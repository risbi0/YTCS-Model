I feel like this is a culmination of all my life experiences to this point and I'm SO STOKED to finally share it with all you.  Now go get your dang Build Box and let's make some cool stuff together.   https://crunchlabs.com/MarkRober
"Talking about dreams, will the Michale Reves colab ever come out?"
Marks the absolute best I have subbed to him for soooo long and every video he's made is GOLD
Sure
"Whyyyy do you tempt so, Mark! Missing some european countries, so not being able to order feels like that great childhood gift just out of reach."
can you make a bear and  squrril proof bird feeder? i have desighned one for my dads friends but never was able to build it
Congratulations Mark you’re gonna drive me and others to be very paranoid about every room we enter.
Holy cow mark that’s so coooooooooooool
Mark I have something to tell you something important
New hacksmith warehouse looking absolutely astounding
Five Nights at Freddy's!
"Mark , since u have chopstix maybe u should play rush e 2"
5:15 so much but still couldn't get a basic bidet 🤡
How do you have the budget to get something as crazy as this? Because this must cost a lot of money.
Im a huge fan
Please consider making factory of creativitys in the East Coast or touring exhibitions.
Amazing work mate always surprising us
"I'm so exited
you are my favorite youtuber"
I have a question for yoh and can you please help me answer the questions. Why does gravity make water go down like normal but there is no gravity in water????!
Hey Mark I bought a NASA school like a bundle
What's the first step in like I want to know how to create my own engineering belt
you should make a video on stopwach. beacause people dont stop it  automaticly
I'd love to see Mark Build a BATTLE BOT  !
"Had an idea for you, make the world's largest bubble from soap and water. Try to figure out the best water to soap ratio and the perfect air intensity to create it. Of course the contraption to make that happen as well."
I am very inspired by your vids I have been subbed probably for about half my life and my dream job is to be an astronomer
Saw this too late as I would love to get the box for my daughter as she'd have a blast with it but they are sold out
İ feel like hes brothers with the uncle in genius in love
Colin furze where you at
"Mark do you have a queen in your ant farm? If not, I can help you get a nice colony going!"
Hey make a video of web shooter.2 to be exact
Can you show us how you hid the red stone
Before my teacher introduced my to you I hated science but then my science teacher told me to watch the squirrel maze video and now I’m addicted to engineering and stuff
what if I were to grab a mizzen at a hair solon and it opens up to the warehouse? Could I just walk in?
1:50
"Congrats you have a secret base that 14M people know about,not very secret now Is it?"
Well its not a secret anymore
have the player piano play rush e 2 now
Nitro for the win!
Rush e 2 came out
Mi
"POV:you have infinite money
me:*buys all the boxes*"
"he figured out how to stabilize a blackhole and even horizon for worm holes, wait.. not yet okay"
Rush E 2 just dropped
It's OK I know how you do it and another reason I don't want anything to do with you.
his warehouse reminds me of a tv show set
Looks fantastic. You probably should mention to kids that your life isn’t real life and that not everyone has an endless pit of money. Keep their expectations of life real 👍
Why did you leave nasa?
"0:40 Mark, you said before you see if i live then you didnt show us ;/"
Kind of sad that only people from the us can visit this place
I want your life.
this is an interesting concept but is presented in a crap way- being forced to listen to rober's crap dialog
Hey mark I have a challenge for you you should try and make the world’s largest bow
I feel like you made this video after talking to mrbeast
the cool thing is that I actually have a couch that divides into six pieces
"hey mark, i bet the robot piano doing the rush e was too easy. try new rush e 2"
AA
WOW Mark!!!
"@markrober, is your crunch labs thing we’re we can meet up still going?"
I love Mark rober.
0:42 BUT DID YOU SEE THE SMOKE?
Yo mark I had a Dairy Queen ice cream small size with a HOLE in it! I want an investigation
i made my own light on a bow made with sticks
but seriously tho if i was in that office i would flip
"now if you'll excuse me, i will go and become a mechanical and electrical engineer."
"idk if i can watch mark Rober anymore. he's waaaay too cool. i mean look at what he did! very, very inspirational. i can't wait to get his crunch labs kit."
Hotones brought me here. Mr Rober smart asf I’d like to collab with him one day.
"just love it, would love to visit this lab 😍"
Im really thinking about getting some of these crunch lab things! I love building things and the other day I managed to light a lightbulb with two potatoes and i was so happy
Please help! I am trying to trap a really wiley stray dog and i need to figure out today how to create a remote button trigger that will close the door
When are you going to make another video
ok dude you have too much money to spend we get it
I have to have a serious confiscation with u call me it's about the trip to mars

Up next: today i built a uranium fram
DC superheroes want to know your location
Maybe try making an otamatone that plays itself
"I have a request: please make a giant human sized pop pop boat (like the boat Sosuke and Ponyo rides in with a candle for steam propulsion). I would do anything for one of these, please!"
Yes yes yes I want the platinum ticket mark
Egen Like You Vilius omgang og så skræk og hentede mig og du har været til Tyrkiet end jeg ville have den sofa egen YouTube Like You no use youth just du er

"hey mark, i just want to say i love each and every one of your videos. they're all different, but also similar in a way. each time you upload, it makes my day just a little bit better, and just keep up the great work."
Squirrel maze 3.0?😇

Hey Mark it is a Dream to come see You and your team but i live in Denmark and my mom says that i cant get a crunch labs box😊
What country do you live in
Do you believe in evolution
lol the light coming through the bottom of the bookshelf
Chopsticks and Technoblade
"*""Getting ppl stoked or excited about science and engineering""*  Well 22m ppl are now stoked about science and engineering"
Imagine having him as your science/engineering teacher that would be the best year ever
Mark you should make a paper airplane launcher that would be cool
I haven't commented in a long time but I'm ur 10.k'th subscriber!
😍
Dang it I’m a month late :(
"Imging me going to the dentist or somthin  turns everything.  The doctor excuse me ma,am what are you doing? Checking for a secret room. The doctor *calls the cops*"
A real armory would be cooler.
You kinda look like the frustrated gamer
Nicely done Mark
literally he is the best so many teenagers and kids are intrested  to be an engineer after watching his awesome inventions i wish i had an uncle like that
"5:24 So much advanced tech in here, but not even a bidet? 😆"
Can we bring a friend?
Imagine when he throws the darts that he doesn’t hit any of them or it hits 4 3 or 2 at the same time
Make a backrooms thing we’re u actouly clip
The PVZ music in thw back makes it more cool
My b Day 15 june

It’s like a science fantasy factory! Combination of my favorite tv show and hobby 😍
Can you do a rush e 2 on chopsticks
Congrats on making it to shark week

"The worst episode ever.
Just pure product placement."
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory

I don't know if the overhaul of the entry mechanism was necessary because we don't know where the room was
Spread the gospel

Get a plane over
Mark Rober I want to see the crunch labs in person and I want to see you very bad!!!!’
I love your videos so so so so so much you’re my favorite YouTuber
Why isn't Mark my science teacher?
What if  you live in euorupe
This feels like a minecraft world where you test out a ton of redstone builds.
"Can you make a video about how paint drys because even things I hate, you make it so interesting"
11:08 Mark is teaching kids how to make claymores😂
Kan you make rush E 2 o chopstick
Hey were you at the fireworks in maplton

Heyyyyyyy PLLLLLLAAAAY THE IMPOSIBLE VERSION OF RUSH E ON YOUR PIANO
Mark Rober is basically living our childhood dreams for us.
I don't know if the overhaul of the entry mechanism was necessary because we *don't know where the room was*
Bro has 5 nerf flytes I wish I could be him
Yo super wired question and I'm sure you probably won't read this but is it possible I saw you on 7/22 at the Hilton hotel that is near levi stadium? Friend doesn't believe it was you 🤣
And I shot my brother like five billion times
I just finished the disc launcher
Hey mark I have a really cool idea that I’m not sure would work in real life it would be pretty cool if you could make a dice that rolls what ever choice you chose every time you roll it would be very cool please consider this idea as a build you could possibly make in the future. I really hope you read this
just turn the sink non and off without washing your hands.
"MARK!!!!
rush E 2 just premiered
I hope chopstix is ready"
My new favorite word is the watermalometer
SHARK WEEK!!!!
I just order a package and it arrived today I built it and it was awesome it was so easy to build
What is your favorite color
Do you ship these to Australia 🇦🇺
"Hi 👋 I won't contact you, Because I have samthing to work with you from Germany 🇩🇪"
"Mark I'm extremely confused can you explain something. I water my plant and recycle the water that from water catch at bottom back to pot. The water I used started at 85+ f and  now the water is about 50-80f it's noticably colder. I'd love to understand why is happening. Couldn't I theoretically use let's say a larger  tank filled with sand  and get same effect? Creating a wireless water cooler..... 😂 LoL

PS I'm in the he desert and so any input on no energy solution that's better than my idea could potentially help people besides myself."
11:11 ahh yes teaching kids to build a safe claymore
Mark rober my birthday is in 4 days and hoping you can visit in canada
This guy is pretty smart. He should work for nasa
@Кирилл Бондаренко r/woooosh
"he worked for this company for 9 years, and designed the rover."
This is why he is not uploading a lot
So are you watching your videos for quite a while I want to go see your Warehouse looks awesome and I'm actually a scientist I in to physics and I just made something called the triple rc car has a camera motor to cut things and lights and I'm going to need the wheels from this RC car to go to this RC car on top of that one that's a lot of work and hopefully my talk to text works so I'm sorry for any mistakes
"Mark, when you joined Nasa what type of engineer were you?"
@idk thank you
He was a mechanical engineer
Can you give me a box
Daryl. Maart🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾😇😇🦿🦿💌👍👍Lev. Joe

Why are you not posting
"This is amazing, I wish I had these as a kid"
Glad you can be able to do it 🫡 you deserve it all !!
Does your logo incorporate the International Mensa logo on purpose?

Make that rapid fire disc launcher bigger and you basically have a ratchet & clank  Weapon.
4:17 sounds like aztecross another day boys another twab
I wanna be a enginnier like you when i grow up
Smart guy just being a kid. Credit to youtube and Mark to make this content possible!

Anyone saw mrwhosetheboss sign?
"You're an amazing human being, thank you for all you do."
I want to be like you
"I want one of those boxes. Youre a true gem, Mark."
It would be super cool to be an engineer but I know for sure I do not have the patience
I just wanna go there for that fireman piston. I could go down that things for hours
What do you do when you find it ?
Not sure if it’s just me busy the music in the middle sounds like it’s from plants versus zombies
Am I the only one who noticed that underneath the bookshelf you can see the light coming through. Love the content though
I am using my dad’s phone but you are the best of the best YouTuber
I made a mark rober unboxing video!!!
You’re just missing a 2 story plastic ball pit
And I want to be an engineer like you but I know nothing about it
"Mark Rober, it would be so cool, if you could make some device that scans everything around it"
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
❤️🎟️🙂🇺🇲🤟🕜🏁😴🤟🚶😢🚫📨🚫🤟🚶😂🤟📨🤟🚶🥰🤟🥰📨🚶🤟😛📨📨🤟🔚😛🤟🔚😛
the girl that slid down the pole thing went to elementary school with me and was in my advisory class last year

Please do a video about if water is wet or not everybody needs to know
yeah dont inspect the floor too much
We have autobelay devices in rock-climbing. This device has safeties incase of failure also.
It came late and the box was damaged but everything else was amazing and the disc launcher is cool and work surprisingly well. I noticed that just leaving the disc launcher would touch the wire to the table or whatever it it placed on so could you make or at least show how to make a holder? I understand that it takes a lot of time to get everything working but I am just giving an idea
"7:18 I think he means 13,541,139 people"
"13,541,533*"
"Ok, WHY IS THIS A THING?! I love this thing, it’s so cool!"

I love your vids you make me want to become a engineer
Please post more
I love the crunch labs idea but my parents won’t let me get it:(

It’s not a Mark Rober video until a watermelon gets sacrificed to keep the engineering gods satiated
I need you to come to my house and figure out a solution for the cat that knows how to open the screen door.
This is like Gus Fring's meth superlab.

mr.rober but when i live in germany (what i do) and get the ticket how do i come to crunch labs or does the ticket last a life long greetings.gabriel
I've never been a huge fan of engineering growing up. But watching these videos really makes me think about trying it. 🤔 the warehouse looks so amazing!
Walter white level lab.
Mark rover I really like your videos Please reply
hi im mark rover
he wont and never will
What a cool guy with some super cool ideas. Well done Mark
When will we get Squirrel Maze 3.0?
I’m just about to turn 18 and I’m going to college and will be majoring in physics/engineering. I absolutely love your videos and everything that you engineer is so fascinating to me. I’ve been watching your videos for a while now and I think that you are one of the reasons that I want to be an engineer. I just thought that I would let you know that even if you never see this comment.
This is just Rob Dyrdeks Fantasy Factory.
I also know someone who is a ultimate frisbee player
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
Well its not much as a secret anymore
wheres the office😲🤓😞🙃
"I would love to come hangout in this dream warehouse and try to win $10,000.....I'd probably miss but I still want to try lol"
What about the crack under the bookshelf secret door

day one of asking for squirrel maze 3.0
just turn on the tap then turn it off
This guy is so cool
I like that
No.5 has the plants vs zombies theme
Is soo cool
i remember when i was a child and my older sister introduced me into this cool app where you could build things and explain how it works. its amazing to know that someone will take it into next level and send real life parts and explain how things work. thanks mark rober.
ummm mark u do realize theirs a light shining underneath the cabinet bonus people can look underneath as well. not smart about that entrance gap their
OMG the toilet seat... I'm dying 😆😆😆
What about the crack under the bookshelf secret door

15:33
"My son's Crunch box arrive yesterday.  He had a blast watching your video and building it. No golden ticket, but maybe it will be in the next box. Thanks Mark."
It’s been a while sense he has uploaded but that means he is probably going to have a bigger video!

"All I can say is this: if guys need to leave the seat down, girls need to leave the seat up. Sorry not sorry. I only just realized this road has two ways"
Love it! Possible to ship the box to China?
I used to Love American Gladiators!  I used to like American Ninja before they made it so difficult that it takes professional level athletes and stunt people to get through the course.  They should make an American Ninja Level 1 show for entry level people to advance to the professional athletic level.
maves ur bog
What
do you ship out of the us??
Wow 👍🏻
Can you make a piston polling you up
Gotta love the little PvZ soundtrack playing in the background
I don't know why I waited so long to watch this. It's like every dream fort I ever sketched as a kid.
Does it cost money
I'm a teacher. All my students adore you. You're part of my science class all the time. This box needs to be written into the regular curriculum
That would require providing actual education. Can't have that here in the USA. Only the current agenda.
Do you want to do a YouTube video together

Mark is there a way to turn friction into electricity because I have an idea how to make it but I don't know how to turn it into usable power
"If a toilet locked me in and nobody told me it was because the seat lid was up I'd just kick the door in, I wouldn't assume there was some trick switch I had to activate...."
Can you  help me get a  seecret bass
Hi Mark my gramma almost got puppy scammed can you make it please
Please 🙏 help me make my idea a reality
"Hello Mark can you help me out with an idea 💡 invention my ww2 uncle mentioned to me years ago, it's been in my head for ions"
"I'm guessing Willie Wonka might have been a favourite growing up Mark. This is a wonderful undertaking, but the most significant point you make in the video is that your fantastic work drives the development of critical thinking in young minds. While you couch the value of that mental training in terms kids will get, better sports performance, math comprehension, etc, I think the real value comes when they emerge as intellectually empowered adults  in a world where a general inability to parse logical flaws in political rhetoric, or rebut irrational responses to global crises is crippling human capacity to flourish and live sustainably. If Crunch Labs builds one thing worthwhile and enduring it won't be a clever educational toy, it will be a generation of clear-minded, compassionate and humane global citizens able to winnow the profound from the common, history from myth and truth from fallacy. Well done."

I have a question do you have any suggestions about inventions that I can build this summer
"When Mark said ""its important to fail a bunch"" I teared up because it's so important for kids to learn that it's ok to mess up. Super inspiring!"
you should make a robot backrooms entity
More doors or more wheels
New vid soon ?
Me waiting for squirrel 3.0 lol
Mark Rober what if I get the ticket and I’m in china? Is it useless now?
I think you should sell mini frisbee golf nets as an extra on the website so people can make like a mini frisbee golf course that would be cool
I guess I'm not an average person. I'm always aware of my surroundings.
Hey i need you to make a radioactive suit with stuff from your local stores. This is for everyone to know so they could know what to use for them to be able to save there family. Hey if you see this message send it to mark rober

How much did dennys pay you for that placement advertising lol
Mark Rober basically makes things that were a part of everybody’s childhood dream and that’s why I love this channel
"8:44

This secret warehouse was so epic🤯 imagine if this comment get pinned
Hey mark rober I made this functional rubber band launcher and I was wondering if I could mail it to you for you to look at it
"Bro mark, your voice has changed"

What kind of engineering did you do? I’m going to college for engineering and I’m curious what kind of engineering you took.
This really is like the Willy Wonka factory so maybe there will be that one person wanting to buy like 100 boxes to get that platinum ticket lol
Surprising I just found this channel today
I always dreamed of having a “ clubhouse “ like this
When I watched this I was thinking how Mark would’ve been really excited about some of the laid back tech companies’ offices but would’ve felt restricted by their work. 😂 That’s cool…but I’d rather make random things at work.
"Been watching your videos for years, my son who is 11 now is interested in building these type of items, however I live outside the states and I pay by the Pound ...thanks.."
"Me and my dad ordered the first box, (the disc launcher), and it was so much fun! We built it together and set up targets for the discs in the backyard. It was so interesting to see how it works and to have fun using it. It launches like a real frisbee!! And I just wanted to say thank you SO much for this amazing opportunity. :)"
this
"Coming from a massive fan, its amazing to see how far you have come. Thanks for the amazing content over the years!!!"
News: YouTuber's friend calls the fire department after getting stuck in the toilet.
Cool
"Love this and your creativity so much!  I keep saying with all the kids today needing to be entertained (tablets, TV,  phones, etc.) I worry about them not fully developing the skills like imagination, thinking outside the box, creativity, ingenuity, etc.  If we have a generation who have lost these skills we are doomed.  All the great inventions, cures and treatments for diseases and such, and engineering developments were discovered and developed by those who definitely possessed the skills, were encouraged to use them, and were brave!  We need out of the box thinkers if we are to survive!  You make this ""learning"" look so fun they would never realize they are being taught (which is the key to teaching anyone).  I appreciate all you are doing for our world.....oh yeah and how you are not afraid to act like a giant goofball of an adult.  I am jealous...I wanna come play there! 
People......please hear me and share this thought .....we HAVE to be sure and encourage our children to be creative, to explore, and use their imaginations....if you don't you are doing your child and the future of our world a great disservice!"
"I'm an engineer. But always respected these types of engineers. New subbie here. Love this geeky stuff.

Dude is the willy Wonka of engineering. I'm grown but I want the experience too!!! 

Engineering is so cool."
this is making me want to become an engineer
You should start a new project called team breeze which finds a way to reduce carbon emissions
when will you make squirrel maze 3.0
Who are you really ?

what state is your crunch labs in and what city
DONATE YOUR MERCH TO BEAST PHILANTROPHY :)
Ever since I started watching you when I was five now I’m 11 I’ve always been inspired by you because I’ve always wanted to be an engineer because I’ve always thought it was all so cool and interesting to see what happens and make a hypothesis
Is he going to died…?
"Just so that y’all know my kid will be going to the Mark Rober school of engineering, bc we all know that where this is going and I’m here for it."

Me waiting for Squirrel 3.0
"According to the footage at 15 : 59 we can see that there are 20 boxes of the kit on the table, Mark said it was fair. But however as you can see mark is throwing darts at it at a chosen place leading the upper boxes to get hit more often, when mark actually packs these the boxes on the upper layer would go to the bottom. and when the kits are arrived at the country the person ordered it, the upper layer ( in that case was the lower layer on the beginning ) gets loaded first, making the kit on the bottom layer including the ticket, average shipping boxes are 18 "" x 16 "" x 18 "" fitting about 30 boxes on average, therefore IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING THE TICKET, YOU NEED TO BUY A KIT  AT AN AVERAGE PACE OF 25 TO 30"

"My first guess was a Phat Gus sanctuary, anybody else?"

That bike with the train horn would be so cool to use
What if you miss the foam pit?
Boxes are already sold out 😭😭😭
3:53 did not know Mark was a Jschlatt viewer

"I am sad you sold out. :(
But we are on your wait list. :)"
You just showed thieves how to take everything
"I mean, I've imagined having a secret little gaming room in my house but this really takes the cake"

Indeed
So basically all this video tells me is that Mark Rober is one suit and some brooding away from being Batman.
Tell me your favorite programming language without telling me your favorite programming language.

"Oh wow you could do a special series in which you create fighting robots, then you create a kit for kids to build their own and maybe some can eventually get a chance to fight their robot in your warehouse in a fighters arena you build. There would be soooo much great opportunity for learning all kinds of things with something like that. Whatta ya think Mark?"
Mark i LOVE your videos! :)

Hey @MarkRober. Just wanted to let you know that I'm graduating this spring with my Engineering degree. You were one of my biggest inspirations to switch from business to engineering back in 2019. Don't know if you will read this but I want to thank you for what you do!
Nice!!🤯🤩👍
Even mrwhosetheboss was there
I want to meet Mark because I have ideas 💡 and I've lived in Cali for 50 years
Mark I'm shay I've always watched your videos and I have to say they really love the way you make the impossible possible keep going and try your best I'm also turning 12 this year so my dream is to become a chemical engineer or a nuclear engineer stay positive

Ty
this is so cool and the crunch box is brilliant.
Hey @Mark Rober    can you make a sprinkler silencer so I don't wake up at 4 in the morning to sprinlers.
The thing is I’m not much of a buyer I’m much more of watcher
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
I knew it was behind the bookshelf like in poppy playtime
I love your videos
I Wish I could afford this 😭😭
A shark with freakin laser beams attach to their head would be dope to hahah xD
This guy would be the best uncle.
You have to be my favorite YouTuber and I would love to meet you ❤❤❤❤😁😀😁😀
Mark Rober❤😢
Hi Mark I am a big fan and saw this and would like to know how to make your pnewmatic piston stair thingy pls
My guy is the real tony stark sheeesh
the bookshelf has light under it which you might need fix
"mark I have been watching every video you ever made and I love them all 
and even time I try to bye a pacet your alwase sold out I hope I get the patmut ticket to meat you in real life"
Dude you are the IRL Rick from Rick and Morty you make robots to make something easier.
"Mark, next time you make a video, you could do, I tread of a darts board that changes it’s position, you could make a basketball hoop of a WHOLE FOOTBALL PITCH GOAL that does it.
Also you need more stock for crunchlabs."
I'm going to daeiy in 4 weak
Wish your videos were around when I was a youngin..I'd be a engineer today!  You make it exciting and fun. 🤘
Job well done sir. Job well done!
Imagen just being a pizza person and no ones there so you walk in feal thristy and get a deit pepsi and you foud a secrat base

Idea: Seeing threw Pokemon packs to see the Pokemons without opening the pack
ratio
That's true!
Seems like you should start your own Rober Land park only With a higher educational entertainment angle.
Hi! I really enjoy your channel! Might you have any videos I can reference or programs I can purchase that will teach me how to create a noise cancellation audio device? I’m seeking to make the device palm-sized. Thanks so much!
I Live in canada can I still get crunch labs
Genius!
How long have you worked on this?
"""Secret Exclusive Mark Rober Video"" * Shows QR Code *"
lmao at the tiny tool bench we always see
Am I the only person really intrigued by the ant farm?
You should make a box for adults
minecraft base IRL
I think Mark has jumped the shark. This feels like a 17 minute commercial for a new product.
All im saying is 3.0. FAT GUS WANTS MORE HEISTS.
Mark Rober is literally Batman now.
"Mark Rober: You would only see the office if you were to come here. You wouldn't be able to find the lab.

Everyone with ADHD and/or autism: Are you sure about that?"
Seems nice for you but a nightmare to work for you.
This would have been a dream for me when I was a kid watching Dexter’s Lab day after day!
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and interesting to watch."

I am defenetly getting that box
"i basically got tricked into watching a commercial about his new product…

…and i’m perfectly fine with that"
"Can I be one of your videos I was like one of the first to be there I was here since 600,000 subscribers"
"Love your videos Mark, Your the best. I've been watching you for 4 years now and still are amazed at what you do and the opportunity you give people."
@eioshen boboi Agreed
"Can we appreciate how awesome this dude is?! Mark has helped track down scammers, worked on Mars rovers, and NEVER fails to to impress us."
grate
you should sell some of your safer inventions because I know I would love to have them in my house.
"Hey Mark, thanks for being one of my inspirations to become an engineer. Love your videos, never stop."
cool…but I’d rather make random things at work.
Mark I love your videos I have been watching them for years and they have truly inspired me you are a true role model to me
You are a great guy😁😁😁
"I nominate Mark for the, ""coolest person in the world"" award. He's even cooler than Tom Cruise x 3 million!"
"I like your content mark BUT I feel conned.
If you gonna make a 17 minute advert for your boxes then list it as that, dont trick us by wrapping it up in some other guise."
Are u panda
When will squirrel obstacle course 3.0 gonna come out
The Frisbee part is basically about Aero-Dynamics.
I have an idea for a cool video. Maybe a paper airplane launcher that breaks the world record of 230 feet. That would be cool.
The nerf wall is every kids dream
Wish I could go even if I got the ticket I'm in a bit of trouble as it is
"Thank you for making engineering education fun, Mark!!    Matthew - a fellow engineer :)"
What's you favorite sport?
Hey are there drones in the crunch labs set?
That’s so cool I will definitely try that with my brother cuz he is actually the Ingenieur and not me xD but it’s worth a try and looks fun

"I have and engineering challenge for the great mark roper. I wanna see the MOTHER OF ALL BUG ZAPPERS. A TESLA ZAPPER!!!!! a little extreme but thats what your channel is all about. I wanna see an average size outdoor living space go from complete infestation to lightening bolts to peace ✌️ again within about 10 seconds. Since energy follows the path of least resistance and a tesla coil forces electrons to find the closest negative charge over a given distance... given enough power to encourage an arc. Could that arc use mosquitoes 🦟 as something to jump off of?? Im no expert, just hypothesizing"
You’re so awesome
You can literally see the light coming under the bookshelf mark…
What I thought my room would look like as a kid.
Man’s been secretly designing random things since he was born
Oh my gosh. You are so cool. Your builds are so cool too!
Please give me a job

2:58 *POV: slavery in 2022*
mark is one of the coolest humans on earth
9:30 this is like a view generator but both partys (creator / viewer) get something (money / cool invention)! NICE!
Do you ship to England?
Is this world wide?
"Has anyone ever thought that Mark Rober looks like Seth MacFarlane, or is that just me?"
mark is the only guy that would make everyone want to actually be creative even if they are like 92 lol
I hope your son enjoys crunch labs
He's turning into the science Mr.Beast.
do you have a hamster
i love this video
Im jealous
This is some next-level Gustavo Fring sh|t here!
What about the gap under the door u can see
This is amazing!
All im saying is he is 1 bad day from becoming a super villain
Super cool.
Only mark would go through the trouble to build this
So many great ideas combined! Awesome!
Im just wondering how much this cost
"Has anyone ever thought that Mark Rober looks like Seth MacFarlane, or is that just me?"
Splat-r-ball > nerf.
"""because men are pigs"" bruh"
Neat video. Could live without the men are pigs comments next time
EPIC!!!!!!! Way to go Mark!
Mark is like the nice version of Rick Sanchez

"Wow, Brilliant"
This is the house of my dreams
I LOVE your videos Mark Rober you are my personal inspiration
"Learning fast through mistakes until you have no mistakes. Cool this is how everything should be. 

Instead of mistakes to no learning to  more mistakes and claiming success"
Crunch lab supreme
Awesome L
Hi
"I just realized this.

Mark looks like Jimmy Fallon"
It makes me so gitty Two see your love for teaching about engineering it pushes my love for teaching as well and inspiring others so keep at it
I sometimes think Mark's channel is better than Youtube itself
U should make a video of a time lap of just your ants
"20M, more like 12M






You’ll get there, someday, but not today"
For big channels videos usually don’t get as many views as subscribers
Can’t wait for the new squirrel maze
Mark you need to build a squirrel maze 3.0
IS THAT Mrwhosetgeboss
"This is genuinely one of the most interesting, and amazing things I’ve ever seen.



Just in general an entire building designated to inventions made by you would have to feel amazing to just be in, because seeing it is insanely incredible."
Please post more !!
"Mark, I used to not know what to be when I'm an adult, but you've inspired me and now I want to be a creative engineer or a computer engineer! Thank you!"
"Hi Mark i am really excited for this but i have some questions.

1. is it going to be able to buy it if you are from Europe or any other country?

2. how much does it cost?

You can take your time to answer and also you are one of my favorite youtubers and engineers."
"Those boxes are great, I think a more advanced version for older people would sell well."
Ahh yes a child’s dream from someone’s inner child
"Mr Beast: Builds Willy Wonka's chocolate factory

Hi Mark Rober. I am an ananya misra's daughter and I love your videos! I am going to con vince my mom to get me that build box. I have always wanted to meet you.
I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and interesting to watch."
"It’s been a real honour watching you for all of these years, here’s to the next generation of engineers!"
Smart guy (btw not being sarcastic
Mark tries so hard to make all of our dreams of being an engineer come true. RESPECT 100.1%.Love your videos!
What if im from another country
"This is genuinely one of the most interesting, and amazing things I’ve ever seen.

"I used to love kits like those as a kid. But when I told people I wanted to be an inventor or builder people always told me that wasn't something a person can just be. At this point in my life it is too late to start now, but at least you are developing kits to inspire kids to achieve what I couldn't. I hope everything goes well and it becomes a future staple of childhood for generations."

Marks the only reason why he made me get into crafting stuff
"It would be really cool if after the 12 months, you could make one BIG contraption using all the concepts you learned from the previous crunch boxes."
who said you couldn't?
"I mean once you really understand what you've learned with the creations, you can take them apart and combine your knowledge and the pieces to create that one big contraption using everything."
So it would be better if you somehow fix that.
"Mark, can you do a bloopers video? plz"
"Giant foam pit??? Obviously now you have to build a ramp (ramps??) and throw bikes off them. And boards. And go karts. And little pedal-cars. But mainly bikes, because bikes are awesome."
Mark Rober is Jimmy Neutron in disguise prove me wrong.
What if your in a other country
"Just asking, will you do more stuff with Anthony?"
Mark rober can someone live if of solar panels for electricity
Looks awesome 👌
Aahhh so cool! This looks more my... i mean my 6yo son's speed. I promised him a summer class but with my own university studies and both our ADHD neuro-divergent brains i just couldn't commit. Yay for bite sized projects to hyperfocus on. Ty.
awesome!! Wish you would be a little closer to us :)

The fact that mark is trying to help kids so they don't have to think of a new thing to do like its insane what 1 person can do to change peoples lives and I think its so cool he does this
I wish that my family had more money so I could do those boxes. And actually have a chance to meet Mark Rober and fulfill my dream of being an engineer.
"This is what you get with a very genius engineer, with lots of time on his hands, lots of money in his bank, and who is still a kid at heart.

Well done, Mark."
"Hi mark, always LOVED your videos. In this video I wanted to point out one SMALL ERROR. That is the person can see the LIGHT COMING FROM UNDER THE SECRET DOOR. So it would be better if you somehow fix that."

"Those boxes are great, I think a more advanced version for older people would sell well."
"This is what you get with a very genius engineer, with lots of time on his hands, lots of money in his bank, and who is still a kid at heart.
Well done, Mark."
It's really cool to see a YouTuber making a product to help people not just to make money
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
"Loving my little 1 second cameo 😂 Thanks for taking us around (Cannot BELIEVE you kept this quiet for so long, I struggle keeping a secret for a week)!"
Mark is the ultimate cool teacher that doesn’t give homework and actually inspires you to learn
"Mark i can do this you son of a
B*****"
The fact that mark is trying to help kids so they don't have to think of a new thing to do like its insane what 1 person can do to change peoples lives and I think its so cool he does this
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.

Always sad when parents aren’t sure of their children’s age.
You’re a saint Mark."

Agreed
Love you
Where was Mark Rober 45 years ago when I was a kid? I would have LOVED the Crunch Labs. Still would at 58 LOL

Is this what you did with all the hot wheels tracks from the domino robot video
This is by far the coolest lab in youtube
Your workshop is not that secret because you can see the light under the bookshelf 😂😉
This was my childhood dream. My dream hasn’t changed

What is and where can I get that couch?!
Why does it take random chance to get to go to your lab? I personally think it should just ship out to random subscribers.
"Or while I’m at that, let you know somebody wants to come, and they get to spend the day!"
So easy to find because of the light under

"This is awesome, and something i would get for my nephews. However since i am from Denmark and my Nephews aren't fluent in english, i feel they would miss out out on the second part of the experience, the video. Would you consider dubbing or otherwise making it more accessible for non-english speaking buyers?"

"@YouTube, you have cash, make it happen."
That opening is just like the one in Gravity Falls. Grunkle Stan vibes.

You can see the light from the other room shining under the bookcase. It was the first thing I noticed 😂
hello
Great vid! I just wish you could ship to Canada I really wanted to get a box.
I wish that my family had more money so I could do those boxes. And actually have a chance to meet Mark Rober and fulfill my dream of being an engineer.
This not science this is big brain mark
i though it would be the glitterbomb 10 except there is no glitter
okay and also colin is the amazing inventor else well at 5 top inventors
My top 4 inventors are 1. Mark Rober 2. Hacksmith 3.Creative Channels 4.Mythbusters
Mark is my greatest engineer of all time and also hacksmith😀🙂
Is it bad if u know how to make devils toothpaste 😏
Giant foam pit is cool and all until you jump blindly and realize you forgot to put it back

this
Your yell is perfect.
"I love the idea of the crunch box! When I was little I used to do the build kits from the home depot. I love the lab and love your videos. I have watched them for years, and they have inspired me to be an engineer, well you and the hacksmith. Recently I got into an amazing engineering school, and am halfway through the degree! Because of what you do, I've had some amazing internship opportunities ! Thank you for teaching people what its all about!"
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL
2:38😅
I love this!

Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi.  Not diet Pepsi.
That's so awesome congratulations on the warehouse I always wished for something like this...loved American gladiators especially being born in 85 and growing up in the 90s!!
Is it just me or is Mark looking more and more like Mike Myers?
"Welp, looks like I’m gonna go be an engineer now"
Not 20m 11m

@Mark Rober- This has major Willy Wonka vibes.
I had a dream that I went to Crunch Labs😴🛌
"Chopsticks vs The Dominator, who is better?"
I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.
"Can we appreciate how awesome this dude is?! Mark has helped track down scammers, worked on Mars rovers, and NEVER fails to to impress us."
You are becoming too Mr beasti
I love how you put in chopstix and dom
Mark will definitely be the leader of the robot apocalypse
The toilet is kinda wack 💀

Nice infomercial
Dude's a legend ❤
Was that SMOKE coming out of the Hole?!
My son loves your videos
not very secret anymore lol
"OMG, this is my dream office!!"
You might want to fix the bottom of the bookshelf door so that it doesn't let the light in from the factory. its a dead giveaway.
I m simply going to say Dexter's Laboratory
Very cool!
"*** No one knows there's a secret passage***

Except for the light from the room coming out from beneath the bookcase.. for an engineer you don't see the obvious very well..

Edit: excellent product. I approve."
i think mark has a crush on watermelons
Wow
Dam
Cool
"Sorry to break it for you, but in case of emergency it is not smart to have a toilet with a lock like that."
"The boxes are amazing as is everything you do! Love your enthusiasm for learning, discovering and teaching. You will continue to do great things!"
it’s like the golden ticket given out by willy wonka lmao
Wish I could come
O
"I’m just spitballing here, can you find a person and make a prescription screen for a tablet?"
Respect 👍✌️

secret passege in your office was pretty obvious because you can see the light reflecting off the floor
14:00 lmao what did you expect
i see light comming from under your book shelf is there a window behind it? lol
Your an incredable human being and is such a pleasure to be able to watch you work. What an awesome idea and this will be huge.
"I wanna get into engineering, just to try and design my battle maid armor i made a blueprint of when i was 10...i was a wierd kid"
I wish i can buy this but sadly mayo mommy stupor a body 😭😭😭😭
🥺🥺😭😭
"You will probably never see this but I have a couple of questions for you Mark. First off. If we get the ticket to visit you, will our family have to buy plane tickets and everything? Because personally, my parents can't afford things like that. And also as I live in Australia, are the boxes American dollars? 
Thank you Mark."
But I wash my hands then flush then open the door?
Im 53 and want to win 😁
Wish I could come
I feel like one day the robots try to make humans that work better then robots lol 😂
I want to come 😻
People in 100 years gonna find this and be awestruck
"Mmmmmmmmmm gravity fallssssss
But it looks more like it’s from odd squad because of the quadrants"
looks like the fantasy factory from rob dyrdek
I wish I could meet you that would be so cool but I can't even if I had won I wouldn't be able to my parents work so much so I'll be stuck at home babysitting my baby brother
You the Best Mr. Mark Rober! MAHALO & ALOHA!
6:03 why not just lock the door tho 🤔
Wicked !!! That’s so cool! Love the kids education stuff too .. Great motivation for the next generations !!!
I got my crunch lab first box a few days ago and I am loving using the disc launcher and I can't wait for the next box! keep up the great work mark love the videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do you take India currency?
Are you panda from dude perfect?
im 14 and seemingly can't be intrested by the things that adult and children enjoys
why are utah people like this
Anyone know what train horn kit mark used on the bike? I want to put it on my bike now
"unfortunately, all the light coming under the bookcase makes it a bit less secret"
Does it cost money to have the build box?
This is absolutely insane Mark!! You made every engineer's childhood dream come true and I can't wait to see what you have in store for the future ! Keep inspiring and make great things.
importance. there aren't enough complimentary words i can say about you and CrunchLabs!
He should make a disk minigun that shoots 20 disks per second that would be awesome
Great!

love you mark
It has Become my Life Goal to get into Crunch labs as a Child.
"6:00 ok but I always use paper towels to touch the sink because germs, and I don't think the capacitive touch will work through a paper towel"
ive wached all of your videos
"I cannot say say thank you enough, not only to you Mark but to the hundreds of others that continue to show how amazingly beautiful science is. I've always wanted to be an engineer, but you and people like you helped me relize what that almost instinct to make was. I'm almost a senior in high school and have been doing my own projects and love every second of it. And now I'm using all these tools that where just being developed when I was young, from CAD to ardunio, to 3D printers that continously become easier to use, learn, and get. I see all these tools that kids much younger than me will have access to. STEM for youth has never been more engaging or had access to so many tools and resources, that 20 years ago where hardly available in universities. I'm excited I get to use these tools now, while kids 5-6 years younger than me are aswell. And im exited for them (And slightly jealous). And it's people like you Mark that inspire kids to use these tools and learn about this stuff. And that is something that's extremely important."
"Loving my little 1 second cameo Thanks for taking us around (Cannot BELIEVE you kept this quiet for so long, I struggle keeping a secret for a week)!"
this
do a vid on how to solve a rubiks cube. I've been trying to but keep failing. only you can teach that way!
Mark’s Cool
Can we all agree that mark is a genius?
Mark Robber build more secret things
hey
Is it a secret tho since everyone can get into it now lmao 🤣
Do you run out of the silver ticket nine days after watching this video
mark: I never lose I win or learn
I dreamed of that too but I changed I love science but I wanna be an auther now.
U cool
Is crunch labs all ages?!
"Hey Mark, I have a group of scammers that keep calling my cousin because I called them through her phone and threatened to call the police on them. Any way you could help?"
"I've said this on a different a count before but I still love the plants Vs zombies music ""loonbloon"""
That's amazing!😀
You should sell them on stores please I beg I need to know how to make the ro car that appears here just please I love physics and science
Boxes are already out of stock. Disappointed ☹️
wow
if you built the warehouse from scratch how did you start? did you dig a hole through your wall to start the hallway?
Can we all agree that mark is a genius?
"""the lab location super-secret""
(aside from all the light visible under the secret door)"
What's the music at 3:24?
"Recently we’ve been looking at reflection and refraction in physics, and I thought it would be cool if you talked about one-sided mirrors. Maybe with a warehouse tour?"
I need you to build a golf robot. And show me if a longer shaft produces longer drives. And is it due to velocity. Arc. Torque or another factor. K thanks bye
This secret lab is no longer a secret
MTV cribs vibe anyone else? no? just me?
I love going through the journey with you and finding something new and exciting.
Interesting
this is insane

How long have you used Crunch Labs?
Just because of this lab alone you're the coolest person ever!
Awsome I might get the boxes
So cool I’m a girl but I would love to visit there but I live in Australia

Amazing.

"yes its all fun in games until you realize if you looked at the building from the front of it, the office thingy dosent matter because it has an entire warehouse behind it."
There light coming under the secret entrance...
"Aaja, lmao even I can make it it's so easy.


Wait! What do you mean this ain't minecraft?"
i dont know why this video makes me emotional
i like the lab
I love your message that it is important to fail.  Myself I say you only fail when you fail to learn.
"Can you make school maze 3.0
Please"
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and inter sting to watch."
Hey will you still be posting videos here?
Cool… (too bad I can’t afford it) :(
i get hype whenever I hear the music in your videos prolly cuz I associate it with content like this.. the riffs are pretty dank too though lol
"""no way to guess there is a secret lab in this boring office"" : maybe the bright blue light coming from under the shelf at 6:26 is a hint ? ;)"
Nice really you are supporting kid’s to be creative
Please make a squirrel maze 3

Love your work!

Hey mark don’t know if you’ll get this my family and i love your videos best YouTuber EVER you should be a Science teacher you would be the best
@6:27 if they don’t see the glowing blue underneath the bookcase?
That lookes really cool

Cough cough this is the where house where we did the robot domino vid
My first thought: Dead bodies?
Mark remember me at escape room palms springs we took a photo
Every day I'm dreaming about meeting mark but ill maybe get to finally meet him in 10 years
@ 6:27 everyone would see the light under the bookshelve
"You are such a fantastic human being.
Thanks for everything you do."
hi mark
11 out of 10 would love to watch again

"Well, the light under the bookcase is pretty obvious"
amazing.
Bill Nye for the next generation.
"So, um, how much do people pay you to be able to work for you?"
"I used to love kits like those as a kid. But when I told people I wanted to be an inventor or builder people always told me that wasn't something a person can just be. At this point in my life it is too late to start now, but at least you are developing kits to inspire kids to achieve what I couldn't. I hope everything goes well and it becomes a future staple of childhood for generations."
"don't give up on your dreams, it's never too late to do anything"
"@Will Peeler totally agree with you 
Its never too late to do what u want to"
It’s never too late. I started taking YouTube classes a few weeks ago in blender and learning how to weld
I WOULD LOVE TO VIST CRUNCH LABS ahhhhhh

"If any of you are adult engineers that want an experience like what Mark is doing:  Teaching engineering to kids, doing cool things, solving unique challenges, building crazy cool thing...  Become a FIRST Robotics Mentor.  At every level, It's the hardest fun you'll ever have.  If Mark ever wants to do an episode on FRC Team 4160 ""The Robucs"" would love to host :)"
this is so wholesome
Your lab is bigger than our company xD

"looks like tony starks lab from ironman !
too cool !"
Hey Mark! I wanted to tell you that your videos have helped inspire me to dream of one day working at NASA and so this fall I will be attending Embry-Riddle in daytona with a duel major in aerospace and mechanical engineering!

Dexter's Laboratory vibes
"Guys like Mark are why I wish YouTube was around when I was a kid. I may not have ended up as an engineer, but he’s a brilliant role model. His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn’t mean you have to quit.

"Guys like Mark are why I wish YouTube was around when I was a kid. I may not have ended up as an engineer, but he’s a brilliant role model. His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn’t mean you have to quit. Being able to work through the failure and push towards success and find solutions is a lesson that can be used in any part of life. Hats off to this guy, no YouTuber deserves more success than him."
“I made a secret lab” I thought it’d be another type of lab😭🤚
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
I must have that box
Do you have any mechanical car boxes???
Mark is doing stuff that everyone wished they'll be doing after completing engineering.

"Mark I have a challenge for you, try to make a sink that detects your hand and turns on the water for 20 seconds. 😃"
why not just a hand sensor what if i need more water?
I can still smell the smoke from the original tennis ball launcher 😂
Do you not send this packages to India
Do you not ship to India or any other countries specifically India
"This..this place is beautiful. I need to come here..THIS PLACE IS LITERALLY MY GREATEST DREAM, I LOVE EVERYTHING HERE!!!"
This is awesome but who's picking up all those Nerf balls? Lolll
"I wish i could go there but considering there's 10+ million people who also wants to go there, i think i don't have any chance at all 😂"
"If I ever go here I have three Ideas 

1 (the bad one) a pair of shoes that have some sort of pressurized system allowing them to make you jump higher or help launch you at an angle that can help you front or back flip. 

2 (the one to mess with people) I am a fairly tall kid so pistons in shoes controlled by an app to give you a little extra hight. 

3 (my favorite) a pair of - you guessed it SHOES!- that have little treads that fold into or sink into the sole of the shoe (with added material ofc) so at the touch of a button you have a slightly cooler far more aggravating pair of heelies."
Any other silly or fun ideas that you might wanna try there?
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
"A Mumbo-Jumbo secret base build, but irl"
NITRO!!! American Gladiators was my favorite show as a kid. What an amazing channel you have built Mark and crew.
So how do I apply for a job working with you?
How much is crunch lab?
Wow. Just wow.
you are the best and you make cool stuff I want to be you
the hot wheel track on the wall look like a giant pc raddaitor
Very awesome but around 17:10 you can see a massive glow under the bookcase
This is so cool for educating kids! Mark is amazing.
I want these toys for my birthday it looks so cool I love legos and this looks awesome
yes its a secert only 11.5 million or more people know brilliant
This is surreal.  Congrats on another amazing and successful venture/video.
Yea that's all cool but I lost track and immediately started typing this comment after that origional mystbusters blueprint... what a beautiful thing to own
graze the roof hitting so hard rn
If it wasn't for the bright light under the secret door I would have totally missed it. :-(
i wanna see gus and the others
Invent a way to stop democrats from cheating in elections.
So how do I apply for a job working with you?
"Did you forget to show us you trying to not get hit or was that a joke.

Also can you do some type of engineering on chess? Maybe voice activated so it helps people learn the coordinates quicker 🤔"
"i would just go into the claw mechine and take like, five"
It’s like a Mark Robert version of meow-wolf crossed with Willy wonkas chocolate factory.
Im Going to be just like you
This is so cool
well its not really a secret now is it? LOL
hmmmm never saw you advertise and tease so much. don't loose your track for money.
"Dude, you’re an amazing person. The world is so much better because of you. Carry on kind sir."
Mark is awesome.
see all of your videos so much and I'm going to buy the boxes as of now you're sold out for this month I really want to come meet you it would be a dream come true love your videos and want to become an engineer someday
"This dudes channel has really gone off the rails. Hes just the wish version of mr beast now, not really worth watching."
hey Mark if you read this I want to know what is the ratio of a chance that I will get a platinum ticket what out of what
"So, one of those crunch box kits is basically a claymore for kids."
Which is pretty cool 👍
you need to make a squirrel maze 3
Suggestion: You should make a V8 carbonated tesla
Will you make more videos
Light is showing under the bookcase.
My friend is in this video
i think you got too much inspiration off the willywonka moovies
W human fr
You Should Make Something With BB-Guns Or Bow & Arrows
"Mark, you should look at nearby schools that have Interior Design. They require their students to work on a group project, and I think redecorating the entry office would be great for them."
mark rober is overated the real king is phat gus (this is a joke)
Mark Rober just built Dexter's lab.
You should get together with Mr.Beast again and plant another 20 million trees. I loved when you did it last time!
mark rober is just a kid in mans body
i cant wait to see if mark will make a vid about this in the next lik 10 or so years and say*and before you ask yes the hole that nitro made with the launcher is still here*
This is amazing!
Hi mark I know the chances of you seeing this are low but if you do I have an idea for you so I was thinking you could do end cards and show videos of people showing off their cool disc launchers and more to come
Mark is living our childhood dream
What does this building look like on the outside
"yeah, that's fine. he just made a gun is all."
🗣️🗣️🗣️Mark Rober is what the internet should be!
You should make a plus kit that has something that is wrong with the creation that they have to fix
"#5, the light under the book shelf gave it away."
"This is amazing! If I had a kid I’d totally do this with them! But because I’m kid-less, I’m still gonna do this alone and force my fiancée to have fun with me😂😁"
Our box just arrived!!!! No golden ticket but we are still excited!!! Can't wait to put it together!
And like Stephen Blakely said you deserve way more then and one on YouTube most other people are trying to copy but for mark he just has fun with what he does
The fact that mark is trying to help kids so they don't have to think of a new thing to do like its insane what 1 person can do to change peoples lives and I think its so cool he does this
I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.

"mark in  Texas: you can try to find it

Awesome
"The delivery guy: walks in and accidentally knocks the Eagle

Mark in the lab: I have been waiting for you, agent bond"

You make me so excited when I see that you post a video one day I wanna be just like you The fact that I might have a chance to meet you in person makes me so excited I would do anything to be like you
If I get the golden ticket can I bring grandpa joe? I hope the oompa loopas are there too. :)
You should make a basketball hoop that always make it in

"I LOVE THIS PLACE MARK , I AM TOTATLY AMAZED GREAT THINKING btw"
"Cool build boxes! It would even greater if they don't simply teach the best design and provide some ""extra"" enhancement parts for the kids to think how to enhance the project!"
2:52 looks greenscreened
Mark always knows the best music options for the moment
You did what in your fireman?
"bro he got 11,271,016 views in one week wow"
"""Mr beast copyright willy wonka"""
6 more months then it’s time for 5.0
"Not a fun idea, but you should probably make something that cleans up your mess. More extensively than a roomba. Like, the only thing i was thinking about when you shot that watermelon was ""Dang, I'd hate cleaning that up""."
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and inter sting to watch."
Squirrel maze 3
But what if we find it by accident 🤔
I saw this video cause I really like Mark and when I heard about the platinum to get my dream just came true I love you Mark
Donate 50k to ryan trahan to make him get a greate reset or 100k toget a permanent tattoo of your choice

I have had that idea from #10 for like a super long time
What was the song that was playing during the hotwheels section of the video?
Totally taking crunch labs
"In the next video, try engineering a brain for your son"
If the platinum ticket is significantantly heavier than non tickets wouldn’t it be possible at the manufacturer scale to sus out the box?
Ur so cool
17:16
This is the dream of any child or manchild xD

"eh, one big advertisement."
"Even though I’m just 21 and still a student to become an engineer. You make me look sooo much forward to having children with which I can build these projects with.
Absolutely admire your work Mark!"
It always impresses me that Mark seems like such a nice and fun dude passionate about his work and tries to inspire everyone else in the world too. What a legend.
"Hey Mark, thanks for being one of my inspirations to become an engineer. Love your videos, never stop."
"Dude, you are amazing what you’re doing, sharing and inspiring"

This is quiet a well known secret

most children around the world won't be able to afford the crunch lab box or get to meet just bc they don't live in the US
that's understandable."
i instantly knew the show when i saw the tennis ball cannon
when did mark rober turn into mr beast
"Best YouTuber out there

“Actually Mark you only showed 11 million people your secret place”
"Mark, I used to not know what to be when I'm an adult, but you've inspired me and now I want to be a creative engineer or a computer engineer! Thank you!"
"Guys like Mark are why I wish YouTube was around when I was a kid. I may not have ended up as an engineer, but he’s a brilliant role model. His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn’t mean you have to quit. Being able to work through the failure and push towards success and find solutions is a lesson that can be used in any part of life. Hats off to this guy, no YouTuber deserves more success than him."
"Mark, please make nerf darts come back to you in like 10 seconds or so"
Can you make a more advanced option for teens it looks cool but I am older and want something more complicated?
you can tell its there from the scraches mark
You forgot about number 5!
Can you help me convert a big shopping cart into a dog carrier on the bottom and a golf cart on the side walk or road? Also can you give it a pop up shelter for varying weather? An a c. And heater on the inside would be great too. I know a shopping cart can be a vast resource and I figured that you gave the imagination and skills to do it.
Is nobody gonna talk about the PvZ music at 6:30
Oh he uploaded again
gravity falls
"would love to see you and ""stuff made here"" channel do a coop project"
PLEASE LET ME COME PLEASE
Big video!
I think every kid can agree when I say every kid has dreamed about something like this at least 8 times
"Wow Mark! This place is so so so (x100,000,000) cool!! I think you should make a invention where you make someone trip with a rope, but before they hit the ground you make something extend out that could snatch them up or break their fall."
You know how you said you like to take things that humans do and make it better what about lawn mowers is will be fun and easy to mow
I Love this channel!
Not me sitting doing my engineering work thinking how fun being an engineer looks :p thanks for inspiring the next generation!
thats crazyu
The Legends of Zelda Shrine Puzzle Music Was Perfect 6:51
What is that music called. I’ve been trying to figure it out
"is it portable to germany? i live in germany so if i win this ticket, can i still come to the USA?"
Id love to see a mario kart hot wheel on that track
Do you have to be a kid to qualify as a winner? Or would my kid-like imagination be acceptable? Haha I’m in love with the warehouse and the crazy ideas. I want to visit.
"If I can practice as many times as I want, can I run a bunch of tests, physics the crap out of it, and then try?"
can someone give me the link for the mini rivals? can't find it on amazon
My kids and I really enjoy this channel thank you for all the cool stuff you do!
This. Is. Dope.
"I can't wait to have kids and share this kind of critical thinking activity box with them. We are definitely a household that will be fostering the cr*p out of STEM principles/activities for our kids! Also as someone with a strong interest in science, this feels like a much safer and less chaotic method to promote science learning than my dad's idea of ""objects in motion"" principles taught by slamming the breaks on the car....which in hindsight was probably just him covering his really bad/aggressive driving habits up with ""science lessons."""
"Not only a really nice guy, but super intelligent and a big kid at heart. Having fun whilst learning, teaching and sharing his knowledge. Need more Mark Robers in the world!"
RIP KIWIKO. Love the video tho :-D
I WANT TO GO TO THERE!!!
Inspector Gadget
do you know whAT VEX IQ IS
thats crazyu
A group of people would probably just get together and go to a bunch of places to just find and storm the crunch lab.
I think women should lift the seat when they are finished
Dude you out did yourself......too fn funny
9:39 did you just leak the QR code for one of the videos :O
Does that mean Canadians are not eligible to win the trip?
Amazing - yet again you win Cool Uncle Award!  Does your son visit the lab with you?  I'm sure you find wonderful things for him because I am sure you are also a Very Cool & Kind Dad!
Supercool! Just fyi you can see the lights under the book case by the way.
So if i come are you gonna pay for the plane ticket
What's wrong with keeping the toilet seat up
22M people you mene
when will this turn into basically star labs
Can I please come over!
Woah!
Thank you for adding graze the roof I have no why I am saying this so yeah
i love you mark
You can see the light under the book shelf lol
"I signed up for a year of boxes ""for my daughter"""

$300 for a year!? I would really like to sign up for that but that's crazy money
"Let's say I win, I get to come to your special warehouse but do I have to pay the tickets myself?"
by the way you could see the blue light under the bookcase!
kudos Mark - great that you and your team have built this place!
"Thank you for showing us the exact way into your ""secret room"""
why do you start your videos yelling so loud
thats a super cool secret room i wish i had one just like this
11:08 Can't wait to get my gear badge for claymores
Mark is the ultimate cool teacher that doesn’t give homework and actually inspires you to learn
"I had one like this. Mr. Martin taught biology. He was animated, had a passion for his subject, plus... He let us take our final home the Friday before our test date, then he covered all the windows with brown paper and let us watch Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons while he graded our tests and did the math for our final grades. If we were low, he allowed us to write a short paper on a subject of his choosing to have turned in by the end of the day. If you turned it in, whatever you wrote, he upped your final grade by one letter grade. I already had an A in the class, but a few of my friends took advantage to get a B from a C. His class was fun and informative and I learned more than I thought I did. It was great!"
"He probably would give homework, but it would be way too fun to be classified as homework"
I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.
How do you redeem the platinum ticket???
Please make fat gus merch
yooo
hello
It’s literally a real version of Dexter’s Laboratory 😀
"mark, is Fletcher still alive?"
all i gotta do is now find that place
this is literally kids dream
Sing pure imagination
HI Mark. You can't do that. That's not how you become an engineer. Haven't you been on LinkedIn or Xing lately? You become an engineer by complaining until you get a quota that makes you one.
What's Xing?
Was it just me who heard the og PvZ music?
POG WAREHOUSE
well i see light down the book shelf
I have a problem : I live in France :(
Giving back to the community and help share your knowledge with kids and others is admirable. You’re an inspiration my dude!
dope lab.
"Mark Rober, you are an absolute dream come true for those who love to explore, build, and most importantly, ask “why?”.
You’re an inspiration beyond value. Stay young at heart and keep creating these amazing ideas."
"Mark Rober: “I made a new lab!”
Me: “I NEED IT!!!!”
Plus the problem with the new product is it costs $180 and I don’t think anyone will be willing to pay that much."
i want this now
It’s funny tho because they just finished this office and mark video came out this same time
Thanks Mark.
Mark is basically a real life version of my favorite movie character. that probably sounds weird but it's funny to me
Mark is the only person who would build a super secret lab and testing facillity only to make half of things for nerf wars. my dream come true
Cooooooll
Mark! You actually inspired me to want to be a rocket engineer for Nasa and I’m so excited to get your crunch lab build box! I really hope I can be a engineer like you❤️
how much you want for the bike?
i try to invent
awesome big zDdy
Make a phat Gus stuffed animal
Sell a phat Gus stuffed animal
"I wish Mark Rober was around when I was a kid, I would have loved to become a engineer as a kid watching your videos, it’s so nice you’re doing this for the youth!!"
It’s so cool
Love the Crunch Lab my guy!!!
I think Colin furze and mark should do a partnership again
5:39 THE BEST EXAMPLE OF EASIER SAID THEN DONE!!!!!!
THIS IS CRAZY
not such a super secret lab any more is it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
MKBHD catching frisbees? That’s the best “work area” I have ever seen!
Fast question. ¿To witch countries is aviable the crunchlabs boxes?
"“I’ve got a huge secret-“
Proceeds to tell pretty much every single person with access to the internet"
Ya make like a nailed it sort of thing where you get your engineer friends and make the best functional build
Always been so impressed by your stuff how do you do it I’ve always loved engineering!!!!!!
Just a quick question if I were to find your building would you be angry if I were to go inside and try to get in?
Never mind
📲123
"And after all that, the engineer still manages to teach kids how to make a weapon. It’s the Manhattan project all over again."
This is my dream of having one if these no far mom said it's my tern with the secret lab
WOAH!! SO BIG AND CREATIVEE!!
ITS THE BEST ONE I EVER SEEN!
Seen the light underneath the book shelf
So once we receive a box with a hole in it we´re in!
"That 10k target is dirty. I have a feeling you can get it in, but im more concerned the force would make it bounce back out."
The Crunch Labs build boxes are an amazing idea. Keep it up
Can I have that I'm 8
You can't hate this guy urban legend
this guy built his minecraft secret base irl
Soooo you’re basically Willy Wonka. Dope.
I really want the boxes but my parents said I have to pay for them myself and I don't have the money. :(
15:56 SUS
When are we going to see the return of phat gust
"ok ok i get the point mark
but can i receate this with my own twists and turns"
surely mr beast helped with all this
I want it but i live in pakistan so what i can do
How do you shut the door back?
"I find it ironic that Mark Rober makes a science version of willy wonka and the chocolate factory, the same time that Mrbeast makes a real one.🤣"
The only downside to the secret doorway is the light under the bookshelf gives it away
can we bay 1 box?
I feel like I could jump from the height the pneumatic is set at.
"When this guy's kids go to school, all their classmates are going to hate their own parents."
I can say I’m 11 and want to be an engineer because of mark.
Sameee
There is a video in these sponsors.
I got so much I idea and it's possible to build
best youtuber
He should collaborate with Hacksmith. That would be awesome
6:48 GENIUS!!! NO ONE EVER GETS DIET PEPSI
bro it is 299.40$ that is so expencive
6:19 *plants vs zombies music plays*
what if u live in a different country like NZ is there still a way to Win or is it just the US
Mark Robert quick question do you pay for the expenses of us coming down there for the day Because my mother is in financial issues but she still has some money to spare to buy some stuff
is it me or do you sound diferent
I thought it was a methlab
“And behind this wall I have built an entire Nuclear Reactor Core!”
Of cource you did
It was so. SO COOL
Do you guys ship all across the world or only in america?
you're such an amazing creator of unimaginable things!!
The office that you have built looked like the dude perfect one and I thought it was the dude perfect warehouse
I want to visit somewhat badly
This reminds me of Mr. Beast’s new video with the Willy Wonka factory but cooler and more scientific
Would it actually be possible to find crunch labs just from looking around offices/dentists offices?
What kind of engineer are you ?🤔🤨
"Can you make a video about Japan’s futuristic technology, because I live in Japan 🇯🇵"
Secret bookshelf is not so secret you can totally see the light streaming out from under it
Mark is just getting started
I love your vids!
"when i went to the website it didn't work, nor did the link you put"
"""Now is my second favorite way to get to a secret room"" JUMPS OF A BUILDING """
He’s the best !!!!!!!!
In 8:07 you can see the aluminium thing that the backyard scientist made
I just imagine people walking into buildings and tearing walls down to see if it’s the lab
😂 congratulations mark! I have watched you for many years and grew up watching you. It’s nice to see how you have grown and taught all of us more. You have inspired many of us! ❤️
You should make a giant swing that swings across the entire warehouse
I wish I could do this :(
I am 9 and I WANT TO MEET YOU SO BAD but I kind of far away
"Others: psi
Mark: WATERMELOMETER"
That is super amazing!
I love the massive amount of consideration toward Nerf battles.
tbh at some parts of the video you look unhappy
im gonna guess the beds have holes in them for reasons
dude i with i were u sometimes. you are so cool.
"your crunch lab, is it available overseas?"
secret passage ways aint so secret anymore
No balls nerf battle me
that's it... I'm making a secret warehouse when i grow up
Wished I would of watched your videos as a kid. I’m 23 now & I’ll never do anything revolving engineering but I would of loved to study it growing up
"um
wow
that is
um
wow
I've wanted to be an engineer for so long and this is just-
amazing"
I love that at 6:30 you have a Plants vs Zombies remix song XD
That's super awesome. I'm pretty jealous.
i   m u s t   g o   t h e r e   n o w
Bro maxed out his intelligence and coolness and is STILL not the favorite uncle
something tells me hes going to make an ai then that ai will go crazy and destroy all humans
How do you make the fireman piston
So cool
Bro can make a lap and become gusfring
even know  if i get the platinum thing i cant go there cuz i live in Indonesia nooooooooooooooooo
"We all NEED some Phat Gus plushies. Are they going on release or did I miss it. Either way, Mark Rober always makes the best stuff and he puts so much work into it. Keep it up"
you are the most creative youtuber I've watched and you're videos are not only fun and entertaining but also educative. You are awesome!!!
dude you are living my dream
Goat
I’m planning on making a secret door in my house as well.
I wish my life choices had led me to become an engineer.....smh
Imagine one day you forget where the foam container and u still jump 🤣😅
"No way mark Rober put pvz music in his video, he would never"
srry i ment today  anyway its a wallet that senses if its touched then a light and a buzzing sound will go off so that nobody can pick-pocket you anymore!
"Mark, THE WORLD REALLY NEEDS MORE YOUS!"
"I wish I could use the like button multiple times, amazing video Mark!"
Minecraft in real life
No one gonna talk about how he just stole from a Denny's 😭💀🤦💯
Are you the favorite uncle yet?
Greenhouse in your glass walls
BRO I REALLY WANT TO DO THISSSSS but me and my mom don’t got money so I won’t be able to but I’ll be a scientist one day
mark your slowly  becoming the real robbie rotten
Imagine being at a barber shop Hmmm this child doesnt look real lets twist him around until something happens
"I’m only smart enough to do animation. This is amazing fr, I wish I could do all of this, but I’m really glad he’s accomplishing his dreams!"
Only a big brain guy can do this
Says secret room 6:26 can see light under bookshelf😂
"Next step i need you to roll put these crunch labs to major cities or maybe have a mini crunch labs in local children's museum...who know maybe one day your own STEM theme park


Honestly so proud and excited for you"
"that is awesome, this is my new dream, to have something like this."
This is cool...
Yo Is that JiDion? at minute 4:40?
Hi I love your videos!!
It's kinda obvious with the light coming in from under the shelf 😂
i could watch him explain his entire office/warehouse for hours and still not get bored.
thats the same warehouse from the dominos video.
Wdym thx for all the support over the years? I swear it feels like you just started on YouTube. Time flies
For a second I thought Mark got busted for human trafficking
की
"Well, it's not a secret anymore."
what happens when someone jumps off the ledge without knowing the container was moved
@Mark Rober Watch Nile Green’s video to get ideas for the next glitterbomb!
I use to love you now you are no better that those scamers. you sent the bait packages to.
ive been watching mark for a couple years on and off and now i should be getting my mechanics qualification at 18
This is truly awesome! One great solution to help people be curious and learn! Really awesome!
"There is only one flaw about the secret entrance from the boring office room. You can see the light coming through from the bottom of the bookshelf that blocks the entrance. :)

P.S: This is not to insult anyone, this info is only for entertainment. ( Please don't yell at me. )"
"REALLY, WHOS THE OTHER UNCLE?"
nothing's more iconic than that workbench you always stand in front of in every videos
Mark you are THE GOAT and don't you ever forget that!
"Seems to me your going to need to make a nerf picking up Roomba kinda thing, that also sorts them and puts them in a ammo supply box. :P"
Mines cooler
Is this in Florida cuz I want this
"At 6:42 your ""secret"" passage is easily detectable by the glowing lights underneath the bookcases.  The scratches under the bust are also a dead giveaway.  The gap between the floor and the bookcase slider is another dead giveaway."
"Literally, Stanley Pines."
Can you be my uncle please
"A buddy for throwing Frisbees AKA MKBHD...

Check, this guy is badass."
Kinda reminds me of Odd Squad HQ ngl lol
Can we just talk about that box trust that has no base plates or support to it
mark rober is now my favorite youtuber
I GOT CRUNCH LABS
he noclipped into the backrooms 💀
maybe a water sensor in the sink to catch those who just touch the handle instead of actually washing their hands?
"Yes, but why?"
"It would be way cooler if the toy car reaches the end of the hot wheels track would do something. Like when reaching the end it will hit a button or something to turn off the lights, it would open some secret door of some sort and will be back at its place again."
I'm not sure what is better...Mark's inventions...his lab...or the editing on this video! Bravo all around!
Question:I live in Texas if I were to get the platinum ticket how would I get there?
I think every kid dreams about having this kind of warehouse. Including me
its so big
this is literally my dream when i was younger i did the same stuff but in minecraft tho 😅
I'm getting major Fantasy Factory vibes here
It would funny if he made the new base in Ashland Missouri where I’m guessing no one lives beside me
"time to get a super widescreen camera on that hotwheel car, and make it so you can ride it in VR with head movement tracking :P"
Bro where in the world is this
do you have a crunch labs but for teens 15-18?
"whats the ratio of the platinum tickets
out of the boxes"
Can you do a squirrel maze 3.0? Please
Gotta close the gap under the bookshelf so that light won't shine trough.
Where can I buy that chair !!?!?
Just shows not all hero's ware cape's
I think your already the best uncle xD
"Mark Rober made his lab the modern version of willy wonka and the chocolate factory! With platinum ticket, that is something😉"
this is so freaking cool!! my favorite part has to be the floor to ceiling whiteboards though 😍
After This video I will twist every eagle I see on a bookshelf
14:45 Scott would be proud
Love the video and I got the crunch 12 month package😎
I was so hoping for a willhelm scream when he dove off the balcony!
7:20 *10M people
I like how he mostly uses the nerf rival perses one of the best nerf brand blasters
DID U JUST SAY YOU STOLE SOME THING
"homeboy built a secret lair, started a movement, and broke a world record in a 17 min video"
6:03 we love logic gates
I love your vids
You should use airguns not nerf
"This is awesome, congrats"
"Ok, beware of nintendo's demands, you have created mark labo"
oompa loompa didly doo i smell chemicals cooking i do
"Hi mark
If someone got a box but lived abroad from you. How would they get to you if the received the ticket. Would expenses be covered or is it only Americans that have a shot at getting the ticket :("
"I thought the whole “crunch labs,” and “crunch box” would be like the biggest sponsorship to crunchyroll."
"It doesn't seem to ship to Switzerland, sadly..."
yeah but what if I don't flush
A very most excelent Creatatorium. Well done :)
Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory but better
No
No
Mark River is doing more for the next generation than our public school ever did
Bro do a battlebot
Did he just create the nerd's version of Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory?? I am in awe.
a real bummer that you have to be 18 by the rules :(
"secret warehouse: Mark Rober edition 
Rarity:1 out of 100000000000000000000000000000000
Value:Undefined"
My friend just has a zipline from his bedroom into his swimming pool
It's always nice to watch these videos and feed off the positive happy go lucky energy that is always too lacking in this day and age
Ok grunkle stan
The question is… do any computers in and around Crunch Labs run CrunchBang Linux?  Theme-based tools!
I applaud this video.  I also dreamed of an engineering lab when I was a small child.
You should partner with How Ridiculous and smash a bunch of things with the tennis ball cannon
Who all came here after watching project nightfall 😂😂
one minute in and im felling so jealous!!!!
the frisbee guy took you can't be a dog too seriously
"Gordon Freeman, is that you?"
This reminds me of grunkle stan's secret base!
"Only problem is that there is scratches near the eagle, signaling it's turned quite a bit which I'd suspicious, and also there is a blue light under the bookshelf which is a major giveaway... the way I'd fix this is to put LED lights under the bookshelf and desk and anywhere it fits into an aesthetic.. and then for the eagle u could put foam or smthn soft under the eagle to prevent scratching"
This guy has been planning everything something he started today is gonna come a year later
Might be the best video on the internet. ever.
Dr
Mark needs to make a skateboard that uses magnetic force to keep you on the board so you don’t fall
5:21 based
LOUD
literally my dream home
0:00 through 0:04 (breaking bad reference 😳)
"just watched teleshop on youtube and i liked it, idk how you managed that, mr. rover"
Quality infomercial
So coollllllll congrats
3:39 WOW I heard that transition!!
your my biggest hero mark i hope you see this it would make my life
15:51 retreeeeat!
that looks so fun!!!!!!
Is that mrwhostheboss ?
This video just made my day! What an amazing place you have created.
Only problem is fire hazard what if someone was smoking while pooping and they had to run they would burn alive
Do you ship to the UK
I'm in the weird part of YouTube again.
You can only get in through this secret entrance or the giant garage door.
What if you want Diet Pepsi
Next video: I’ll be making a nuclear power plant
9:39 I scanned the QR code pettily and got rickrolled 💀
So basically you are the Willi Wonka of engineering
"Ngl, Mark just working together with Elon Musk would be cool."
Wow
Make a version of these boxes for folks with a Grey hair or two and im on the list ASAP Mark!
well if that aint the best goddamn sales pitch ive ever heard
yes but what about team breeze for clean air?
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

"#5 let’s just ignore the blue light coming out of the bottom of the bookcase.
There is nothing behind there. No secret lab or anything."
"Nobody:
Me: *iTs MrWhOsEtHeBoSs*"
Wait wait wait. Did he just say Phat gus?! and not fantastic gus? How is that possible! 3:47
Are these things in Canada or not
I really hate the fact that most American YouTubers such as Mark or Mr beast aren't able to ship over any of their products in the UK and if they even do that you still have to pay in dollars mark if you read this you will change the country of Britain thank you
"nobody:
my birthday coming soon: (:<"
"Mark, I wish I was a kid again. Thank you for thinking of the kids."
The shelves in the entry office leak way too much light and it gives the entrance away. Very cool area in any case.
I WANT THAT BOX !!!!!!!! even though I am 21
"5 MINUTES IN AND THIS IS ALREADY SO AWESOME.
Is no one going to talk about MKBHD cameo with his frisbee?"
Dang it... I live in the Philippines and I really want one soo bad but we ain't got money for it its like 1500Php per month but I can't do anything about it so im just gonna watch You (Mark Rober) so I can learn something new!. [ I know that you may or may not see this comment but its ok :) ]
"way to go Mark, swell pad! congrats!!
I even enjoyed the commercial. to package up all that engineering knowledge for kids to play with is pretty amazing. you're making the world a better place 🍻
might have to get the disc launcher, for me!
there was a disc launcher gun in the '70s that was a favorite toy. I can already see that your design launches discs way better 😀"
This gives me Odd Squad vibes lol
4:39 as if that is NOT Marquess Brownlee lol
After 30 seconds I stopped caring.
"Just amazing, i love this idea so much. Ur the best Mark !!"
"Lol, where is MTV cribs at?"
This is the coolest thing ever!
there's no way that mark isn't the favorite uncle
That advert was really long
"Crunch lab, ah yes the founding father of making individual creativity come to life"
Stuff made here and mark rober SHOULD DO A COLLAB
Science and engineering are both just a fad. Nobody needs engineers. I've seen Idiocracy.
i cant buy the package because my parents dont let me thats sad because i want to meet mark

anyone know the song played on 3:24 ???
I swear Mark has become this generations Billy Nye.
"Only thing I noticed, I see light under the book shelf. So I would def mess with things trying to open it"
Nothing secret about the entrance to the lab/warehouse when the bookcase has far too much light leaking out from underneath it.
Makes secret compartment-shares where it is with everyone
You’re going to have more ants than just the ones in that ant farm after all of those exploded watermelons 😂😂🐜🐜
Another amazing video
Sharktank next?
awesome
"If I would have been Mark here, I would have built the whole thing underground and build another legit business over top so that when you enter the lab, you have absolutely ZERO idea that there's something underground. That would make it 100 times cooler. Totally something out of an espionage movie."
6:27 you can clearly see the light under the book shelf
"How did you make this, Mark Rober?"
How did you make this mark rober?
"hi Mark Rober, dude it is easy to find your secret door because there is light under the secret entrance so fix it pls"
"Recently, my car got robbed, and I lost thousands of dollars worth of technology. So I was wondering if you could…..

Invent a car window that, upon being smashed in by a burglar, immediately deploys something that releases from the top and bottom of the window, and clamp shut; detaining the burglar in some way."
“‘Ain’t so secret now pard’ner”
"Remember when Mark just filled pools with orbeez, I do."
"Your frisbee friend disrespected you with that professional athlete worth of extension on his catch, lol."
You're like a modern day willywonka mixed with Nikola Tesla. Love all of this.

You can see the lab lights under the cupboard. That's a dead giveaway.
I would love to see Mark rover vs Penn and teller they set a magic trick and mark has to recreate it with out any plans or knowledge of how it's done and then they see if he made a new technique or has figured it out
Mark *explaining something important*                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Me *Vibing to the plants vs zombies 1 music*

"So COOL! I love all that you do, keep being awesome!"
"My heart just broke with two little words at the bottom of the screen : ""US only"""
Where ?
When are we getting Mark Rober University?
It really that much of a 'secret' lab anymore
I watched this a few days ago and can’t help and comment that it looks so inaccessible for the disabled community. What if a child with mobility aids gets a ticket?
"Mark, you're truly incredible."
Is it US only?
"Wow, this is fantastic! Mark, your truly amazing"
Я руссс
"What if you jumped of the balcony, but the shipping container wasn't there"

The light under the bookshelf gives it away
this is awesome
You are great.
mark rober i can bet thet with your help I can fulfill my dream to become a engineer
Can we just appreciate the time and effort he puts in these videos? Respect! 💯
I really wish CrunchLabs ships to Malaysia :(
"*Mark see a Watermelon* 
Mark: Finally! A Worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!

Watermelon: aaahh s***, here we go again."
Ohhhh. Can I come run some experiments???
Entertaining Video! Keep up the great work!
Lucky this guy didn’t stay at nasa
So there just a light below the cabinet  well mark
Gravity Falls?
"“Bumps into these stationary air molecules” isn’t generally how lift works. It’s the low pressure zone above the object that pulls it upward. Wings on a plane don’t push air down, they pull the plane up."
"Nope, that isn't the full reason. Yes that's partially true, but the main way it works is through the coanda effect. The wing curves the streamlines down, and thanks to conservation of momentum, the wings are forced upward"
"im assuming that explaining low pressure zones to children is still a tad complex. but in either case you are still in fact bumping into ""stationary"" air molecules."
This is every kids dream.
6:18 OOOOOOOOO THE MOOSIC
14:50 I disagree even if you weigh less I believe you can still go down with momentum.
You must have seen allot of Dexter's Lab when you were young.
"Hi Mark, you have a delivery destination to my neighbor Singapore but not Malaysia. Hope you plan to open up to Malaysia as well soon."
Light is escaping from the bottom of the bookshelf.
"Ever since I was five , Mark Rober changed my life I love science sense he posted his first video , now I’m 14 in science is really easy for me because things like this make me happy ! Seeing this happen for the other kids makes me happy!"
I would love to see you make a bike that never falls (I know this already exists but I want to see you do this your own way)
"I wish YouTube (and your channel) had existed when I was 12. I might have actually learned a few things. In reality, YT didn't exist until a few years after I graduated from high school."
hi
Any books on how to think like an engineer?
Can I come over

Hey Mark you may never see this but thank you for your videos. I want to become an engineer. I love math and science so much. I just don’t know what I should do to actually become one. I guess that’s where I have to live my life.
Me getting my brothers phone and going to the part with the QR code to scan it with my phone
Mark would be an amazing science teacher
Cool
Invite the Furze over to collab!!
Rush E 2 is coming out soon… just sayin 👀

You're so smart."

Very epic design.  I'm surprised mark didnt used this as a Squirrel Maze 3.0  Speaking of that anyone still looking forward for another exciting Squirrel Adventure?
Can u make something out of solar power
THE FAR SIDE ONE GAVE ME FLASHBACKS DUDE!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!

You can see the warehouse under the bookcase just so you know
"It always impresses me that Mark seems like such a nice and fun dude passionate about his work and tries to inspire everyone else in the world too.

What a legend."
"👆👆
Tell Rockwell I referred you for something new strategy on New Terra/UST, or you are involved in other exciting projects. Thank you for the comments👆⬆️."
:( i can't afford it :( it 300$ in total and i have 150$ :(
This is awesome! any chance you'll be shipping to argentina any time soon??
"can you show us how you did it? I really wanted to see how you got the bookshelf to slide, or you can show us your progress i might wanna do this some day. Thanks!!!"
First mistake was using Willy Wonka as a reference. This is Dexters Laboratory you uncultured swine lol
Really sweet...I love your designs and pranks...

That train horn bike is cool! I have something similar what I did is I went to a junkyard and took a horn out of an F-150 and then used a drill battery and put it on my bike. 😃
Mark Rober you are doing such a great job at making videos! I love your content thank you so much! And also a little heads up you can see the light from the WareHouse under the bookshelf.
Can I help
Bros in minecraft
Completely opposed to the toilet sensor. It's not my job to put the seat up when it's equally on them for not checking
i’m still confused on how big this place is
big Fantasy Factory vibes
Mark Rober would be an amazing weapons developer if he out his mind to it.
Hey mark I’m a physicists I would love to get together and work on a project
"What about us outside of the US, Mark? I feel like most of these giveaways on youtube now a days are US only. It would be nice to be able to even participate."
"I wish there was a ""love"" button cause like just doesn't cut it. This is so cool Mark! You're the real life nerdy Willy Wonka."
Yo mark Rober I am a huge fan
A new dude perfect is born.....you should gather up your powers for a MEGA VIDEO

"you need some felt under that eagle, so it doesn't continue to scratch the crap out of that shelf, and give away where it is"

I love how fat Gus is a meme
amazing
It’s not a secret anymore
Actually you only showed 10 million people not 20
niceeee
Mark is like the real life tony stark
You guys should sell those boxes at Walmart. They'd be so cool
Mans just like those ppl on the when we were growing up with a secret lab
The amount of adults (including me) who's a child at heart that's gonna order that box lol
Watching this 2 days before my final FEM exam makes me cry for all the little kids thinking its all about building stuff🥲
"I want to buy the monthly box for my adult son who Ives in  a different state than I do, I am not sure of the best way to get I, I was a little confused by the suggestions and process, it talks about a virtual card thing, please assist with this matter."
i live in the trenches??
is the videos only for the people who buy it
This is literally my dream. Congrats
"Hey @Mark Rober I do rock climbing and there is something called an autobellay which is a device that lowers everyone at a reasonably equal at different weights, I think it uses magnetic or something but I’m not sure. How do these work?"
"Im so happy for you and your family and your Team Mark, Ive been along for the ride almost since the start and to see the channel grow this much and to see you smile and achieve your dreams is sooo amazing. Stay dope and keep that amazing content coming :)"
Grunkle stan????
mark is one of the coolest humans on earth
"I want to see Mark fight not a nerf battle here, I wanna see a nerf war fought here"
Mark Rober’s engineering brain: “I want to be Willy Wonka. How do I make that happen?”
whats the background music playing at 7:00?
You can see the light from under the bookshelf.
cops get called cuz people are staking out buildings and touching everything
Giant warehouse lab <<<<<< adult playground
You are so awesome MARK
My dream job is it engineer this will help me become it
"This is the guy You Tube was made for.

Best of luck with the business venture with Crunch Labs

Back in the 70's Radio Shack had the 300 in 1 electronics lab where you applied patch wires between batteries and electronic components to make several different things. Back then there was a Radio Shack in every town and eventually you went in there and as a kid those labs were cool. I got one when I was 9. And it launched my love for computers and electronics.

I hope your Build Boxes do the same. Critical Thinking is in short supply. Kids today are told what to think but now how to think.

Dude built a Club House we all dreamt of when we were kids. Jealous."
Mark for president when?
I might have been watching too much breaking bad but this would be a great…
"This. looks. so. cool!! Such a cool idea to try get more and more kids into STEM and eng. Out of curiosity, would u consider opening up the competition to people outside of the states?"
admire your work Mark!
bro wat will hapen if mayby i winn  the silber tiket and im from germany how du i get wif my family thu your lab will you buy us a pane ticket or wat will hapen plead help me aut
"I mean, the lab is cool. But I really like the oldschool office :D"
At 3:27 there is music playing . What is it called
What does the lab look like from the outside? Is it just a tiny office with an giant warehouse connected to it?
that ping-pong ball claymore thing looks so cool
🥳
whats the background music playing at 7:00?
Plants vs. Zombies music roof something...
why can you be my physics teacher
"Dude Mark, I don't even know what to say, that vid was just like the coolest thing ever! I'll get myself one of the ""dang Build Boxes"" as soon as I can. Keep up the great work, love your videos, everything you do has just made me want to think in some smarter way. Things that I had never before questioned I now think about all the time."
you could legit become batman but better
I wish I had a phat Gus plush
3:49 What you mean by “stole”.
Mans changing the world
wow
You should make a beyblade that is fully controlled by you. Including stamina and how it moves around
Do a robin hood a Robinhood is when you land two darts on same spot and getting a bullsi
Is this channel morphing into Mr Beast
This will be a museum in 40 years time.
This just makes me want to be Mark's nephew even more...
You’re probably never ever going to see this comment but if I find out where that is can I come in 🤣🤣 if you say yes well then that’s my purpose in life now 🤣
What hurts more 105 mph baseball or this tennis ball
"No one has 22mln subscribers not being owned by the elite, with zero interesting to say of course."
the light beneath the bookshelf kinda gave the lab away
This is a masterclass in marketing - well done
This is so freaking cool
"This feels like a Mark Rober style, over the top extension of the pandemic science lessons from two years ago. You stopped them, saying you wanted to work on something big. Is this the big thing?  Do the kits have to be for kids?"
Jesse! I found a new place for us to cook!!
"Nerf guns are fun, but can you create a system that would recollect the bullets please? :)"
I  bet that platinum ticket has a phone number on the back that goes to a phone that mark will answer. 🤔I want it so much 😭
What if the lab was a red herring and there was a bigger lab behind it.
"Mark,  Congratulations on this new achievement.  You are an amazing human being.  Jeff"
Best. Warehouse. Ever
Can the crunch labs come to England I mean the bowes with the stuff inside
I wanna make a place like this but for my restaurant when I become older. (I wanna become a chef). But I’m now thinking that some sort of cool function in the barn house restaurant could be cool. Thanks for lighting my creativity.
how much for each package?
dude whaht. where is this. i couldnt fly anywhere to try and find this.
😂😂 تاااافه
For the world record hot wheels track did you use the half a mile hot wheel tracks from the domino video?

He built he's own batcave
That epic warehouse is soooo cool!
"Mark! Please consider changing the title of this video.. it's terribly understated in my opinion, and doesn't do justice to the mammoth accomplishments within it."
9:40 what if the link is a rickroll

It looks like your version of the freedom factory! I’d have a blast (pun intended) hanging out for a day!

how much did this cost
Should have named it S.T.A.R. labs
"I was wondering if there are people who actually watch these videos, these types of videos are trending in the most watched ones Nobody can interfere in anyone's life"
???
They should make a electronic toy box for like making rc cars or something cool.
he's probably making like 90 secret projects at a time
Imagine forgeting moving that big container and jumpin on the floor
I wonder if I’m gonna get the platinum ticket
Your awesome!
I can not stop watching this video it is amazing
willy wonka would be proud
Mark if you need an extra hand I will be able to help in about five years from now
Mark I did a project on you
You colud se the light under the book shelf🧐
"bro I’ve been watching mark since he appeared in tv with the pranks n stuff watching him grow like that is truly amazing. Mark u insane my dude

We don't deserve Mark Rober
"13:29 Now, why would you go and do something like that? Didn't you see the sign that said, ""DO NOT PUSH THIS BUTTON!""? How will we finish testing with the self-destruct mechanism active?"

You just built MY DREAM ROOM! With secret passages, awesome Bond gadgets and just the coolest gear!
Congrats on your dream coming true and best wishes for the future adventures that WILL COME!
Cheers to you and everyone involved 👍🏻✌🏻"
all that you're doing is incredible.
I really wish i could buy the box but $300 is too much for my family
This is the first step of the robot revolution
My son always watches you we are in on crunch labs😎
You should use actual guns with live ammo
yert
my guy even got youtube's atention
W O W
That's just awesome.

"Guys like Mark are why I wish YouTube was around when I was a kid. I may not have ended up as an engineer, but he’s a brilliant role model. His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn’t mean you have to quit. Being able to work through the failure and push towards success and find solutions is a lesson that can be used in any part of life. Hats off to this guy, no YouTuber deserves more success than him."
"@Andy-GTI but he does spend a lot in one video too, so technically he needs it after buying a whole wear house."
Agree!
True
@Andy-GTI how does that have anything to do with the dude's comment?
"@Andy-GTI well you could also imagine that to pay to make a lot of his projects, his team, living expanses, business expanses, etc. Would cost significantly more than $70k. He is similar to Mr.Beast where he puts his revenue back into his ideas and projects and thats what makes him and people alike stand out. It's also interesting to note (as evidence to my statement) that over the last years, his growth has obviously brought him a bigger financial success which in return also made his projects bigger in size and quality"
Bro why did you make the entrance so complicated? You could've just put 2 signs and a painting in a hole in the wall

I have been waiting for my chance to wear one since the event. Hope you're doing well!"
It’s secret until 9.9 million people see it on YouTube
I have to take my hat off to Mark Rober who is the complete master of all production content and who has totally unlocked the secret YouTube algorithm. I was having so much fun watching this video that it wasn’t until the 17 minute mark that I realised I’d been watching an advertisement. Now that’s total genius work. Thanks Mark and I hope your project spawns a whole new generation of engineers. Cheers! :-)
Bro is living my dream I whant this
"hey Mark I had a cool idea for one of your next video's, I thought of a base ball that always throws strikes"
I'm 28. Is it strange that I want to get the Build Box?
I want to meet you without the ticket🥲🥲🥲
should I really be under 12 to get one ?
Is that Marques from MKBHD throwing the frisbee?

You can see the light
How much it all costed to build? Wow Is YouTube money paying for all this ?
"Random person: are ypu afraid to get robbed?
Mark: grab the watermlometer"
I thought the work bench was in you garage
what is the song that the piano play ??
"Just too cool mate, too cool by half."
"Secret room no one, except the 9.9 million subscribers, will ever find."
Does America have to do workplace risk assessments? Whole place looks like a liability insurance nightmare 😱
Do you ship to india 🇮🇳

Can i buy it from malasia?
I'm British so the crunch labs kits look amazing but I don't know if they can ship to England?
Awesome lab but dude. You just took kiwicos idea and passed it off as your own. They've supported loads of your videos in the past
Nah not couch plus. MEGA COUCH!!!
This guy made a weapon more powerful that a rifle only it uses small balls instead of 12mm armor piercing bullets
Great stuff Mark.
He's a marketing genius
Is it worldwide shipping?
Lol you might want to fix the bright strip of light beneath the bookshelf. It kind of gives it away. XD
"Don't get me wrong but this feels more like a museum and not an engineering lab. Did you just not show the Maschinerie (laith, mill etc)

some areas like the big sports room are amazing for testing tho"
"Someone probably already said it, but the light under the bookcase is a really big clue. Besides that, that is awesome. Very awesome I want one."
how can it be secret if u tell it millions of people ?
"nerf gun wall, secret passageways, giant foam pit... this lab is E P I C. well done!"
Does your worker's health insurance cover nerf gun injuries?
Hey Mark would love you to do an interview and secret colab. with Naomi Wu!  That would be fun...
"If he becomes a supervillain, we're all fucked."
"whats the first music chopsticks called the usual one that mark uses for his intro?
the one that says echante in french"
Why does he sound like jojo siwa
bro when war breaks out you're set
You ship the boxes to Denmark and sweden but not Norway?
nice
"Everyone dream uncle🤩
Btw AMAZING secret room"
"Those boxes are great, I think a more advanced version for older people would sell well."
@Andy-GTI he deserves that and more!
I'm 29 and I think I'm gonna buy some! Gotta start somewhere :^)
"I dont have money for it, but I would absolutely love it. Maybe even have boxes where you make things that are not only fun but also useful"
"I would definitely buy it! I'm retired military I need something to fill up my days with other than landscaping and crocheting...oh and drinking beer, lol"
@Andy-GTI doesn't surprise me. He is very smart about when he uploads his videos and what he makes them about.
Omg this is so cool place
"if I were to ask mark to build something, I would ask him to make a robot that sponsors my channel."
This is literally my dream. I wish I could live there. Great work!
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
The kit is not able to ship to India :(
Mark seems to amaze me everytime
"so very impressive, great ideas and that warehouse, wow. loved every minute"
:0000 the PvZ rooftop music is awesomee
"The thief trying to break in to crunch labs after watching Mark Rober's video:
😮😲🌚"
"Was that the Zelda ""reveal"" sound at 6:51?"
Mark rober is coollllllll
Crunch labs reminds me of Entertainment seven twenty from parks & recreation🤔
This reminds me of Imagination Movers
I’m going to school to be a luthier and my dream is having a big guitar shop with fun stuff like this
Εγο δεν πόρο να έρθο γιατί ειμαι α πο την ελλαδααα 😡 κεαν δοκιμασο να τα παρακιλο αφτοσ που θα τα φέρι θα χαθι 😡
do the build boxes ship internationally or are they only available in the US?
You don't realise somebody moved foam pit -💀
AMAZING!!!!!!!
Gives me Dexter's laboratory vibes...
This is why we love Mark
Mark has an Xbox Series X on display. Mark is the goat.
"Too bad you're MRNA vaccinated,, you were smart and had a lot of potential."
Thats nice but i think i heard PvZ music
My crowbar I been doing Mark Rover I’ve been doing ultimate frisbee for
Future Sheldon Cooper type engineers will watch Mr. Rober
"Hey Mark, for your Make-Over I would make sure there is no light coming out through a gap under the secret entrance."
Need to cover the light coming from under the secret lab door:)
Cool.
I am so afraid of fome cube pits because I got stuck in one when I was little.
Hey Mark. Can we PLEASE be friends?! :-O
"Really not fan of the idea of crunch since I worked in video games, but amazing workshop! Love the secret passages and the box might get a lot of children in engineering, I wish I had that!"
You need a lot of work on your superhero landing.
I have never watched a 17 minutes commercial before. Cool stuff!
Crunch labs
This dude is like 4 videos away from becoming ironman
this reminds me of Dexters secret laboratory
Might be worth adding a roll of cloth or a brush underneath that bookcase to stop light from leaking under it.
Stop because I hope I dream of being in your secret office!!
What I would do to be Mark Rober’s nephew
THIS LITTERALLY EVERYTHING A CHILD WOULD WANT
"Okay Mr. Davenport, nice lab"
No 2 on trending sheeeeeeeesh
8:21 this is  me
the only sucky thing is that it can cost a lot of money
him:the most abmitious thing i've ever done :Me expecting him to show a nuke
"This reminds me of a much smarter version of ""Toys"" with Tom Hanks."
This is so cool!!!
did you got to school at M.I.T
Me before a fight with my mom 0:42
That’s awesome
"Ok, listen, there are some people who are lucky…like if there is EVER a case where I can become one of Mark Robers nephews than by all means, sign me up. And then there are the unlucky people…watermelon"
"You and the ""Stuff Made Here"" guy need to get together"
This is some Micheal Jackson type shiii
Mark the only youtuber you love watching sponcer discribtion of
I wanna come to your place and help I love your vids since I was 6
Me to I really want to make a lab
what is 1
So... Freaking.... COOL!!!!
I also really like your crunch lab’s  boxes
give mrbeast 100m subscribers
I really want to be a engineer like you and hope to build amazing things like you
I am disappointed there isn’t a single breaking bad reference in an underground lab
Thats a nice hint
And I want to craft stuff
I will be 12 in 10 days
That lad is so cool
👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥
So fantasy factory…
you should give us an update about miss fat Guss
That lab is so cool!! Your creations and designs take engineering to another level!!
Mark's raising the bar for himself wth every video! In a few years we might see a rocket that goes to the moon or something!!
have you heard of mesa (math enginering science art)
This I’ve been waiting for my son is very bright he’s 6 but I struggle to challenge him thanks for making a Box we can trust!
Hey I am an engineer well... Not classified but I do make a lot of paper/cardboard crafts to help me for example 'my helpful finger' which is some origami folds and I put it between my fingers then when my fingers go close to each other the origami clips and it can pick up 1.5kg

By the way where did you get the couch
Playhouse
THE CHOPSTICKS REMIX OF THE OG MARK ROBER MUSIC WAS SUCH A SMALL BUT NICE ADDITION
I respect the PvZ music starting at 6:20
This my dream play house. Mark you are living my dream!
"life well lived.

stay in school, kids. This is THE dream."
How do you sign up for crunch lab
Where did you get the horn for your bike? George

Did anyone else see mkbhd
😎
I'm just interested in the accessibility like having a lift that goes up to the higher level etc.
This. is. so. cool. Mark Rober is amazing!!!
Bros doing red stone irl
Zach King has competition
Do you ship to India 🇮🇳
Bro how much did that cost
"i've seen other things in the past where they send out a box with build activities in them but you just know, without a doubt that this new CrunchLabs thing done by Mr Rober himself is going to be setting the new gold standard. How many of those other things are run by former NASA engineers? I hope CrunchLabs is as successfull as i think it is going to be"
"People with asian parents... yeah, we don't get da boxes :')"
failing is not bad failing is you finding a way that does not work
"Whoever's reading this, I pray that whatever
your going through gets better and
whatever your struggling with or worrying
about is going to be fine and that everyone

Please be our leader🍀
U are amazing I love your videos
POV: you want to be a engineer but you have strict parents or you don't have anything that you can use to start engineering and can't get anything like that yet.
Spreading the love for science is an important career that I respect.
Just like the entrances to the Bat Cave!
This is cool
Hum I don't know how to say this.  You know id like to really meet you.  Not because I am a famous scientist or a chemical engineer 😉.   But cause I'm Autistic.   Im high functioning and I have a bachelor in Programming and a masters in Databases and networking.  I have achieved a lot being on the spectrum.  I would love to meet you. Would also give you hope with your son who is Autistic.  Let's say a glimpse into the future.    That is something that would make me happy if I could get that chance I know not many people get to meet you.
Newest vid running out of stuff to watch love the vids
keep up the amazing work mark
What casters are on that shipping container?
I’d love to have the mind of Mark Rober.
I think that place is where dom set the dominos
This is my life long dream. So epic
Be careful with that container. There should be some big foamy side guards to keep people from accidentally landing on the edge or falling off.
I got it hope it’s worth it!
Mark Rober is the new Bill Nye. You two should do a collab
"Admit it, you just scanned the video qr code and found the crunch labs youtube channel. Admit it."
"So, does the box with a dart hole hold the platinum ticket? 🤫"
"6:26 you can see the light coming from underneath the bookshelf, i think anyone who notices is gunna get suspicious lmao"
You built Dude Perfect Headquarters 2.0
Reminds me of Fring’s meth lab from Breaking Bad!
"OMG, we are sooooo excited about this! I am one of those parents who asked you to do something for kids. Thank you Mark!"
"6:26

mark: this is how we keep it super secret 
The light under the shelf:"
I got a feeling it it is not a secret anymore...
This is so cool
107 videos and 22 million subscribers! Bro let me see your blueprint please!
"Do whatever makes you happy, not what other people want from you. For me, I'm gonna wake up tomorrow morning, get hit the gym, and cherish life for the amazing blessing that it is. I hope you do the same and have an amazing day as well!"
mark rober teaches me things school never could
YES
do you like rubix cubes
I’m a genius I just screenshoted the QR code and got the video
Me watching his vids and forgetting that he worked for NASA as a bona fide engineer
"Mark Rober makes videos every now and then, and even though they aren't weekly or daily or anything, they're super cool and fun to watch after they do come out.  Thank you, Mark, for being a great youtuber, and person."
"I got an idea, ur next team something should be teams BEES (to idk make something to help bees and show that they don’t all sting like some in Australia)"
Where is crunch labs
"8:18
Always sad when parents aren’t sure of their children’s age.
You’re a saint Mark."
You are a saint for making this lol
You deserve the world my friend
<3
Well done....LOL
Lol
you probably could legit tighten up that fireman piston design and sell it to fire departments
are u there
mark?
hi mark
"This is awesome =) and just so you lol. =) Thank you for inspiring so many to want to ""be like you"" its a fantastic thing! Loved the lab favorite part was your 15:49 retreat lmao Nitro was one of my favorites too!"
ants in 2d on 3d world
Go off Mark!
#6 is a fire code violation
did i clip in another reality or this is actually happening
where was all this back in the 90's?!
How come Mark is friends with the coolest of people
And Hind a sign sed 8 and also go the place have many trees
I love that little zelda chime! (that one that plays when you solve a puzzle)
Hi mark I’ve Ben watching you’re vids for 3 years and no doubt you’re the coolest person I’ve  ever seen love the warehouse (jealous)😀
I like vid cause Gus

Bro I wish I could come to the where house
Mark Rober is the embodiment of the principle that growing up is optional.  I love it!
I’m a huge fan and I would LOVE to see your Willy Wonka Factory but I live in Australia :(
You should give Mr. Beast a call so that he could do something like this
@6:19 Or Look down at the floor and see lights coming from the wall unit. You can found it.
Hey mark I know you probably won’t see this but is there any way you can make a kids helicopter that only flys a little above ground I would tell my mom to buy me that like for all ages cause I’m sure a lot of people from any age would want to try
How do we tell you we found the ticket??
The kid: what in the what are molecules
3:26 chopsticks ❤️💋😊🥰
I smiled throughout this whole video.  You are awesome!!
guess what it's not Secret anymore
:)
When I see that I feel like the freaking 1980s freaking Batman TV show oh to the bat pole
*Mark slowly becoming more and more childish by the minute*
"The boxes are amazing as is everything you do! Love your enthusiasm for learning, discovering and teaching. You will continue to do great things!"
🤗
i hope thats drywall
This guy should make his own theme park and school Disney how it’s done.
Does anyone else realize we already saw this in the dominoes video
I won the science fair contest because of your videos :)
I wished I grew up with mark rober videos
"I saw the garage door in one of the shots; you have another way in, you cad! ;P

Also, if Psychonauts 2 taught me anything, it's that the giant tooth decay poster is to be burned to reveal the secret passage behind it."
I don't have the money
Iv never seen a islander kid on any white persons yt before
"i never knew plants vs zombies music would fit in your videos, now i know"

"the only problem with the secret doorway is there is light comming under the door, should be easy to fix:D"
Yep.. so secret it has windows to outside....
Omg congrats on #45 on trending!!
so it's kiwiko but different?
I don't see how it's different... my guess is he may have partnered with them...
best youtuber in the world
Amazing!
Love the Legend of Zelda music when secret door is opened. Very cool.
You might be smart but I bet you can’t beat me in a airsoft match
Willy Wonka has been making a comeback these days...
"It's videos like this one when you realize it's sad you can only give 1 single like for a video instead of giving it a rating like 100/100, or in this case 1000/100"
Best mark rober vid ever
im a bit sad because i dont have a card or anyone to buy it for me and my birthday is in a few months and you probably wouldnt be giving out signatures. I can just hope you answer my question on if you will still be giving out signatures after idk when it ends or something.
"mark, i love you, but you litterally stole an idea from one of your past sponcors lmao"
keep doing what your doingsike sucker
mark.... hire me
Mark did what we all wanted to do as kid and make a real-life Dexter's Lab.
Where?
cool
"""I got this huge secret place, and nobody knows how to get in! Let me show you how!"" Thanks! Coming over soon!"
Did Mark buy the Fantasy Factory?? 😝
Light seeps through under the bookcase

"Ok not to be that guy, but a giant foam pit on wheels is just asking for trouble, picture, mark Rober says watch this, dives off the balcony onto the concrete because the intern though he'd clean up and move the foam pit back to it's home, wherever that was, lol, I mean I'd do it, both sides"
you can see light coming from under the book shelf
bro is a pig💀
Looks freaking awesome. Gotta watch out for that under-bookshelf-light tho
9:51 World war one flashbacks
that is so awesome!
"I typed in Mark Rober in the YouTube search bar and the first result was Mark Rober scammer, so that's a thing, bit of unforseen consequences, lol I hope people don't get the wrong idea"
"It’s not that secret anymore 
And the door has light behind it so u could tell there something behind the bookshelf"
the legend is back
"I feel like Mark Rober is the enginerring Dad of the internet and I'm sure we can all agree, we couldn't be happier. You can just tell how happy he is to share his knowledge with the world. So keen to see what comes next!"
"I love the crunch lab idea. I took the Monthly mark sober class while yes it was educational it didn't really help me with building my build. I relied on youtube videos a lot, plus I did not realize how much money I would spend on supplies plus the class itself. (I did finish my build and it was awesome, a Oreo crossbow. I like how crunch comes with the materials to help build the invention while mark rover describes the science behind it, helping us learn how to become better engineers. Its also a lot cheaper. That was a great idea mark"
"Muito legal! Sou Brasileira e gosto muitos desses vídeos!🇧🇷
Parabéns Mark Rober!"
This is the way the internet was meant to be...
Hes living the life
He takes no stairs down only a vacuum tube rope drop
Mark you are the best
Please
Mark make more videos
14:48 Don’t wanna eat your watermelon then Mark Rober Got your back

He has a mansion for a warehouse. Awesome.
Cool
How can you NOT love Mark 🐐
Great place -- but a feminist toilet is not cool.
Wow a bookshelf just like anne frank
This video turned into a jackass episode
"almost seems like, after you enter the secret door, you end up in a portal test room :D"
Wow that’s a cool secret …….. not any more
"**”Secret Bookshelf” has a suspicious natural light coming from under it.**

Mark: No one suspects anything 😮‍💨"
"Yup, i did. Was looking for this comment"
its not a secret if you tell everyone.
Being a grown adult and orders a crunch lab box for myself 😅😅
"i have an idea for your next video

Tungsten melting point of 3422 degrees
Make the tungsten into a thin coil that is 10 feet long 5 feet wide
Rhenium has a melting point of 3180 Degrees
Make tungsten cylinder big enough to fit the coil in
Compress coil to 2 feet long 
Put rhenium in tungsten cylinder with tungsten coil in it and heat up to 3000 degrees
Aim it at metal and release coil"
Can I buy this even though I'm not kid?
PVZ theme in background
Mark is the best human there is
This is so cool dude. Well done!
Coolest YouTuber ever. Period.
Love the lab
Bro why crunchlabs got 40k when it’s his 2nd channel while he has 20 mil +
so cool !
Love Marques!
"Great idea on the box kit, so having 4 kids do I need to order 4 separately or do you have a family pack? Most box designs are ment for one kid so without spending a fortune on 4 kids make a family box please."
you built everyones dream hideout! your so cool!
I am so glad you made Crunch Labs because I want to be an engineer like you and now I have a chance to try making my own things!
That looks like official hevan
0:42 that smoke is concerning
Can it find my dad
Mark do you have a course for more grown children.... That maybe already understand al these stuff but want to learn more
Mark I want to be like you and your my hero so I wish could be in one of your videos your awesome I’m 10 🤟🏽😁😁😔😔😔
And he will make a few bucks too.

The intro was just nilegreen lol
I never knew a big advertisement could be so entertaining

whats the song chopsticks did
So this is basically like Willy Wonka so you have to get a ticket and if you get that ticket you get to go there
you are a legend
The Build Box is a phenomenal idea!! You sir are an engineering saint.
You are a real MacGyver 😜
Don't forget to drink your Ovaltine

You started your first video on the day I was born
what state do you live in?
this is such an amazing video. it’s so inspiring to see you do your work and i’m definitely picking up a box online! awesome place!
Mark I am Gobsmacked by the depth and breadth of your imagination.  Thanks for keeping us ALL young!
“No one will ever find” - no one: why is this one tiny office the size of a warehouse from the outside?
I wish mark was my uncle.
"I feel like if he wanted to, mark rober could take over the world"

Legend
Lol😇👍💕

Cool
"""Hm, this office looked much bigger on the outside"""
why don't you make in your next project a prosthetic for disabled men and women that are comfortable for them to wear.
what if I get the platinum tickrt but I live in a diffrarebt country?
I’ve all ways wanted to work with you as a 10 yr engineer
I was wearing a Mark Rober hoodie while watching this ;-;
I feel like Mark is like one of those characters in a movie or story no one hates cuz he always does such wholesome things!
Awesome job Mark!  You deserve this.  Kudos.
"I think this is one of the best videos you have ever made! I genuinely enjoyed every second. My mind was officially blown. I love all of your videos, but this one reached a new level for me."
I wanna be like mark rober when i grow up
Phat Gus Phan Club
wow
"@markrober I want to cement my place as the greatest roommate of all time, so what would it take for you to have my engineering major roommate and I to go to your super cool new lab?"
for a make a wish would you guys take someone there. I'm currently recovering from aplastic anemia I got a bone marrow transplant and I get a make a wish and I was wondering if I could possibly go there.
you should go to the uk and land at hethro
Awesome!!!!
sweet
How to find:number 1 go to san Mateo County . Number 2 go to every single dentist in the city
And just like that. Marks net worth went through the roof
The plant vs zombies music is a banger
@Mark Rober
you should design a solid state battery
You ship to the Philippines??
Nvm you don't :(
The hero we have always needed. You have reached legend status
Oh no the manchild has a mancave now..
When I grow up I would love to not grow up like you!! Oh wait... That already happened... Long... Long... Time... Ago.........
HEY!
This lab is like the coolest thing i`v ever seen.
"Looks like Mark essentially built himself the playground he always wanted to have when he was a kid. ;-)

Which is fine by me - because there is nothing wrong with making your childhood dreams come true. :-)"
Underneath the bookshelf u can see light so… not that secert
"So, for not triggering the ""not washed hands"" alarm... I just don't flush?"
It makes me really happy that he kept the iconic workbench and also most of the previous projects or the spirit of them :D
Wonderful project of getting kids to learn creatively and practically.
i can see the light under the bookcase
"Congrats dude :) Love the new ""office"""
At first I thought
<3
"Oh well, goodbye KewiCo"
Will it be available in India ?
I wish I could buy the boxes but I don't have any money sadly :/
"for the sink thing, you should make it so it only open when the sink is turned on for 20 seconds and make sure that everyone has nice and clean hands"

This is the best video
Yay you put Mrwhoestheboss

We love your videos I have 4 boys between 12 and 5 do you think they could work together on these projects or are they more one on one geared?
"Dude, there is light coming from under the bookshelf"
Very Kool I want this!!
Imagine the people that find this in a hundred years
you could just line the top of the pole with hand chalk.

What if my parants are spanish
"My son loves you. I wanted to buy three boxes for him for the summer, but that option isn't available yet. :( I don't want a whole year because it will just get pile up through the schoolwork months. Hoping that option becomes available before this summer is over. If not, maybe next summer. Still, these are awesome and perfect for my son. Thank you."
"Wow I guess it really pays off doing you tube vids, it’s unbelievable how many young kids and guys are millionaires doing this stuff, while I live paycheck to paycheck, impressive!"
Mark is doing stuff that everyone wished they'll be doing after completing engineering.
@Andy-GTI that's great for him
"Did you know, he makes $70,303 from one video?"
College the best way to stifle any creativity you once had. Best innovators aren't followers
@Swapnil Thorat indeed. You don't need an engineerings degree to make awesome stuff.
@Ironymus he is engineer without getting any such degree
I am 21 and I want to do this
I realy like those ideas but sad thing that i live in a Third World countries
اقوم بنشر محتوي تحفيزي ويسعدني جدا أنضمامك لقناتي  ومعرفة رائيك ❤️❤️❤️

Mark is both living his dream and making the world a better place. Awesome!
Joder cómo te quiero Mark
watrmelometer....clasic american
i really want to do it but i am in austria
We can see the light under the door 🤣
Kudos on priming the kids' minds with all things engineering...
why is there no shipping to India 😔
Every time mark rober makes a video he becomes closer to be real life batman
It’s no longer a secret lol 😂
Mark Rober I really want to get that super ticket because I like you a lot I’m your biggest fan
Toilet seat is gunna be a lawsuit if anyone has a medical emergency with the lid up
"Mark, where is CrunchLabs in Mountain View, California exactly?"
"Fritzl did also have a secret door, but he didnt brag about it 😆"
Is crunch labs deliver world wide (over seas)
That lab is so cool!! Your creations and designs take engineering to another level!!
Congrats on insta millionaire... brilliant idea and perfect implementation
Mark  I want to buy but kent buy it...
"I really want to see a Mark Rober and Stuff Made Here crossover, would be so epic"
Mark the greatest to ever do it he never disappointed
Love it
How do you get your signature
That is so cool I am such a fan of you!!!!!!!!
Loving the Premier Ultimate League jersey that MKBHD is wearing! Go Austin Torch!
Did you just repurpose the fantasy factory?
Is shipping to Mexico coming soon? 🥺
Why u can not win in EU
You are amazing!!! 🤩
3:36 WHERE DO I GET A CHAIR +⁉️ I NEED ONE IN MY LIFE‼️
The piano is playing song 'Dansez' BTW..😁
I think it would work better to use electromagnetism/Eddy currents to do the soft landing.
This is sooooo amazing
Darn no canadians
please enable shipping to brazil
Real-life Dexter's Laboratory 🤓
you sir and your team are a blessing to all the new Engineers of the future!  So much fun and keep up the great work!
why is it that i come on your channel after 4 months of not watching it and i see you building my childhood dream on a wednesday. like what is going on
"Wow I wish I could afford this build box for my youngest kid. That looks so awesome. Kids with adhd, autism etc would love to have stuff like this to do. Problem solving engineering etc."
wow this is amazing
I saw mrwhosetheboss
no point in buying it if the coolest reason isnt applicable to 80% of the world's population lol
That hand washing sensor should be in every restaurant.
This is the guy that makes life on mars
"But what if someone wants a Diet Coke?

You know, it's never come up!"
6:20 The light coming through under the bookshelf might be a bit suspicious though.
Mark's becoming Willy Wonka but less intimidating
It’s like a super villian lair
The light coming from underneath the bookcase is a dead giveaway 😄
Mark rober has perfected the art of demonstrating actually interesting engineering in a way that's fun and engaging without boring people with too much science... Just enough to give people a taste and seek out more on their own
I love ur vids but do they ship to au?
So... You're Batman
Team up with the hack smith and you can become an actual super hero
If I had this warehouse no one would ever see me again
"Wow-
*I sadly can't get it TvT*"
Hi i am on my moms account but i love your channel i dont think i would be great at engineering i love it but yeah thnx for being awsome
Mark how did you this?
Very nice lab warehouse…the ultimate work and play ground..
What is the average time to complete the full hotwheels track?
"I think if Mark had been around when I was a little kid, I'd be in some engineering field"
We love your videos
you and Colin Furze need to do an epic project together.
"i feel like there needs to be some kind of sign that pops up or something to show if the container i there or not. because if you assume its there and you dive, and its not there... well that could be bad"
I’m an adult but the kid in me wants to win and come see the lab lol :)
5:41 those were wise words from both the flash and Mark
This guy is so cool he makes dude perfect look like a slug
Hello!
Well you need to transplant your wall/ door of stickers!!!!
Can I please have the bike?
The fact that my school is teaching engineering is awsome
ahh yes A HINT
"this guy is absolutely CRAZY! i love it. 

What would i give tohave a warehouse like that myself :D id be satisfied with that firehouse up and down thing, and that foam pit! youd not see me for like a week :D"
Can you make a video about rubik's cubes because I've been trying to solve one but I can't
I sure do hope mark doesn’t team up with mr beast and both become supervillains
"Mark Rober,

You should build your own hot wheel as an added bonus for your track. (If you want it as a challenge, try making it so that it maintains its speed for a longer time than the best hot wheels car out there.)

Also, I am a huge fan of your videos. Can't wait for the next one."
im 28 and i just got this! incredible idea!
🤐💯
Algorithm
"grear idea to make the entrance in the diet coke button, as nobody will ever find out anyways"
mf literally built a secret panic room
"Wot if mark put his talents towards building something actually useful? Mars rovers don't really count, either."
"One question, what happens if you forget to close the toilet and close the door, how do you come inside the toilet?"
MTV Presents Mark Rober's Fantasy Factory.  Up Next: Mark and Big.
This is probably the best building ever for my opinion.
"I wanna see Destin get a tour here, with a camera mounted to show his first facial reactions all the way. I bet he would beat Mark on the boy-joy scale!!!"
Dexter laboratory whithout didi :D
Okay ! This is cool :D
"the bell let me down, so I'm two days late"
I want to be an engineer honestly and this guy makes me wanna be more of an engineer
Anyone else concerned that having the entrance triggered by Diet Pepsi is just inviting a Rudy Invasion?
Did you know that my school uses your videos in science sometimes
i would love something like this
COOLEST PLACE IVE EVER SEEN
Dang this guy is likable.
Now everyone want just touch the faucet with out washing hands.
"Mark you have always been my role model and I have watched you for years. All I wanted to say was, thanks for inspiring me for years"
"I would absolutely LOVE to do this, but I just don’t have the money for it. But I still want to try and make all the stuff. So I’m wondering if all the video’s that explain how to build it and the science behind it are going to be on the crunch labs channel?"
i dont flush so dw
Wow just wow
Videos are always so insane
11:10 FRONT TOWARD ENEMY
Dexter's Lab. I'm waiting to see Dee Dee in a future episode.
"I always wanna do CSS but whenever I see mark rober videos it makes me think of doing engineering and make a new motto that ''best thing about being a engineer is that if there is a thing that does not exist and you want it to, you can make it exist ''but then I have to stop because I an in 10th grade only  ಥ_ಥ"
"Yesss, love that you get to just have Marques over for frisbee"
Tony Mark
"I'm convinced this guy is a genius, like ACTUAL genius"
there is light under the shelf that leads to the secret warehouse revealing something . other than that it is awesome
this is the biggest men cave in the world :D
He really is a mad scientist now huh?
Did he make a claymore? Because it looks like one but made of wood lol
"I mean, I've imagined having a secret little gaming room in my house but this really takes the cake"
Wow 👌
"You Sir ABSOLUTELY ROCK!!!!
THANK YOU!  THANK YOU! THANK YOU!  Blessed Be 🌟"
A secret isnt a secret if you make video of it and post it on youtube.
"secret warehouse 
9 million people : interesting..."
"The only problem is that you can see under the ""secret entrance"" the light coming frominside of it."
Is this the birth of a new startup.... showing off his corporate office itself is bringing him the money.  All the best Mark Rober.
8:10 Moichandizing!
Its like mark rober got fused with the essence of mr beast :o
Mark is the goat engineer
you ever heard about charlie's chocolate factory? 👎👎👎
cool👍👍👍👍👍
@mark can u make a volley ball robot
"That was the coolest video of your chanel in my opinion,and I watched every video"
10:32 that's rhym
"Oly someone like Mark Rober can make this, this is amazing!!!"
Mark I really want to make robots with you please come to pakistan so I can make them with you
"Only I lived somewhere close...
At least, now I have the motivation for studying hard and going to my dream university in the US I guess."
What if someone just wanted a Diet Pepsi though
Lest be honest:who hasnt dreamed about making this

This is what happens when you gain too much money!
Is crunch lab available in Ireland
My Disneyland! So cool.
I love how he is so passionate about what he does in this era. 90-95% of people don't have the passion and they are not enjoying what they do kudos to Mark for being such an amazing person
Bot
"Mark: He he you'll never find my secret room
Bright white light under the bookcase: 👀"
"This guy is too cool, he must be stopped. Keep up the work!"
Imagine just wanting a diet pepsi then a whole motherfucking secret passageway opens up
"Mark, I saw that back door. I will be careful to look for doors in extremely huge warehouses. I will find Crunch Labs someday.





P.S. lol"
Took the engineering course in inspiration of this channel
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
"""A secret lab the average person that will never find!""

*posts the lab in youtube lmao*"
yes i remembee that shkw and i remember Nitro!!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
"I feel like Mark Rober is the enginerring Dad of the internet and I'm sure we can all agree, we couldn't be happier. You can just tell how happy he is to share his knowledge with the world. So keen to see what comes next!"
"Remember guys, always touch the tap after going to the toilet!"
"Totally AMAZING.
Teachers really need to take advantage of how this would motivate kids into science. It's gonna be huge."
imagine mark rober with elon musk money
you delivery to germany
Didn't know MKBHD is a Frisbee player.
"My son’s going to be so happy when he gets the first box. 
I think he’ll pass out if there’s a platinum ticket inside. 
Thanks so much Mark, this is exactly what your audience wanted and you freaking delivered!!"
mark rober shud build tunnel under his house like gus fring
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
This is the coolest thing ever
Cannabis grow room?.... Ugh just a ping pong no bong 🔫
Thank you for just being you and making the world a better place. Your warmth comes across in every video.
"nerf gun wall, secret passageways, giant foam pit... this lab is E P I C. well done!"
I heard that Zelda reference
This is deliciously awesome! :) Thanks Mark for showing us your ingenuity!
I love how he is so passionate about what he does in this era. 90-95% of people don't have the passion and they are not enjoying what they do kudos to Mark for being such an amazing person
"hey Mark I love robotics, i just wanted to know which kind of arduino board do you usally use"
Amazing. Truly amazing
I love how he is so passionate about what he does in this era. 90-95% of people don't have the passion and they are not enjoying what they do kudos to Mark for being such an amazing person
Cool you got Marques with the catch!
"My son’s going to be so happy when he gets the first box.

Thanks so much Mark, this is exactly what your audience wanted and you freaking delivered!!"
Dude I would have LOVED those crunch boxes when I was a kid
Amazing vids I bet lots of people will love it
You’re telling me you didn’t collab with Mumbo Jumbo?
Absolutely genius! This is by far the best program invented in a long time. This is no doubt going to be huge and the world will be a better place because of it.
"Wow, this is a next level revolution on teaching Engineering. I hope to see more Engineering covered. Kudos"
This is the coolest thing ever
Are you doing the virtual camp this summer?
Is it available worldwide or just america
despite being around 15 I would still do these to do them and get the chance to meet you and ask questions as well as do the projects along the way. Pretty soon I am visiting a university with my brother to see about mechanical engineering courses and it would be great to meet somebody as energetic and creative as you.
This is the coolest thing ever
"6:19 ""how we actually keep the lab super secret"" steps over to bookshelf,light coming out underneath the bookshelf...."
"Mark, as a golfer looking to turn into a instructor professionally, you hit the nail on the head. By having an engineer mind, someone can utilize that skill to find their best way around any course around the world while enjoying every moment! Thank you for what you do!"
"That's so amazing. Wish you the best with these boxes. Now I just want you to make a box for grown ups that's a bit more difficult. Like building a robot vacuum, a GPS, a pair of bluetooth headphones, a doorcam or a drone or something like that."
"i just wanted to say that these build boxes are seriously really cool. i’m not part of the target demographic anymore, but when i was young, having an ongoing source of easy, manageable engineering projects like those would’ve very probably sparked a real passion in me. the child in me got super excited hearing about it all."
Wow 🤩
"7:19 mark says he showed 20M people..
Rest 2M people be like :🥲👍"
The video only has 11m views rn
US Residents only :(
"I really love this, a playground for those who have always stayed a child deep inside xD As programmer I know how awesome it feels to finally make something work, especially if its many little pieces fitting perfectly together in the end to become something big and awesome! I bet with that creativity and passion for what you are doing and teaching you will inspire a whole generation =) 
Stay awesome, and never grow up! xD"
"My Daddy owns a peanut factory and he's going to get me a platinum ticket as I want one, I want one now."
If you show it to us then it’s not secret any more;A;
So... having fun is your job. Cool.
"I feel like Mark Rober is the enginerring Dad of the internet and I'm sure we can all agree, we couldn't be happier. You can just tell how happy he is to share his knowledge with the world. So keen to see what comes next!"
I love your lifting rope ; jump off rope
MARQUES!!! My absolute favorite cameo :)) best part for me
"I feel like Mark Rober is the enginerring Dad of the internet and I'm sure we can all agree, we couldn't be happier. You can just tell how happy he is to share his knowledge with the world. So keen to see what comes next!"
"Your videos bring me so much happiness, every time I see your video pop up I click it without hesitation, absolutely love your work Mark! Thank you so much for your efforts and love the work shop and the audio ❤️"

Kewl
Absolutely incredible
"It's hard to be jealous of a guy that just seems so genuine and wears his love of his career on his sleeve, he's clearly put his all into being as successful as he is. And the fact that he really tries to inspire kids to get into engineering and not see failure as a negative is just the cherry on top."
Soooooo many bots
“ motivate “ anyone who isn’t working hard
"I need to know... Please tell me if I can get it in europe, if not please make it available."
That foam pit's all fun and games until someone doesn't realize it's moved
You can make a centrifugal break for the fireman rope. It can be made pocket size
After 20 years the world is full of great engineers groomed by Mark Rober. This will help kids at the early age to become creative and innovative. You and MrBeast are setting high standards for an influencer. Great job!
"DUDE...obviously this is all fun and cool but......NITRO FROM AMERICAN GLADIATORS?! Im guessing you and are very much the same age or extremely close in age (40) and American Gladiators was such a huge deal to me that I would end up trading an absurd amount of chore work for a little kid in exchange for being able to stay up and watch.

American Gladiators and Nitro are effing LEGEND"
NASA trying to cancel this because they getting job applications from 9yr olds.
Do you also have a camera in your washroom?🤷
If I was to get a platenium ticket would it say when to come?
But i live in croatia
Mark Rober is a genius who uses his great mind for nice safe things. Image what would happen he started making weapons. That would be scary.
bro he said he let 20 million people see the secret entrance but there are only 8 million views :/
You gave firefighters a great idea to get rid of the pole.
i just realised you can 3d print 90% of the things that you would pay 30$ for but it only costs 3 in resin.
Critical thinking makes you a better human.
I want one lol
"Whenever you gi to the lab on video you better say ""to the crunch lab""in a voice reminiscent of batman"
What engineer are you?
I as the caption and immediately thought Gravity Falls
I’m jealous now
I know Mark has never used that work bench because it has a 10mm
Mark Rober's Fantasy Factory.
"oh no mark just did a thing , now everyone is checking things regardles where . we gonna see some people pressing buttons in hospitals XD"
Signing up to do with my nephews. Happy to support you. I wish we had products like this when we were young. We had discovery toys and little electronic kits down at radio shack and that was really it. Excited to do them with them though!
I NEED to see the camera on the green hot wheel
Amazing
Where is squirrel maze 3.0?
Why are you so awesome? What’s the matter with you? You remind me of a “Law Abiding Citizen”.
A genius at both engineering and marketing! Love it!
Can you buy that in Italy?
Engineering is for kids that are autistic or kids that loveeee learning the process 👍
I feel like engineers are just socially awkward kids 🤣
"Mark: has a secret doorway from the movies

The light from under the bookshelf: ""I'm about to end this man's whole career"""
"Great, glade i wasn't the only one to notice LMAO"
@Aniceto Moreno Jr honestly lmao
And the scratch marks from the contact points at the bottom of the eagle statue
Reminds me of a Minecraft house
Mark Rober truly helping make the world a better place
Do a cohete
i sooooo baaadddly want that bike haha
"You inspire me so much!! You’ll probably never see this comment but thank you for being you.  you know, for being freakin awesome"
i love your videos i want to be an engineer when i grow up and change the world i have an idea for a robot that cleans table because i hate having to clean it so my idea is to have like window wiper the ones on cars but spinning in a circle suctioned on the table and bags on the outside to catch the food
GTA online really be like
I want one
"mark- i don’t know if you will ever read this comment, or ever know who i am, but at one of the million people who have watched you, i just want to say thank you for everything and i’m proud of you. you’ve made it and only trying to bring joy to others. that’s real. ❤️"
Amazing!!
somehow this is my first time really seeing one of your videos just started as an engineer recently after finishing school would definitely love a warehouse like this one day
Mark is really the Bill Nye of this generation
legit
"Apart from the glaring light coming from under the cabinet it would be secret. heh, amature. Mark Rober 0:1 Dede"
Next level uncle
yo who is MrPeast
A foam pit you enter by jumping off the second story balcony that sometimes isn't there — what could possibly go wrong? 😅
"""Why don't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?"" -Spies Like Us"
The warehouse isn't too secret as at 6:26 you can see light under the book shelf.
mark rober
"Honestly, this is probably one of my top 3 of my favorite videos I really love it, thanks for making it."
0/10 it wasn't a s*x dungeon
"I love it, can't wait to get my daughter involved"
"Mark that is super, super impressive !!!!!!!!"
mark i love it how you describe it as a will wonka engineering lab you're a amazing and so smart your a true G.O.A.T
"Dude, make it for ADULT please!!! It's really cool, I'm as an adult feels like a child again hahahahaha🤣"
Top notch!  Keep it up!
Looks a lot like the Fantasy Factory 🤔
mystery shack
hey Mark I was wondering if I should go into engineering for college
It's bigger than my whole house
I dare you to play scrap mechanic
I wish you had another channel that really shows you designing and constructing and all the mathematics. I’m in college for engineering and I would be so fascinated to see another engineer I look up to do what I am learning in class
Almost like a advanced master class for college kids
On the sides of the entrance you should have put a fish tank
"MARK If i ever had a child someday, I would definitely get this... for myself and ofcourse for my son/daughter HAHAHAHA"
I love how he talks about things i have no CLUE ABOUT
The fireman did what in what??!
you have inspired me to want to be a engineer
What is this gravity falls.
evrybody. needs. to. be. like. you.
Throwback to when Mark was at 3 mill
Nice video
oof i can see a light down the library . revealing the entrence ... but still i would have loved to been there lol
is it just me or the light on the bottom of the bookshelf gives it away
Omg Who else is excited for Nitro 😀
Dangggg tony stark irl
Nitro !
"Ferb, I know what we’re gonna do today!"
Glitterboom but with mustardgas
you are amazing
Imma cry-- this place is so AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWESOMMMMMMMMMMMME!!!!!1
Or both
d8d you copy  mr beast and his winly wonka stuff aka you jump on the band wagon
This dude is YELLING
Bro people like mark rober and mr beast are proof that not everyone is here just for the money and that there are still people who care for this planet and everything on it. And it makes me so happy to see them create cool things and start charities to help people and bring entertainment at the same time.
its just so cool to think marks literally changing peoples future with stuff like this. it might not be a lot of people but im sure there will be kids that get so inspired from doing these that theyll end up doing something big with it.
Mark rober I really seem interested but I live across the country all way in Delaware and I want to be part of it so what am I supposed to do?
I'm 37 and I want to go to the crunch lab. Great job recreating the best parts of childhood under one roof!
I admire you with everything in me I love engineering!
People who actually wanted diet pepsi 😐6:48
can you make a video where you glue magnets to the ground and un scrue the wheels on a skate board and glue magnets to the bottom of  the skate board
Me just watching and then hearing fire pvz (plants vs zombies) music playing 6:19
and the fat gus
I've counted -seven- nine OSHA violations.
Make a maze for Chipmunks 3.0
i want that bike
Genius!!!
Wow crunchlabs is really going to help little kids who aspire to build
Should I be a regular engineer or a robotics engineer?
I would like to take a real shot on the ping pong cannon
Ur amazing
collab with @Stuff Made Here
Your getting closer to nile green in every video
Mark inspired me to be an engineer 😀
came for lightsaber ended with warehouse
"Mark Rober Is An Example of ""follow You're Dreams"" Nice Job Mark (:"
Play scrap mechanic if you want to be an engineer without any tools and resources
Hi
Dexter's laboratory
I wish there was another box for like teenagers and adults
6:20 I know now 😈
mark rober do you doubt my coin spinning skills
FAT GUS RETURNS TO THE BATTLE
..was that mkbhd?
Love from India
Homie bought the fantasy factory lol
This guy has money wow
Very Cool!
can we all take a moment to thank him for amazing content!
Genius… level 2.
Wait-  does that mean we won’t have any more secret labs for another 1 1/2 years?
This is so cool
But some of these boxes for adults aka still children would be dope 👀
Bro got dexters lab
"You are a madman, and this is one of the best and most original channels on YT. Keep up the fantastic content."
"If I came off the street or delivered a package, I'd see the bookshelf is so obviously a door. There's light shining from underneath it and there's wheels on the bottom."
Ok
Uh…. “Firefighter” - it’s 2022 you know.
First watch on 7/17/2022
umm you can see the light from behind the bookshelf-door from the oface side
"Crunchlabs is awesome,"
I’m a kid and I have autism and it’s so cool that he his making these boxes to build
Now this is just another jackass movie
This is simply amazing
For us it’s a new video but for the watermelons it’s an apocalypse
THAT... wow
Let's go fantasy factory v2 😎👊
Breaking bad type build
Follow on Youtube
Bro livin gta securo serve
Mark Rober is the YouTuber where I watch the sponsors and promotions instead of skipping them
you should build a quarterpipe at the end of the foam pit
Congrats on #1 trending mark rober!
For Australians he just made questacon
Seriously the Bill Nye of my kids generation. MKB as well! Are you kidding me? Just give the guy the Nobel!
I gotta be honest mark...I have neices and nephews but I kinda wanna order the toys for myself!! Ur channel is awesome sir hoping to share it with said kids
you can see light under the cabinet
mark ur awesome
"Other channels: “here before 10k”
Mark rober: “here before 10m”"
bruh mark so skilled he can upgrade ur toilet to level 2
2:44 she is actually my bestie irl so that’s pretty cool XD
BRO CAN I DO PARKOUR THERE PLS?
6:43 That secret enterance is quite suspecious if you can see light seeping under the shelf lmao
I’m going to need to see a collaboration with you and Stuff Made Here
Awesome
What are he and mr beast up to with the similar wonka themes?
Mark you gotta make adult beginners level boxes and so on. For the adults that have that kid in them still
When your in science classes it helps you
I’m sad that I didn’t watch this video sooner.
"Fix the light underneath the bookshelf, but really cool place and vid"
I wonder if there is wheelchair access to the cool balcony. The fireman's piston would be awesome fun for that.
6:36 for reveal
"why does this remind me of bill nye
(but much much cooler ofc)"
Do you deliver to Europe ?
This is such a great way to get kids interested in engineering!
I have this project I won't to do but my parents don't believe I can make something that can work
Mark Rober is todays Bill Nye. What an amazing individual
I want one too
I was so excited when you said we got your signature that is on my bucket list
My opinion the #1 coolest thing there is you Mark your amazing and I love that your passion is to inspire the younger generation and give us all these amazing videos. Thank you Mark we love you 💕
But before you can see if I actually live
"I really wish I were a kid again so I could go down this path. When I was younger, I loved the Tinkerbell movies because she was basically an engineer and I thought she was sooooo cool, but to physically have something to help me channel that passion would have definitely set me on a different path (I’ve already graduated college with a fine arts degree). I’m so excited for all the future engineers that come out of this!"
great vid<3
"5:21
Speak for yourself."
We can make anything? 🤔
I am sad I cannot get this beacuse i am from the Philippines
"You sound like a very likeable guy, love your work! Guy from Norway with autism."
This is amazing bro ♥
"Can anyone see the big problem of having a secret room Then show 8,000,000 people where it is"
Pov Me after I finished the Nuka world code quest
me just noticing u can see light from under the secret door
"I’m from Canada, can I buy it?"
how much you want for it
An engineer can take with patience and passion can literally take over the world 🔥
Other than the light under the bookshelf.
it's where he hides the bodies
"Wow, just wow, this video is a 10/10, keep doing a great job Mark"
If we had more college professors that loved teaching like Mark the world would be a better place.
Were is the location
Love your work Mark. Inspiring US youth to embrace and celebrate a projectile based society.
It would be useful if he Invented a way to get Joe Biden out of office so we don’t have $10 gas this summer
6:26 you can see the light under the place with books
"Thanks for all of the inspiration, I’m happy for you."
Big Ups
Is it just me or every major youtuber is trying to be like willy wonka
How complex can the crunch lab boxes get
W YouTuber
"This is nucking futs, all on a nuther level"
ive always wanted to battle two coins like bayblades and with the coin spinner (if i get it atleast) i finally can
He used a Zelda breath of the wild sound😂 but overall pretty cool
I solemnly swear to create the cybersecurity equivalent of this one day.
It reminds me of Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory!
“My uncle is Mark Rober”
Ok but what are you gonna do when the ants start rebroduciong more and the colony becomes massive
Sheeesh
Niceee
I though he said nerd farmery
It's giving the montage scene from Blank Check 😂
This is awesome.
"Let me guess...
Gravity falls?"
that's awesome! :)
I need one of those build boxes!
when did this become a kids channel lol
from now on i’m going to check every bookshelf and painting on the wall
"It is still rare to see someone so passionate about what they do, and to get so much joy from it that they can't help but share it.  
Well done Mark.  The Crunch Lab boxes seem like great kits. I wish you continued success."
it looks like an green screen
That launcher can really place intruders in a hospital. If they can find the lab first.
Elephant toothpaste. Not devils tooth paste…. Elephant.
Disnet villain mark rober
Is there seriously anything I can do? I have no interest in engineering
"Mark Rober is the kind of a teacher who teaches kids that ""everything can be a weapon when you give it to an engineer"""
Where does he live
That’s crazy Mark
The mark cave
Charlie and the chocolate factory haha first thing that came to my mind as soon as I saw that big winner ticket !
Bros becoming the new age bill nye the science guy
can you make a rocket powered katana
What a great time to be alive
"Wow, dude! Hie to kolob, dude! Totally rad!"
"""Subversion of expectations = comedy"" No wider words have been said. ♥️"
im 8 and i like your vids and i want a crunchlabs box
"Unfortunately mike here is almost copying of Mr beast with the style of videos, he's now getting a lot of people involved"
we dont know were you live so what is the point if changing the room
Hi
mark is living my childhood dream. i have literally NEVER been this jealous of anything ever.
"Why did it look like a kid show superhero hideout?
Lol"
This is a factory of wholesome 😌
"Thanks Mark, now i know how to get in (:"
my guy was in full catchers gear💀
:)
Im surprised that mark hasn't turned that piano into his own version of Alexa
IM IN THE CONTEST I REALLY HOPE I WIN ITS PRETTY MUCH MY DREAM.
5:50 I just touche it for 1 sec without waching my hand s
mark plays life and he is winning
Mark advertising himself be like…
"The one and only Mark Rober that makes things fun,entertaining, and learning   congratulations 🍾🎉"
NICE! Who are you going to invite to your new space?
Wow I always wondered what he does with all this money he is making and I see he Definitely put it to amazing use can't wait to see videos taken in here and also if u made adult engineer things Mark that would awesomeeee
SO AWESOME!!
Yooo Mrwhosetheboss in the video!!!
"Hard question time
Would you rather live at 
Mark’s warehouse 
Or
The Dude Perfect’s office"
Mark should go to  Hacksmith Industries for a month
Where is the body Lebowski?!
im most stoked about your safer packaging. great thinking here wish more youtubers were more responsible
Hey this is awesome however you might want to fix the fact at the secret door isn’t so secret since you can see it’s off the ground and on top of that you can see a light underneath which both of those are a dead give away
"Just bought the build box, so hyped!!!"
amazing warehouse !
A very cool lab but the shelf has lights shining under the shelf
The toys sound like a really great idea. I don’t have kids but I might buy in
Mark ur a ba
dudes living in the future
Your such a legend Mark
I’m going to use crunch box now! I’m so excited!
Mark you are awesome and so inspiring I love your channel it is so cool how you can help young kids or just people in general.
You need to put some opaque material under the sliding bookshelves because there's light leaking and it gives it away
Your the real willy wonka instead of candy it's cool toys and robots
You’re the best mark thanks for the awesome videos
Invite
"Because being a multi millionaire is not enough,  more money for Mark people"
👍👍
So amazing
"Erm, this is genius. Uh, just want to say this ahead of time; you’re gonna be a billionaire Mark. Str8 up genius. Bravo sir"
"Erm, this is genius. Uh, just want to say this ahead of time; you’re gonna be a billionaire Mark. Str8 up genius. Bravo sir"
Well its not a secret now
"Mark, is that a goddamn foam ball CLAYMORE in the crunch lab set?! AMAZING! LMAO."
Wish this shipped to the Philippines! Looks so cool. I'd love for my daughter to try her hand at engineering. :)
"I—I can’t even. Just when you think Mark Rober can’t get any more legendary, he legit sets up, not just a kit parents can buy to make more little Robers, an actual workshop that people who buy these kits can visit. Wow. However, Mark, if you do manage to see this comment, I have just one question for you; If you could go back all these years, and choose to stay with NASA instead of going full time with YouTube, would you have stayed?"
Wow that is cool
reminds me of arrow
"i just wanted to say that these build boxes are seriously really cool. i’m not part of the target demographic anymore, but when i was young, having an ongoing source of easy, manageable engineering projects like those would’ve very probably sparked a real passion in me. the child in me got super excited hearing about it all."
I haven’t been this jealous in the last 20 years…
This guy is living his best live .
I’m speechless.
5:27 That's an amazing fire hazard you invented.
the warehouse is where he did the dominoes
"You can see the light coming from under the bookcase though, so we know there's something behind it"
"if only 1% of people who've watched this video, go on to buy his box... they've got a 1 in 80,000 chance of getting that platinum ticket.
That's better odds than winning the lotto, but still really bad odds lol"
Never tell me money doesn't buy happiness again
American Gladiators was a fun show. The tennis ball gun and the one where contestants shot back were my favorite things on TV back then.
"Question, will the trip cost be covered like gas food etc. or will we have to cover that, for the platinum ticket of course."
Hey mark your a hero!
Hey mark your a hero!
5:20 fire hazard
Yes
Where can I sign up to work for you? I don't need a salary or anything. Just food every now and again. Actually forget that. I don't even need food. I'll just share some nuts with gus.
When you make a secret room in minecraft but wanna shot it off anyways
That's awesome... everything. You're an amazing person Mark! World needs more people like you!
ok.
"i just wanted to say that these build boxes are seriously really cool. i’m not part of the target demographic anymore, but when i was young, having an ongoing source of easy, manageable engineering projects like those would’ve very probably sparked a real passion in me. the child in me got super excited hearing about it all."
"My daughter and I are stoked to get to work on these!! Thank you, Mark!"
"Mark, you are living my childhood dream. Always a joy to see you doing what you love. Also when I have kids, I am so ordering some Crunch boxes to teach them with"
"OH MY GOSHHHHH
ITS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!"
Could Mark Rober get any cooler? I think NOT!  I'm waiting for the day I over hear some kids say that they have Mark Rober as there virtual teacher. :)
what if someone finds it
This is a little kids dream
Our generations Edison. But more chill ☮️😎
"umm,  I give up.  I am just going to go live with Mark"
"I've actually made a secret room in my own house...




I meant my Minecraft house"
That's cool
"Let me guess: there are summer holidays coming in the USA
He is a genius, in every way"
I would love to have you  as an uncle
"...Enchanté...@Mark, Keep teaching, Keep inspiring others..."
Where is the squirrel maze 3.0 Mark?
To be honest I wouldn’t think he would let you in.
He made himself the Willy Wonka of engineering. I love it.
This is every guys dream
"Hi Mark! Thanks for all the incredible work you put into the engineering world and for helping kids get interested in science! I’m an elementary teacher who’s teaching 2nd grade in the fall. Would these boxes be appropriate for a lower elementary extra curricular club or integration into a related science unit? Or do you think these should be reserved for home as more of a self-paced activity? If anybody has tried the Crunch Labs box and can offer some insight, please let me know!"
"Just so you know, ur son has the best dad ever"
I can't help thinking if someone jumped that fence thinking the foam pit was there but it wasn't. My mind sometimes. 😃😃
This is a Mark Rober style Mark Rober video and I can 100% whole heartedly say that as a Mark Rober fan of Mark Rober
I’m in my 20’s and i want a crunch box
Mark Rober is so wholesome... he's goin to heaven for sure
Your the best
Will you be bringing your product into the UK?
You are a legend!
"Dude this is the coolest thing I've ever seen! I'd buy the kits for my daughter, but she'd probably not have as much fun as I would😅"
Legit looks like  rob dydecks fantasy factory
his son must be so happy…
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
Google is jealous.
"“Now don’t worry folks, no Mark Rober’s were hurt in the filming of this segment…” 💀💀💀"
Ok
Breaking Mark
AMOE time
"Some weir Mr Green thing ""motivate"" etc"
IN DEXTERS LAAAABORATORYYYYYYYYYY
Two internet celebrities doing more to help the world than the actual government.
Hillary Clinton already played this trick for children.
"Not a huge fan of rugrats, but think what your doing is a great idea."
"This is awesome! All the support for this, would also be fun to create a line for adults too!"
Veruca Salt would like to know your location
"not really serect when when you can see light coming from under the door, love the idea"
Are you planning to deliver to mexico?
yes a vidio
What if you forgot how to get in to the warehouse 😬
"7:36 I literally own that exact record player, have had it for years."
... a call center
That office is not suspicious at all.
Yellow
Day 1 of asking mark rober to make a giant growing crystal rock like thoes toys in target
Can you please create a toy box for adults? Like ages 18+? It could include soldering or actual computer components maybe.
you can see the light under the door ... but you probably already know that :)
Can you make an adult version? With more complex designs??
Awesome!
That invention that shows if you washed your hands is just amazing
How does the outside look tho???
why aren't you putting a motor  and controller for the foam filled shipping container
Amazing congrats Mark!
I would but my mom said no
rip
questoin if i find crunch lab behind the oversided tooth decay poster is it legal to get in
Signing up just to build the claymore lol
this is the type of thing you would make in minecraft but nah mark rober made it in real life
"My son’s going to be so happy when he gets the first box. 
I think he’ll pass out if there’s a platinum ticket inside. 
Thanks so much Mark, this is exactly what your audience wanted and you freaking delivered!!"
Got our first box and it was AWESOME! The disc launcher works extremely well!
Yeah its actually a pretty affordable box
I clicked on ur channel and it seems like ur pretty talented
@Oliver Helenius clown
bot
Mark Rober=Mars Rover
Mark Rober is how I imagine Elon Musk to be as a child.
experiences to this point
this cool
U r the best Mark
"why aren't you making something for the teen age guys, and by the way its not criticism its just what I want, thanks you are amazing..."
"Office: has mysteriously large footprint
NPC: Must be the wind."
Are crunchlabs aviable for russian auditory?
probably not due to U.S. sanctions
Mark is like the engeneer Mrbeast
I'm just imagining from the outside this tiny office room with an enormous 'secret' warehouse attached to one side. 😂
😂😂
"Plot twist: the office, not the warehouse, is the secret."
Hi
Cool
"Great video, Mark! We featured your video on my website this week in our ""Feature Theater"". Link is in my bio!"
Hello me bucko
4:05 wee oof
the piston looks like a disney cgi type build
Willy Wonka X Tony Stark = Mark Rober !
skrum
*Mark you outdone yourself!!| this video definitely has Mr Beast vibes* 😂
XD memw
Marky invite me to crunch labs it’s my birthday (:
schools need a field trip here
Next invention: portal gun
This is friggin amazing. You can still see light under the bookshelf. Your content and abilities are amazing
Bro made the batcave
modern day bill nye
Congratulations on your lab. Just amazing. A child’s dream!!!!! I shoulda been an engineer. Dang. But I’m bad at math!
Thats insane
wooo this is epic
"He's the Don Herbert (Mr. Wizard) of 2022. AS a kid, I wished I lived in New York state so I could be one of his science kids."
I will NEVER get into a prank war with this dude. Lol.
"Impressive job in all regards! Video, forward thinking and great for aspiring engineers!"
What a nice idea for zombie apocalypse
"This looks like a way lower budget version of ""Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory"" from MTV back in the day!"
3:20 anybody know what this song is called?
So if someone is lucky enough to find the lab do they have permission to just freely explore it? lol
Such a cool idea
"This would be cool just dump the nasa shirt on the other vids, thanks"
D e s e r v e d :)
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
So many of todays youth are going to cite YouTubers  like mark or destin as the inspiration behind their choice to pursue the careers they did. You are shaping the futures of so many of the younger generation. You are awesome mark rober.
Nice
Great video. I want more of these!
Can’t believe Mark Roger team up with nestlé
"For the last few months I don't really know why I'm waiting for videos anymore.. sorry, but it's not worth the wait anymore.."
"The fact that I’ve been watching this guy since the beginning when he made the Halloween costume, and now to this. It’s honestly amazing how far a person can grow when they have supporting people around them. Marks going places…"
"@ExOtic_Us3r1 I had a different account, then got a new computer and didn’t remember the password for the other account. So I made a new one. My bad for the confusion"
"@ExOtic_Us3r1 tehy could just be on a different account, ik i’ve switched mine like 5 times"
"Your channel was made in 2021, “Since the beginning when he made the Halloween costume” 😂"
He already is places!
keep doing incredicle things for science and engineering! there are going to be some really happy kids here!
"your dream’s coming true, mark!! great job"
Anyone else think Mark's voice sounds different?
This is brilliant!
Gravity falls?
"Great Lab, you did some really cool things. The only problem is that the door isn't very secret since you can see light under the bookshelf. It would be a dead give away for someone to know they need to investigate the bookshelf some more."
I think the moving foam pit is an accident waiting to happen!  Imagine when Mark dives over the railing thinking he will land in the foam but he forgets that he put the pit away the night before so there is just concrete!
"It's weird, I can't understand what the piano is saying if I'm looking at it, because my mind sees a piano."
I cant get into your website

Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay.
This is a childhood dream continued as an adult if I had the money
ok but is no one gonna comment on the fact the professional frisbee player is MKBHD
"Mark, you just make me happy seeing you having passion and love for what you do, I hope I get to be happy like you one day."
awesome!
maybe i will
Can't wait to be in the dentist and see kids just ripping posters off the wall looking for a secret entrance
"Wow, to imagine that you can do that while I can only make food disappear"
"It’s awesome what you are doing for kids, It would be fun If I were 60 years younger I would participate in a heartbeat. Keep up your awesome work. 
Ron"
You missed The light underneath the secret door 🤫
"I've been there! Well, before it was finished. Fun to see it an actuality Mark!"
This like like the dude perfect headquarters but for Mark!!!
🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
He should have a room called the Rober Room
Vip🥰🥰😍😍😍😍🤩
The bookshelf needs weather stripping under it to cover the daylight
GRAVITY FALLS
No its worse
WOW that’s all i should say
What an absolute legend.
Where was this stuff when I was a kid????
100000 points for the effort. Living the dream Mark!
I’ve always thought of you as the new Bill Nye and this cements that opinion.
"3:23, you can here someone clicking a mouse button lmao"
I hope this helps go to NASA some day
great video keep it up
"Imagine me if I got a ticket in the box. Will mark pay for my ER bills?



*If you didn't get it I fainted*"
🔥🔥🔥
Oh my gosh if I got replied to I would be so happy
He's like the Willy Wonka of engineering!
What am I doing with my life lol
Fantasy Factory vibes with emphasis on engineering. I support this
Your website is unavailable.
You're incredible. You do wonderful things for kids and you're so fun!
"Are the little kits limited edition, or can you get them at any time?"
Don’t flush the toilet 😏
Nice box but... have you heard of kiwiko? Because (of what I know of both without owning any of them) the general idea is exactly the same with just slightly different products in them
I love how you casually flavor all ur videos with the original pvz music
He is a mix of bill nye and Willy wonka but like engineering versions of them
The person who wants a Diet Pepsi😨
Top 3 places I want to work: 1: Marks lab
How we keep the lab super secret (can see the light coming from under the bookshelf)
I absolutely love it Mark! Do you ship to Canada?
That was... unexpected? :D :D :D
Mark rober? more like mars rover
Mark is becoming more and more of the main character in life
I don't think I'm a pig...
"please, please, please ship to India"
This announcement was the first time I've regretted not procreating in weeks.  Maybe months.
Mark Rober...YOU ARE SO AWESOME!!!
"It's hard to be jealous of a guy that just seems so genuine and wears his love of his career on his sleeve, he's clearly put his all into being as successful as he is. And the fact that he really tries to inspire kids to get into engineering and not see failure as a negative is just the cherry on top."
@Gunnar Thiessen oh i guess we found the jealous person
He doesn’t seem genuine. I’d keep my kids far away.
I heard she always have a way of linking someone investment into something new and profitable?
A news host spoke so highly of💕 Priscilla Dearmin-Turner and her loss prevention strategies been trying to get to her ever since
"@David HudsonThank you, Going through her profile in her webpage, she smashed all her state certificate and accreditation🙏"
the best toy marketing video i've ever seen and will ever see!!!!
Holy crap this is so cool!! Literally childhood dreams crunched into one place ;)
I have a younger sister who aspires to be an engineer and I know she will LOVE crunch labs! thank you mark!
"Mark Rober is a big child.
And I love it"
Mark Rober I have a question. Can you make build box’s or people 14+ (I want this but I feel like the models on display in your video are geared towards kids under the age of ten) and if I can help I use the email linked to this account.
I bet this is going to show up on a MrBeast Reacts video
HAHA
I’m happy mark is helping these kids find their passion
"Make sure it detects the lid, not just the seat, because laziness is gender neutral. Most only care about the seat down, not the lid as well, and apparently enjoy spraying toilet water all over."
Did he call Marcus brownlee a professional frisbee player?
I love your videos but try asking one of your nephews for an idea
what a flex
this guy is scaring me he is literally giving me dr doofenshmirtz vibes and I love it
Sign me up!
Nice layout Mark!!
"nerf gun wall, secret passageways, giant foam pit... this lab is E P I C. well done!"
What's up YouTube
"Hello all powerfull sir YouTube,how was your day?"
Hi YouTube!
YouTube needs to make 50 and 100mil play buttons again
Hello YouTube
Huge Props to Mark for letting people engineer with him!
Not so secret anymore..
I wish that was available in french for my nephews! Any plan on developing that?
Legend says that this dude made the bat cave
"i loved this vid, plus i wana say thanks for filling my summers with fun, and because i binged your vids for weeks at a time, i got the highest grade in my robotics class"
Wow <3
The things I would do to go there
"From a fellow engineer, what you are doing is awesome"
Outa a Hollywood movie
6:50 HEY LISTEN
I saw a video of an emergency escape system that uses pistons to lower a person one floor at a time.
Can you please build a working rollacoaster
"You are AWESOME. Like srsly.When I grow up, I want to be an engineer just like you. Thank you Mark for inspiring me to be a engineer when I’m an adult."
Can you build a working rollercoaster with a chan lift
"If everyone in the world was like Mark, We would literally have world peace. And not only that, But we would have a bunch of cool gadgets doing things to make all our lives easier."
Under the secret entrance there’s a big gap and you can clearly see there’s something behind the book case🤫
EVERYONE PLEASE HELP MARK SEE THIS COMMENT WE NEED TEAM BEES
"I have no kids, and I have ADULT money and the inner child in me is screaming 😭  I've gotta do it"
MARK I KNOW YOU PROBABLY CANT SEE THIS BUT WE NEED TEAM BEES
*This be everyones dream*
Mark as a child my dream is to do the same thing
street fighter is awesome!!! i love that wharehouse!!
"Looked everywhere for that orange couch, anybody know where to get one?"
YYYYEESSERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This is what happens when the smart kid becomes the adult who gets a little money and some time to play. The rest of us just get to nerd out through these videos.  
I really wish your boxes/lab had been available 15 or so years ago for my kids. (My son was the kid who disassembled and re-engineered most of his toys so they’d “work better”. He’d have loved this stuff.)
:)"
"Basically, you're *Forge* from the X-Men who built his own *Danger Room.*"
What if we are in a different country?
After 2 weeks of @RyanTrahan crossing America on $0.01 …. this feels like too much
This is so great! Thank you for getting kids into science!
This secret room is so dang cool!!
“But before we actually find out if i live” 💀💀🤣🤣
So this is basically Dexters Lab !!!❤️❤️❤️
잘보고 갑니다 ^^
The cog board is so cute
Why am I not surprised you and MKB are friends
Sidebar did you engineer a Nerf claymore!?!???
Love you mark so much ur literally my fav guy and we love ur energy throughout the years of watching ur vids
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
"Since you make science, by any chance would you promote “Nintendo Labo” just like Bill Nye?"
I won a golden ticket daddy
Think critically. Ironic.
I want to be like you
"Mark. You’re not my uncle, but you’re my favorite uncle."
"And I’m 42, and I want to be you when I grow up. And the Crunch Labs projects look amazing!!"
STAN PINES
mark rober is about to replace elon musk lol
Who cool vid
"Showing this to 20million people....okay....only realesed 2 days ago....""7,759,476 views"" :O Great job as always!"
9:39 i was fully expecting a rickroll
"Can I be you, please? I've got like $4.29 in nickels, dimes, and pennies. Maybe we can trade?"
mark buddy pal champ friend. did you make a bloody wooden claymore?
"if you actually cared, you'd install a urinal. Urinals should be commonplace; toilets aren't properly designed for standing urination."
"Mark, please consider making the instructions available online in other languages (perhaps with priority given to developing countries). I'd like to share these engineering kits with some kids in other countries to give them an opportunity to open their mind beyond the minimal education they receive. This all without being gated by having to know English."
This is very sunniest to

Aaaaannnndd... there's the highly anticipated mid-life crisis of Mark Rober
That’s awesome
so the ball launcher is like an ligit wepon
"Mark: I built a secret room that no one will find
Also him: *proceeds to show the whole world *"
"Only flaw: the light shows under the bookcase secret entrance, rendering it not so secret."
RIP KiwiCo
Your approach is genius but it still lacks fat.
Can I visit your lab please
"You are like Bill Nye, Rob Dyrdek and Mr. Beast wrapped up into one"
Great advertisement.  No real value here unless you wanna buy something.
"Hey Mark, I'm sure you know this, but there's light showing under the bookcase (Shown on #5 discussion).  This kinda gives away what's behind it."
"""because men are pigs"" causal sexism and self hate 🤦"
I want to go to your warehouse
mark help me be favorite uncle
I just realized I know @Mark Rober 's Secret XD
what if you get a platinum ticket butt you live in a different country? Fore a example i live in Sweden.
"Wow this looks amazing, and really fun to explore"
when you id a close upp to the wall with the hole in the beggining there was smoke comming out of it
Mark rober is like the dr wu of this world
Do CrunchLabs sell internationally?
0:49 it looks like the lab from breaking bad
"Builds ""secret room, nobody can find""...

Then puts it online and shows everyone how to find it.

Next: Hacksmith or Mark rober? Who could be the best supervillain?
mark is just a big kid. I appreciate that so much. I wish more people would keep their inner child alive.
😢i live on the Czech Republic and the shipping cost 500 dollar’s 😢
WOW! INSANE!!! 🤩🤩😀😀
LET IT RIP
Only mark would be the biggest child in the world. While being a literal genius.
Rip his janitors or work people who have to clean after them.  Messes + nerf gun
genius
Please tell me you have plans to make boxes geared towards adults as well! 🙏🙇‍♂️
Nice video but sad how you just act like kiwiko never existed....
I’m impressed
Yo u got a whole warehouse
Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment”🏆
I will definitely use crunch labs for my future children
This guy has room for my dream job
Now is no secret👌🙃
mark rober: and we stole dis claw machin from dennies and then bla bla bla me: um say what now?
Bunker
kiwiko must be happy...
this is so cool
I want that many nerf guns
"""but before we see if I actually live""

4:53 MKBHD's catch was too clean.
Overall  still pretty cool nonetheless
Should have some Frank plushies. Frank is the brains.
What song is at 9:10 ?
wow this is like the fantasy factory from MTV but actually way cooler.
When I grow up I wanna be just like Mark

im 12 an its true i do want to be just like you mark :))"
"Absolutely genius idea with the builders box, my kiddos are going to love these they spend hours watching your videos and showing their friends while they have them over its so adorable. I'm glad my kids look up to you and not the Hollywood stars"
6:48 cuz no one drinks pepsi?
The world needs more Mark Robers.
"the true fantasy factory, absolutely amazing!"
This would make my late Physics teacher and my retired Geometry teacher smile. Application is always better.
bro tryna recreate gravity falls
"Every single time I watch one of your videos, I get so encouraged and it makes me want to create my own invention! You have no idea how impactful your videos are!"
Crap im in Italy :(
you should rent it out for the day like you have to make reservations
Okay can you be my Uncle
your so cool
This video 100% gives me gravity falls vibes-
No shipping to Brazil :(

youve been watching rick & morty
There is light under the bookcase.
I bought crunch labs and I'm so excited  to get it you are my favorite YouTuber and I want to be just like you some day but I have a long journey to college
Gravity falls?????? lol ty for making this!
e
Is it available for the UK or is it USA only?
For the algorithm. ✊
Great place! When will you let HHS ACT visit? 😁👍🏼
"Hey Mark, can you give us all a general idea of where the Crunch Lab is located? Like, tell us commenters the state it’s in, please. I’m not asking for specifics (like cities or anything else more precise than just a state), just what state it’s in, so that I know if I can feasibly look for it at all. Thank you in advance!"
He is literally my idol
Hey did anyone notice there was a spaceage light plate near the fire alarm pull station at 7:44?
A Wild MKBHD appears!
Mark Rober is like a Minecraft redstone engineer but in real life
"You should invite Mr.Beast there
It would be great for your success (I know it's sounds bad but trust me u may get huge amount of subscribers)"
Hey mark I’m your best fan and I really wana get stuff that you belt but I’m in iraq and i can get anything so do you have a solution for that?
Marketing genius
This is sooo cool
Every Childs dream place:
Wow. Nice
Where is Dom
is it available in asian countries ?
or worldwide ?
Can they reach the UK??
💡Light under the bookshelf kinda gives away the secret.  💡
"Thanks Kiwi Crates for the past sponsorships, but I don't need you anymore, becuase I have my own (Crunch Labs)"
I have always wanted to engineer thank you.
Dreams Crushed.
so it's just kiwico but mark rober branded. got it
is that thumb nail a gravity falls reference? :D
you are great bro
Can i get a visit in church lab if I live in mauritius ?
And nobody sees the light under the bookshelf ?
This is like a secret base from a kids science cartoon
So you made your own dexter’s laboratory 😅 coolest thing I ever seen
Will crunchlabs come to India?
This is a place you could buy in GTA
"Upload for one day with 7M view, okay..."
Mark Rober's Fantasy Factory
Everything having a nerf secondary use is making me suspicious this is Nerf Labs 🤔
Dude!  This is AWESOME!  You make me wish I was a kid again just to get the crunch boxes and hopefully a platinum ticket!!!
Please please PLEASE make a Poppy Playtime GrabPack!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love you
It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.
YES!!! The builds could be more complex and you would get to do more math and make it so it's actually more engineering and less attaching rubber bands. The builds would be different too that would be so fire.
Dexter's lab ... for real!
"EPIC WORK!! OMG im so sad im from europe, this is exactly what i would buy for my nephews.. Your are The G Marc."
You are seriously an amazing person
Do a new squirrel maze this year pleease?🥺

"That suitcase is made of glass, yes? And that tennis gun can blast holes through the walls, yes? And... You get unlimited practice shots, yes..?"
If you need some one to patch those holes. Gimme a shout I'm in ontario

The lab is a dream
Was ganna buy it but holy s$&t it costs a lot
Why can't people like Mark be the president
The REAL question about the innovations of Crunch Labs is: will there be delicious chocolate and puffed rice inside?
The light coming out from under the bookcase is a dead giving away.
The hand washing alarm should be sold to fast food restaurant's to make sure staff wash hands.
Who else scanned the article code in the box for crunch lab
I want to go
"One small issue: If you use the toilet, and DON'T flush, the alarm doesn't go off"
"Mark... we love your new digs! I've been a fan of your projects and educational style for sometime now, and super happy to see your new content with my young daughters regularly. They love your channel too.  The one thing that would make my kids love you more, is if you teamed up with Physics Girl -Dianna Cowern, their personal hero. All the best!"
"You know it's ""A lot stronger"" when the impact hole is smoking 0:41"
there is a light that shines under the book case. you might want to take care of that
"""if you were to walk in off the street"" part shows light leaks out under the secret door >.< Maybe a bristle skirt would help"
"NEW YORK EMPIRE!!!! MKBHD LET""S GO"
NOW THATS IMPRESSIVE got me thinkin dexters laboratory rn
"Sooo, did Kiwi co drop you as as sponsor?!"
I wish I could be a part of this but I'm just incapable of partisapateing. But I believe I can come to make it happen myself. You will always be my motivation
I would totally get the boxes but I don’t have enough money and there’s no way my parent would cough up enough for me to get it.
NICE!!😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
It would have been so much easier to close the toilet lid automatically 😂

"I don't trust you, and I can tell why. Your son suffers because of your actions"
Cool secret entrance.
"Hi Mark.

Congratulations to you and everyone involved in getting this done. It is forward thinking and a great achievment. 

After the recent tweet from, Xyla Foxlin, about people in the industry assuming she is the asisstant or PR,  anything other than an engineer because of her gender. I am interested how you plan to raise awareness in children about equality in engineering, via your hub, so they don't become the ignorants of the future in positions of influence.

Kind regards,

this is mark rober
I was waiting for it to connect to the Colin Furze tunnel. 😁
I can see so many potential fun video ideas with this!
why does he yell constantly?
To grab attention
We all know he did this because he can
My kids got the KiwiCo Tinker Crates for years when they were younger.  We would totally have got yours if you had started earlier since they love your videos.
what is the song chopsticks is playing
"How you gonna find the nerf bullets, must be a pain"
"this is the best video ever, in terms of engaging with your audience, and marketing a product."
"This guy is national treasure, i just hope there are many kids who would rather play with these little engineering toys than on their phones."
"Hey Mark, flaw in your secret door behind the bookcase.  You can see the light shining through at 6:26.  BTW, loved the Zelda music when the secret pop door opened."
What if someone who delivers you a package watches your vids
This would for sure be my dream job
Need to fix the light leakage from under the book case :)
This is not that “secret” anymore.
You should make a super accurate golf club!! ⛳️
Do they ship to the philippines?
"This is amazing! Work hard, play hard. Love it."
"Yo, I need to find myself a NASA engineer!!"
youtube is getting way out of hand lmao the effort
Phat gus 😳😳
Mark is the new Mr.Rodgers/Bill Nye all rolled into one perfect person
Take my money now!!!
You’re an living example on why no one should give up on their dreams no matter what
Mark really learned redstone IRL
"dear mark Rober,
I am sincerely disappointed with this video it wasn't as creative as the past videos you have created, it has really let me down since I have waited 2 whole months for the video of a a secret room behind some wood? please take this in and rethink your videos"
Maybe let him do what he wants?
"i just wanted to say that these build boxes are seriously really cool. i’m not part of the target demographic anymore, but when i was young, having an ongoing source of easy, manageable engineering projects like those would’ve very probably sparked a real passion in me. the child in me got super excited hearing about it all."
It’s all ages don’t worry. I’m considering buying one and I’m 22 0_0
I wish we had stuff like this when we were younger 😔. But you only live once! Live it to the fullest!!
these boxes really could be used as teens who are trying to find what they want to do as well
@N A Agreed! I'd be all over adult-level build boxes
69th like
yes mr peast
Fantastic video 👍
Crunch boxes are cool but I can't help but feel like it's the same as kiwiko and the thing is that they sponsored mark many times so it's kinda weird to become their competitor but otherwise crunch labs is a great idea!
My toilet flips upside down and tosses me into your ball pit.  My mad skillz amaze even myself somedays.
❤️
Love to see it but... Kiwi co👀
"Super duper ""secret"" entrance behind a book shelf (with a clear light and doorway behind it) that takes you to...the gaint plain garage doors.....on this millions strong YouTube video.

"@Martin Cart Haha nice refrences, I totally agree"
"Mark is the engineering Uncle, Matthias Wandel is the Dad."
Definitely
It's science.

"this place is insane, and i got the willy wonka reference"
I always thought I recognized one of the songs in Mark's videos. Finally realized it was from Plant's vs Zombies lol.
When I’m older I really want to make a YouTube channel about engineering like you. If I could meet you one day that would be life changing
Its cool but u can see light from under the cabnet/closet
My students and I love your videos and learn so much from them! I would love to do the Crunch boxes with them. Are there any package or classroom deals offered? My classes are usually small — under 15 students. It would be so cool to be able to do one monthly with them!
I love your channel and i realy want to buy a box
I want fat gus
"What an amazing space.  Since you like Nerf, you need to have epic battles in there complete with scoreboard and a way to keep track of hits automatically."
You're literally the Willy Wonka of engineering. Or the Dude Perfect of engineering...
OmG it’s #1 ON TRENDING congratulations 🎊 mark!
For whoever see this comment the crunch lab build box’s don’t give you a chance to win the ticket if you live anywhere other than the states and only if your older than 18. It kinda feels like false advertising or at least it should have been clarified
Bro. This is so cool. I can't even tell you how jealous I am RN ❤.
AAESOMRB FHNDT
This is so freaking cool.
Bruh my dude has a talking piano in his hangout room. he is liveing the dream
Anyone here knows the tune the piano is playing?
It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.
Imagine if someone walked in the office and thought the eagle looked cool so they just turned it and the bookshelf just shifts..
I want to be like you Mark. Very inspiring and entertaining 
bro needs to work with the u.s military and tennis balls my guy
It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.

Stay awesome, and never grow up! xD"
"Hi Mark!

I love how Mark never takes his hat off
I saw a kid at the dentist office waiting ans moving everything until he started punching a poster
"How can he be still ""on an ongoing quest to become the kids# favourite uncle""??? Since both kids shown here didn't appear to be ultra-spoiled brats, i can only theorize that in the Rober family there are so many potential candidates, each a master in their specific craft, vying for the kids' favour, constantly outdoing each other on a daily basis.





I am jealous!"
So flipin cool

im gonna try to get all crunchlabs engineering toys

that is very cool
This video is sponsored by... Kiwi Co...
"I think you do a great job Mark. I was pushed to be an engineer by my father and went to an engineering magnet school, but it only served to push me away. You showing what we as humans can achieve with science is a fantastic way to encourage our youth to be future scientists and engineers!"
Yes
He's definitely cooking meth
"Ah, yes, now that 7,5 million people know about this, nobody can find you ""secret"" lab, Mark!"

The observant person knows there’s a passageway because of the light coming from under the bookshelf. Just saying! 👍🏻 Always love your ingenuity! ❤️👍🏻
"That looks amazing, congrats! Although I would like to suggest you put base plates on your truss structure in your filming area - it shouldn't really be stood directly on the floor in the way it currently is without a base plate!"

Well it's not so secret anyone because you put the video on YouTube
I think you sabotaged Marques there🤨
I've always been enamored by secret passage ways.  If I were a millionaire I would build a house with secret passageways  Galore

Great vid
That looks totally amazing! Looking for a gofor?
So basically this was just and excuse to sell your tat.
Is that MKBHD catching a Frisbee???
squirrel maze for men !!!
These kids hit the lottery of uncles. Imagine uncle Mark they have best childhood lol
This is amazing Rober GJ!
"Congrats Mark, what you're doing is inspirational"
Mark you are a modern day hero
More like Dexter's labratory!
Mark it's not secret now 😂😂
Congrats on #1 trending
yes
Also Mark I was curious as to your thoughts on the great pyramid? I know u must know that those weren't made how they say as they cannot create proof of concept
It's all fun and games until they move the foam pit and you dont realise it.
Imagine mark transfer into fantasy world and be like senku
I wish my Uncle were this cool xD
"Love the monthly box, I will be getting this for both of my kids if for no other reason to get them to think for themselves and the problem solving that comes with it.
Love the idea"

Phat gus better get some of the proceeds from the plushie
"""Coming in at number 5 is how we keep the lab super secret, this is what you'd see""

Yeah, I can see the lights underneath the bookcase."
Bro i need help for the YouTube channel upload videos ke one gaming divice😞🙏 please help me bro  please reply😊
I love EVERYTHING about this!
i love your videues
"Millions of views.
""secret""
😅"
I wanna see someone hit the bullseye 🎯💯
Does Mark Rober even get some rest
Bro mark its not a secret anymore lmaoo
I feel like I just watched a 17 min 15 second advert. I loved every moment :D
I love how he is so passionate about what he does in this era. 90-95% of people don't have the passion and they are not enjoying what they do kudos to Mark for being such an amazing person
comparison is theft of joy
@TwerkToSpec rude
Like you?
8:08 The moment a lot of people at Kiwico started swearing. They even helped him finance the whole thing.
But look at the bottom of the book shelf you can see light! Cover that light
People will question that light coming from under the bookcase
GG Mark
But make sure you don’t miss the rope!
Wow! Just wow! 👍
imagine mrbeast ask mark to build a mrbeast warehouse for him after seeing this
"Now I'm curious about the ""didn't wash hands"" light, the way you explained it, does that mean if someone doesn't flush it bypasses the alarm, even if they don't wash their hands?"
south korea uses #10 as emergency fire escapes in the hotels we stayed in while traveling around the country
bro i love you
you are wonderful
cool🙌🙌🙌. I'm so jealous 😫🤣🤣
What about the more adult ppl? :D Like Crunch labs +
Eyerthing is Great only the gap under the door must be sealed so that no light comes through;)
No shots above the shoulder kids
Correction currently 7 million people rounded down
"Hello Mark, please do some trick shots video in that amazing factory with DudePerfect :)"
"When you have so much money, you don’t know what to do with it"
I guess Prof proton is back?.
Bro why you got to do us like that yeah we leave the seat up it saves time
Nikocado Avacado breaks the rope💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Love that PvZ theme 6:30 🔥
You are the very embodiment of the word cool
Was that MKBHD..?
"This is an awesome idea, your videos and those kits are exactly the kind of thing that would have engaged me, if either existed in the 1980's! I hope this is a long term success for you. 😎👍"
It’s great when you have money to burn
when tf did he become a children's entertainer
Fr
I bet elon musk Gonna hit up Mark asking for a Secret Base
I'm 39 and am kinda interested in the box lol
Kinda diggin your fantasy factory...and by fantasy factory I mean the most entertaining doomsday bunker ever
😱
Im cant buy it and im cant come im your werehause
Wow this is the coolest workplace I have ever seen!! Are you hiring artists/designers by any chance? 😂
"So you basically copied KiwiCO? But also you can see a light under the shelf, so it's not exactly a secret theres no room behind there?"
can you also get these boxes in Germany
Really cool! I think my dad is in there
"Cloning Kiwi Co are we?
Typical American, can't invent.. copy.."
"I want this warehouse so bad! It's so cool! Also, I used to cut those foam pieces for foam pits.  12x12x12 pieces.  I cut like half a million of them in 1 shift once. It was crazy"
Dude literally built the closest thing so far to a Batcave.
Who else used the QR code at 9:36 to see the Disc video?

Space age
Nerf flex
i love you mark
si mark tahmik langg
The Crunch Labs stuff looks awesome. Next gen build crates. Fantastic job.
This is one of the most dopest work spaces ever!!! You’re definitely YouTube’s coolest uncle!
He always thinks outside the box
We gonna talk about the bright lights underneath the bookcase that clearly indicates that there's something behind it?
The world is a better place with Mark Rober in it. 😁
"Mark be careful Mr. Beast could sue you jeez

Jk imagine though lol"
Totally can't see the light on the floor leading to the secret lab lol
This place has Mr Beast written all over it.
"""nasa engineer"" sticks a arduino in a drawer and calls it a day."
So COOL
Does this mean Kiwiko will no longer be a sponsor as the concept is pretty similar?
Mark I wonder how your long time sponsor Kiwi Co feels about this? lol Did you get their blessing or was this a surprise to them? Just curious...lol
Mark took over Dude perfect HQ??
number six is easily sidestepped as those who don't wanna wash their hands already run the sink in order to smokescreen out the sound of running water to passers-by.
I love all the things you do and make.
i bought a couple for my siblings. thank you for your work Mark
Oh look. My next investment
"Tbh I really would love to see full Hot Wheel POV video, love Hot Wheel tracks and think it was cool to see that"
im sad because it does not send to indonesia
showing how to enter your secret entrence and your secret pasage ways you show on youtube Defeats the it By saying it is a secret.
when you want to buy something for your kids but you don't have enough money-
"You're really special Mark, not enough people in this world like you"
The secret lair of every kid's dreams turned up to 11. You have outdone yourself on this marvel!
6:27 lol we see light  :}
Can i work here.
ratio
NICE
Bruh i wish my uncale is like you
He just made me love engineering .BTW LOVE YOUR VIDS
For crunch lab you could maybe have 4 different components where the builder has to choose what works best
0:43 wow nilegreen really did him.
Are u shipping to Austria?
the irony is if this video is sponsored by kiwico
Welcome to my profile id You tube id
Lol i wish i had a money to buy an ticket for a plane and also the crunch lab so i can see u lol
Probably my opinion doesn't matter a lot cause of the millions of views but my exactment went to the floor after you start advertising your business.
Anyone else order before the video even ended?!
"Any international variant expected soon ? 
I'm French and I would love to share such cool toys with my little brother that is not fluent enough in english :/"
KiwiCo be like - am I a joke to you?
"Mark, I love your passion and dedication to spread knowledge. Would love to be a kid again just to do this. Great work!"
"I have to say Mark, you have encouraged my passion about engineering. I have a big goal set (mechanical engineer at Nasa), and your mechanisms and creativity really inspired me to use my skills to better the future world. I have graduated a year early, and I am about to start my engineering career in College (UAH), and I hope that you continue to post these awesome contraptions to further motivate me during those years.

(I could use a letter of recommendation from you in around 5 years lol)"
Great vid! Also the marketing team behind this is next level
You should try the launcher on a coconut and see the cause and effect of the damage on the coconut
Epic simply EPIC!
This is soooo great!
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING
Is it possible to produce your videos subbed or dubbed in other languages for the kits? English isn’t my native language but I would love to give these to my kid as well 😁
Madlad made a claymore for kids. Nice.
wow such an awesome idea! so glad that we have you lending a leading hand to todays generation
"Would you rather (in an apocalypse):
Go with Mark Rober's Workshop (100% Deadly Tennis Ball Cannon)
or
Go with The Hacksmith's Warehouse (Tons Of Heavy And Cool Weapons)"
Wait wait wait. Dont you have to leave the toilet seat up all the time???
The surviving kid will inherit the factory.
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
22M actually LOL
"Reminds me of ""Dexter Laboratory"""
make new squirrel video its been a year
What's the point of a secret room if u just post it on the Internet for the whole world to see💀💀
content ;-;
how much for the place?
"Hey Mark,

Is the gap of light underneath your secret pathway visible anytime?

When yes, then I think anyone who waited in there for more than 5minutes would notice that there's something strange with the cabinet"
I am 13 and I want to do this
""" "" One of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something he always respect us , the audience and his team , and his is polite in all videos We Congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come ,"

How long did it take you to make those trick shots
Wow. Just wow

Mark Rober would give batman a run for his money... And ingenuity.
You can faile but you cant give up
"Everybody: Omg mark will become batman or ironman
Mark: Here is my product. Buy it!"
This dude is a legend
No one gonna talk any mkbhd catch?
Awesomeness!
Number one on trending deserved. Keep up the great science communicator work!
Mark is it possible to make a water charger for your phone
My childhood dream that I will never achieve. Congrats
despite being around 15 I would still do these to do them and get the chance to meet you and ask questions as well as do the projects along the way. Pretty soon I am visiting a university with my brother to see about mechanical engineering courses and it would be great to meet somebody as energetic and creative as you.
The lab is awesome!
The Disk launcher is based off of stuff made here 100% I bet
Men are not pigs
was that “professional frisbee player” teased in the video mkbhd?
Love itttt markkk
"Please keep doing this for a very long time. Im a ways off from being a parent, but would so want to sign my kids up for this if they showed an interest in engineering!"
Your smart.
"Forget the kids, I'm 30 and I wanna get those build kits 😆"
"mom: ""dont touch all of the things when you are outside
Him: ""when u are stuck at the waiting room at the dentist office you want to get up and just start moving everything around display.""

Well done. Truly an awesome idea. Kids of tomorrow will thank you for the spark you are creating.
cool
Great job
WOW i didnt know that the tennis ball cannon from the original AG was still in existance
Toilet seat stays up buddy.
Absolutely genius! This is by far the best program invented in a long time. This is no doubt going to be huge and the world will be a better place because of it.

"This is amazing Mark, well done!"
this was just epic
Can you give me one plz
the video title should be worded differently
I live in Greece so the crunch labs kit from 300 dollars sky rockets to 750 dollars with tax and transportation
You should put a light on the car going on the hot wheels track so its easier to see
"What an amazing, incredible idea!! It looks wonderful!"
I wish crunch labs was around when I was a kid. Legos on roids
that is just so cool
Okay grunkle Stan...
Was it a tour or an advertisment
Kiwi co watching this video like🤨🤨😶😲😬
I bought this the first one I added a stronger battery and a bigger mag and I made a mag that holds more discs
He thinks of everything
"Firefighters – – not ""firemen"" – – don't use their hands on the pole. They hook their elbows around it while wearing a long sleeve shirt. That is why they can get down very fast. It also helps the firefighters poles are made of brass and kept polished so there is much less resistance than some painted green pole on the playground."
"Yup in case anyone's wondering, that's MKBHD"
It just needs a robot that cleans the place or collects the nerf ammo

The only thing missing to the moment when he’s in his office is a classic catchphrase “To the Batcave!” cue the theme song music or any other theme song without the catchphrase would do.
In a country like Bangladesh its hard to get anything shipped from overseas. Let alone monthly shipment. I'm an engineer and I'd like to get my niece more excited about engineering. He already learned to program a Sphero mini. Please consider selling the boxes as individual packs. Love your content.
My dog would still catch those tennis balls 😂
What a banger of a video-just like your Mark’s theme.
lil problem at 6:26 anyone can guess that there is something behind bookshelf cause of light comming out from bottom
Mark it is incredible what you have done...and one can only image what is to come.  You are an inspiration to Put your mind to it and it can be done. And the royal fat Gus.... hahaha.
who needs bombs you have super sonic tennis balls
My son and I love you mark! Thank you so much! ❤️

Mark we need squirrel maze 3.0
Its like real-life Dexters laboratory. You just need a blond sister to break stuff
wanna test 375 on that firemans piston?
"also with the toilet seat does it work if you only lower the ""butt ring"" part. Not sure what its called XD"
I'm so jealous i want the fireman's piston.😲😲😲
I’m going to be homeschooling my daughter this year so these kits would be such a fun monthly activity for her to do! She’s going to love this!
WOW
low key kinda cool i would not wanna work there not the most professional plus ima be a underwater welder so yknow
Rip KiwiCo
Missed a easy one with fireman's pulley
Where do you get the funding?!
He's literally Willy Wonka.
You have the best ideas.
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
an actual walking W
"Fireman's pole or piston, it doesn't make things sound better does it..."
"Mark: I have a secret lab!
This video: *is #1 on youtube trending*"
You make me want to be a KID again.
"2:35
There is something that behaves like that giving you constant resistance no matter the weight, for straps in wall climbing venues, not sure how that thing works, but i doubt it has a huge cylinder, so it seems more efficient"
Yo imagine walking into that office to deliver something and going “ what’s the light under your bookshelf?”
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOool
zelda breath of the wild
SWEET!!
What you do for kids is remarkable!
It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.
Looks just like Dude Perfect headquarters but with more tools...
Crunch lab is literally kiwi co
Willy wonka in real life is mark
I wanna come over and play!!
I bet a conservative would have a panic attack if they found out their kid was inspired by a cool dude like Mark since they hate science so much 😂🤣
"Everytime Mark uploads a video, my admiration and respect for him grows even more. You're an awesome guy Mark! Keep it up....Massive respect"
This is every kids dream including mine.
it isn’t so secret anymore now is it mark
The world needs more Mark Robers. This is the start of something huge. Probably much larger than anyone could imagine. Congratulations to all involved.
Mark rober day
Yasss
Mark I have a question are you a cristin or non religious
Well effing done Mark
I want to *SO* work here
The Watermelon 🤌🤌
"It’s not like anyone would find this! 

*even though I posted it to 22m people.*"
"Mark: “I know what you’re thinking. It’s not exactly secret now that I’ve shown 20 Million people”

The video with 6 million views: *_*Clears throat_**"
mark your secret door kinda showing the light below.which may give away the secret.
"Mark: “I know what you’re thinking. It’s not exactly secret now that I’ve shown 20 Million people”

The video with 6 million views: **_Clears throat_**"
Worldwide?
"Mark: “I know what you’re thinking. It’s not exactly secret now that I’ve shown 20 Million people”

The video with 6 million views: *_”Ahem”_*"
By the way is there a queen ant?
That's pretty neat 💎
"Mark: “I know what you’re thinking. It’s not exactly secret now that I’ve shown 20 Million people”

The video: **6 Million views**"
ON THE FIRST DAY!
damm number 1 on trending damm
dude i wanat the ticket but i don't think ill win
I love this
"Mark, I have a pitch to fix our recycling problem, I just need a way to learn to design and build my own machinery but I am far too ypung, I know you do 't really read comments on your videos but I just said it any way... I am not even out of high school yet and I have so many ideas but no way to test in small scale or put them to use.. If anyone else reads this and has an idea on what I ahould, let me know."
"Another upload oooooo


Sounds sarcastic but no"
This is the new era for Mark robber!
"Dude I'm an adult older than you and I want to do this even though it's meant for kids.  It took most of my life for me to be brave enough to finally learn what I want to learn, automotive. So last year I finally after achieving some huge financial goals finally started on that journey. I found you through the glitter bombs videos and ever since have been hooked. You have a heart of gold to get young people interested and evolved into this world and I wish that I had an influence like you when I was young. Keep going and keep doing what your doing!"
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
Gotta manage the light leakage under the bookshelf in the dusty office.
I knew it would be restricted to Americans 🙄
😮
Amazingly cool

Mark @6:26 see light from secret passage :P
Bro the ward house would be stock to the brim
I don’t see ANY funko pops bro
kiwico be like
6:28 sorry mark but you can see the lights at the bottom of the shelf
"Mark, you're amazing!! I wish there was someone like you when I was a kid, to spark my imagination and help me figure out things I dont understand.

I get chills watching you present the Crunch Labs box, seeing how much pain and frustration I could have avoided when playing around with engineering myself 🤣

I'm very happy and excited to see the next generation of engineers!"
We NEED more people like mark out their.
#1 ON TRENDING!
He vsauced it
"You bought the Fantasy Factory, didn’t you Mark? That’s Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory."
o
Every Mark Rober video restores my passion to keep pursuing my studies as an engineering student.
I appreciate the fact that he uses pvz original music in the background sometimes
my jaw dropped when I saw the first frame of this video
Looks super cool
Mark you are amazing beyond any word can describe!!
ok now put 200 hot wheels on the track at once
Hey Mark only one of the plans allows for a day to spend with you is that just a typo?
Why are you yelling?
Epic
but the blue light shines under the bookcase
Today I'm feeling really sad because my rabbit got stolen and I cried a lot and I saw your video and your video made me smile thanks to mark rober
"“But first before I let you see if I lived,”"
"Okay, all things aside, who's your main street fighter mark?"
If I made something this cool I would never be able to keep it a secret for years lol
Genius... making geniuses!
KiwiRo
Mark let me come engineer and build something.
"You're like one of the best people on this planet. Keep on doing what you're doing, you're amazing."
#1 ON TRENDING
Your doing great things mark
1# trending... WOW
"What if you attach the pullie to your hands into a glove-like contraption, still giving the allusion of going down the pole?"
Greatest YouTuber of all time keep up the great work Mr Rober
"He’s like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base and special gadgets"
this guy is literally an irl cartoon
isn’t this what kiwico did??    they even sponsored you how can you do this 🤣
I’m being serious I guessed it would be accessed thought that ornament XD
This is like Mark's Meow Wolf
This is awesome. I'm really glad you got the opportunity to build such a cool shrine to engineering and the creative process
I mean we were totally not gonna sneak into your house and find the secret door to your warehouse😁😁😁
Just imagine having a rope elevator on your staircase and walking down it like you are a secret agent from a movie
My dude became the Willy Wonka of engineers. I love it.
Wish you'd been around when I was growing up. I figure how to make things work all the time.
Nice work !  Please make a French version of your build box !
really enjoyed your video!
MKBHD!
mark not wearing a helmet
"Crunchy Labs ;)

✅The Colour

✅The crunch
❌Just needs the roll"
I have been watching your channel for 4 years and still u are my favourite youtuber
yea wow cool but the point of this is to have it a secret so fail.
Bruh dudes playing minecraft IRL
You're wonderful.
the underneath the Shelf
Is there an age limit to enlist in these classes?
7:32
"Dude I'm an adult older than you and I want to do this even though it's meant for kids.  It took most of my life for me to be brave enough to finally learn what I want to learn, automotive.

This is wonderful! I always enjoy your videos. Thanks for sharing your passion for science.
Kiwi co about to go bankrupt
i love this fr
Lol is no one going to talk about the fact that one of the projects is basically a kids claymore??
"I love your content, you are doing amazing work! Just wanted to point out that you stole Kiwico's (one of your earlier sponsors) idea of mail order projects. I'm sure there is a conversation there where you have their blessing (I hope)."
It is not secret anymore
This is so freaking cool. Huge respect to you for being so passionate about teaching others and getting them excited about science.
"""Failure the best teacher is"" - Master Yoda"
"I would've had a better childhood if I had these kind of toys. Even now as an adult, I'd rather choose them over any other type of entertainment. 
Also, the Crunch Labs is really well made! I love all its features, especially the piston that enables you to do superhero landings. 😎"
NO THE GONG ITS NOT WARMED UP AND YOU JUST BONKED IT AHHH
So you made an enemy out of Kiwiko?
half life 2 dr kleiners lab be like:
Toys? I see junk
you should make sure your camera is level on the crunch labs set lol
Yes
This is so freaking cool. Huge respect to you for being so passionate about teaching others and getting them excited about science.
"This is so inspiring, your videos bring me so much joy and I am always learning because of them ❤️"
6:43 secret passage so secret it even glows underneath the bookshelf as a natural deterrent. (mostly a joke ily.)
If I were a kid I would watch this religiously.
What state do you live in
"Seeing Nitro again firing tennis balls, , , , makes me want a time-traveling Delorean to get back to 1986 or 1988 , , ,I appreciate how much better life was then , , compared to the compost-heap of today's hopeless struggles , so f- ing dismal today , , ,😞😕🤨🎲"
So if your a subscriber then the dart lands on me then I get to go check out the crunch lab
Least imaginative secret entrance ever
You already know mark rober is up to somethhjng
"Really well done, I wish you much success in the future!"
"I have to say Mark, you have encouraged my passion about engineering. I have a big goal set (mechanical engineer at Nasa), and your mechanisms and creativity really inspired me to use my skills to better the future world. I have graduated a year early, and I am about to start my engineering career in College (UAH), and I hope that you continue to post these awesome contraptions to further motivate me during those years.

(I could use a letter of recommendation from you in around 5 years lol)"
uou should create a pulley that also brings you up
This is amazing! Love your videos
"I always say ""I'm not a mad scientist I just play one on the internet.""
It's such an inspiration to see the real deal though!"
Is this the Fantasy Factory?!!
I was definitely not expecting any of this.. although im not disappointed either 🤣
At 6:26 you can see light under the shelf. Suspicious
"He’s like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base and special gadgets"
Nice outro
Its not so secret when I can clearly see a bright light shining at the bottom of your bookshelf 😂😂😂
Only Mark Rover would make a better version of a fireman’s pole and make it something you can ride
Next: making a meteor and testing if it can end the world
I’m still waiting for #1
Genius.
"He’s like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base and special gadgets"
"3:48
You did what 😀"
This is like Rob Dyrdeks fantasy factory but for engineers!
"Mark unless one of your niece and nephew's other uncles is Father Christmas himself, I think you already won the favourite uncle title. By like, a lot."
Does anyone need reactions click the icon
So mark pretty much just copied kiwiCo and made it better.
Mark I want to make Nuclear Fusion can we do that together?
Mf finna become a superhero 💀
A Dude Perfect Lab for geniuses. Wow!
I wish he was my cool uncle 🥺
You could have hid the light under the bookcase
"He’s like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base and special gadgets"
"Just got the box but was wondering is digital Dudz ever coming back, they are really hard to find now"
Idk why but this video brings back alot of childhood memories. so thanks!
Can you ship a box into the province of thr Philippines?
Can you please design and engineer some maglev tires for cars so we can get off fossil fuels and also have flying cars?
Mark is the kinda guy that restores my faith in humanity bit by bit
This could be the coolest thing I've ever seen.
"This video is just Mark flexing, and I love it."
And the bright light coming from under the bookshelf
Gives me Rob Dyrdek Fantasy Factory vibes. I’m here for it
Holy crap… I just  wanna BE you! This is amazing
You can see light shining beneath the bookcase entrance...
gosh everything is so amazing🗿
Its not fat gus its fantastic gus MARK
"I hope this coexists with Kiwi Co, but it looks super cool!"
Next make fred bear
Imagine having one of only secret entrances on your property and telling over 6.5 million people.
I can see Crunch Labs becoming so much bigger! Mark you've really done it this time!
Incredible!
Every Villain secret hideout be like:
I wonder how long it took him to learn to be dude perfect and hit those trick shots
Mark Rober never ceases to amaze me
What other uncle could mark possibly be competing with to be the cool uncle
"How funny, I just do happen to also know the exact location of where this video was recorded."
Was that MKBHD and the frisbee?
#7 I kept shouting “Ball pit! Ball pit! Ball pit! Ball pit! Ball pit! Ball pit!” 😂
The world would have been a different place altogether had engineering being taught by someone like Mark.
Glad Ur getting what u want in life keep doing u xo
This is if Entertainment 720 went to college
I know this is random I don't know why you look like the real life Ash Ketchum
I like how you can see light under the secret door to the lab
Secrets aren't secrets when everyone knows.....
"Mark since you use an ardino in the video, teach me how to use proteus!"
Just gonna be honest. I’m a full grown adult and am definitely signing up for this.
pov: my minecraft base
Bro how much money do you have lmao
The bright light under the bookshelf kind of gives it away lol. I want secret tunnels in my home one day.
"I love this! I use to have science lab-in my backyard every other Sat. I had a great microscope and all the kids in the neighborhood would come and put things under the microscope, they were so psyched about how it looked. I hope I turned out a few scientists"
but what happens if someone actually wants diet pepsi?
"Should use an automatic faucet and a sensor to detect when it activates. 
This would require the user to put their hand under the tap instead of just touching the handle and walking out."
This is my childhood dream
For anyone who sees this I am sad to say that the single month box it is already sold out
"I don't even have kids, but that box is a great idea."
Mark is one of our few heroes to help shape up the next generation.
You should put a frame around the tennis ball hole
i love this guy
There's team seas and team trees but what about team skys where every dollar repairs a bit of the ozone layer
When I see US residents only 💀💀💀
Your the best
Woow Mark has just achieved our dreams from our childhood....
Kiwico
MKBHD lets go! haha
"It was pretty smart of Mark to make the secret entrance button diet Pepsi, because he knew that nobody would ever choose diet Pepsi."
Now I know your secret mark
I love your videos
I really want to build something like this when I grow up
This would be a nice destination for an educational field trip
Mumbo Jumbo but in real life.
I bet you could be a billionaire if you wanted to
My jaw dropped for the entirety of this video 😲
You make the best videos
Congrats on #1 on trending
I feel like the no wash hands siren should play a rickroll
…not yet OSHA rated
"You're so amazing Mark, I've been watching these amazing vids since 2018"
How to defeat the bathrooms engineering. Don’t close the door all the way
LOOKS FUN
LOOKS FUN
Mark I am lost for words. You are an inspiration to so many and I want you to know how much I value your content. Thank you <3
those crunch lab kits are epic!!! thanks bro❣️❣️❣️
Nice
"The second I saw the cannon, I thought ""hey! that's just like the one from Americ-"" then Nitro was there, and my life is now complete."
The ant farm is my favorite
NITRO!!!!!!!
my boss should try this
MKBHD cameo
Mark Rober is so cool
Wait 😨 now I don't have to go to Harvard to use one if those chairs 😅
Wonderful video.
There was steam coming out of that hole
The light under the bookshelf: I'm about to ruin this man's whole career.
Dude built the science version of the fantasy factory
"Have you been to any of the Meow Wolf installments? If not, you must. Your lab has a definite Meow Wolf feel. It's amazing."
KiwiCo did not like this video
I wonder how he hid the outside of the warehouse so people don't know how big the building is
Mark robers fantasy factory
"Holy crap, Mark.  That crunch box system is going to make you so freaking wealthy, you are going to freak."
Mark is turning childhood dreams into reality. Like who didn’t imagine having a secret entrance to your favorite room?
@Puffin cope harder
@Jojough I just stated a fact... I do have better vids...
"@Puffin According to 'your' channel, you aren't even the content creator. I'm not sure what your goal is, but the best way to respect someone's memory isn't to use their Youtube channel to make comments on random videos claiming his were better. The channel isn't going to grow if there aren't any new videos posted, so I think it would be better to leave it alone, at least preserve what made the channel his. I'm not sure how you relate to him, seeing how you have access to the channel and account, but I'm sorry for your loss."
@Puffin I have a better ratio then you
I have better videos then mark rover...
Except you can see the light coming from underneath the bookcase.
"I don't agree with the toilet cover though. Why should men put it down? Women, If it's up put it down and use it, and men, if it's down put it up and use it!
I don't understand what's the big deal about it?"
I LOVE SECRET STUFF LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!
Mark Rober is the next Bill Nye.
I love you put the plants vs zombies roof music in the backround
4:43 Go doggy!
Did he practically buy out Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory? 😁
Mark is slowly becoming batman
Someone who is new to Mark Rober: Huh? how tf did he do th- Me: Shut up I'm watching Mark explain a half mile hot wheels track.
I'm gonna try to build that disc launcher thing with stuff around my house. Muahah.
I'm gonna try to build that disc launcher thing with stuff around my house. Muahah.
I have so much of a love and hate with all of these videos I love to see everything they can do but I don't think I'll ever be able to do anything with my life now.
I couldn't finish the video. Enjoy
I love the enthusiasm and easy-going nature of these videos! Definitely will be ordering the Crunch Labs kits for my daughter. There's nothing like building your own toys and having fun with them to foster the creativity and curiosity that I think is so important for kids (and adults) to grow.
Want that😔
:O
You should engineer spy gear for kids. I remember loving my spy gear suit case that shot rubber projectiles in the early 2000’s
I wish Mark Rober was my uncle lol
I love every time you make one of your videos there so cool and inspiring
This is a true adult fun house
No thank you for making something worth watching and to strive towards. I hope I win one day.
"Okay, because he mention team trees and team seas, what if there was a team breeze that like helped decrease air pollution. The 3 atmospheres have their team for cleaning"
"Did...  You use the Plants vs. Zombies soundtrack?

YOU DID!"
Just so cool!
Tony Stark vibes?
OMG that's so cool! This is why I love all of your videos and you now have your own warehouse like other youtubers but you're 1 of my favorite youtubers in the world because of science which I love a lot so thank you for everything and for teaching us a lot for you So I hope you have a fun experience making this video and everything so thank you very much!😍😘😊😊😊😊😁💕💕
Yo this is #1 on trending.
YES!!!!  He FINALLY did it!!!!
Also got any tips to make my own laboratory
AHHH ANOTHER MARK ROBER VIDEO
lol crunchyroll rip off
"You do realize that by divulging the secret it is by definition no longer a secret, correct?"
FAT GUS PLUSHY!!!
mi preganz
What if somebody moves the foam bit before the jump 😳
"some buggy flgs on the builder container so not to miss it, i know i would miss hahaha"
Congrats on 1 st on trending
I wish it was offered in different languages. Like french.
The whole time I was watching this I wanted to tour the factory and I hope I can get lucky with the ticket
Crunch box should be in school!
"The amount of time you put into each video is incredible, and I'm all for it"
@mark rober fix that. glaring light coming from behind your secret lobby entrance for the make over.
16:10 GIVE.ME.THAT.UBER.
Wait you know mkbhd and mrwhosetheboss wth...😂😂

Am I the only one who thinks him and Elon could change the word together?

Gravity Falls (2012)
I want to live there
Well what can I say “smart YouTube?”
"If aliens ever come to earth, I want this guy to be our species champion as he exemplifies all the qualities that make us uniqe from any other species on this planet."
Im now going to RT. a middle school for engineering.
Loved the video and ordered a box for my dad. Hope it goes well
"Me, a teenager: imma need that crunchbox"
Coolest living person on earth!! Mark Rober
You must collab with hack Smith and create some stuff
I've seen you make glitter bombs to catch porch pirates but what about some way to catch poeple that drop things in others drinks like a roofy catcher
instead of a work bench you should have it showcase a giant statue so it looks cooler and makes it more of a secret superhero room
"Hey Mark I was wonder if we could soon get something for older kids, I personally wanna be an engineer and I am 16 and it would be great if I could do some of these things but just wish for them to be a little more complex and really get me thinking"
cool
Mark copy kiwico with the crunch box
"LOL. Mark, you're silly. 

That's not a criticism."
I thought you had a meth lab in there
"You make science, learning, and engineering so darn cool, and fun for every age. What an inspiration for the generations to come, and such entertainment for the ones before."
You are wearing the catcher gear that I have
"Very cool, get these new gens creating great things...love the channel"
great
What's the relationship between KiwiCo and Crunch Labs? Seems like you copied one of your longtime sponsors...
"Honestly, people like this give me far more faith for humanity."
yo i saw this in my dreams
mark really does wonders for all of us... I'd love to be in that epic hangout!!
You can’t convince me this isn’t an upgraded Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory.
Mark Rober’s Fantasy Factory
"Mark, please don't just pretend that KiwiCo doesn't exist... explain why yours is different, why it's better, etc.  But don't just turn a cold shoulder, particularity since you've worked with them in the past."
I agree. This was very disappointing
"Mark engineer percsise says 20 million 
My brain:but you have 22 million"
So I’m guessing the boxes aren’t available for Europe?
"I love the video, but I’ve always wondered what classes you took in high school and college? What did you master in college as a student and how hard did you have to work? Keep working hard, love the effort you put in the videos!"
"Also hope they'll properly look after those ant bois, not an easy creature to raise and care for."
Mark engineer and is percise
Love it
what an amazing guy
ima actually check out that like lol (i posted this when I finished the vid and the other one when I say 11:16
Heck I’m a granddad and I want to think like an engineer too. Sooo…
"Hackers, please set off sirens across Russia at 3 AM each morning so parents can empathize with Ukranian parents."
Willy Wonka
I’d love to have a legacy like you
"So the blue light shining under the book case isn't a dead  giveaway, lol."
"So YouTuber run kiwi co, sounds okay"
Hi
You're amazing mark 😃
If a museum ever lets Mark redesign their science exhibits for kids.... HOLY HERA.
What his lab is in like California and someone lives in north Caroline
Hi Mark Rober I really love watching your videos
You're gonna be the new Bill Nye the Science Guy.
What happens if you are in Canada??
Hey mark does it have portuguese translation? I want to buy it to my sis but brazil you know.
I love Mark Rober's Willy Wonka arc.
"You rule. Love seeing people use their engineering skills to think outside the box. SO rewarding to see someone taking it to not just the next level, but a whole other level!!!!!"
Kiwi co: -.-
"I can guarantee marks son loves that place sooo much, I also have a son the same age with asd and I know he would have the time of his life in a spot where there’s so many fun things to do 😊"
Number 9 would be my brother's dream.
You better offer a family value pack for up to six members Cause I have three other siblings
This reminds me of google’s workplace
The entire point of this 20 minute video was really just to advertise his new STEM box
Imagine jumping but you realize the container is not there.
You should give the cannon to Johnny Knoxville lol
"Congrats Mark, this is the coolest thing I've seen since fantasy factory."
mark is what a hairlip dog says
I feel like the moment Mark releases a video YouTube just immediately gives the video the #1 On Trending thing because it always happens anyway.
"Wish there was away to give this video, idea and program ... two thumbs up!!!!! Thanks"
"KiwiCo, but mark rober style"
"I love this concept, and I understand high production costs for a first run of something like this, but its not very accessible. $25 a month/$300 annually just isn't something that most parents I know can afford. It would be cool to see a scholarship program or something to at least acknowledge the gate keeping aspect of that when you say your goal is to share engineering and inspire kids."
"I've been watching your videos for 6 years, your videos truly inspire me. Now I'm a Civil engineer. Thank you."
Great. Now I want you to be my uncle
This is crazy
You always are #1 on trending
"wow dude. making child hood dreams come true.

plus tools. stay awesome"
Im an adult  and im definitely spending my pay check on crunch labs boxes i dont have any kids
When Mark said solving problems to overcome and become better soccer player or piano player I paused the video and said who needs to become a better piano player when you have chopsticks
This episode was sponsored by kiwi co
3:47 you what
किसी भी काम मे जब भी Motivation कम होने लगें तब अपने माता पिता के तरफ देखना और फिर मनहत करना👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦.
My dream is to become an engineer in disguise got me for what I need to do
Hey mark you always make my day when you post I always am so happy to even rewatch your videos and I love your content keep on doing what you’re doing. you just make it so much better I really wish to see you out there if I get the platinum ticket hope you respond. Also I also dream to be a NASA a worker and be like you after
This totally makes me wish I was a kid today seeing this.  The inspiration abounds.  Alas I saw nothing as inspiring as a Mark Rober video when I was a kid.
pl i love to be like you mark you make me me
thank you for sharing
Mark is creating all of our childhood desires every video
Mad props on the train horn!
i love the pvz roof music
Gravity falls vibes 🤧
We don't need school we need mark rober

Blank Check starring Mark Rober hahaha so similar
The Willy Wonka of science!
Mark is a true capitalist.

Genius.
Cool 😎
You can see the light under the book cases.
I want to visit you
"But you got light coming from the bottom of the bookcase, bro."
GIT GUD

"I am so jealous of this, I want it😍😍😍"
#1 on trending sheesh
MKBHD's entrance was equally surprising
"That Is Awesome, keep up the great work. Love the vids"
Mark this is amazing! I’m so excited for the generation under me to experience this
Light shows under bookshelf.
The next generation will be watching Mark Rober videos instead of Bill nye
My lottery indulgence is to build a network of secret doors and rooms and passageways.
"I feel like if I was in this place I'd anticipate the foam pit being somewhere where it isn't and break my neck, pretty cool place though."
"This ladies & gents, Boys & Girls is how you talk the talk, walk the walk, and achieve excellence by example. Great Job Mr Rober !!!"
cool
so ur saying the only thing thats preventing me from opening the door is closing the toilet all the way? well dam. i guess the door is getting kicked down.
3:24 what's the music called ?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dude your currently number 1 on trending
You should see about schools using your crunch labs to teach engineering to kids.
How does one get a job at crunch labs?
Now we just need older ages for the boxes like 16
Bruhhh I wish Mark's youtube channel existed when I was a kid and had a lot of time to make these cool stuff.
this is so cool but im broke and cant afford the box i have to save my money now i wish i win the ticket
This is beyond my imagination
"This is awesome. The next accomplishment, founding a low-cost engineering college."
I saw that watching gravity falls can't fool me
Make it less money for that box it is to much money
That is awesome bro!
"Mark ""Willy Wonka"" and the Crunch Labs Factory. One of you will win the ""golden"" platinum ticket and tour his wonkey factory, I love it!"
"theres team trees and team seas, where the *non kid friendly word insert* is team bees?!"
So you basically made your own Fantasy Factory lol.
Always top notch content... helping yah with the algorithm ...keep up the great work....
This is going to sell out and go for crazy money
Nitroooooo!  This is awesome
Is a platinum ticket better than a golden ticket?
It's not a secret room enymore the whole world saw that 😄

Hey mark can I get a discount code?
Mark Rober I want to be like you
only mark would take a run up to front flip off a 2nd story balcony XD
You have actually help inspire me to be an engineer
I didn't realise you invented those costumes. I've still got one I purchased years ago 😲
"Okay, can i plz get the blueprints for the mirrors and the piston?"
Mark Rober is a gift to humanity.
Reminds of the fantasy factory miss that show
Can you make some ultimate frisbee related engineering videos??
How about a little credit to the people that actually build this stuff? You did all this by yourself?
Dude perfect nerf battle collab needed
I swear he is going to open a portal to a different dimension

The Plants Vs. Zombies remix music had me
"Hey Mark, I thought it would be cool if you designed a watch that vibrates to the beat of any song, so hopeless dancers can look cool"
This is literally everyones dream as a kid
Mark there's no point in making a secret lab and then publicizing it on YouTube all the burgalers are watching this vid.
When you forget the foam pit is moved
Cool lab
"""my brother built this and this, oh we stole this from denny's."""
i HAVE that one red nerf pistol that by the nerf ultra (white gun)

Can i have it ?
Is that Pepsi entrance a nod to spy's like us? Lol
how do u construct the firesman piston?
this mans just raising the bar every video
what age did you start working twords becoming an engineer and how long did it take
6:26 is it just me or can you see the lights shining through the under the bookshelf?
THATS awesome but can u make the crunch lab cheaper plz😭😁

#0 coolest thing about crunchlabs: Mark Rober
The Plants vs Zombies soundtrack running in the background ❤️
So neat
True equality is if I have to put the seat up a women needs to put the seat down.

Dang it. My dream supervillain lab exists and I can never go there.
And why is that?
Get the Jackass guys to go against that tennis ball cannon.
Is mark going to bring back his twin brother who he's been pretending to be back from an alternate dimension or something now
Can we just get an engineering box like this for adults? :( but congrats on the new lab and the new kid friendly boxes!
If mr magorium wonder emporium was a real thing
You didn't say why it was called the crunch labs
"mark rober, you are the only person I would trust to make a batcave."
RIP diet Pepsi enjoyers
... wow
Bro is literally giving super weapons to kids (I saw the red ball claymore trap in the video)
Wish I had a place like this 🤧 FYI you need something on the bottom of that shelf because you can clearly see there is something behind it lol.
Everyone would wish mark was their uncle
Did anyone else think Mark's ultimate frisbee player friend looked like Marques Brownlee?

Congrats on trending!!!
"What an awesome video! Cant wait to sit the wife and kiddos down and watch this together later. Also Mark, i may not be a guest at the warehouse, but i have a project id love to bring to light. I want to design a system that makes motorcycles safer, wether it be from and accident, or preventing an accident."
Every kids dream
Here's a cool idea.. make an egg cracker that doesn't get any shell into your food
I wish I was young enough to do this! That's super cool!
What an amazing engineer. He is my inspiration and he encouraged me to be an engineer and he is my number one favorite YouTuber
This is one of the coolest videos I’ve ever seen.
The answer is give Mark money lolol how convenient for him.
"When I see a new video from you, its just like finding GOLD!"
U just told the world where it is and how to get in
HEEE LIVVEESS!
"Sir please I have a problem with energy but to give a brief idea,
Please could you explain anti gravity and is there a device to cancel it out.
Also how can the density of heavy object be reduced to nothing. Like how can volume be made nothing 
I guess ..."
For the toilet Barney from How I Met your Mother had the best invention where the toilet won't go down.
Has anyone checked on kiwico to see if they're ok?
only mark would make a 17 min video flexing his new warehouse
the thing that gives away the lab is the bright light under the bookshelf
I just watched an 17 min advertisement
Have your version of the fireman's pole generate some electricity to store for other projects or something. lol
"""hey kid y-you wanna twist this?'"""
My geography teacher made us watch your sand hot tub video and i was suprised No one knew who yoh were
make more videos with da squirrels
That place is awesome
"Dude, I just have no words other then you're an awesome guy 👍. Love your videos and I think I'll be spending this weekend watching as much of your videos (again)(but) with my son. Thanks for all you do ... Seriously. Great channel, great content, great videos."
He's gone full Willy Wonka but with engineering instead of candy
"Congratulations, Mark!"
This is like Dude Perfect unveiling DPHQ2 😂
MAJOR Shark tank VIBES when it comes to the hallway
"This is the best video i saw in a long time, amazing mark"
Does this mean there is no more KiwiCo sponsorships 🤔😂
Yea sure secret behind the shelf room... nvm warehouse. Im sure nobody would notice that huge space from outside
"Monthly boxes are sold out already

Thanks anyway mark"
That wear house is a crazy as you can get
"Little problem with your capacitive touch sensor on the faucet...

Some of us prefer to take a bit of toilet paper into our hands to use the faucet and that would probably prevent the sensor from picking up your touch, but you'd be even more hygienic. Haha."
"I absolutely adore what you are doing, you have been a big reason as to why I am pursuing a career in Mechanical Engineering, just finished my Freshmen year of Uni. Thank you!"
I’m in Middle school and I want to be a architectural engineer
"Was going to say when I grow up I want to be like Mark but I’m already grown up 😢 Epic work, keep it up!!"
12:00 in the video my mom is going ot get this im so happy
"Feels weird to say since I don't know you personally, but I'm absolutely thrilled for you realizing your childhood dream :)"
I’m 10 and I love your videos
One of the bast  videos ever im so proud on how much work and effort he puts into these projects and bulids to entertain us and even makes it possible for us to exspirence it with us. I just wanted to give you a big Thank you.
Mark went and betrayed kiwi Co XD
This is so freaking cool. Huge respect to you for being so passionate about teaching others and getting them excited about science.
This place is giving me mystery shack vibes with the secret passage and the showcasing of stuff he has
What a great way to grow people's desire to science and engineering.
*Gravity falls*
Dope on so many levels you should get Elon out there!
You're number one on trending.
It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.
thats just called study engineering at uni or college ahahaha
Me who is 15 hehehe i am still child
@CLove511 That’s why I went to school to design bridges
"@John Beauvais Yeah, but after 5 years of hard work, it pays off when you get to spend 80 hours a week designing toilet hinges that people all over the world will never see and pay your boss tons of money for"
That would be amazing
Great room look fun for my 7 boys.   I like the hot wheels track and the watermelon gun.
But does it ship worldwide?
I cant this is literary every childs dream how is this real
It's not a secret anymore now is it xD
"Mark, you’re such a boss"
"I think I speak for many. We need a ""How to"" on the fireman's piston!!
Such a cool design!"
mark recreates our child imaginations
I like how you try to teach kids respect bro
mark recreates our childhood dreams.
"I just love all the stuff that you do and I really apreciate your aproach to kids into engineering... Will you be shipping to México..?  the ""other company"" that has the same concept won´t..."
This place looks amazing. Did you happen to publish a how to on the fireman’s piston? That would be amazing.
Is crunch labs by Mark Rober available in the UK?
After saying you wanted to work for TinkerCrate and doing the domino robot with them in a previous episode you have set up a competing company

Mark is like a superhero who has all his trophies in his secret chambers warehouse haha
"Wow , beautiful 3D printer farm in the corner bro"
"Mark, you are such an inspiration !!"
Something tells me he won't get sponsorships from Kiwico anymore... He basically copied their entire business idea lol
Are you carbon offsetting this lab?
I think you already solidified yourself as “the favorite uncle” to not only your niece/nephew but most the people who stumble onto your videos.
no longer a secret
For the last 3 weeks I've been working on a woodworking shop and now I just feel discouraged because this is so much better than what I've been doing Like this is dame cool but like ya know
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
And this is where i build my nukes
He seems so happy we love that.
The toilet seat is my favorite part
R.I.P. KiwiCo ;D
"Babe wake up, mark rober posted"
I feel like he's gotten in love with money
And when everyone is super no one is
I guess it’s not so secret now

your voice was so loud in the start
"In number 7,I don't know how to explain this but when mark runs his hat is straight and when he falls it's backwards Soooooooooooo yeah"
my jaw droped wile watching this video
Can we all appreciate 🙏 how much offer he put to make this video 👍
"Mark its honestly what you've built.
But I gotta say. As an electrician, it hurts me to see didn't have decora switches put in. 
I'm mean come... on toggle switches!!! 😄"
Next thing Mr.Beast and Mark are gonna save are the flees
If Mark can make a big secret base.. then I might be able to.. 😭

"Watching Mark makes me want to be a mechanical engineer, even though I am already a chemical engineer 😂"
"Big W, keep up the passion"
You are awesome! Crunch Boxes sound amazing!
Mark Rober is legit trying to put KiwiCo out of business.
If you are still on the quest to be the favorite uncle then I’ll never be loved
Would you ever consider making crunch labs for older people?
Why in the world would you put Pepsi buttons on a Coca-Cola box??????

"I have to say Mark, you have encouraged my passion about engineering. I have a big goal set (mechanical engineer at Nasa), and your mechanisms and creativity really inspired me to use my skills to better the future world. I have graduated a year early, and I am about to start my engineering career in College (UAH), and I hope that you continue to post these awesome contraptions to further motivate me during those years.

(I could use a letter of recommendation from you in around 5 years lol)"
"Wish I had had your motivation when i was your age. Hopefully I can inspire my daughter to take her life in her own hands and follow her dreams, even if they are hard or scary."
GREAT COMMENTS 👍
"I support you! One advice tho, think out of the routine like box!"
"My Aunt has been an engineer for Nasa in Houston, for about 30 years now.  
You got this!!"
"Work hard and do great things. I am a physician. I was an aerospace engineering major in college before I switched over to pre-med. Was always my dream to be an astronaut. Remember, perseverance, hard work, and the ability to self-learn overcomes and outperforms natural intellect 100% of the time if you want it badly enough. Work ethic is everything. Stay strong, and don't get discouraged. Remember your goals and don't forget them when it seems like they get lost in the pre-requisite curriculum during your first two years. You won't excel in everything. That's normal, and don't let it discourage you. That's not what matters. Never give up on yourself. Goals and work ethic are what matters. If you want it badly enough, you will have it."
Hey batman think Mark has got u beat
If I win a platinum ticket do I have to pay the plane ticket to California? 😅
"What I wonder, is how long it will take for the squirrels to get in?"
"Pepsi & Coca Cola = tooth decay

Your bookcase door is super obvious. It has bright light coming out from under it.
"How much is it to be apart of the crunch labs? And does it reach to Canada. Cuz I'm interested into asking my mom.

And also I used you for a project for school of one person we would like to meet cuz I think you are cool!"
This was cool and all but how does the secret door work!!?? This isn’t what I signed up for!! Cool lab but I wanna know!!
The bath room one made my brain steam up
"Just like kiwico, you don't deliver tô Brazil. Sad!"
What if I sit down peeing and don't watch my hands afterwards?
"I just made this SECRET lab, here is where it is and how to get in"
a mini claymore
Disappointed that the entrance wasn't a bust like the Adam West Batman ;-;
"Start of the video do be looking like breaking bad 
Jesse i build the Secret lab we are going to Cook meth"
Make a crank tv
Nitro!!!! I LOVED American Gladiators!
"You like Kiwico so much that you stole their idea, nice"
you should really play poly bridge 2
i'd spend an eth to go live in this thing for a month

Does anyone know what the watermelon death toll of mark robers videos is at? Id guess we're getting close to both world wars

Dude Perfect and Mark Rober are going to be in a relentless battle between who has the best warehouse soon.
Me and my dad love watching Mark Rober and seeing this filled me with such joy that I felt like a kid again and I didn’t even experience it in person! You’re an amazing person Mark keep doing what you do!
Can we all appreciate 🙏 how much offer he put to make this video 👍
I wish I can get one of the boxes and get the ticket but I'm probably not going to
Can you order these boxes to the UK?
ZELDA SOUND EFFECTS 🥵🥵😍😍
Failure is always an option

Except... we can see glowing light under the bookshelf.  Dead giveaway!

Absolutely awesome!
how can I get a crunch lab thing
These videos never cease to make me feel like a kid again. Keep up the great work and content!
"This is soooo cool!
It has always been my dream to have a giant secret warehouse."
You are such a huge inspiration to both the younger and older generations! I genuinely feel inspired and motivated to push on and get my own engineering degree. I'm sure I'm not the only one! You are AMAZING!
"I wish you all the best! You're an incredible person. You're smart, creative and funny! It is so important to motivate kids to learn science. My children love your videos, we all learn and have lots of fun!"
"Soon you'll have to do an advanced box with soldering, bread boards etc....even how to make an fpv drone!! That's one of my favorite things to do!!"
"I watched half of this vid, then went and made a airborne gun, from a car air horn and a broken impact took 7 hrs to do bc it wasn't working at first"
Why couldn’t I get my mechanical engineering internship this summer with mark! It would be awesome to work with someone so insightful and brilliant.
Why not connect the ends of the Hot Wheels® track together in an endless loop?
"Hi Mark
I'm an inventor with an inventor's mind. 
You may be an INFJ, that's an inventor personality type.  
I'd love to work with you. 
Hey, beyond that I thought it would be funny to make a remote control Slinky. 
I could NEVER get a Slinky to go down stairs, maybe just 3 steps,  but in the commercial it goes down a flight of stairs. 
There's my idea for you. I'd love to personally experience that and also the success of it working could help ease the pain of millions of Slinky owners around the world who could not get their stinken slinky to go down stairs. 
Thanks for understanding.  
Keep in touch if you want me to visit for a video."
You should get all the squirrels and adopt them and put them here
Am I the only one who thinks Mark kinda behaves like Jake Peralta from Brooklyn Nine-Nine?
Congrats on #1 on trending! :)
Gravity falls vibes
He just dribbled kiwico
Omg that’s a childhood dream
I've never watched an advertisement so long and that kept my attention until the end. Congratulations for the achievement! I'm sure you are making history!
Has crunch labs got a British site?
Sooooo... kiwico?
Wow this is awesome 😎
You should team up with StuffMadeHere

Solo imagina un enfrentamiento contra un super villano y Mark en este laboratorio
i miss the garage
"So eh, where's that gorgeous 60's/70's styled office going, now that it'll be replaced by some other inconspicuous front? Because I would not mind working there from home every day..."
Sorry hacked but higgins blossoming  from winds Pic with sound emails  work iffy
What was your job again? Being the coolest guy in the world?
Our little Dexter is all grown up. :)
This is wonderful! I always enjoy your videos. Thanks for sharing your passion for science.
Mark Rober makes me want to be a better science teacher. Keep up the inspiration!
As a diet cola guy i would definitely accidentally stumble upon the secret secret enterence
"Whoever’s reading this, I Pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen 🙏"
Thank you
"Dang mark, now u have to worry about deedee blowing your experiments to smithereens!"
Awkward glow coming from under the bookshelf is a DEAD giveaway
You’ll see
One day mark your robots are gonna take over the world
Now I want a Marvel Disney+ series where a variant of Mark Rober gets his hands on some discarded StarkTech XD.
You so cool
So cool
Was it there you filmed the domino video cause it looks familier
this guy is living the creative deam
Only mark would make the world longest hot wheel track because he is the goat and I love his vids he inspires me know I'm going to beg my parents for the crunchlabs product  mark is the smartest person In the world
How much did that cost!!!
I clearly made a career fail by not being an engineer
"Hey Mark!!!!!!, you wanna be my uncle!??, awesome project!, would love to work there every single day!!"
It's stuff like this that really makes me wish I was born in this most recent generation. Being a kid just seems so much more fun now than when I experienced it. I go to Walmart and see the toy aisle and I see all these things that I would have gone insane for as a kid.
Okay but the ant graveyard is so cute and sad/funny. 😂 Ants are awesome
"I wanna know, after a while will u do a phase two of the boxes?"
RIP Kiwi Co.

Wow! just Wow
Can kiwi co sue? How is this different than kiwi co
if ONLY i was young again and you were around doing videos like this 😪😪😪
"Number1 on trending, let's go"
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
Mark is like the coolest uncle one can ask for
u can see the light under the door lol
Mark are you copying kiwi co
So like the Fantasy Factory
The red chairs at 3:17 are also at my church; we have the same ones!!
"Train horns on a bicycle?!

My Dad an engineer also put a train horn on his 1965 Buick Wildcat. It was LOUD!
He also designed Space Deployable Radiator Panels for the Space Station. He also had many other inventions. He had the potential to be a great Dad. But his inventions were more important to him than his family. So I grew up mostly without a Dad eventhough he was home a lot. He was always out in the garage or at his desk working on his latest invention.  Never having tome for me. He never read to me or threw a ball with me. I would have loved it if he had.

Mark, don't be that Dad."
Every Mark Rober video restores my passion to keep pursuing my studies as an engineering student.
@Loui Handwerker Nice! I’m in civil engineering
@v101Titusville Thanks so much! I sure will
"Hey same here, I’m in electrical engineering what about u?"
"whatever it takes, keep it going!"
Is it inspired by Anne Frank’s secret annex?
i can just say WOW 😁💥
Bros turning into the new mrbeast
"Mark is really an amazing guy. Though really still a child at heart, he managed to persevere through his challenges in life and make something that has always been his dream since young, which I find is a very impressive feat. And of course, he never fails to entertain us with his interesting projects and storytelling:)"
why this #1 lol
"This is the coolest thing EVER! OMG! I wish I were ten again but even though I'm decades older, I still want to get a box and get started with engineering.
 
Folks like Mark, his team, colleagues and kindred spirits are quite possibly our only hope to save the (very broken, inequitable) educational system in the US by inspiring creativity, passion, and fun for STEM curricula, to help develop critical thinking skills and confidence to approach tough problems, to encourage others to balance their brain by developing the interpersonal skills needed to succeed and to make the planet a better place. 

Bravo to Mark and all his supporters!"
make something that hangs ur clothes up for you PLEASEEEE i’ll sell my soul
"You and Colinfurze should get together, it be epic."
ah yes gravity falls
Engineer gaming!
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and inter sting to watch."
The firemen's worst nightmare... The thinking toilet?
"I'm 35 and want to go play in the secret lab too.... lol

what's the target age for the boxes? My eldest is 6 so thinking maybe too young?"
Cool
This… is… awesome
"Mark, you're amazing!! I wish there was someone like you when I was a kid, to spark my imagination and help me figure out things I dont understand.
I get chills watching you present the Crunch Labs box, seeing how much pain and frustration I could have avoided when playing around with engineering myself 🤣
I'm very happy and excited to see the next generation of engineers!"
"Please, make a Rober Furze collab."
Bro this some Minecraft stuff
This whole video was amazing!
Can you ship to other countries?
US residents only😩
Ee
Congrats on trending Mark!
This is the definition of awesome.

Willy wonka engineering factory😂 mark definitely watched the new MrBeast video
Anyone else think the secret engineer lair looks like Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory without the skate ramp? Congrats Mark. It looks amazing.
"yes, because having no struggles with money and actually work with the science is easy and following pamphlet instructions is so hard"
problem-solvers? solving what how to look at a pamphlet
1# Youtuber
My daughter is so excited she wants to be a engineer and the kits are perfect and she always wanted the chance to meet Mark Rober!
"""U.S. citizens only"" 😞"
Bro is turning into grunkle stan
Bro I literally want a kid just so I can sign them up for Crunch Labs now lol. How cool!
11:-01 mark mentions the best creation (beyblade) ever
Dude it is about 106 dollars for not even 6 months
The box kind of seems like a rip off of tinker crate.
mark is one of the coolest humans on earth
Not trying to be mean but you can see the light under the door might wanna cover that up.
"I noticed that you used plants vs zombies music, cool!"
Yo Nitro from America Gladiators!!! 🇺🇸😅😂🤣
You’re just so amazing and inspirational! Love from UAE 🇦🇪
here I was thinking he made these things in his garage
Why did the piano just say see you soon
Reflection un the floor under the bookshelf
This is like Fantasy Factory for nerds! I love it!
You should devise a system that auto picks up nerf darts around the lab lol
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and inter sting to watch."
Now we need a team edge and mark rober collaboration with the foam pit
"Dude I'm an adult older than you and I want to do this even though it's meant for kids.  It took most of my life for me to be brave enough to finally learn what I want to learn, automotive. So last year I finally after achieving some huge financial goals finally started on that journey. I found you through the glitter bombs videos and ever since have been hooked. You have a heart of gold to get young people interested and evolved into this world and I wish that I had an influence like you when I was young. Keep going and keep doing what your doing!"
Very nice! Roblox videos are also cool
Yeah
Very well said!!
YOOOOOO NITRO .. he was my favorite too!!!
ONE OF THE BEST THING ABOUT DUDE IS THE HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE ACHIEVE SOMETHING . HE ALWAYS RESPECT US THE AUDIENCE AND HIS TEAM AND HE IS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT . MORE TO COME
What if you made a real life scale of SMB 1-1 and can control a real mario
"Love your new space, so thrilled to see your childhood dream come to fruition. I feel a lot of people will benefit from this magnificent and creative space."
Hiiiiii
"Mark isn’t a nerd, he’s the guy who started playing with rocket physics in his parents garage of course!"
"What, no Lionel 027 electric trains?!"
crunch labs sounds like one of thos healthy food things
Mark FNAF is becoming real with a online delivery service if they open a restaurant you should make the animatronics.
"People shouldnt complain about toilet seats, its not hard to put the seat down, but its also not hard to put it down if someone else forgets to."
"Mark, you can just tell us you're Batman. We already know, it'd just be nice to finally hear it."
"Love your new space, so thrilled to see your childhood dream come to fruition. I feel a lot of people will benefit from this magnificent and creative space."
I can't imagine these are OSHA approved
Hi mark In gonna ask my parents in the morning to do your course I love your videos and want to be an engineer 😁
Hi
RIP Kiwi Co
But I wanted to be my nephews favorite uncle :(   You're awesome Mark. Will you be my favorite uncle too? Count me in as a volunteer anytime you need a hand - I'm up to anything you'll need!
Imagine what you'd think discovering this abadonded 50 years from now.
The toy boxes
Can you get it from England
👍💯
"hhmmm, opening the door should flush the toilet and lower the lid automatically"
"Hi Mark, congratulations on this new and amazing project! I'd love to gift the kids in my family with these kits, so I can claim the spot of favorite 'uncle' as well! Is there any plans to expand the shipping availability to southern countries, especially Brazil?"
Gruncle stan
Do you think you could make your own school next? I would rather see my kids learn from here then actually colleges or as an extra curriculum 👍
"Wow, KiwiCo just got friendly fire from Mark Robber new Crunch Lab."
Willy wonka tickets 🎟😄
"Batman has his Bat Cave

The Avengers have Avengers Tower

"Hi Mark, congratulations on this new and amazing project! I'd love to gift the kids in my family with these kits, so I can claim the spot of favorite 'uncle' as well! Is there any plans to expand the shipping availability to southern countries, especially Brazil?"
I Like your voice
That’s super cool. The boxes are a great idea!
"One of the best thing about this dude is that he never takes creadat for him self when he achieve something he allows respect us,,,,"
mans really built a whole stark's garage in his house
this feels like those edited episodes...
My only regret is not making kids sooner. I'd love for my kids to get into this but alas they oldest is 2
Does crunch labs ship to UK?
Anyone gonna talk about the awesome retro office he built as an entrance?
That catch by marques was insane
This my house inja let me comeee
talk about marketing
"Mark, what of you got the platinum ticket but you lived in a different country to America?(I’m assuming that it’s in America)"
"The toilet sounds like a death trap tbh, what if the magnet fails and you get locked in?"
Your just amazing mark rober ;)
I loved American Gladiators
"Sometimes it means everything to hear a hero say it's okay to fail. As someone who clicked this video feeling like a failure working on my current project, hearing Mark say its not only okay but important to fail a bunch gave me the strength to keep going.  It's time to learn fast and keep moving forward."
Tbh I’d rather make a yt video
"Hi Mark, congratulations on this new and amazing project! I'd love to gift the kids in my family with these kits, so I can claim the spot of favorite 'uncle' as well! Is there any plans to expand the shipping availability to southern countries, especially Brazil?"
Light leaking below the secret door is not what you want see for others. :) They will know there is something behind.
how do I double like this?
EXCELLENT 💯 💯 💯 💯 💯
"""#1 ON TRENDING"""
What an incredible idea for a product! You’re a national treasure Mark. I hope my daughter will end up enjoying these toys
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeesr!!!
Mark your the prime example of ppl who don't drop out of schools and who study's hard and gets more than one degree at college. your one of the only ppl who can help gen z thx for keeping this generation smarter than it already was :).also that's not a bat cave its a mar-kave
That was more than a hint
"He Mark, You have inspired me so much. I have always had a passion for engineering and inventing but ever since I started watching you it has been a while other level. I truly wish to meet you someday. Thanks for this insane video"
06:26 you can see the light from under it
Wake up baby mark posted a new video
This video is the embodiment of all that I love about Mark Rober.
"W! O! W! Nice place, Mark! Congrats, brother!"
Thank you bringing down the tyrant scum.
This is awesome
I can't wait to get the Crunchlabs box! My little sister has loved all her Kiwico boxes and I know that she'll love this one too!
"Mark rober never fails to entertain. 
                UuuuuuSsssssss!!!!"
This is by far the coolest thing I've seen on youtube
I'm sure Kiwico will be so excited to see such an innovative new company!
Are you going to make squirrel obstacle course 3?
If you didn't think minecraft when he showed that secret door to the warehouse then ur well just how
You can be a professional Frisbee player? Really 😂
coolioooo
"It is heartbreaking to watch Mark's monthly contributions and wonder how we would thrive if we as a society had more in common with him.  ""We can't all be NASA engineers"" is not what I'm referring to.  Why does the desire to drag successful people down seem almost instinctive to so many?  We don't need more people with Mark's skills nearly as much as we would benefit from simply having more with his heart, and you don't need a degree for that."
This is literally my dream.
Ratio
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Mark is my favourite Engineer!
real life dexters lab
NUMBER ONE ON TRENDING
The most unsecretive secret door ever. Mark actually can build a weapon but only live and choose to build fun things
You need another door at the other end of the secret entrance because light gets through
"He really made it like a Willy Wonka's engineer factory.  Especially when he put a silver ticket to go to the factory, exactly like in the movies."
I'm 33 yo and I would like that box 😅
"If you are smart, you dont have to be elon musk. You can be mark robers"
I can literally that there's light beneath the shelf what the frock do you mean by a secret?! (JK really loves you videos)
Hoi Mark I live in the Netherlands so if I find the ticket what then; can I come to you lab?
awesome ideas dude.
When are you going to make a video about how to fix grocery cart wheels?
The boxes where like peace out I'm leaving
"When Mark Rober or MrBeast upload a video, you know it's going to be a banger!"
Mark the light is illuminating the floor from the secret passage at 6:27 lol

"at 9:23 he freaking took page outta Dude Perfect trick shots. You are so amazing Mark, i used to hate science but now I love it thanks to u. Keep making amazing videos to make all of us smile, you never fail to make me gasp in amazement at your work"
I'm sure Kiwico will be so excited to see such an innovative new company!
Juste WOW !!!

"He really made it like a Willy Wonka's engineer factory.  Especially when he put a silver ticket to go to the factory, exactly like in the movies."
OMG MARK! I saw that exact same red top-chair thingy at a store a little while back! That’s so cool!
"He’s like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base and special gadgets"
Like a kid friendly Batman.
"Marks content only gets better with every video. His engineering skills are truly phenomenal. Great job, Mark"
Editing skills and showmanship are on point too.
"And why don’t you redesign things like a door or a bed to help us or make new helpful things like light weight, re arrangeable shelves."
"Mark Rober some time ago: supporting KiwiCo
Mark Rober some time later: mmm, capitalism! ""For a long time, I've had parents reach out to me and..."""
When are you going to make a squirrel mage 3.0
"Secret door in an office, just ignore the massive warehouse on the outside, nothings in it hahah"

Wow this channel just gets getting better and better. Very impressed on how dedicated mark is for the next gen of engineers. Also a secret lab is dope too.

Is this actually Mr Beast's channel?
👉🏼♻️
really want to try these out but not sure my 5 yo is ready for that much thinking lol
Love this and while I support this 1000% I can't since both my kids are too young (6 & 2) and I literally don't have the funds to buy this for myself.
But there are lights under th3 bookshelf so you do know where the new lab is 🤔
"I would've loved these so much as a kid, I used to get these electronics kits from Hobby Lobby when I was a kid with brushless motors and switches and stuff to mess with, this would've blown my mind, I still want one lol"
Uhm you see the light from u Der the shelf so you can find it from the room haha
You can really see the light under the door
Is the guy in the fome pit from MKBHD???
THIS IS THE COOLEST THING IVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I LOVE CRUNCH LABS!!!
Gravity Falls reference lol
Sell out
Amazing I wish I had this as a kid
Next thing we know he's gonna end up creating the backrooms in real life!
"If Mark Rober became a world leader I would not be stressed out... Honestly, I would be happy knowing he would make the world a better place."
5:44 Mark rober really has his tissue the wrong way
so when will you release the golden tickets
I'd swear Mark Rober is Batman!!!
wait what if u moved the big foam pit and someone in the crew decides to jump in the other place and doesnt look before he jumps...
I would love to see Mark do a colab with Stuff Made Here
I like your style.
our boy using redstone.
just take a look at Elon Musk and SpaceX.....great example of failing to success with the rocket launches
The world needs more Mark Robers. This is the start of something huge. Probably much larger than anyone could imagine. Congratulations to all involved.
@Reese Collins 1000%
@unlokia what?
"yup, you can apply this brilliant method on every subject. kids don't get an education in public schools anymore, people like mark really help."
No we do not. One is far too much ego for a lifetime! 🤣
Congardulaitions*
"I know you're probably not gonna see this but I just want to say one thing you should do difficult boxes that have programming, electrical engineering, soldering, circuit diagrams and things like that because if they're anything like the Eureka crates they'll be really easy (: thanks"

You are the most unique person of the world :)

@Mark Rober you should try and do a video with @colinfurze i think that you two coyld came up with the cooleat anything that could be made
Mark I love what you’re doing but you need to have your crunch lab for babies (younger kids) AND then another option for grown men such as myself
reminds me of gta 5 online
It’s so cool seeing mark build and engineer so many cool things because it’s always been kind of my dream to beginner cool things like that. You keep being you mark
Ah so that's where all of his YouTube money is going
"I love how Mark realized that if KiwiCrate is making enough to sponsor youtube videos, then there is enough market there for him to make his own build crate box :). Taking existing ideas and changing them to be exactly what you want is what it is all about!"

Your so awesome at engineering! Keep up the great work Mark!

The problem with the system to determine if someone washed their hands is that it doesn't detect if someone neither flushed the toilet nor washed their hands.

I guess I'm not the only one who spotted the light shining through underneath the secret entrances?
"So your answer to the question ""How do I foster my child's interest in engineering?"" is... ""Let me make money out of it!"" But nice lab, though."
Do you have to be American to go to crunch lab or can you wait until you can fly to america
"Awesome Mark. I've been following you for quite some time now, and I really think you make all the process a very interesting and fun adventure. Please consider translating your content to Spanish, it would help a lot of children from around the globe to learn more with you. Thank you for your great work!"
No methlab? 😂🤭

Kiwi co go bruh!
Guy really Zuckerberged kiwiko

Ooohhh
Reminds me of Dexter's laboratory... watching it as a kid got me interested in science and technology and build cool things...I'm an engineer now and those early experiences are crucial....thanks for being that person for the next generation of young thinkers.
"this is such a mark robber to do, i wish he was my uncle, do you ship worldwide?"
Gl passing OCEA inspection.
Mark i Love your idea but you make feel like every creek and turn might lead to the place of the secret entrance even if I'm in Sweden and not in America
Mark Rober is who Elon Musk thinks he is.
Dude just finessed kiwico
I could see the light under the book shelf
Someone grew up on Dexter’s Lab

"What a beautiful homage to your legacy and so many others who helped pave the way. Yanno, like Gus lol"
HotWheels did some great engineering to keep the car stable no matter how fast it goes!
Only mark could make such banging videos month after month 🤪🤩🤩🤩🤩👍😛
Do you ship the crunch lab kits internationally?
There's light under the bookshelf...dead giveaway
"Hey Mark, any chance of opening the lab visit to non-US residents?"
I want to live here
Gruncle Stan
Nvm i mean tomorrow
This is the best 17 minute commercial I’ve ever watched.
I thought Chopsticks was gonna rickroll us
I'm already an engineer and think it'd be cool to get to spend a day in there - i can only imagine how exciting it'd be for someone young!
I really wan turk do this but my family doesn’t have the money so i hope i can some other day
Eller ikke You videos am så skræk bede til jul eller lige vel ikke en der video Amager fant

Hey Mark your 1 on trending
I love secret rooms always since i was a kid
Can you donate Money to Ryan Trahan and to help people that need food
Minecraft
I love that you inspire kids.  Where can I find some projects that can inspire adults.  I love the Engineering idea but I have no idea where to go.  I line that you are really busy but maybe you can help. Thanks for all the wonderful videos.
Hacksmith X Mark Rober collab when?
this is my dream
"Mark, you're amazing!! I wish there was someone like you when I was a kid, to spark my imagination and help me figure out things I dont understand.
I get chills watching you present the Crunch Labs box, seeing how much pain and frustration I could have avoided when playing around with engineering myself 🤣
I'm very happy and excited to see the next generation of engineers!"
i think i speak for us all when i say im living my life through. this was something that reminds me of everything in my childhood
What about Crunch Boxes for older teens who are interested in STEM?
I kinda wish I was 25 years younger.   Despite the fact that would mean going through Junior High again.
"Too bad, my mom immediately said NO!! As soon as i showed her the the video and the crunch box. TvT"
"Me ek youtuber hu or mere channel se apki help ho sakti he,🔥🔥🔥🔥🌋"
I’m 21 and just got this incredibly strong sensation to ask my mom for 300 bucks for this
Hiiiiiiii FINNALY I WILL NOW WATCH ALL YOuR VIDS AGAIN hope you happiness
Can you ship to the UK?
Is there worldwide shipping for the crunch lab kits?
"This is like the St. Louis City Museum, but awesomer. (The City Museum is pretty much 10 floors of this.)"
كومنت العربي الوحيد و لا ايه
Hi Mark . Someone will be able to see from under the door. When that part showed in the video I saw some light under the door
"Okay Grunkle Stan lmao


In all honesty, This was really cool Mark!"
Has a high tech lab. does not install a bidet or a shattaf 🤦
I bet even current engineering students would learn a lot from the cool projects!
i love this guy
chopsticks is amazing
bro he dyin

This just might be the coolest Mark Rober video ever! Can't wait to build these boxes with my nieces and hopefully get to come to the lab!!
"video about a secret on the internet

Crunch Labs is amazing!
"Ok, so you've built the batcave. When are you going to become Batman?"
Whoa
This is the smart man's version of the Fantasy Factory.
That office gave me Dark Knight rises vibes.
Pretending KiwiCo doesn’t exist and that you invented the idea was a sad move. Especially considering they sponsored you previously. Give credit to others.
But like kiwi co has the same things
"""When you have a friend who plays ultimate frisbee...""

*Casual Marques Brownlee appearance*"
Melted Aluminum ground wasp nest/fire ant colony on that shelf of toys. Very interesting.
I keep trying to show my brothers and sister this video but they won't watch it
"And Ladies and Gents, this is how Tomorrowland becomes reality! An another reality! :)"
7.51 so from now on no sponsors from kiwi ko i guess
Imagine what my house would look like if I asked Mark to build it...
Oh my 7 yo daughter would have loved the crunch box.... sad that it cant be delivered to Pakistan.... hope you expand your target market in the next run... although i just loved to see the cool toys that you showed... truth be told... i would have enjoyed working on these toys just as much... but i guess i'll suffice with watching the videos on your other channel... u are an inspiration to my engineering genes mark...(my dad is a navy engineer)... thanks for the videos...
Hire me as your secret agent
One of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. Great job Mark 👍
Dr. Kliner?
So the Office is a Reverse- escape room?
Mark Rober is an absolute legend of this generation

"If I win. Imma build a aimbot nerfgun. Lmg preferred. And it has a motion detection system that if it sees movements faster then a snail it will turn on a flood light, lasers and the alarm from the star destroyer from star wars. Making you insta dead"

"U are kinda of doing things like Mr. Beast😀😀
Best of luck on your crunch labs"
"I have a question for Mark: I love creating things, and I would like to learn how to engineer one day. Problem is, I hate math, and I've never been that great in science either. Can I learn how to think about these subjects differently, and how?"
Is that PvZ music
It’s a dead giveaway when you walk into an Accountants office from 1972….lol 😂😂
"Is he going to start selling blueprints, with 5 of them having golden tickets"
No joke i wish i had this 😢
"I dont know why the box part made me emotional but what you are doing for future generations is inmesurable and the the though made me tear up. The lab is epic, you are epic, and will probubly go down in history as one of the great minds of our time. Thank you for being you I will continue being a fan for life."
You sir are epic
Mark Rober has a Minecraft Basement type of house
Definitely Uncle stan
Gustavo Fring's Lab
"Mark, be careful while telling people to touch everything in an office, they will do it and then when they get in trouble they’ll blame you"
Let me know when you find Jimmy Hoffa back there now that would be a video of the post.
"Mark Rober is real life Dexter from Dexter's Lab, confirmed."

Is this for every country because I don't live in America
Cool
"This feels like Charlie and the chocolate factory.
But engineering style~"
Mark is starting to transform into Mr Beast.
"Okay, here me out. U give me ur secret warehouse, and I give you 50 cents. Deal?"
"Mark, as a  ""make it work"" person, I've built, modified and designed many projects based on a need.  I still do a lot of custom work, mainly firearm related, but will teach any of my friends, family, or any person in need.  I've enjoyed working with engineers and other people to carry on the help anybody attitude my father-in-law had.
He had a full electronic, chemical, and photo labs, plus the machinery and woodworking equipment to build anything he wanted when he passed away from an accident woodworking.  I wish I would have had the space you now have as I would have moved everything into it to continue using everything to advance the ""I can do it"" education to everyone.
No, I never did an engineering degree, just hands on learning from many mentors as early as 10.    One was an engineer, one was a watch repairman, and the final owned a garage that did most car repairs.  I did my first tune up on a 1957 Chevy Belair on my 10th birthday.
Keep the education of the STEM subjects as there are many young children still interested."
I wish I had a kid so I could order them a crunch labs box!
Why does your workshop look like a Disney show laboratory?
Cool
never have i wanted to work somewhere more
Meowwolf of engineering!!!  Love it!!!!
"Another video, another great day."

"Thank you so much for giving back, the internet needs more creators like you"
This is so important to usher in a new generation of big thinkers and dreamers. Thanks mark

I was half hoping it would open into Colin Furze’s tunnel 😅
Mark just built my dream home
"Mark is really an amazing guy. Though really still a child at heart, he managed to persevere through his challenges in life and make something that has always been his dream since young, which I find is a very impressive feat. And of course, he never fails to entertain us with his interesting projects and storytelling:)"
"Bruh, how do u come up with this amazing speech, if I try to make a comment like this one it would be like one sentence lmao"

"Mark: This is so secret

Also mark: Sharing the exact location to anyone who finds his house."
You’re a marketing genius.
Why does this give me huge dude perfect vibes
"""I built a new massive secret lab that the average person will never find""

Wow
congrats Mark on your childhood dream secret warehouse!
"I fell in love with the project, if you need a translator to get it in Spanish for latin america, just dm me please! You are such an awesome person"
Cool now make a spaceship
"As a child I always wanted a secret passage after reading the three Musketeers. Wanting a castle was probably too big so I figured that was decent enough. I'm totally jelly.

Those things during my life incorporated into a warehouse would be a dream. Kinda wish we all had that chance to achieve this in any scale. 

I'm sure Mark is in heaven, especially when he can share it with his local community of YTers, his family members and friends. 

Now I'm regretting not living close to Mark's home. Awesome Inc!"
"This video gave me chills how crazy smart Mark Rober is, BUT NOT ONLY THAT HE IS CREATIIVE!"

"I'm glad I know your take on men mark! Unfortunately I'm one of them, and I really liked you till I heard that!"
"The funny thing is, we JUST ordered kiwi-co boxes! Wish we waited to grab some Build Boxes!"
"Mark: “If it doesn’t exist, you can make it exist.” 
Me:  I WANT BITC*ES
Me releasing that it will never happened😭😭😭😭"
"I would just like 10,000 please"

The watermilanumurer
He just revealed a “secret base” to over 5 million people

Mark Rober gives me hope for the future.

H Mark. Little detail. I noticed that you can see light coming out from the crack at the bottom of the secret door.
someone in here is going to make a hitler joke about this i can feel it
"Why does this bring back memories of when the YouTuber Unspeakable sold his house and bought the island house,"
"I am a YouTube 
My vloging channel

"Great job on the awesome lab. I like all the secret entrances, but you need to seal the floor under the bookshelf so the light shining through doesn't give it away."
basically your minecraft underground base in real life
so.... death house
wait mark apploads 2 videos in few months?
Can you build a flying Harry Potter broom?
You are living in every kids dream
"I'd love to see the outside with the small building attached to a large warhouse in the back that is totally not suspicious giving away the entire ""secret"" warehouse."
Could have a small building next to a huge hill with the lab inside the hill.
when you have light coming from under your bookcase its a pretty clear giveaway.
Mark so umm I been willing to ask this can you help our team in Vex competition? Please
There will be a day that the foam pit is not on the desired place.....
every video is a masterpiece
Yes.  I like you!
Congrats on #1 trending! I've been watching your videos since the start!!!
Gravity falls feels different
i dont want to hate or anything but that's just copying Mr Beast
That’s some scooby Doo type stuff there.. awesome!
"Famous last words (as flying thru the air). ""Oh s*** they moved the foam pit"""
I want that bike!! that is amazing
it's a great secret lab except it's not cuz 5mil ppl just watched the video :)
I cant even afford daycare lmao
the hot wheels track looks a little sketchy what if a precious car falls off!
He's the Willy Wonka of engineering.
This is like how the hacksmith made an entire factory
thats really cool mark but i guess 5mil ppl know about your secret lab
How mad would you be if I (hypothetically) forded a perfect replica of the platinum ticket and tried to use it to get a tour of the new workshop?
"Just, very cool."
Cant wait to see somone use his kits to make something Crazy Mark would be so proud
kiwi co be like: bruhh
Noice!
.
pog
I did want to become an engineer when I was younger but then I found out just how much math and other problem solving skills I needed. If I was young again and saw these videos I probably would’ve stayed that path
this is the warehouse of virginity AND I LOVE IT!
"Giant warehouse, childhood hero, huge lounge. Definitely Entertainment 720."
So hopefully when you redesigned you took care of the light beneath the secret door....
"I was already amazed by the warehouse in the beginning and then I heard the Zelda theme…





Truly outstanding Mark"
"With this giant engineering factory, that means we'll be having a more cooler buildings and learnings in future."
Really great Mark...
Hey mark have you ever seen the channel stuff made here? He’s an incredible engineer and I feel like you and him could have some fun
what if im in a whole other continent and my summer break is over- and i get the platinum ticket and my parents dont allow me to go-
This is every kids dream!
Can you make it for Arab people because I am Arab
Mark should be in a show like bill nye or something cus he’s literally the new bill nye but engineering
"The only problem I can see is overtime when you turn the eagle more and more, it’s going to scratch up the wooden surface it sits on"
ur d best
Not much secret now
U and ur team are legends.  Thanks for helping to inspire the next generation
"him talking about keeping the lab secret, me seeing the light that gives the lab away underneath the bookshelf"
Rip Kiwico
This is the best video i ever seen.👍👍👍😊👌😎♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
How much did it cost?
int that just like kiwico
My kid is Eight
Now this is called serious dedication.
Not so secret anymore xD
He is storing nilegreen there
This is my CHILD HOOD DREAM!!!
A playground….. for engineers of course. Scientists. Mmhm.
"""Money doesn't buy happines""  uuuuhm yes it does"
I LOVE THAT IT WAS THE THE BEST
Shoping
Engineering is cool...Paternalism isn't.
"If I get the platinum ticket how could I come because I live in INDIA

THINK ABOUT IT MARK 
I REALLY WANT TO MEET YOU
LOTS LOVE FROM INDIA"
Been watching your videos for a long time. Thank you for making science fun! You are helping change the world for a better future.  👍
"mark: then coming to number five is how we actually keep the lab location super secret
me: 🤑 while looking at the like at the bottom"
I'm so jealous of you...
what a great video
Can I internet here🥺🥺🙏🙏
I'm 29 and don't want to take a box away from a young one but I also really want a box... Woe is me.
I’ve been building kiwi co and I think I’ll be switching to crunch labs build box.
"Mark: “This is super secret so nobody knows”
Also Mark: *Shows millions of people the secret*"
@V XYPEN! quiet bot
Ratio + k-pop better 🤳🏼🤳🏼🤳🏼🤳🏼🧑🏼‍💻👶🏻👶🏻🧑🏼‍💻🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
I love your video's
mark is literally changing the entire world it is absolutely crazy
Made a secret room. Why not tell 22 million strangers just to make sure it's a secret lmao.
he's....he's the engineering version of willy Wonka
Honestly love this Channel is so inspirational 😁
"Hey Mark, this is epic, but.....why does that 225lb guy have to look so chubby?"
This is so incredible. Awesome work
Aim from México but al  si your videos
If someone gets the winner silver bar in your crunch box dose mark pay for you to fly to his location or do you have to pay to fly out to him?
Mark Rober for President
its all fun when u couls go through pictures like in minecraft
"Hi Mark, congratulations on this new and amazing project! I'd love to gift the kids in my family with these kits, so I can claim the spot of favorite 'uncle' as well! Is there any plans to expand the shipping availability to southern countries, especially Brazil?"
Can we all appreciate 🙏 how much offer he put to make this video 👍
"@V XYPEN! No, its not"
Ratio + K-POP BETTER🤳🏼🤳🏼🤳🏼🧑🏼‍💻🧑🏼‍💻🧑🏼‍💻🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
"I'm no engineer, but if I were to have an area where people can dive off a second floor and land in a giant foam pit, I wouldn't want that foam pit to be on wheels."
"Mark, can you maybe make a rocket/ missile launcher?????????"
This is literally my dream and why i want to be an engineer. But mine is gonna be in the bathtub floor.
Somebody out here about to not flush.
Congratulations
Are you below El Pollo Loco? Say Hi to Gus.
Isn’t that just kiwico?
"Wow, you are fantastic!  You are appreciated and loved by so many.  Please keep it up!"
"""Ultimate Frisbee"", I'm not sure if I've ever seen a bigger oxymoron in my life..."
It's a thing
i dont wanna fight folks on this but isnt this kiwico? Did you buy it or compete?
you should team up with the 3D basketball hoop guy
This dude is an American treasure. We must protect him at all costs
Imagine being lucky enough to be born with Mark Rober as an uncle
"WAIT, ""STOLE"" FROM A DENNYS OR STOLE FROM A DENNYS? 3:47"
"5:57 Being a software tester, the obvious solution is to not flush the toilet!"
cant help it i have to get this for my son
There is an unusual glow coming from under the book case that might give it away
"I've never been so jealous of someone so fast, while at the same time being inspired and loving them wholeheartedly."
ok
So uncle mark created his own Squirrel cave. nice :)
Bro jus ripped off kiwico
Sorry can’t afford it
oh the misery
"I hope this product blows up, the amount of effort and passion you put into this for such a noble cause, people asking how to be an engineer like you. Couldn't be happier for you very well deserved 👏"
this is beyond cool
great
"Mark, did you buy this from rob dyrdek"
Wish you were MY boss!!!!
Kiwico is screwed
How do I get one lol
Kiwi and co…
Would have been better if they were modified NERF. NERF is a little underpowered. Also better if you had a solution to pickup up all the bullets. A modified Roomba for bullet retrieval.
i thoght it was like crunch and get dowwn and wwork hard but its wway cooler than that .
Gonna Point out that there is light coming out under the bookshelf. So maybe you can change the lights in the first secret hallway to match those in the office?
No more kiwico
"I think Mark is trying to solidify his ""superhuman"" status.  Current members of the famous superhuman club: Gandhi, Mr. Rogers, Steve Irwin, Tom Hanks.  Way to go, Mark.  Way to go!"
Would have been better if the firepole was 2-way - UP AND DOWN
This just proves that Mark Rober is one of the most genuine people in the world and I believe he inspires so many people to this point to continue their childhood even if there a full grown adult. Thank you Mark Rober
Team bees
5:58 what if the toilet wasn’t flushed…
I was wondering can you get it in different countries.
This reminds me of a cooler version of the Fantasy Factory!
Please colab With Stuff Made Here!!!!
"Bro living the life i wanna create, W"
"I would've loved these so much as a kid, I used to get these electronics kits from Hobby Lobby when I was a kid with brushless motors and switches and stuff to mess with, this would've blown my mind, I still want one lol"
@Byron Day yeah I probably will tbh
Then why not get some? I know I will?
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and interesting to watch."
Agreed
Oh yeah! 😎 sooooooo coooool!
I have the same thought too
You can’t say it takes a long time. Because look at forged in fire @Unvaders
"Not limited to engineering but there was a show similar to that principle: ""Baking Impossible"", where engineers and bakers had to build things together"
Modern day much cooler bill nye
The bat cave
Just imagine if Mark and Hacksmith collabed to make something like the millenium falcon.
You and the guy from Stuff Made Here should collaborate!
"Mark, you live a well deserved, very charmed life.  Very cool!"
Why not available in 4k?
Cave Johnson in Aperture Science!
that ant farm. i neeeeed. but seriously could we get a vid on it alone at some point? like how are you hydrating it? how do you feed? and cleaning it when it inevitably gets nasty. also non-american so what species is that they look quite pretty. (and maybe also how to build our own mega ant colony)
This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Thank you Mark.
OMG I want these boxes translated to German for my nieces!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Well and maybe I'll have the English ones for myself :D )
excuse to finally touch stranger's things
Mark should make an escape room! The Eagle idea would be really dope for something like that! :D
Anne frank belike
Putting the secret door behind Diet Pepsi is genius! Who would think to pay actual money for a Diet Pepsi?
Anyone else thinking of a Mark Rober and Hacksmith Industries collab?
"Well done, Mark!"
just need to explain why your house is 50% of the size when inside hahaha
I hope after the remodeling there won't be light visable from behind the secret lab. Like it is now beneed the bookcase.
that is amazing
Slight problem the light under the secret entrance gave away the “secret” part
"HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE?!

(Edit)
This is really cool by the way. It's always cool seeing these projects."
"@Amanda Mccaw Weeeeeell, not quite what I meant. See, I'm a mangaka, I just write things, and draw for myself, (and others, cuz commissions are fun), and even I don't have the kind of time to set up all of that. Must be pretty cool though, having access to those kinds of resources, and seemingly so easily too..."
"Dude, it’s his job and he literally relies on this and he doesn’t need to that much, all he does is, design, shop, have fun and edit and don,t forget eating sleeping and drinking with going toilet so yeah, not much."
Its his job bro...
"Thanks for all that you do, Mark, and I hope for continued success in your future, and the future of so many others thanks to you. 😊"
THIS is one of the next steps to our Star Trek future. Great job Mark. I'm lovin' it.
Yeah mark made a new video
I just have a question about the kits and i was wondering if they are only avalible in america as i live in england and would love to buy them.
1:01 why does it have the red tint that level run for your life has
mark’s secret labs is secretly the backrooms
Amazing
"u r an inspiration for young people everywhere!!
Also that nerf collection was soo cool!"
You need to open your own school
"Mark went competing HACKSMITH INDUSTRY and KIWICO at the same time! 

Now gimme some like if you thought the same.. ☠️"
There are engineers...and then there is Mark Rober
i feel like mark rober would make the world a better place to be honest.
5:21 Thanks Mark
"wow i wish he were my uncle, Those kids are so lucky!"
Next we are going to have team breeze 💨
"To the person reading this comment, maybe it will be a romantic love story if you write me today"
Love this!!
"There's a design flaw, you can see the blue light under the bookcase."
you can see light coming from under the bookshelf
My inner child is so jealous and Me as an adult too lol.
I’d like to see Mark Rober bust out Ray Finkle and test the limits of deformation of a football just to see how far it can be kicked before it deforestation or breaks.
Dude are mark rober and mrbeast related? LIKE THEY BOTH MADE A WAREHOUSE WILLY WONKA STYLE
The warehouse area seems similar to where you did the domino bot thing
It is really cool
It is WAY to clean to actually be productive.....
My grampa went to school for chemistry but ended up getting a Dr in microbiology. I went to school for biology but love martial arts and now compete. Weird turnaround. But I love engineering and need to go deeper in bioengineering. I should be able to look after myself for my fight and have a better understanding of the other human against me aswell as I tactical especially engineering gamelan each time I compete. 😝
k just dont flush then
"Tips for getting the Platinum ticket, check for a dart hole in the box"
Do you ship to Australia??
The only problem is that people could see the light coming trough from under the sliding bookshelf in the office.
deez
I knew this was going to be awesome from the beginning
"Well cool thing about it, it's not secret anymore 😁"
"Awesome, now I need an adult version of the crunch box as well. That way my kids can build theirs and I can build mine..."
was this warehouse where you filmed the domino video???
Soooo cooool CONGRATS ON 22MILLION
Could you please make a Star Wars lightsaber please? That would be epic!
"Honestly, Mark is an amazing role model!"
imagine jumping down expecting the container but someone drove it away
“That’s because men are pigs” - can you imagine if he said that about women? I’m over this double standard
Where can I get my own Mark Rober?
Now this is just flexing
"Can you PLEASE make the Crunch Labs boxes available as a standalone purchase?
I think some of these would be exceptional to use with my preschool kids (I work in a kindergarten), but many will most likely not be that fitting
And if there is one thing I absolutely hate, it’s subscriptions…."
"Holy smokes
This is insane :D"
He built his own facility from gta
I love u mark
Awesome job mark!!
Why dot you make a engering kint to make or won invation
IRL Gus Fring
hey mark i know you worked at JPL why don'tyou make a cool mars rover like opportunity rover
this is amazing
not really a secret any more is it?
"How are you famous and nice and cool in the same time , you're a real amazing"
"Friendship ended with KiwiCo, Crunch Labs is my new best friend"
He’s such an inspiration tbh
Noise
W MANS
"Would this be available abroad? I live in Colombia, South America and I would love for my son to be able to enjoy your creations and not missed out on this new creative way to learn some fun engineering."
now its not secret lol
Mark’s becoming a super villain and his base is ready
Im your biggest fan
Is there an age limit on participation?  It looks very fun.
MARK I thought you were gonna take the easy way out dont do that to me
You can coil the full hotweels wall and drop a magnetic ball then use that to power a light bulb or something
Mark rober in the future be like: today i have the ability to control the sun
"if you throw a dart, does that mean there will be a hole in the box?"
You should turn the office into something cool too
7:38 o lorde
Mark this is not that secret now
Crunch like the sound my back makes
That was pretty cool secret lab 😎 😊
You’re an amazing person
Hacksmith industries got some competition for better warehouse 😂
"The box is impressive. The warehouse is epic. The pitch, though, that is, what can I say....pitch perfect."
15:53 I can … what
"Ah yes, one of the best days out of the year when Mark Rober uploads \m/."
"Just a little question, how long does it take for the hotwheels car to do the full loop?"
"Didn't know MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) was a pro ulti player!"
I love mark bc he is a N.A.S.A engineer and now makes so many fun shts and giggles for kids.
"The light under the bookshelf is a pretty obvious give-away that there's a doorway behind it, and seems like an easy problem to fix"
How do I get the box tell me please
💯💯💯
bro worlds best secret base!
🫡 🙃
Oh well he invented kiwi crate
Mark Rober; the only guy that has reverse threads on his light bulbs...
Giving me WWII vibes
4:03 OMG you gave me a heart attack
Brilliant
About to go mission impossible in his lab
Should totally build the worlds best escape room engineer style
I just finished watching a 17 minutes advertisement. Well done! Mark!
You got that from dying light2
"This is awesome!!! I will totally get ur monthly thing!!!! I really hope that I can get a platinum ticket because I had an idea of a wind turbine with solar panels on each  blade. So hopefully I could come and we could design that. I'll be honest u r a literal genius!!! I've always wanted to visit!!! Just wanted to say, I really love ur videos. I love how u always explain the science and the videos are always so cool and informative!!! Thank you for making such great videos!!!"
Wonder what would happen if you put Shane from Stuff Made Here and Mark Rober in the same room
MKBHD!
Gravity falls vibes
please like this comment!PLEESSSS
My dude has quite literally created the batcave
Who else noticed the Zelda breath of the wild sound effect.Brought back summers playing Zelda games.
Can an adult win the contest
only if i get the “platinum ticket” do you pay expenses with plane tickets to zed destination?
WTF?I was so amazed that I peed the floor😅this is in fact the most favorite video in YouTube
When he said “this is my WILLY WONKA …. I was like wait a minute that’s mr beast. When I heard 1 and a half years I was like NANI?!
wow
4:05 my mans dead
I want to get it but I live in Malaysia so i’m not sure IF you can send it to me
Basically u built your version of Dexters laboratory!
PLS MORE
"I just need to say I think you are an ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE BEING !!!! This world needs more people who think outside the box like you do, and now you have created a way to get children engaged and started on their path 👌 We begin our homeschooling journey this September, our son will be 5 in November and I can not wait to get these boxes, and learn along side him while he explores the endless possibilities of this world.  Since he could talk he's said he's gonna be an Astronaut 👨‍🚀🔭 Engineering could be a huge stepping stone. Again thanks for all that you do, can't wait to see more. ! 💜"
Can we all appreciate 🙏 how much offer he put to make this video 👍
:O Even the bags are compostable.... 🥰
We’re gonna need a field goal kicker 2 with Justin Tucker as he hit a 66 yarder. Coming in the future?
"While I'm watching this video, the kid inside me is shouting ""Awesome!!"".. Ps- im not pregnant 😂😂"
how to buy it?
epic
The fireman did what in his tin
Are there any hard Crunch lab Makings for older people?
Mark is the only person who could leave NASA and become cooler. He literally has a secret lab now.
RIP KiwiCo
Chop sticks hit puberty
Amazing.
Mark. Please stop yelling. It's ruining your audio
Gustavo Fring liked this
love the fact you're just riding around in a go kart with catcher's gear.
"16:06 Haha, Not possible if you live outside US 💀"
my brother wants to be a plane engineer
When is 3.0 squirll
A mark rober video is always a treat 😊
"This so awesome, wow. I think I know what I'm signin up for, whenever I get the chance"
I wonder how many childless adults are gonna snap up these subscriptions...? (No aspersion to childless adults but I'm not sure how you PREVENT childless adults from buying up all the stock -- but perhaps that's its own engineering problem to solve.)
I WANT TO GO TO THERE
I love marques brownlee
Plants vs zombies music lez gooooo!!!!
"if mark rober was my uncle, im pretty sure he’d be my favorite even if he did throw me in a foam pit. because he threw me in a foam pit in a giant warehouse of modern engineering mixed with gaming, adrenaline rushes, and toys."
Hi Mark
This is probably the coolest thing a youtuber has ever done super cool
I need a home like that
MARKKKKK!!!! you could have made the Batman head statue button thing to open the door instead of the owl
will you ship to mexico?
I'm sure Kiwico will be so excited to see such an innovative new company!
He’s gone from being sponsored by them to Being in direct competition with them.
Can we all appreciate 🙏 how much offer he put to make this video 👍
@Mitch McCron I don't think he needs to buy out any copyright tbh
"Was wondering who was gonna notice that, he must’ve bought out their copyright or something for it"
Ratio + K-pop better🧑🏼‍💻🧑🏼‍💻🧑🏼‍💻🧑🏼‍💻🤳🏼🤳🏼🤳🏼🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
cool
mark for president - humanity would be in the future faster than you can blink xD
To be honest even though I won't be able to get the crates I will still watch the crunch labs videos just to learn about all the cool physics and stuff.
Me: see’s I’m not subbed. 😅 I’m sorry! Subbing now I’ve watched ur vids for years!
"Really really cool, i hope the lab has some more accessibility options if some of the public are able to visit eventually. Love the box concepts."
"so this is a sponsor video for his own product, which he ripped off kiwico?"
I always feel better after watching this guy.
"This guy needs to run the country. He literally makes all of the dads wish we could be as impactful as him. 

Go mark. If you need a dad who loves to “test” stuff. I’m in. Lol"
Love your channel Mark but I love even more how passionate you are about getting kids excited about learning. Keep up the awesome work.
that is literally my dream of a mancave
"I love how you try to push kids to think different, build stuff with you, and to become smarter because of it.
Really nice! Please don't stop."
Can we all appreciate 🙏 how much offer he put to make this video 👍
What happens if you miss the foam pit when you jump off
"I have an idea to make an anger glove.
When you're angry you can put it on and there are strings from your fingers to the back of your hand that prevent you from closing your hand into a fist and there is a way to make it harder or make it easier depending on how difficult you want it to be.
I don't have the things to build this idea, I thought you can do it or just think about it because it's something I really think can help people like me that have anger issues
I have been a big fan of yours for the longest time now and I tried to see if I have the way to create it in my home but it isn't in my ability."
Will the monthly box be available worldwide?
Kiwi co rip
You are my next Elon Musk 😁😁
Sooo kiwico?
"So, can we expect a collab between you and Hacksmith industries :D"
I want You to Be my Dad :(
Imagine if ur dad was mark rober😩
this reminds me of omega mart with all the secret passages
Sounds like gravity fslls eith extra steps to me
Barret .50 vs. the Tennisball launcher
You are so cool
Does anyone else think he should do a collab with Hacksmith industries? Any ways love the content keep it up
Hii
Waiting for the box for kids aged 40+
Nice
Kiwiko
Getting some real Dexter's Lab vibes from this place
So thats why you dident upload a video in a while cause you wanted a banger
"Soooo, crunch labs is like kiwico but better."
"Mark, you are a great human and I wish you much success on this venture!  It is brilliantly designed and executed, perfect I would say."

Make the fatgus plush merch
"Congratulations Mark, from India."
Am I early?
I envy you mark now
Now show your balls for sience
Wow mad shade on kiwi co! Shots fired!
I’m speechless 😶 I WANT TO GO THERE
With hacksmith industry and now crunch labs we are going into a epic age
"I am thoroughly impressed and jealous. You are doing what you love and having fun while doing so, and are educating youngsters and giving them an opportunity to have fun with you . ...... It just doesn't get better than that!!!!!"
"Since I can't be a kid again to enjoy all these creations, this makes me want to have a kid and watch him enjoy them!"
Mark just ripped kiwi co off
Imagine himself making the backrooms
perfect that you said it helps with piano playing (kinda) because im doing piano practace
Best uncle confirmed
This is beyond awesome. You make Fat Gus proud! ❤
"This is awesome Mr. Rober. You are exactly what YouTube and todays technology should be. Bravo to you, I only wish I still had small kids, I would sign up in a flash. Maybe I’ll have grandkids one day and hopefully you’ll still be at it."
Please make it worldwide shipping.
It's like real life Dexter's lab.
my guy you suprised me so well!
"14:37 you could have made the PERFECT joke! ""It passed with flying colors"""
Mark rober is slowly becoming more and more like mr beast
if a random dude walked in he would see the glowing light under book shelf still cool
Does the crunch labs shipping international?
This video is godly
He is fricking Tony starks in real Life
"Can you order in a different country and change it to the country's currency

Cause im from Philippines"
And yet another reason why your one of my absolute favorite YouTubers
"Hey Mark, I am 22 and over the past couple of years you have inspired me to become an engineer (on the day I can afford to go to school.) I work in additive manufacturing and am a firm believer that if I had been exposed to the engineering world at a younger age that my life would be completely different. I love the idea of inspiring young minds and introducing them to the world that is engineering. I’d love to help out the less fortunate kids of the globe whose parents don’t have any way to expose mechanical and other types of engineering to their children. 
Thank you for your videos and exposure of the joy of engineering."
Childhood
gravity falls memories
Totally a grown up and totally buying this box lol
Everybody loves secret bases
"Wow this is original!! A warehouse full of kids toys, dude perfect, how ridiculous, just Dustin, Matthias dope or nope etc"
As someone who was really into engineering in school I love ur vids and now tht I have 3 kids ALL THREE WILL GET THESE
The nasa shirt ruins it
@Mike Jones He worked there That's why he's wearing it
@DanMan are you a big fan of agencies of authoritarian regimes?
What’s wrong with nasa
"Love your new space, so thrilled to see your childhood dream come to fruition. I feel a lot of people will benefit from this magnificent and creative space."
“Willy wonka factory for engineering” This was a reference to mr. Beast
Me beast didn’t invent willy wonka
How about hand soap?
Holy shiiiiiiiiii-
who payed this mr beast
"the light below the secret door just gives it away to fast, maybe put a second door at the end of the hallway"
I am grateful to be alive in the Mark Rober age🙏
looks like the odd squad base
your the coolest person ever!
Really cool
Sweet hideout I just hope they work on the bottom of the shelf because you can see the light thus giving it away to those who be looking for it
replace the tennis ball with explosive and you got your self a cannon
Mark I want to be an aeronautical engineer I love your vids love from polska
I wanna become a engineer but I don't know how to make something
That's a big hint 00:05
A M A Z I N G ! !
"Your so amazing Mark
If anyone were to make this it would be you 👍🏼👏🏻📚🥳🎉"
I mean- guess its not a secret anymore
The legend is back
a question if u get the ticket are u going to pay for the rise to u?
Amazing bro 👏
There’s not much I wouldn’t do to do some engineering with mark
I WANT TO VISIT!
Still love the fact you use the plants vs zombies theme
Feels like the engineer's version of the Fantasy Factory of Rob Dyrdek. Love it!
Cronch labs
Awesome! You are a modern day Mr Rogers! Love the way you use your knowledge to inspire!
Awesome 😎
"Outside looks like a factory, inside just an office. Nothing to see here"
well everybody knows where it is now
death
Auchente 🤣💀
Nice
Do you ship to Canada?
Amazing project <3
So much useless inventions that are completely awesome.
not so secret

You’ve got to work with the jackass guys
We dont now were it is because my mom are finking to get it
Gus Fring’s alternative universe secret lab.
The world's best YouTuber to ever live is for sure Mr.Mark Rober

🙂
You showed us the QR code 😅
Dude that bookcase door has a flaw with it you can see light under it
As of now you have 4.7 million views I don’t think it’s a secret anymore
all my dream is in this video
Just use gloves so ur hand dont hurt👍
Mark is just the coolest nerd ever!
I know it’s not your fault because China is well… China but I wish I had access to these boxes here for my younger sister and also my dad’s friends son whom I’m teaching engineering principles for a very early age to
Mark stole Gustavo Fring’s basement.
New competition against kiwiko
Every time I watch one of your videos I feel useless
Tony stark
what if your from another country
that's my son love your YouTube videos and my son loves building things I'm going to get the build  box he can't wait 😊
Anne Frank you there?
You are a hero among men.
This is minecraft redstone irl😂
So cool
I will never be able to sleep again knowing that mark rober could be behind any wall I see
Mark Rober the engineering Guy
WHAAAAAT?!?!
but what song???
Mark's office is Squirrel Maze for human now
You should build a automatic frisby thrower
Mark Rober is the real life’s Ironman
not shipping to India. But why
You should maybe make it so that the secret entrance doesn't emit light from underneath...
This guy is literally living my and everyone's childhood dream 😌
"I know I don't have to be a child to buy these Crunch Labs kits
but Mark Rober's shenanigans really make me want to have been born later"
Best video ever!
"You are awesome, Mark. You deserve your awesome lab. So happy for you ❤️"
no.9 was being originated by tommy gunn & danny gunn from gunn vs gunn nerf war..
Mark is officially on his way to becoming Doofenshmirtz
This is only the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life
"Anime women maker 
 Me as an engineer 😎"
"Me an indonesian knowing I’ll never be able to afford one: huh, I’ll make sure to write that down"
"nobody

Mark Rober when he is golfing: wait I think I need a robot for this."
My son is only 6 but loves these videos. I'm so excited to get this crunch lab set for him. we love doing science things together and it looks like a great way to expand his curiosity.
That lab just increased my fantasy of having my own mancave
The another real chocolate factory
You vs mr beast top trending!
6:26 its not obvious at all
I love you dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dam I just wanted diet pepsie got a intire lab
You’re awesome mark
I have that t shirt.  Love it
You’re totally living the dream!
8 mill gta online arcade
What if you don’t live in California and you get the ticket in your box
You guys don't need fire exits?
So what is the difference to the curiosity box?
Mark Rober -- Colin Furze mash up would be epic
Amazing!
Miiiight want to do something about the light under the shelf making the entrance rather... Obvious
"Adulting is boring.
Alternative:"
do yall ship worldwide?
Wow!!!! 😎😎😎
What if sensor didn't work 😂😂😂       you are locked with the 🐁🐁🐁🐭🐭🐭

Not much of a secret now is it
i would find that ez becuz im a clumsy and curious guy
meow meow meow meow meow
Just.... Awesome!
woah
:)
"He really made it like a Willy Wonka's engineer factory.  Especially when he put a silver ticket to go to the factory, exactly like in the movies."
@User 2C47 also easily weighed out by shipping personnel :p
"Labeled platinum and looks like machined aluminum, but the point stands."
Better than MrBeast’s chocolate factory IMO. It was kind of a let down IMO.
@meshhkin to make people mad.
"​@Isaiah Viverosi get that its irrelevant but why do u need to say small eyed, you could've said anything else but that"
at 8:07 rubix cube in the back
Dexters labratory LOL
"Flywheels are very useful for launching frisbees, I mean I was literally doing the same thing like Tuesday? Well it was motorized but whatever."
Marques!
Another great video!!! This lab reminds me of the house from Honey I Shrunk the Kids
"but you didn't show the ""adult"" dungeon..."
The retention for this video is probably 📉
Waiting here for more than 20M of views (is our little secret 🤫).
Minecraft irl 😂
I want to buy the 12 month box thing but 10k of my currency is kinda alot
Amazing video as always! I can't wait to see what you do in the new space :) (Please go 4k)
Did Nurk do these drone shots?
Is he mkbhd?
I think it would be pretty obvious if the giant warehouse only had one tiny room without any other entrances
How do I apply to work in the crunch labs!?!!!
desC linK
i like the pvsz theme song in there at #5
Wow this channel just gets getting better and better. Very impressed on how dedicated mark is for the next gen of engineers. Also a secret lab is dope too.
MrBeast 2.0
Hi does it ship to anywhere?
This is the coolest place ever I wish I had a place like this
Where do you cook the meth?
This is So cool broooo 😎
Tony Stark?
I wish I could meet Mark but I live in Australia
What species are the ants?
4M ppl r watching so its not a secret anymore
Imagine mark on Minecraft
I am an engineer..... and i just love your videos ❤️❤️
Mark Rober is one of those cool uncle's everyone wants to have.
Wish i could buy it :(
"I may have just signed up for the boxes ""for my nephew"" but let's be real, it's totally for me."
Imagine having Willy Wonka/Peter Griffin nonsense money
Just validates that Mark is an IRL Dexter
so cool
"Im just shocked, i love it <3"
"kinda just feels like its bragging about realestate and showing off his cool mansion and i dont like it, but i dont dare comment something negative on marks channel because hes the kind of guy to actually tack you down and do something to you over petty internet comments"
"Great Stuff all around there Mark! I love the amount of positive energy and passion you put into your projects and also deliver to us in your videos! Thank you so much for that.
  
One more thing: I was wondering...does the solenoid at 5:26 disengage automatically in case of emergency like..lets say a fire alarm?
One might be in a hurry to leave then :D"
Probably
Yeah - I was worried about the fire safety of that door lock too! Hopefully he's considered that..
"Crunch Labs. Awesome idea. I truly wish my kids will have the opportunity to visit this one day, or something similar near their home. You are an amazing human being and I'm loving showing your ideas to my kids (who are loving your videos). Thankyou for being such an amazing role model to not only my kids, but many others as well. Please let me.know how i can supprot crunch labs in any way...."
Brooo...i have an idea...what if you make a tv show on the crunch lab
What a fantastic human being!!!
I wonder what your kid self would think if he saw your lab
This is the real life dexters laboratory every kid dreams about lol
No way!
Fantasy factory vibes
Not so secret now
said this before i watched the full video (spoke too soon)
"I would loveee to make something like this but I probably have to learn more by myself. I kinda have always been liking science so much, I normally pay extra attention to science because I really think I can do something cool with the knowledge that I get from science."
Amazing like always
Me in Europe ಠ_ಠ
Is that Marques Brownlee throwing the frisbee to you?
Dexter would be proud of you lol
"Honestly, only you would have the idea of making a warehouse for engineering, creating and fun lab. Really great place!"
This is the coolest invention on your channel this is great!!
People like mark change the world.
"2:48 Nerf armory, I thought he said nerf artery 😂😂😂 (it's funny cause fartery LUL)"
Nice nice but now in like a week everyone finna hop of the server
its made for 10 year olds
Still one of the coolest humans alive 😂🔥
Yeah no one will notice that a giant warehouse building that only shows a tiny office front space has something in the back :)
I really want a deep inside on fireman's piston
Kiwico is felling a great disturbance in their their pockets
Mark is the best kind of egg.
Willy Wonka: Bro did you just copy my idea? Doesn't matter that you changed the gold ticket to platinum and think that no one noticed! 😂
Absolutely and  TOTALLY awesome!
Mark your just absolutely amazing changing young kinds all over this is just ugh so awesome 👏 you’ve done it again mark 👏 I am gonna sign up my son thankyou so much !
I'm getting Dexter's Laboratory vibes from this and I love it
Is it US dollers
You are INSPIRING.
I build a mass secret lab that nobody knows about. Proceeds to show on YouTube
"So fun. Like Elon Musk, but kind, thoughtful and fun"
Only 1 problem. I AM EUROPEAN
Two minutes in and you’ve already reinvented the fireman’s pole. Why would you use anything less?
Babe wake up mark Robert posted a new video
Mark rober would be the best human trafficker
I'm not sure Mark knows how wide his age demographic is. I'm 22 and am totally buying this.
Real life Phil Dunphy
i want to be a kid again
Claim your ticket for Mark's number 1 trending!
O.o pepsi is the trigger o.O dammit im locked out XD
Rob I can see it glow under the shelf their are weals under it and it looks like a set. It’s pretty obvious on a second look
"The REALLY impressive bit is from the OUTSIDE, the whole building looks like a 9'x12' dilapidated Fotomat kiosk, complete with boarded-up windows and a ""Closed, Will Return At 3:30"" sign on the door. After all: who's going to suspect a warehouse lab when the chintzy office is already 2.5x too big for the structure that houses it?"
"I want to come but i am a little short on money lol and i also am in France so even if i were to come it would be hard, rip lovin it keep up the amazing work my guy"
"you deserve everything you have mark 
your videos are not only intertaining but bring atention to something or teach 
my mum and i love your videos and i think something like the crunch labs is a amazing idea"
Now we need a collaboration with Hacksmith Industries and Crunch Labs to make the best engineering warehouse
Why does he keep calling it willy Wonka? Anything to do with Mr beast?
Do you ship internationaly?
"That’s not a lab, it’s a Minecraft underground base"
Mark!! It doesn't want to allow shipping to NZ. Please can you change it. I'm a mom and a Science teacher and I would love to use this crate in both scenarios in my life!
"Was that Marques Brownlee, MKBHD throwing the Frisbees?"
It's like a Jimmy Jabs but more scientific
It’s a fantasy factory.
omg i got the platimum ticket!!!!!!
Please tell me crunchlab box is available in India
He’s living the dream.
SECRET TUUUUUNLLE
Zach king ? Jk
"i wish i could go to your lab, but im in australia :("
"thank you for recreating my minecraft base in real life, where can i download the map?"
"Beekman is dead, all hail Mark!"
Only thing is the bright light emitting beneath the sliding secret door haha gotta fix that
Ships outside us?
This is why Mark Rober is my favorite YouTuber.
If only Australians could win😔🙏
I swear the robot footballer looked at his leg flying away lol! 11:25
F-N AWESOME!
I still know when he was with kiwico now he made hes own brand called crunch lab now im confuse should i buy kiwico or crunch lab or both i guess in the future
Congrats!
3:48 Mark Rober is becoming the way MrGreen makes him act in his parodies
HOW MUCH IS THIS WARHOUSE MARK? I WILL PAY U LIKE010 MILLION FOR THIS AUSOME THING DUDE!
No meth lab 3/10 jk it is very cool
"Me and the other 5 million current viewers of this video agree that this is indeed, secret af."
"4,666,895 views in 16 hours!"
New video and its amazing
Funfunfun
Bro thats the best commercial for your product ever
"this guy never misses, absolutely love each vid you post👏🤝"
"Dear Mark,

I. Hate. You.

But, could you also invite me over??? 🥺👉👈"
Danggg its like a spy kids headquartes 😍😍😍
"Get Mark and Elon Musk to collaborate, what could POSSIBLY happen???"
"Rob Dyrdek called, he want´s his Fantasy factory back!"
Mr whose the boss came yay I think that this is the colab he was talking about
"um KIWI Co, not cool M."
5:35
I only started watching you a few years ago but i'm now about to finish year 12 in Australia and begin an engineering course at university. How I wish I found your channel earlier!!
You are the best!
"Mark: im gonna give a tiny hint
Him also opining and showing every room in the ware house’"
"Did he just reveal a 'secret room' on YouTube... Keyword ""secret""😂"
"I would love to meet you guys! 





Now I have another dream that's never gonna come true.......😅"
Just handing out a kudos and  sincere thanks for taking the time to make these uploads. For younger kids ; engineering  sounds like the most boring thing in the world; its been a pleasure to watch all your uploads over the years with both my kids and nephews..
You need to make a watermelon amateur shirt
would hate to think of all the watermelon that got sprayed into the hot wheelz track
"I wanna be an aeronautical engineer... Desging and creating commercial aircrafts... The only thing is I'm so confused is... how on earth do those who actually create aircraft make them when 2 diffrent communities are fighting to explain how a airfoil generates lift... (Burnollis effect ""Equal time argument"" vs Coanda effect and Netwons 3rd law)"
ITS THE COOLEST THING EVER
isnt that just kiwi box?
it look like from movie despisable me
this is my dream house lol love ur videos ive seen every one of them

"You might just be the coolest person on the planet, no cap."
"""There's no better teacher than failure"", as a math teacher, I like this a lot."
lol kiwico must feel betrayed
Imagine forgetting to put the pit back next to the second floor
You know all those secret passages and doorways are now not well secret…..  But they are still awesome.
Are you now competing with your sponsor Kiwico for the science box market?
Somebody has just taken what it is to be a YouTuber to a whole new level.
"The word ""robot"" comes from the ancient Greek word, Mark Rober."
Im 15 and i still love ur vids lmao
This is epic
what engineering have you done?
6:26 i can see light coming from under the bookcase lol.. kinda un-secret
We're in a ressesion noone has money..
boring
This is like a *dream* secret room! Great job dude!
is that mkbhd??
kiwiCo?
This is insanely cool!
"A future billionare: yes thank you all, i owe all of my fortune to my hero, Mark Rober, his crunch engineering boxes really inspired me so i'm giving him 1 billion dollars and my children"
Even if Mark is just showing his new toy for the camera it’s still very intertaining for us
can you make like level 1 box level 2 box level 3 box mode 1 is easy 2 is normal 3 is hard
"What about kiwi co. I mean I feel like they are mad. But I still LOVE your concepts and how they seem more engineer oriented and focus on concepts

Edit: Is your monthly class also becoming part of crunch labs"
MarkBeast
marquess brownlee?
Can people outside of the states win the trip to the warehouse?
this guy is playing Minecraft in real life
Anyone else wish they hadn't grown up yet?
"Love ur videos!!!!!!!! This is my DREAM u inspired me to never give up and keep going,thanks for that!!!"
"Hi Mark, love your videos, but isn't your box a Kiwico?"
My favorite YouTuber is back
"Those $10K hanging off the wall there is definitely not an incentive for anyone to break in, no. 😉"
gravity falls
no wayyyy
"W! O! W! Nice place, Mark! Congrats, brother! 🤘🙏"
Great idea 💡 👍 👏
Dude really made the dream base of every 5 year olds in the world
Mark’s literally living my dream. 😦
Star Trek or Star Wars?
Awesome
This Is Not A Normal Mark Rober. This Is Mr Rober.
1st on trending
So you're a supervillain now? Someone owes me $20. :)
I think the coolest thing about Mark is that he's basically a big kid.
team peace next? (it ryhmes
3:24 can anyone tell me what song it is?
A manchild
So excited for this next step in your ever-growing career!
This guy living like minecraft
Make a nuclear reactor
Can this sent to China because I live in China.
Not so secret when you can see light shining from below the shelves
Teaching Divide and Conquer as Crunch and Making is a great idea
Kiwi co: i thought we are special
spared no expense...
Mr Beast but nerd lol
Only thing I don't like about this is that it isn't very secret. You can see light under the bookshelf.
Omg chopsticks yoooo i like that piano
"Ayooo!!!, what happened to the NERF bullet @4:26"
You can literally hear the mouse click 3:22
I love you Mark ♥️ thank you for being an incredible human being
"After you redecorate, make sure light doesn't come through the bottom of the entrance like it does currently, underneath the bookshelf"
"As someone studying Industrial design, this lab and all its quirky features is an absolute dream! Creativity must be flowing there! Much love, Mark."
This is the fastest time you have uploaded a video after  video
"Your brain's ingenious wiring schemematic sir, is the way America's next generation of prpoer cranium growth will come to fruition... You are a great person and I am sure am glad you are a real superhero, instead of a super villain..."
Yes mark rober
Can I get one with euros??
no
I would love to buy these but I cant :( cuz prob they may not ship and also my parents wont allow me :(
rip kiwiko
I want to be  a scientist when I grow up
Ohh you willy wonka madman. I'm happy for you. Well done.
Its not super secret when you can see the light reflecting off the floor under the bookshelf..lol
The Gus Fring of engineering.
"this is so cool. I'm sure your family is so proud. you're just a big kid, keep that energy. mad love from new zealand!"

"I really need that bicycle 
So much so I wanna learn how to make it 
Because there is no value for cyclers in my city literally every motorcyclists would think that 
Oh! that's a cycler let's speed my vehicle to overtake them and sometimes hit them and blame on them for nothing
but they don't know that cycler have a value 
BTW Love your video 
Love from india"
Nu
This would be Mark Robber's (Great) Legacy -- and could be Robber's museum!
Friggin awesome!! 🤘🔥
Nice rip-off of Kiwico ... I guess they won't be sponsoring your videos any longer
Wow just wow
When can crunch labs come to the uae
never
gravity falls??
Does it deliver to ksa
Compostable plastic is so much worse than regular plastic..
Mark is the only guy that would build a weapon and make it look fun and kid friendly
B
I am getting the platinum ticket no matter what
No Shipping in India
Amazing! But… no shipping to Norway 😭
"I know 4,6 million people who would dissagree that it's a secret"
get youtubers there
Please don't become Mr beast. One is enough
I'm crying 😢 😭 . That was my hole life fantasy
This is awesome!
Striving for that higher tax bracket lol
if only I was in america
I'm tearing up thinking about all the curious little engineers out there you will give more purpose and happiness in life 💡🧠🦾
0:02 didn't ask so hahah
"2:42
you can go down, but how do you get up?"
"That's crazy, anyone else wants one of these warehouse?"
So your basically doing kiwi crates then? just with a splash of Mark Rober madness/childishness.... nice! 😂
Dexters Lab!
Windows maybe?
I'm green with envy. I need a warehouse like this.
thats my dream too :)
"Will you hire me, I could like help gather stuff for you 😂"
you should hire a designer :)
"Seems to be about time to leave this channel. No content is appealing to everyone. This is not the content I am looking for. I am not saying he should not do this, it’s surely great, just not what I was looking forward to on this channel."
You're making me wish I had kids...
Mark it’s crazy how you can engineer the worlds first wash hands alarm thingy
"Ha, ha, you‘re officially turning into a mad scientist… I love it! Keep those wonderfully weird ideas coming… cheers from Switzerland"
Who’s playing plants vs zombies in the background
those are the ugliest furniture to ever be witnessed by this side of the earth
"Hi Mark, first of all I am really happy that there is someone who could make the younger generation better engineers, but on the other I am very disappointed that crunch lab’s doesn’t deliver to India. You see India’s 70 percent of your are engineers and out of those only 2-3 percent are employable. This shows how flawed our education system is. So, if you could ship those boxes to India the younger generation who will obviously have a better chance become better engineers when compared to the present gen."
What if this Crunch Labs is just a front.
Any fellow engineers that brought a box?
4.6m vievs in 2 days xD
"Yeah, “super secret” light comes though the bottom and the people know, “oh yeah, there’s something cool in there!”"
Imagine you try to rob this place and he pulls out the tennis ball cannon
Wow! Great project Mark! I am not a child or an engineer but watching this video made me want to visit your lab! Guess I will have to wait when you make a build box for a mini spirel blads wind turbine energy station.
I was literally looking for a new vid an hour before this came out
You're awesome!
So cool!
"Other people: ""We built a secret room""! Literally one tiny room.
Mark: ""I built a secret room""!
Me: More like a secret mansion."
"I really wish I had that bicycle horn when I did some touring years ago.   Now, it would be great to have while bicycling here in New York City."
I want in😭😭😭😭
you should try and build a fnaf thingy that would be so cool
This is the beginning of Mark becoming Batman
"It is heartbreaking to watch Mark's monthly contributions and wonder how we would thrive if we as a society had more in common with him.  ""We can't all be NASA engineers"" is not what I'm referring to.  Why does the desire to drag successful people down seem almost instinctive to so many?  We don't need more people with Mark's skills nearly as much as we would benefit from simply having more with his heart, and you don't need a degree for that."
"Last year it was kiwi co, now it’s crunch labs"
"i was amazed , although the light from under the bookshelf ruined the faux office :-(, lovin it though max playground"
You made a kid-friendly claymore mine?!? If only I had had that when me and my brother where kids XD
Mark you are amazing!
Amazing warehouse!!
WOW I was literally jumping around its soooooooo cool
4:46 is that MKBHD playing frisbee???
"No one:
Mark: 'But before we see if I actually live, I would like to introduce you to my Willy Wonka factory for engineering.'"
Professional ultimate frisbee player looks like mkbhd
"No joke, this is on par with Dude Perfect’s HQ in terms of homeyness and sheer versatility!"
google?
Is there the appropriate amount of egress pathways?
"THAT was literally a dream of mine.
Such a Court of Miracles...

I mean I even like this idea of a picture of a cow, that you can ""milk"" by pressing on the Nose. A small stream of milk will flow out of it's udder, and u can fill ur glass of milk.
This Lab, is on a similar level of unexpected marvels... I want to live there"
The frisbee player was MKBHD
Well clearly you lived if you uploaded this
did anyone else think it was going to be a meth lab
Being an engineer is so awesome
just amazing
“Bayblades with coins”
that tennis cannon must not be legal
Your my favourite youtuber
"Oh cool! It’s fantastic to see this happening, and it’s great to see you having fun with it. (So that’s why channel uploads were a little wonk for a bit. Totally worth my guy!!!)"
"Just ordered. 

I cannot wait to tell my boys."
He'll be bored tomorrow
Dude copied kiwico to the Max
Lol
Hmm what's this giant warehouse next to my dentists office
"""Subversion of expectations is comedy""...  Fantastic! 🤣🤣"
You would never suspect a thing... unless you also happened to see the massively bright blue glow coming from underneath
Mark is becoming mr beast
The compostable packaging came as a suprise.
Anyone know what sort of nerf gun mark was using?
you are such an inspiration mark!!! keep up the great work
Our secret
wow.  who knew?  peter pan didn't grow up... to become an engineer!
Please release it for India too
Kiwico wants to know your location
"tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der
 Master K. I.       !..."
i want a collab with Mark Rober and Stuff Made Here tbh
Cool
Your lab needs better lighting
"I'd totally buy this ""not washed hands"" sensor 🤣"
Wivjowoieje this is so amazing I could never-
Now mark has his own version of kiwico
Gravity Falls be like
*Jealous 100*
Noted. Time to start eyeing everything suspiciously as if it has Mark's lab behind it
Can you please invent a ray gun that makes me a kid again. Im a 43 yo that loves your channel and wishes i had that box when i was growing up.
I'm jealous
"First of all its fantastic! 
Although the light under the bookcase reveals your secrets ;)
And the video.... but yeah xD"
Why does the office look like Gus Fring's
The only issue I can see that there's lights bleeding from the sceret doors underneath
"i like how he ""just happens"" to have friends with really cool talents"
Dude perfect’s next video: trick shots; crunch labs edition

My kid loves your videos and wants to be an engineer like you
Is there something that would be subtle to make for someone with dyslexia?
This is what all kids dream of when they were young...
I don't think an engineering uni student is his target demographic for this but I just want them so bad haha
You shouldn't show this to us haha
"12:01 ""Supplies are definitely limited, so make sure you limit it even more!"""
"I don’t have children but it blows my mind how affordable your new program is. Considering most youtube plans and programs sold cost hundreds and are valueless, the fact that yours is basically the cost of a premium streaming service while offering a physical product is just so awesome to see. You’re not only making this kind of things accessible for children, but also affordable for their parents. You are a truly awesome human being."

"Sir Mark, you are absolutely amazing. You are making kids happy and making sure that the Earth is not damaged by it at the same time."
Would be super neat if Stuff Made Here came and built something in your new lab
Why not delivered to India
Is it bad that I’m 32 and really want one of those boxes?
Mark strikes me as the kind if person to not pay his employees a livable wage.
I'm so jealous. I wish I had a super awesome custom warehouse!
This guy is a goat
"its cus you don't know how to properly get down a firemen pole, look at the second pic u provided the guy isn't even using his hands he has it wrapped around clothing."

How about touching the sink but not washing you hand you should have put a sensor on the soap so you have to use it so if you dont wash you will have sticky hands or if you push it and leave in on the sink people will notice.

Mark Became the Grandpa from Gravity Falls
"Lol, you could play ultimate frisbee Mark"

The “Men are pigs” joke was kinda un-called for

I think NASA should collaborate with you to give you some project that kids can do. I mean it don't have to be Mission critical project.
I  Bought it looks great

"6:41 except for, you know, the giant glow coming from beneath the book case indicating that there was an accessible void behind it. after that, it's a simple process of elimination to open the passageway, or, just fire-axe your way through..."
@AleNuts you can see it though
But u can’t see a glow under the book case? U think Mark wouldn’t have thought of that already silly?
exactly :D
"In 20 years time if u ask any NASA engineer how they got an interest in engineering they’ll say
 “Two words, Mark Rober”"
"hi mark im 14 and u have been an inspiration since i was twelve  which led me to making planes along with these other people who inspired me: Peter Scripol , williom osman and thebackyardscientest. please keep making vids and keep it up. u should make an rc plane next vid!"
… I don’t have kids yet… but I want to buy this for my kid….
"Come on, it’s not shiping to India
Btw great initiative, Congratulations on your new lab"
Not so much of a secret anymore as this has 4M+ views.
Those boxes are basically kiwico but still cool. And love the secret lab
I would really like to get that thing but im too far away because im from finland
This is so cool!!!
Is it possible to get this Internationally? I would love to unbox one for my audience :)
Stop yelling we cab hear you
mark rober's fantasy factory holy cats
I swear this guy is trying to make a lab behind the backrooms
So... You just call Marques to toss you some frisbees? 😬
He looks sooo happy
Who is smarter mumbo jumbo or mark rober
"With this, Mark is about single-handedly raise a new generation of creative engineers."

The lab secret entrance gives itself away by the light under the library. Maybe covering it with some tape or so.

"boys sell courses to other boys while mark rober sells courses to kids, this dude lives in 2030"
"wow
such a  cool base"
AYE! MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER KNOWS BEYBLADE. maybe u should do a vid about that
"Mark, my engineering teacher this year remarked to me about having you drive the robotics team's robot for Hurricane. He said you had so much enthusiasm. I also know your nephew Caleb. It's so amazing to me that someone I view as next to a celebrity takes special care to include those around him. I see incredible selflessness and humble thought behind everything you do. Thank you for being my role model and inspiring me in many ways, morally and physically. I hope to someday meet you myself, maybe at Caleb's mission farewell!"

This is like the Smart version of Rob Drydeks fantasy factory 😂🎉
All the boys dream
He is literally the engineer Willy Wonka
It's called Dexter's Lab.
Mark is a step closer to becoming the real life tony stark
"at 6:30 he says ""no one will suspect a thing encept for the fact the behind the thing is a gigantic warehouse"
So what I learned today is that our childhood TV Stars from American Gladiator live in Mark Robers walls now. Interesting career trajectory
This is my childhood dream haha! Amazing as always Mark and so happy for you.

Imagine some guy thinks the foam container is still there. But they moved it away.
6:26 you can see light under the bookshelves...
"You can see the scratch marks at the base of the eagle where it has been turned so much, you need to fix that"
No more boxes!
"Alright, that's it.
I'm moving to the states and finding crunch labs
See you there Mark!"
I can't get the crunch boxes in the UK
Mark literally always has tricks up his sleeve. These creations are so great and smart!
Does this send to europe?
"4:28 “We can wheel the shipping container back to its natural habitat.”

How to troll your friends 101."
What kind of shoes are you wearing?
I mean... WHAT THE HACK??? This is amazing! Are you sure you are not Ironman? Millionaire with an amazing engineering secret lab with an intelligence far beyond average... You rock!
That shelf is like some minecraft redstone contraption
Need to Build a call centre in there :) for testing purposes
Is it available in other countries?
Hey mark you should deliver these boxes world wide not some selected countries.I am not able to get one of these boxes😢
I’m so sad because I can’t get the set because I live in china
Hacksmith has some competition for best warehouse on YouTube
Squirrel 3.0 when
This is so cool
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this guy.
"THIS IS WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF
PLEASE
CAN I HAVE IT?????????"
I hope the boxes become available to the Philippines soon (not yet listed as a destination country when i checked the site). Would really love my kids to build an engineering project every month 🤗
did he copy kiwiko kinda?

Why cant I get it sent to Switzerland.

"I recognize that playground in Mountain View, California.  :)"
Wow this is my dream to visit you I hope I get lucky and open a crunchlab box and get a platinum ticket
I'm an adult and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna sign up for Crunch Labs lmao
Hi
That actually like a dream place to be in!!! Can't imagine how fun it is to have one of those 😮‍💨🤤😁
Literally a Secret Lab lol
"Is this only in California? I'm in Maryland just outside DC and I""m a little heartbroken that I'll never get to experience this :/"
Your creative potential seems limitless.
Well what if I live in Australia then how do I come?

Love it
I'll take note to look for eagles on shelves next time i'm in some office
I’ve always wanted to have a secret door to something then life is amazing
I cant buy this im sorry
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory

you should invite elon for a day to play

Hey you need to work on the inconspicuousness of that secret bookshelf.  You can see the light under the bookshelf.
I love that some youtubers are making my childhood dreams true so i dont have to do them ;)
You really should have the theme song for Dexter's Laboratory playing in here.
Why I feel borring
I can't wait to get the toy claymore

“Before this channel becomes r rated…”
"Mark: makes a secret lab with a secret entrance 
Also mark: releases the way of entrance to everyone"
"@Mark Rober There is only 3M views on this video, not 20M you cheeky little boy!"
Get nikocado avocado to try the firemans piston
I sometimes wish I had a kid to get him the crunch lab box so they learn while they have fun instead of this broken generation always on their phones.
Can the boxes ship to Pakistan??
I think that's a huge hint in my opinion 0:08
Fr
"This is incredible. 

We need a place like this in the UK. I have to say the only thing that i think is missing is some form of impressive button which launches a model railway that delivers the post to the train chase theme from The Wrong Trousers.

Mr Mark Rober, sir, You are the American embodiment of Wallace (and Gromit). You engineering marvels are truly spectacular and inspiring. Enjoy your Warehouse of awesome!"
So Mark is the Willy Wonka of engineering? I like that.
That's Dexter's laboratory!
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
I feel sorry for whatever theif is on the receiving end of that ping pong ball cannon

Is it available in India
Well under the secret door there is light so it’s kinda obvious
"you should also consider to expand outside of the USA, for example Europe"

"You are my favorite person EVER. For reference...I'm a kid's entertainer, educator, videographer. And you are far and away everything I would ever hope for to achieve and to aspire to times 100. I'm just so glad you exist to do all of the things and inspire all of the kids in the most playful manner that so many just do not comprehend is necessary. I'm going to keep doing my thing, but I feel better that there are people like you out there with such a playful spirit, inspiring kids to create, explore and have fun. You rock, brother."
"World wide order, I will order from..."

Can you buy crunch boxes in the UK?
what can you say really super cool getting the crunch lab kits for my grandson keep it coming massively cooool !!!!!!
3:46 bro?
I would have loved those kits as a kid. It took an unfathomable amount of money spent on legos for me to design machines like these as a grew older. Your raising a generation mark
"Maybe this is just me being a bit of a loser, because this whole thing is dope AF but.. You should totally have put like a draft excluder or something under the bookshelf door just to keep light from coming in from under it."

Someone just buys all the boxes
Hi bro
"Mark, this crosses the line."
Mark has a taken yet another step to being a superhero!
"You know who else was behind the bookcase





If you do you know how that worked out"
"The ABSOLUTE king of overkill 😂😂😂 a bike with a train horn, for some reason that was what shocked me most, lol"
Anyone know what the song is at 6:18? It's stuck in my head!!!
"After hours of trying to find it on the internet, I was able to figure it out. Downloaded the audio from this, ran a section of it through vocalremover to isolate the background music, and Shazam'd it. The song is Graze the Roof, from Plants vs Zombies, by Laura Shigihara 😄"
Watch out kiwi co! Rober might be cutting into your market!
The light shining from underneath the bookcase is a dead giveaway though
grunkle stan?
Do you ship to the UK?
yeah im 24 and i lowkey wanna get these boxes
Wow just wow
Mark rober and Collin furze trully are living childhood dreams with there projects Colin furze building an entire tunnel system under his house and yard and mark this factory

Did you forget to change your account? lol
If only Anne Frank knew about this...
"That is literary my dream thing from 2 years ago. I'd love to buy the build box and support you but rn i can't affort it, because i'm working on a small project of mine."
I might buy a crunch box only because he told me in persuasive writing and using PEEL
This is one of the best things that I have ever seen
its my birthday tomorrow :)
Im making that bullseye when I visit one day
Bro like I actually don’t understand how this guy releases a video every month on a project he said he’s been working on for over a year
It's not a secret anymore if everyone knew about it
Your wife has been wondering where all your life savings have been going to
When is it available globally?
my reaction would be: ''why is there light radiating from this shelf?''
I have been looking for an farm that to put on my wall. Where can I find more details or where to buy?
I would do anything to be marks nephew
I feel bad for all Mark Rober's nieces and nephews' uncles because they're no match for this guy
"Advert for business, not a mark rober vid"
I love all the Easter eggs especially with fat Gus from the squirrel vids which were one of my favorites 💜
Well not a secret anymore
Light comes from the lab under the library in the boring office. It's a giveaway. Plus the youtube video does not help with the secrecy.
Kiwico?
That's cool
HOW🤯
"This is WAY better than Willy Wonka, you sparked my love for engineering and to this day I love your content. You are such an inspiration for sooooo many people me included. keep doing what you do ❤️"
You should mod some of you’re nerf guns it would be fun and make them a hundred times cooler
What if you live in a diffrent country?
Congrats! It's so cool.
Mark Rober is a blessing of a human being.
So the wall goes straight back so Is the building really big but the inside is small until you go through the secret doors
"Hey Mark, I would like a box but it isn't shipped to India. Is there any other way?"
12:30 What is the music used there? Also I love your vids Mark! Keep up the amazing work!!
It’s called dizzy
Crunch box is a great idea
Will there be international overseas shipping
When all you want to be is a Mark 😆
14:44 The cleanup would be so big

Only Mark  Rober would make his dream engineering workshop and then make it a secret room...  🤣
"aaaaand he just showed it to over 3,000,000 people.

i didn't wach the entire video first."
Sounds like this is the end of the Kiwi Co sponsorship 🤣

Covert cannabis farmers rejoice!
Is it only me or u are becoming mr beast?
"Wow, this is beyond awesome! I'm not a fan of YouTuber cash grabs but this seems like a genuinely amazing product. Seriously cool stuff and a great way to get kids into engineering."
BEST LAB EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mark do be building robots to take over the world
the best uncle in the world
for the didnt wash hands contraption the sensor is triggerd by the tap what if they just turn on the tap and then the alarm wont go of why dont you put a soap dispenser then put a sensor on that
I look at all those kids participating in your videos and I get so envious! It must be so inspiring for them to watch you build complicated and awesome projects. I would definitely spend all my time in that lab.
Any other vex robotics competitors who just saw mark playing spin up?
Myself and 3.8m others will keep your secret safe

This secret lab screams mid life crisis
sleeper house 💀💀💀
Maybe you need a sign on the 2nd floor to let people know if the foam pit is there or not. The risk manager in me is concerned about people jumping off thinking the foam is there when it's not.
I am speechless. Love secret passageway and rooms. Now I know you've got a secret underground bunker like in Blast From The Past. Because why not?

It would be inhuman to think that mark makes all of his inventions in his garage

Me: Mark Rober’s nephew…"
I need the claymore
"Arnt you too ""WHITE"" for CokaCola?"
"Ooooooh so cool

It's amazing but I hope it follows the building laws especially for fire.
What does he do to make enough to do this???
Can we get some AI on that piano. Her commentary will be priceless .

Mark has never failed to surprise and impress me. I've been watching him for 3 years and it has never been boring. Such a great guy
I wish I could come but I probably can't since im in New Zealand
im so exited im going to watch the video 5 times
Mark is now giving children tennis ball claymores.
Mark you should colab and work with HackSmith!
This has HUGE nuka world DLC vibes with the door
I forgot about the tennis cannon lol
So i just watched a 20 minute advertisement.
Huh

"Love the build box! English speaking kids have so many choices. Are there any plans to dub yourself into multiple languages? I guess Swedish will come last 😢 but if you had it in German, Spanish, French etc I think it would be really successful ❤️"
I can never go there even though I want to
mark rober is my childhood hero
16:25 HOW DID YOU DO THAT
"I'm not in the USA so idk if it's even possible to buy the crunchlabs box, and even harder to get the plat ticket :skull:"

I am glad someone else thought this! He even helps make some boxes for Kiwico.
Came to the comments section just to find a comment like this 🤣
"Yess, I was thinking the same thing😂😮"
The wall of 3D printers tho
Someone in my class is doing a poster on you

Hey Mark how will you know we got the ticket. Do we have to do something for u to know that we got it and what if someone doesn't live where u live would we have to buy a plane ticket to go  to your  warehouse
I guess 3.7 million people know the secret entrance
Yay new video!
So we're you not sponsored by Kiwi Co. several times? You literally just copy and pasted their entire business.

Isn't this just your own take on Kiwi boxes or are you working in collaboration with them?
"At this point, It's literally more impressive if Mark posts a video that doesn't go viral."
BRILLIANT!!!!
This gets my vote as the coolest thing ever.
I've always wanted a lab like they had in the dexter's laboratory show. Looks like mark did it. So so cool!!!! /\
this guy is crazy (but really cool ngl)

WHO IS THIS GUY’S RIVAL?"
You're so awesome and smart lol I know the kids love you the most haha
"As always, blown away! My son is only 4 but i can see these boxes in his future 🛠"
This feels like tony stark secret room for his suits
what if we live in another country?
"Mark, do you have a scholarship program for kids who don’t have the resources to buy the kits. Think patreon for direct sponsorship of kids."
This dude is amazing fr
"once sponsor, now competitor"
wow i have wait for like 1000 day yeah it have a long time
"What an excellent idea for inspiring potential young engineers, legend Mr Rober"
I saw number nine. I love nerf.
what state is that warehouse tho first before i buy the boxes
There no machines lol couldn’t get them through the secret door
He added them before the secret door.
The coolest laboratory ever ⚡️
Awesome
Love the new lab. It reminded me of the lab from Big Hero 6. Such a cool lab.
You’ll be the reason I’ll do engineering
This is the way
Another amazing video from mark i can not buy your product but is ok and cool warehouse
Sooo you've made KiwiCo?
it’s crazy i started watching when he’d make those squirrel mazes… love the videos
"Mark might just put Kiwico out of business
""Foreshadowing"""
I'm a kid and I love it
Question: How can you be sure that you'll be safe with the fireman's piston? How do you know that the piston will always work and that users will hold on the rope correctly?
neat
Kiwico be like 👀🤔🧐
Ordered!
"This reminds me of that one family guy episode, but now an Reality"
He really is the Willy Wonka of engineering...
The only thing you're missing is Jean-Ralphio.
We love ultimate frisbee!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So it’s the nerdy version of fantasy factory??
9:50 ...teaching how to use an inquisitor lightsaber
Damm I have to wait for more 6-8 years as my baby is 2 only.
06:24 well the light under the shelf pretty much gives it away
"If you post your secret lab on YouTube, how is that lab secret then??"
Will you fly me out from Australia if I was to win ?
He inspires more people than Elon Musk
always wanted my own room where i could do these stuff.
Real talk though. The fireman's piston might be a great thing for firefighters!
From cool science guy to sold-out infomercial guy took about 10 yrs🤔
Okay on my way!!!!
Congrats! It's a great idea!
"I Mark! I have a question, would you ever think about making adult (18+) boxes like these? I don't want to take away from the kids, but they look so fun! Just a suggestion of course 😍🤩 Thank you for making these for the kids, what a wonderful idea!"
14:48 hmm that kinda reminds me of someone in a car 🤔
I also want to be a engenir
mark I could see the lights under the secret door at 6:26
Is Mark Rober ripping off Kiwico?
This is really one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen. I’m not even halfway through the video yet.
Signed up ;)
Amazing!!
POV Kiwi Co. couldn’t sponsor video mark: When something doesn’t exist you make it that’s the beauty of being an engineer
100% Buying the crunchlabs box for myself seems really interesting
Simply amazing
did mark like buy kiwico or something lol
wow
This is amazing
Wow! Presentation was flawless!
Oh....its just a really long commercial
I am jealous.
"This video makes me smile. It makes me feel like a kid again too. I could imagine having so much fun there.

It's also really fantastic that you do so much to get kids interested in engineering and all the possibilities it offers."
Damm his feels like a inner child's dream come true
Follow the science.
such an inspirational person
"That is one AMAZING LAB!! I’m all signed up! Can’t wait to start getting my monthly boxes!!
You are so creative and talented! My family loves watching your videos! Can’t wait to do these boxes together!"
Too bad for me I'm from Maldives soo maybe world wide shipping?
hhahH
Low-key looks like Zach kings office
Full of motivation and inspiration
"0:42 But before we see if I actually live, this video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends"
"""I've Got a Huge Meth Lab Under This Dry Cleaning Service"""
"Bummer for me, wanting to be an engineer.. asked my mom for a crunch box .. she said we dont have a money tree… : ( that’s unfortunate.."
"""""One of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something he always respect us , the audience and his  team, and his is polite in all videos We Congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come,,🙏🙏"
cool!
Dude the crunch lads looks super cool only thing is I still cant play with Legos without having to take it apart and put it bake together at least once
I want the toilet stuf wherever I go pls! This would make the whole world much better!
I love it!  I bought three subscriptions.  My kids are really excited.
Isn’t crunch labs just like the kiwi box?
Not really a secret door if u can see the big warehouse from the outside of the house lol
GRAZE THE ROOF POG!!!!!!!!!!
0-0 Wow
I wish I have money lol😂😂😂
i am 16. i want one of those build boxes.
This guy is exactly what I thought being an adult was when I was five. Glad to see him living the dream 🥲
Me too😀
@MonkeyJedi99 i’ve never seen such an amazing quote in a youtube comment sections
"Oh, to finally grow up enough to have the childhood you always wanted!"
Same here
"mark: lemme give you guys a hint 
*literally shows us how to get inside*"
hey mark rober im in a difrent contory cald georgia and y whant crunch labs mishns  and how can y get the mshins
are you plannin to do international shipping? i love your channel but not in usa.
Almost as cool as Colin Furze's bunker.
Is there projects that are 16 and up?
"where were you 40 years ago when I would have loved this... .. oh yeah, you were 2.. that place looks like a ton of fun."
"Hey Mark,  would you buy a ticket for me to fly to California if I win the platinum ticket?"
"Holy crap, almost 7 min of wasted time fluff in this vid..."
Its like a movie
mark rober is a child in a super mans body
I just wish mark rober to be my uncle
Incredible as always.
"Sorry, I just can't get past your friendship with the Kimmel abomination."
"Get me a Job dud, I'm desperate"
You basically copied Kiwico which has been doing this for yrs now.
"Platinum tickets 😆 was gold copywriten? 
Great video! great lab! Your gunna make a ton of kids day.. I have no idea how to say that better
Hopefully we get to see you take down more scammers in the near future."
I suppose the light that emits from under the bookshelf doesn’t give the hideout away
"Awesome. I live in the United Arab Emirates. Will you be shipping over here too? My kids would love this.  Ps I think that the light is leaking out under your book case door, could be a give away. Lol"
Where is the nuclear reactor and your roomate Nile red
Can you make me one
This is a bit like the neverland ranch
The whole video its an advertisement
who else but Mark Rober?
"Definitely gonna try the crunch labs, I wanna be an engineer when I grow up"
TAKE MY MONEY!
Lol there's light coming from under that book shelf in the office....
This is 10million times cooler than Mr Beast’s chocolate factory
I'm like 85% sure this guy has molested a kid.
We now all know what you don’t need to be secret well I just got it so never mind
6:48 *Gravity Falls Theme Plays*
This is honestly my dream...a secret room? Come on!
So basically... it's Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory
"Vsauce, mark here"
Engineer the force. I have spoken.
Can’t wait for him to legally acquire NileGreen for the lab
Wow
"So, the squirrels were just proof of concept?  You go Mr. Rober!"
Only Rober could make such an awesome 17 min commercial. P.S. those boxes are amazing and when my kids get older they will be getting them
"That's it, I found an architect/engineer for my future home"
engineers solve problems
Disposable money must be a nice problem to have
"Mark rober has made my childhood dream come true. As a kid I would only play with hotwheels, and now he’s made the longest hotwheels track"
Of course a diet Pepsi button would be the perfect thing to open a secret door 😂
thank you for doing this mark
Ohh yes you uploaded again I thought you were too busy and will almost never upload but now I understand you were building this thing cuz you inspired me alot
"I remember when Vsauce started making curiosity boxes, before they stopped making content."
Early
"mark rober be like

today i am atemting to make a thermal nuke"
I think he used this in one of his live streams
"Yep, that's the place I wish I could work in"
"his personality comes off as phony and exaggerated, like Jimmy Fallon"
Hey mark do you think you are able to make a car that runs from water.
What happens when you have to clean the toilet
yay new video
yo yes
15:00  mark as a weapon maker for war
You sir are a wonderfully mad genius and a delight to watch
8 billion people on Earth & countless others who’ve lived on this planet & yet I’m still confident saying that Mark R. would be the funnest/coolest person to be friends with!
The inside of that building reminds me of Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory
uff...
This guy is amazing he is definitely smarter than Elon Musk
Awesome 🤩
"I would love to buy them but sadly not available in my country, no Latinoamerican country is on the list"
Mark Rober and Dude Perfect are winning YouTube 👑🏆
Every kids DREAM
Awesome! Just like in a movie!
Not really a secret when everyone knows...
Where in the bay area is this ware house?
why are you using a green screen ??? :O
I am 34 and would still order the monthly Crunchlabs Build Boxes. I grew up with KNex and Legos. My mind loves to learn how things work and fit together. XD
Glad you didn’t choose Crunch Brain Fitness as lawyers for those meat heads would be knocking.

i cant believe mark rober would create an air Cannon hahaha 😂

Ha Mark Rober thank you so much for the content and also teaching me how certain organisms work or inspiring me to look that up
"Ok, but only if you promise to blindfold us on the trip 😆 My kids have big mouths and I don't wanna give away your base location 🤣🤣

Definitely looking forward to our 1st box! 🤗"
"Mark’s next project should be attempting to make a roller coaster, I understand that Mark is not a coaster engineer but with his skill in engineering I think he could make a simple roller coaster, not like a crazy one at a theme park, more like a kid coaster."
It would still be rideable by a human to be a roller coaster
Doesn't the Hot Wheels track count for that???
"This guy is amazing.  He makes every adult want to be a kid again.  I can’t even imagine how cool a whole educational amusement park he could build. Like literally, like an Epcot sized park.  Disney’s gotta go! Too woke.  Mark is awesome"
Anyone else notice how he’s basically going into competition with Kiwico?
"We've seen LTT become LMG, Hacksmith become Hacksmith Industry, and here we are Mark Rober with Crunch Labs, congratulations... 🎉 And now, do you need some server? 😂"
"Underneath the book case you can see the light comming from the passageway behind it.
So if the lights are on in there it kind of gives it away that there is something strange is going on with that book case."
This looks sooo fun
Every time I watch your videos I want to be an engineer more
BREAKING NEWS - Kiwi Co is dead officially.
hi.
Gravity falls vibes
Love the FPV footage
Bro just built his own fantasy factory
Pov: You’re jealous
I already know where the to open the door
"Hi I’m Howard, recently my mom have been scammed for 13000 I hope you could help my mom, I’m also a huge fan."
I need help my mon
bro that's such a cool place and I'm almost 28
Kiwi co be crying
"It's nice to see this kinda stuff when you begin to think the world isn't so great. One of those ""faith in humanity restored""  moments."
that is a kid living in a man's body and i'm all for it
Rip me being 17 and unable to enter
you got a family member like a little sibling that could?
"Yeah, if I had the childlike wonder and energy, with the biggest brains and skills, like Mark does.. I'd have built American Gladiators in my gigantic office as well. Alas."
"Hey Mr.Rober. Is this only for kids? If not I""m a fan, and would like to participate."
KiwiCo?
"_Me watching the video halfway around the Earth_ : Well, this is nice.....for Americans; but hey, I can probably watch the winners take the tour here on YouTube which is still nice."
14:52 welcome to demolition ranch
Bro bouta turn into a super villain
Dude mark rober is so COOL🔥🔥🔥
wow!
I can only offer a virtual handshake in respect. How fantastic to take the success of a Youtube channel to spread the spark of imagination and learning to so many others. I have no doubt Mark cannot do this all on his own so also huge respect to all his unsung family and helpers and enablers that have helped him achieve this!
Try collabing with stuff made here. It'll be a banger for sure
Great !! Just Enjoy Your Videos Mark !!
Watch mark forget he moved the foam pit
L kiwi co
This guy has made a literal bat cave
Bro I love Mark Robert and all but I swear he’s a kid in an adult body that’s a genius
I hate having grown up
Isn’t this like Kiwi Co?
Woaaaaahahnjjjjj
"02:50, Hey, I own a Perses as well!"
I love seeing what you do in the months!
"This, 7:12, ladies and gentlemen, is when the ""Yeet the child"" meme came true."
What about that light under the bookshelf? Dead givaway
👍 🇺🇸
"Forget my kids I want everyone of those builds you showed, seriously looks so fun!"
I could see the light under the shelf. Still very cool
Pretty sure you are aiming to be the globe's coolest uncle
"buy the box just to force mark to create the most outlandish thing possible

i'm thinking something to do with a plane. need more time to think on it"
Make a think that u can control with your mind
İ am from another  country can i still get them the crunch boxes
"mark: an average person can never find it
me: (￣y▽,￣)╭"
Dexter Lab
I get gravity falls vibe
Hi
Mark you’re everyone’s hero
Mark Robert's Labbo let's gooo
Cirst he saved the trees then the seas now hes fostering your children
Great job! So awesome!
I'm a kid. And really wish to visit crunch labs. Although. The rest of my family doesn't know you. And not being able to go is sorta sad.
Mark is living my dream!! :D
"11:26 ""It's bot only okay, but it's also important to fail a bunch in order to hit that big break through.""
USSR: ""When were you when we needed you?"" 😂"
Sheesh
It would be cool if you could do something for older kids/teens
"What an amazing project, thank you Mark."
"Hello mark, you are the only reason I am still going through university thank you for giving me hope"
This is awsome
"I love this!! I’ve wanted to try doing stuff like this for a while now, and crunch labs is the perfect opportunity!"
Does anyone feels the same vibe from Gravity Falls?
Lol
"So we have to lift the seat up and put the seat down.
That sounds fair."
It was always my dream as a kid to have an awesome factory to toy around and do stuff like this... and then I grew up...... And my dream became to make it all tax exempt...I think you have done both.. Congrats.
I want to be an engineer just like you
Nilegreen!?
this is the sickest thing I've ever seen my entire life
"In your re-design you should use a mirror as a secret door so you can literally go ""through the looking glass"""
What a great idea.  Even a parent would be blown away with that reference.
the trip wire crunch box i saw got me
Mark... OMG.. you Rock!!...  Blessing to you and family.
Turn that track into a VR experience!
hope I can become a smart as you
Best vid ever
Where is the tushy v 3.0 or Toto Washlet?
You can make a nerf grenade in your next video
"yoo !!this is best for your summer vacays,this stuff cool bro"
Wow he just ripped off kiwiko
Bro could you do this for adults
Need any crunch lab employee?
"I think I'd notice the glowing light coming from under the bookcase, lol"
"I love the idea, sure there is a HUMONGUS garage door on the other side that may sell it as the ""secret lab"" =), but I do love the idea, it is clearly made to make childs dream. I can only imagine how extatic they can react entering from the secret door with the platinum ticket!!!"
"I feel really bad for his nieces' and nephews' other uncle... he has no chance against Mark

All jokes aside though, super cool as always, this is crazy awesome!"
"If I were him, I'd totally make myself a t-shirt that said ""Timmy's _Other_ Uncle"""
My mom bought me the annually one and I can’t wait to build with you!
Love this!
So exciting!
I really wanna buy one but i cant 😭😭😭😭😭😭
def canceling my doodle crate for this
MrBeast and Mark Rober need to make a crossover video.
They did. Twice.
I want to have some kids just so i can buy them a crunch labs box
Let me in. LET ME IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNN
Mark after a long day and going in his factory: Welcome back Mr. Rober
So it’s better kiwico
You need to fix that light leak under you bookcase door.
do you ship to nz/aus
Are u looking for a brother mark😂
Hi
Wish I was as smart as you
"Mark Rober, where's the WKUK nerf nuke?  If you are all that and a bag of chips, you need the NERF Nuke Bruh! I mean, wtuf Mark Rober?"
"wasn't thinking it, Mark Rober at his worst here... :/"
"It's cool yeah, but you can still see the light underneath it. Am I the only one?"
Mans items are so cool they could be in a museum in 100 years
Please check the container is there before jumping 🙏
He's the guy in all science kid shows in one.
This is just like a spy movie for the Secret lab mark you Genius
"While I appreciate the idea of the door being unable to be opened due to seat being up, I hope there is a way in from the outside incase of an emergency."
its tony stark
Guess it's not so secret anymore
"hopefully no one leaps for the foam pit, when it is stored away :)"
"""See light underneath bookshelf."" 
Hum, secret door engineering still in the beta phase?"
Kiwico
"This. Is a cool Video.

Nice Job!

Love it"
meanwhile........ checking to see if i have enough money to pay for gas this week......
"Mark, my engineering teacher this year remarked to me about having you drive the robotics team's robot for Hurricane. He said you had so much enthusiasm. I also know your nephew Caleb. It's so amazing to me that someone I view as next to a celebrity takes special care to include those around him. I see incredible selflessness and humble thought behind everything you do. Thank you for being my role model and inspiring me in many ways, morally and physically. I hope to someday meet you myself, maybe at Caleb's mission farewell!"
Long rime no see
"I'll buy it for a dollar!
Aight! Deal!"
I'm an engineer and love teaching kids.  I'm so jealous. I'm praying for your success.
"you never disappoint, mark!"
RIP KiwiCo! 🤣
6:50 again love the PvZ music
I can't wait to buy this for my niece
That’s so cool
Just imagine you get your dream engineering job working for mark robber and one day while working you just hear the faint sound of an electric nerf gun power up.
The light from under the sliding bookshelf gives it away :D
How are you still not the greatest uncle? Dude you're literally Grunkle Stan from Gravity Falls at this point
"Thiefs be like "" note that down note that down"""
"Him: ima give u a hint

Also Him: 'Proceeds to show his lab'"
"Ahh ,Phat gus/Phantastic gus ,how is she doing?"
"In all of my years of watching YouTube videos, this is the only video where I _wanted_ to watch the commercial!"
"Mark Rober, the ultimate big little kid."
Super cool video dude and this is cool
"Mark, I don’t have anyone to give a box to. 
Is there a way to sponsor someone??"
Most of us agree that Mark is making our childhood dreams come true
"Dude, stop yelling all the time..."
do you know what a volume button is by any chance?
its not that secret when you can see a bright light under that shelf
But im on Indonesian
"Me: ""Honey look, toys to teach about science and more...""
Wife: ""Oh nice!! Should be perfect for the kids...""
Me: ""Sure... the kids... 😉""

Mark, once again you have outdone yourself. This is great! Love your content!!!"
totally for the kids
Lol
He's like Dexter
If you posted this video I know you’re still alive
"You n mr beast. Greatest at scale and positive vibe spreading. Love you both. You’re a hero to so many, it’s epic to see :)"
Amazing!
Bruh youtube unsubcribed me
"This is real life ""My New Minecraft Secret Base"" 😂👌"
if you're not the coolest uncle yet there other uncle must be giving hundred dollar bills or do you wan't to be the best in the world? 😂
Mark Rober officially a 5mins craft channel... NUMBER 9!!!! SPONSORED BY NERF!!
"You should do a Collab with stuff made here, like if you agree to get his attention"
This is so cool! I'm glad you got to make your dream come true Mark!
Mark you are the real life batman
"He has secret science cave you know why …… cuz his MARK ROBER !!!!!😂
But love your warehouse and new crunch labs engineer set 👍🏻
Great video 👍🏻 and love from india 🇮🇳"
what happens if say you live in New Zealand but can't afford to fly to America with the silver ticket? Would we have to find a way to ship it back?
"Step 2 in making a batman story, build a secret lab"
Just one question i live in hungary and how is it gonna work if it even gonna get to me but i get the platinum ticket how will i get to that place?
"as an aspiring engineer, this is awesome. I can also see myself doing nothing but procrastinating."
You are amazing. This is amazing. Wow.

Happy pride everyone  🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 also please don't mess up dentists and random offices just because you think that Mark made it
"go wreck every office you see!!! you might get to say hi to mark rober, risk getting arrested! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
I would love to spend a whole day learning about science thank you MARK !
This is so cool!
but will this make us have maybe 2 videos a month and not just 1 :o
"What happens if there is a fire while someone has the toilet seat up tho?
Do they get locked in till they put it down still lol?"
he who doesnt wash his hands will suffer the eternal fire
Lovely vid mark❤️
The raddest inspiration
What about the light under the bookshelf you can see a mile away. 🧐
When you have child energy but big smart brain and access to lots of adult money you get this
His arm in the mirror literally stopped moving at 13:27!!!

"mark rober, the s-tier youtube engineer"
Yes.. motivation
"there really isn't anyone quite like you, never stop what you're doing"
I can see the secret passage way below the bookshelf
Is this still a secret i mean million of people knew it now lmao😆
"Mark it really makes me smile when you talk about inspiring the next generation of engineers, mainly because I for one, AM a member of the next generation of engineers. currently making my way through high school hoping to specialize in mechanical engineering and get a masters degree from college!"
Mark loved your comment
You can do it!
Omg.. How I wish I was 20 years younger
It's like the real life Dexter's laboratory I love it
I’m early- ish. 😅
You think he coordinated w/ mr. beast what with the whole Willie factory video?
"So, not putting down the toilet sit make men pigs? what does that make women who does not put the sit up?"
"MrBeast
I Built Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory!"
"its now official, Mark Rober is Batman"
Remind me of my Arcade's secret room in GTA Online
"Well, can't get it in India"
my daughter is 6. i think she would enjoy those boxes. smart little girl.
🐐
"Wow, Mark is doing his own KiwiCo...That'll be interesting"
would the coin spinner work with non us coins like nzd coins
This is so cool!
hes gonna start making stuff for the jackass movies 💀
:20 million people opening cupboards in some random shop
Please make it available to MALAYSIA. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEEEE
You should invite Jordan mader to take some photos!
Ok
6:47 It had to be the Diet Pepsi
Sweet mama. Wow
Imagine someone succeeds in finding this lab legitimately without getting the ticket...
I would be scared to visit there because I feel like there would be genius pranks everywhere
That is every kids dream
my literal childhood dream
When the delivery Guy has Seen this video
I am 35 and I love your videos 😂
This is such a wonderful idea. I would've loved to have something like this when I was younger.
Super emasculated
I would love to see an escape room built by mark himself without the tips and tricks it would be epic !!!
I hope my mom lets me buy some of your cool packages
"""these hoes ain't loyal"" - KiwiCo, probably"
"Me :..............,.mhn......... Nah nope nope no I'm out"
Epic 🤩
Mark is Tony Stark v2.0 :-)
We need these things
I am fully convinced that Mark is engineer Mr. Beast
How can I be more like you because you are super successful and I’m just a kid
RIP Kiwi co
so freaking cool!
Hay mark what if someone like me in Australia and we get a ticket????
Here’s where James Bond gets all his gadgets!
Engineer gaming
Mark is about to make bank
"This is so cool, I look forward to my kids being able to do this.  You are awesome Mark, thanks for showing how cool engineers are! 😎📐⚙️"
STRAIGHT OUTTA A MOVIE BRO KEEP IT UP
That is Epic
Mark. You are definitely the hero we deserve in this world!
Is it for all ages
Why am I not surprised?
The ABSOLUTE coolest.  Wow.
Team seas team trees and my buddy mr beast
How funny would it be if this was sponsored by kiwi Co 🤣
"Mark its about time we get you your own tv show. Air it prime time once a week, guarantee to be the best thing on tv. Why cause it’s science, it’s engineering, it’s creatively and last but not least it’s Mark Rober."
Mark what if I’m not 8 or 12 but instead I’m 19 and still want to grow up to be an engineer like you
"From telling subscribers to buy kiwico crates to owning a company which builds one uniquely, that journey's amazing. Keep it up Mark❣️‼️"
mark never dissapoints
Holy cow. I wish this was a thing when I was 8 or 12!!! Now I’m 29 but uh… I might get it just because hahaha I wish I could do something like this for medicine. I’d love to one day get the newer generations excited about medicine!
4:30 Sneaky Marques Brownlee cameo 🤫
Secret?
this has a feeling of Dexter's lab!
"This video is literally ""if I won the lottery I wouldn't tell anyone. But there would be signs."" 😍🤣"
"I get the sense that Mark has this secret desire to be ""Q"" in the next Bond movie.The bookcase opening gave it away."
"When I was a kid, used to build balsa wood airplanes powered by a rubber band. The batteries would never wear out, but sometimes the rubber band would break. Oh and those plastic rockets that you fill half way with water, and pump up with air, those were fun.

That's where I learned about some engineering stuff."
Literally the next Bill Nye
I think he’s already better than them I
If we have to fly out there do we have to pay for it because If I won my family probably won’t have the money to fly out
"I have this dream too , To have my own Dexter's Lab"
Mark are you still on that battery-on-wheels traveling to Colorado
Failing it isn’t a bad thing it’s just learning something new that doesn’t work but it might work with other things
Dang does this mean no more Kiwico sponsorship.
MKBHD casually #7 lol
"INVERT THE LOGO OF THE CRUNCH LABS!!! that way it looks like an L connected (kind of angled) to the ""C"" shape that the wrench makes naturally!"
Mark Rober is Willy Wonka confirmed.
the hotwheels track can be used as a timer to practice time management xD
Next video: Ive made a HUGE secret nuke in my secret warehouse
"literally to the 1% who's reading this, may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day.please look at challenge.🔥🥰🥰🥰👌👌"
my childhood fantasy 🤣
"This person always tries to do something new and extra ordinary and make his audience feel excited for every next video, Love you.🥰🔥🔥🙏👌"
"Bot

"Dope, love the FPV Footage 🤘"
@Space Monkey Films 2 great pilots 🙌
@Space Monkey Films  who's the pilot? Saw this on IG 🙌
Why thanks😊🙏
Can you explain why the pneumatic ladder works in the same speed independent of the person's weight?
"99.9% of the comments here be like: he never fails to make me laugh, his content never disappoint us 💓💓💓"
"Bot
another bot
botting"
I think you will get a lot of adult techy folks buying the crunch labs.   Love the Willie Wonka ticket idea.
"Ah yes, Mark is finally showing his true self: a sales bro."
Mark when I get older can you help me build a warehouse your my idol
"secret lab?


JESSE WE NEED TO COOK"
This guy is one bad backstory away from becoming a super villain
great stuff - possible because of american economic and mental freedom.  Let's keep it.
BRUH THATS SOO COOL
Seems like a dream
holy cow
"Ah #6, the fire hazard."
every kids dream
So cool
You're awesome.  This is a wonderful idea.
These guys are actually changing the world. Mark Rober and Jimmy are gonna rule the world one day
"i want to create things by myself , i mean   i feel not to directly see the crunch lab videos but to brainstorm on idea , does anyone else feel like that ?"
Mark Rooster
"Thanks for making me a ""Real Civil Engineer"". LOL"
"Dude! it's like you have your own batcave, wait.. no the Mark Rober Cave!"
Wow!!!  love it all and the Hot Wheels record track really made my day! Congratulations!
I think this is the best YouTube video I’ve ever seen.
I want to try that piston!
I feel sorry for kiwi Co they are going to see less business now.
I feel sorry for kiwi Co they are going to see less business now.
"I wish I had someone to order the boxes for!  But I would have included an entry a la ""Thunderbirds,"" or at the very least a chute like the Moonbase pilots use in ""UFO."""
So you're saying the channel is going well
"you should make a basketball robot that can nail 3 pointers and full courts 
clarification: its just an idea i thought that might be cool"
Ive seen a chair-plus before in a mall i tried it is really fun
3:46 Hmm🤔 I wonder if Mark mains Ken in Smash as well?
Can’t believe it’s. Been a month already
Fun!  I think what all men really want is a bat cave.
Never grow up Mark; never grow up. 😁
I just bought the 12 month annual plannnn!!!!!! 😱😁😁
sheldon cooper is gonna love mark
"This video was sponsored by: KiwiC ... oh, well this is awkward."
Its not a secret anymore...
Mark = 2022’s Bill Nye the Science guy
Congratulation for 22 million subscriber 👍🏻🥳🎊🎉❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
In 12:25 the background music is literally my background music in every video I make
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You should make the hotwheel go through a fish tank
😂😂😂
i love it
"Hi, my kid is 30. It's me. I'm the kid."
And they say money doesn’t buy happiness
The problem with the piston would be that it takes a second to reset. This means each fireman would have to wait and their response time would be delayed
It's like the fantasy factory for awesomeness
"Kiwico won't sponsor him anymore, I guess 😂😂"
I have always wanted a secret place like that except I would fill it with million dollar cars and have a lounge and bed so I could live in complete seclusion plus an epic gaming room. Mark must spend all his time in there.
"I love the lab, it looks so cool"
This is my childhood dream haha! Amazing as always Mark and so happy for you.
4th
It’s my childhood dream too!!
Same!
E‎
The Willy Wonka of engineering.
"I know you probably won't see this and if ya do I'll probably have a heart attack. But, I live you and you videos, buddy. Awesome bro."
He's got his hat on backwards and he's ready to f**king party
Mark I really want your kit and maybe even get the platinum ticket but it is not shipped in India. Is there any way we can get it?
I mean now
The light coming from the bottom of the bookcase would give it away.  Still super freaking awesome!!!
FANTASTIC!!!!!
they're all you need to do is team up with😊 hacksmith
Lol I'm an adult and I want to get Build Box for myself
Been sued by Kiwi Co. Yet?
I want the home-made claymore.
Woahhhhhh
"This world is blessed in so many ways to have a person like you in it. I feel privileged just to have you share your mind with us all, thank you Mark!"
"Correction ""had""."
cool
"Mark: ""You might want to get up and just start moving everything around on display...""





My ADHD self who can't NOT get up and move everything: ""Oh yeah, it's all coming together."""
We will gonna be miss mark OG workshop
Noice
"I do not approve of the toilet seat lowering thing. Woman should have to put it back up, men should not have to put it back down."
tf?
"I feel like Mark and Mr Beast are quite similar, but instead of building his dream warehouse with all the stuff he wants Mr Beast just buys Willy Wonka's chocolate factory."
8 minutes of promotion
"I'm actually surprised I didn't see the comments talking about something he mentioned at the beginning of the video. He was like he made his own willy Wonka's factory of engineering, referring to Mr Beast's recent Willy Wonka's chocolate factory video too."
I want this :sadface:
Looks like Meow Wolf to me.
My boy wants to destroy kiwico and I am here for it.
"for the first bit, they use the same pully system for the screens and curtains on stage"
"Nobody : 
Bill nye's brother :"
"He straight up ripped those kiwico guys, omg. Went to their office, designed the domino robot with them and now came up with an exact duplicate brand as theirs. Not cool, rober, not cool."
Genius
This may be the coolest thing I've ever seen
Mark is a legend id really like to see him design a haunted house for Halloween
I wish I could buy the engineering thing but can't afford one
Funny how these death guns are completely legal lol
KiwiCo: Am I a joke to you?
Only Mark Rober would make his own Base from Odd Squad Bro 😂
Magikarp
mark got a secret door like batman
I really wish my mom would buy me the engineer kit
You released this video on the last day of school for me lol 😂
"Mark, be honest: are you Batman?"
I know you're not going to see this but do you have to sign up now to keep getting the boxes for the year? Or is it an anytime thing? @Mark Rober
weren't you sponsored by kiwico?
I'm a full grown adult and I'm interested in some of these boxes lol
I'm glad for you to achieve so many things so you're going to go very far
Whats happened to kiwi co?
He’s the rob dyrdeck of YouTube
Banana- WOW
This is so cool I love your vids
Mark Rober! You’re the coolest person ever!! You made your own Dexters lab. 😂. Thanks for existing.
16:40 crowlabs?
What
Certainly more interesting than a billion dollar home
"Mark, I for the first time ever am speechless from what you have created. I now why there was a long gap between your videos.  I mean seriously, you outdo yourself with every video you drop. I can only hope that I get a Crunch Lab box with the, “golden ticket”! 

And by the way, you have been the best uncle ever for quite some time!!! 

Keep up the great content!"
Hey mark i love your videos I was wondering I you would let me be in a video
Sale Sale SALE! well if I was in your shoes I would have done the same thing by now
You are my favorite YouTuber and I admire you!! I would like to know what kind of engineering branch or what career I would have to go into to know how to do stuff like you. I am 15 and I really want to learn but I don’t know how to start.
You could definitely make a tv show out of this
11:08 is that a ball buster claymore? holy crap that's so cool
Mr beast crying in the corner
"6:26 Except for, you know, the major light leak. And the strangely cut carpeting."
Hey Mark! 👍TOTALLY AWESOME👍 that you turned this into learning experiences!
"Another important thing in basically anything ""you haven't failed until you've quit"" -Albert Einstein"
The nuke room
"Congrats, Mark!"
Anyone else notice the Plants vs. Zombies music?
could engineering be a hobbie
One question. Are you hiring?
A colab with I did a thing would be one of YouTube’s greatest big engineers
This is every kids dream.
I love your vids and im super excoted when you post a new one
He such a Willie Wonka
kiwi co punching air rn
"6:19

Delivery guy: hmmm i wonder why the bookcase has a blue glow under it 🤔"
I love what you do! It's always entertaining and super cool.
Sooooooo cool 😎!!
I just love how he casually puts an MKBHD cameo and everyone's childhood dream fortress in the same video.
Well mark what if I don’t live where you live and I win
"Everyone who has a “waiting room” will hate you now. Everything will have fingerprints on it. Everything will have to be cleaned. No more early outs on Fridays.

I kid. Love the Wonkaboritory. So well done."
The Hacksmith would be proud
mark you're the coolest guy :) :D
how much money does this cost ?
This was my dream as a kid
I am doing the crunch labs build thing
"Nerf guns in a warehouse huh, he watches Matthias."
"this video is as Mark Rober as it can be 
great work as always sir"
Next thing you know he made a way to get to the core of the earth
"Dude you are amazing! I hate myself. 
No, just kidding. I actually love myself more because of how amazing you are!"
"My jealousy cannot be expressed with words, so I'll just say, I wish I had somewhere half as cool"
"Congrats Mark! You just gave me an easy pick on gifts for my nieces and nephews. 😊

Also, that couch (@3:33) is amazing. Is that custom-made or available commercially?  I'd genuinely buy one."
"If its not comercially available, I think Ikea sells something similar"
The most fun engineering studio on the planet.
Mark I E-Mailed a idea to u
Mark Rober is ascending to a whole new level.
03:24 can anyone tell me what song chopstick plays!!
This is just amazing
Bruh that's just a kiwi co box
Thanks for existing mate
16:16 bruh
Well thats kiwico done
One day in the future Mark is gonna inspire someone harvest dark matter
I'm gonna take a guess and say that's Mark's favorite hat! He wears it in almost every video lol
Does the platinum ticket still work for people in NZ
Mark Rober is the cool dad/engineer version of David Dobrik.
uhm  uhhhhm definitely don't see some sort of light under that bookshelf mark
the worlds best uncle award goes to mark
"I just became an engineer, and every single one of your videos reminded me why i became one."
wish to have one of the cruch lab
"15:45 On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain"

"On a scale of 1 to 10, ho-  on a scale of 1 t-   on a scale of 1 t- on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?"
Wait was that Marques?
did anyone notice MKBHD at @4:40
This literally looks like it would be a set for a nickelodeon superhero sitcom
i mean tomorrow
Imagine someone wheeling away the foam pit as mark is about to jump in.
"Some kids don’t like the process, they just like the final result 😂"
Mark Rober's Fantasy Factory fr
I thought you are awesome.. now I don't like you cause you're to cool. Doing all my dreams and dream work space
"i have an idea of what you should make next, but i'm going to tell you later"
If he uploads this hes alive
that is awesome mark rober
Yea Mark! Awesome.  Kudos from this 51 y/o kid.
This is so epic!!!!
Similar to vsauce box. I like it
Yay!!
When you are a kid in an engineers body🙊🙊
So Mark Rober built his own batcave
Mark I bet that you cant learn nodes/blueprint (computer codeing)
"10,481st"
This is what science should be like in school. And this is the kind of stuff engineering colleges should teach.
You have too much money.
i wish this is available in the Philippines
How in the world did you get a camera on a hot wheels?
It would be my dream and it’s ok if you can’t
Can this be delivered to COLORADO SPRINGS
Yooo
Hold up.........stole from Denny's
"You and Mrbeast are mine and my kids favorite 
Thank you"
Squirrel maze???
Sadly you probably don’t live in Kansas so I don’t think I can find you
The only problem with trying to find that secret base at my local orthodontist is I'm in australia 😭😭😭
I can't wait until Mark finds someone taking a bit out of the foam bit. Cause you know someone will take a bit... There's always gonna be someone.
I need street fighter II in my home just like that
All you see literally blue light escaping underneath the bookcase XD
just checked out the website Ill probably do the save 60 plan and buy it. I have been building things my whole life!
Reminds me of Gustavo Fring
wow  so when do the tours start...
I would like the crunch box but I'm more into model kits but I might  get one
I’m almost twice your age Mark but you ARE my favorite uncle :D
So its just kiwico but with a video tutorial by mark?
"If you have a problem sliding down a fireman’s pole, you’ve bigger problems!"
Mark Rober you are just cool
Ima ask my mom to buy some.   Teehee
MARKYYY
Is it possible to get this Internationally? I would love to unbox one for my audience :)
"It's says for me, that it'll ship, but it will cost more than $100, also the taxes of my country another more than 100$, so basicly I doubled the cost by living in my country. :( 
I hate this... but it's sooo coooo, I wish I were live there."
@Pokecraft I would like a mark Rober but the special dog version
@Pokecraft I would like 2 mark robers dog special addition
"Just tried to buy one but then i saw that it doesn't ship to nz  : ((((
would love to see something for us kiwis :/
don't know about other places tho"
Agreed Max
Imagine being a casual thief breaking into this place then pulling the eagle.
"Congratulations Mark! This is outstanding, I wish you the best of luck with this endeavor."
Rancho Neverland vibes
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
Let's say I was a delivery guy. Am I supposed to ignore the light under the bookshelf
Every single kid's wildest dreams at one place! This is so cool.
"I'd love to come out and make some funky projects (I have several in mind), but I also realized that that warehouse was not meant for me. It's made for the kids. To inspire young engineers. I'm a grown adult, and as much as I'd love to meet Mark and do some wacky stuff, if I really want to make these projects of mine a reality then I'll just do it. I've got the resources that those kids don't. In light of that, I ceed my chances at a platinum ticket to the younger generation. May what you create be awesome and fun!"
ive been playing plants vs zombies lately and 2 of the youtubers ive watched since then have used pvz music
Mark i love your video i want to be like you
Omg science is so cool!
Mr Beast might as well buy that place for a video.
i was thinking that to
bro mark is making me want to be an engineer so badly..
Only mark rober would just make kiwico but better
At this point just open a school
"Mark, I think and hope that one day you can start a FIRST robotics team. Especially with this warehouse"
Love it
Bro is Anne frank 💀
this is just mark flexing all of his youtube fame and wealth to all of his viewers.
nice
Checking the bookshelf is the obvious choice!!
My brother helped me with the programming part.
bro the pvz music still hits diff ngl
Mark Rober is my hero
wow that is heaven for a nerdy guy like me
"Current: Ammeter
Voltage: Voltmeter
Pressure: Barometer
Mark Rober: Watermelometer"
yessir
"If I was there for a day, I’d be at the piano the whole day"
WOW!
You keeping all my paintings in there?
every man’s dream
TO THE ROBER CAVE!
Chopsticks and phat gus are the most iconic characters ever
Aren’t the boxes kinda ripping of Kiwico which was one of his sponsors?
This feels way quicker that came out
Liked the video because of the PvZ music
"Someone could just take a dump, not flush it and still walk away with his hands dirty 🧐"
Mark I made a project on engineering
Erm...... Kiwico?
Real Civil Engineer would be proud!
DEEDEE GIT OUT OF MY LABORE`A~TORY!!!!!
Crunch Labs is one of the coolest things I have ever seen.
Watch out kiwi co
"Your childhood hero should have been Craig Williams, the contestant on the first episode of American gladiators who knocked nitro unconscious in power ball."

The secret shelf is awesome but you can see the light under the self and it gives it away
"Just wondering, how far out do the packages go? Do they only go in your home state, or your entire country, or do they go across the world?"

Love ur channel
"Rather than making the toilet seat lock the door, just make the seat step activated, so it is held up by you stepping on a pedal, so it's up or down without using hands, and never stays up when you leave."
‘Mark is the only person who’s allowed to do this’
Do you sell your crunch lab build box thing in denmark?!? I would love to have one But if you dont sell it here please say it
he what from a denny's

Imagine jumping into the foam pit then realizing it was moved to another area 💯
Literally what I wish for every day

Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
Can you deliver it all over the world
Gravity fall vibes 😭
I call dibs
YAY MARK ROBER UPLOADED
Classic mark :)
But before we see if I could actually live let's just see the place hehe
This is so amazing! I can’t even begin to explain how this video is!
This is epic you never disappoint
Would it be possible to deliver it to india?🤣
This is better the Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory!!!
There are so many hints to other videos
This is so cool.
Bro made entertainment 720 irl
"As a 27 year old...I kinda want a box.... BUT I wouldn't want a chance for the platinum ticket, I'd honestly rather children only get the chance."
I love how there are YouTube's 2 biggest tech reviewers casually signing something in this video like they're best pals with Mark.
Yo mark your prob not gonna read this but you should try to make a mechanism that allows you to jump higher and no I don't mean you'll go like 15 feet but just a Lil bit higher I've always wanted to see this be made and omg your warehouse looks great
Ultimate zombie apocalypse safe room
"KiwiCo: Hey Mark, you wanna do  another sponsor? Oh. I see how it is Mark, I see how it is."
Mark Rober’s fantasy factory on mtv season 1 coming soon
Can you make it available in India pls?
"So I have to ask, at 16:49 is that in fact Manu Prakash, the foldscope guy?"
Yes
Pog
"Hey Mark Rober, I'm 31 and I want to be like you, where do I start? XD"
I'm 45 and I want to be an engineer like you when I grow up! 🤣
I thought kiwico sponsors you.
no mark let the sweatshop kids out
so awesome
I did not now that you now about Beyblade
What is the song they play at 3:24 ?
do you have delivery to mexico ?
This is the best MTV cribs episode
"""10,000 dollars in a glass suitcase""
Shows a suitcase with 500,000 in it"
Mark is the official Mr. Rogers of science. He should have a nationally syndicated show
"I wish I was like 12 and not in my mid 20s, I'd buy the box instantly"
Oh this is just awesome
"if i had this, my life would be complete"
"*opens platinum ticket*

IT'S MADE OF PLATINUM"
6:19 PvZ graze the roof lol

Kiwico will be mad!
Fantasy factory 2.0??? Atleast what I thought when I saw the foam pit
Only mark whod do This like he is crazy
0:09 well now i know how to break in

This guy would make a great school teacher. 😄
"Mark, after Cristiano Ronaldo, you are the coolest guy ever!"
Any reward for finding the lab?  I would love to check it out.
Mark Rober makes me happy to be an Engineer. The best version of what I hoped to be.  Thank you!
POV: scooby doo
I am doing Mark's engineering course and I may have to end up buying this too. Lol
He has the lab from odd squad
this box will change humanity
Mrbeast!?!?
:0
hey mark can i suggest u a new project Make a well functioning tree house which can do every a kid may need.
You mean Dexter’s Secret Lab
"Truly awesome. Honestly, just a wholesome and inspiring cause. Thank you for what you do."
This is a certified Mark special

Mark I just want to say I love your videos and I want to be just like you one day
Mark is a top 3 YouTuber for sure
Epic
WOW
Must be nice to have money.
If I had this guys videos as a kid I would have become a scientist. He makes science interesting
It’s all fun and games until someone rolls the foam pit away while you’re not looking.
That toilet alarm for not washing your hands is the best part
im only in australia so yeah
"After you redecorate, can I have your Selectric?"
I love chopsticks
just...wow
AWESOME VIDEO!! Like always! I want to work at NASA when I’m older thanks to you Mark! What degrees do you need to build rovers like you did(at NASA)?
"this is no secret to me cuz I knew it from the domino video that where is this place why mark have this I my theory is true
so tuned in for the next episode of Mark Rober Theory , but util then see ya later."
"Imagine you combine Mark Rover, Hacksmith, and Mr Beast and there you have it, real life tony stark"
bummer
Tony Stark is based off of Elon Musk.   They've confirmed it.   So Elon Musk is already the real life Tony Stark.
he's actually willy wonka... but with like ingenuity and science instead ethically questionable employment of ethnic minorities and child endangerment
OMG this looks like the most fun office ever!
"Everyone can be Batman with some cash, but I'd rather be Mark Rober."
WHY don't you boys have a pepsi ?
"I loved the American Gladiators growing up. Nitro was the best.😃 Cool lab, too."
You know your learning journey is fruitful when you can make your childhood fantasies come true and inspire the next generation along the way.. ❤️
Nobody commenting about MKBHD cameo?
Literally hundreds of people are...
You should collab with the Hacksmith sometime
3:28 song please 🙂
Bro I swear I just saw a foam ball claymore
Omg I wanna come so bad I love you inventions
This things crazy!!!!!
"So basically, this is the most elaborate way to get kids to buy your crate.
I like it."
Bro made the gta arcade
Can't wait to watch this again in a year and find out that i actually commented
"Ok cool, but what about the actual engineering part of the lab, you didnt talk about that at all"
@Alexei Utgoff i only saw a few tools and what looked to be a 3D printer in one scene
The entire thing is the engineering part...
Made a secret passage with light pouring under the secret door.
"I'm expecting to see a new science channel show called ""Crunch Labs!"""
Mark is def the modern day engineer version of willy wonka.  And kinda the home alone kid too if you think about it. : )
Ayo what is so cooooooooooooooool also this looks dude perfect’s studio
please can u make more educational videos?
this is nuts!!
"Mark, if you're thinking of any possible upgrade to this, a mini roller coaster would be awesome. 😁🎢"
Solve Climate Change 🫤
Great job Mark. As an engineer in an executive roll we are definitely seeing a need to stoke the young minds and future  of this world. Thanks for making a difference.
"mark rober: ""secret room""

also mark rober: has a massive building behind his ""dusty office"" room thats definitely not a secret engineering warehouse or anything."
We need an unnecessary inventions and mark rober colab
"I love your content so much! Making a dream come true is so fun and cool, especially a secret lab!"
Is crunch labs just a copying of kiwi co
You think Kiwi co was the first?  V Sauce did it a decade ago lmao
That's dope!
"0:05 Let me guess, the hint is that you don't have to dramatically turn the eagle ornament in order to push your bookshelf sideways"
Massive Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory vibes
You should make a system that automatically makes you coffee or something whenever you wake up (in the warehouse) or enter the secret warehouse :)
"the coolest thing of being an scientist, or an engineer. Is just having a whole warehouse, cuz I mean like the whole idea is literally cool"
Congratulations on the warehouse build dream becoming a reality!
W A T E R M E L O M E T E R
Awesome
This defeated the purpose😅
This is too epic!
"3 million views in less than a day...

Yes. This was the dream of A LOT of us!  Congrats Mark and so glad to see the finished product!"
This place is 90% play and 10% engineering work
did you just call us pigs???????
E
Its not a secret if you show it on youtube -Sun tzu the art of war
"Wow. If I don't buy this for myself, I am buying it for my friends kid. This is so thoughtful."
Is that the same place you used for the domino video
"This would be a dream, looks awesome mark"
Mark Rober continues to make my own dreams come true.
"I dream of working for mark, this looks dope"
"I have an autistic son that will LOVE this Crunchlabs monthly build! Unfortunately we live in Bali, Indonesia.... Maybe one day"
Perfect drug lab
You are… one of the best parts of YouTube. Keep being you Mark ✌🏼
"That's probably the best ""merch"" idea for an engineer content creator. 💗💗💗"
Watch out: Rudy Giuliani may get in. His tweet today said he only drinks Diet Pepsi.  Seth Meyers' bit on it today was pretty funny too.
Had to watch twice so cool 😎
Am the only one that's thinking about kiwico?
Rob Dyrdek And Mark Rober collab? Meet the Robs
"I find it quite interesting, bc this content is definitely aimed at kids, the crunch box is for kids to build and everything in the videos is explained very simply, and yet, none of these videos are marked as ""for kids"" it does seem like the target audience is definitely younger than 13. Idk, just interesting"
RIP Kiwi Co
Mark Rober got him a Dude Perfect engineering warehouse.
HOW DID U DO THIS MARK?!
Can You please do video kiling peopl wit rock
Mark Rober - Mr Quality Over Quantity...
Wow you own shoes? Never knew
Garage you will be missed
Got your own fantasy factory
"Now that he had shown us, we can 3d print the platinum ticket 😄"
Why are you competing against kiwico?
Dude just made Dexter's laboratory irl XD
KiwiCo got real quiet after this video..
"Hey mark, you should try and do what mrbeast did for 4th of july a bit ago, or maybe an alternative to that"
Bro that’s my dentist place
I’ve always wanted a secret bookshelf door to a cool bunker or something
Maybe you should Collab with Mr.Beast and make a maze with a bunch of booby traps designed by you and the first one to reach the end gets to keep the money at the end of it. Placed there by Mr.Beast.
MKBHD appearing to demonstrate his ultimate frisbee skills earned my like
shows it to millions of peplo
So awesome! Kids will definitely be inspired!
11:16 no sorry dude i dont want π=3
HOW AWESOME IS THIS PLACE!!
6:26 I think the light coming from under the bookshelf is a bit of an issue
"If Mark Rober ran for any office, I'd vote for him."
theres light behind the bookshelf
"You are my favorite person EVER. For reference...I'm a kid's entertainer, educator, videographer. And you are far and away everything I would ever hope for to achieve and to aspire to times 100. I'm just so glad you exist to do all of the things and inspire all of the kids in the most playful manner that so many just do not comprehend is necessary. I'm going to keep doing my thing, but I feel better that there are people like you out there with such a playful spirit, inspiring kids to create, explore and have fun. You rock, brother."
Amazing human
Getting some Fantasy Factory vibes and I love it!
Mark has never failed to surprise and impress me. I've been watching him for 3 years and it has never been boring. Such a great guy
"Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls
The chocolate room
Hold your breath
Make a wish

Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination
Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination
We'll begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What we'll see will defy
Explanation"
Omg my friend and I are totally obsessed! We love you and would love to come out! Both you and my dad are engineers and you guys inspire me. I would love to be like you and invent whatever crazy ideas I have in my ADHD brain. Keep doing doing what your doing!!
"Bro just made a home safe claymore🤣
11:08"
10:15 “Always drink your Ovaltine”  A crummy commercial?
Luckily for me I don’t flush OR wash my hands! Mwahahaha
"I want a crunch labs for adults now 😫. Just like the kids, but a bit more complex."
Mark op
Don't worry Mark. I think your frisbee leap into the foam pit was pretty rad. Like a caracal leaping after a bird. Very cool imo.
proud of you but to build a warehouse before a recession is crazy...
"Your new secret lair is splendid, but I am VERY impressed with your monthly boxes. It is a terrific way to introduce young people to the delights of engineering. I wish you and your excited students much success with it.🖤🇨🇦"
"This is one of the best things I’ve seen, as a kid I have dreamed about a secret room like this, it’s insane what some people can do and mark is the best engineer I’ve seen, I hope he continues doing stuff he wants lol"
I'm 23 and i want him as my uncle xD
EZZZ
gah... this or tinker crates?
Plot twist.  He still isn't the favorite uncle.
I'm an adult and I want to do your engineering crunchlabs. Is this allowed?
Why not! Have fun! We are all still children deep inside!
meth lab
dude. you're basically real life Bruce Wayne without the tragic backstory.
Mark rober saying it a secret then showing the way to get in
This is one of the best mark Rober video can easily compete with the squirrel videos
And thank you. I truly admire you.
so much plywood died for this video
Kiwi Co 2.0 ... I love to watch him collab with Stuffedmadehere
This mf got the fantasy factory 2.0
"This is absolutely insane!! But there’s one flaw in the office, even though he’s gonna be changing the look, he needs to make sure he covers up the light underneath the book shelf door or whatever he changes it to because it does give it away a little bit."
Love this love you keep going
"3:25

What song is this?"
"Ordered a box for my daughter, shipping was amazingly cheap down to Australia!!"
"You made Dexter's Laboratory!!! 🤯

And.....when were you at Ford Field??? 😱"
My Favorite Uncle
🙉 AMAZING!!!...
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
Colab with stuffismadehere please
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS MARK KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK 👍
Mark made himself a fantasy factory lol
“But before we see if I actually live-“
I remember I bought an erector set and built some things but the coolest one I have is a auto paper plane launcher with a three round mag.
Are you telling me that you are keeping Danny Lee Clark AKA Nitro inside that secret room? Quite disturbing
where is this warehouse
am i the only one that feels escape room vibes
This is dope af! I love it! That tennis ball laugher tho! Daaaaaang! My wife's dog would loose his mind
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
Bruh
What is rong with you
7:44
Forget my kids. I'm buying the box for me... And I guess I'll share.

So cool
"Great, now a few million people know"
imagine how long it takes to put new batteries in the boosters of the hotwheels track
What? No HotWheels Loop?

2.9 million views? not much of a secret anymore :/
mark is like a the colest teacher off all time
"Wow, I'm amazed at the ability to go from a millionaire to a billionaire!  Love it!  Learn from him kids...."
The light under the bookcase is a dead giveaway.
Not anymore huh

we love u mark

Those are some huge...  Tracks of land for a 7th grader.
"The ""a"" should be spelled ""an""."
wish me a happy birthday
let's take a moment to appreciate this great content creator
"Yes, I agree fellow human. I really like the videos this specific content creator makes, it makes me experience happiness chemicals in my non-robot brain"
Mark Rober literally made his own kiwi co. Amazing
Gravity falls vibes rnnn
I love you
"That has got to be the best warehouse ever built in earth history.
As a side note, I really want roof to floor whiteboards."
yeah Mark ...I'm sure ANYONE will be able to...sounds like a fishing guy that I know of that said kinda the same ..maybe you all can do a collab...
Can you make a train horn with the liberty to cereal without grabbing it and grabbing the milk and can you like make 1
And now a word from our sponsor… KiwiCo !!
"Mark rober copies Mrbeast but its 
engineering"
I love this channel.
The Fireman's what? 😳
This seems like every YouTuber ever does this…where’s all the “engineering”? No CNC machines or routers? Only a few 3D printers? No computers for CAD or CFD? A few basic hand tools on a peg board? No draftsman tables or surface plates? …Or am I missing something?
Already ordered. My daughter is excited about the boxes and just in time for summer break. I would love to see a counter on the webpage to see how many orders you get on these build boxes.
i do not know how to leave something better then a like..
Reply to me! I love you!!!
Let's go!!
There’s something you didn’t thin of….(I mean if perfection is your REAL goal)..that is a randomized selector that selects any one of 25 entry switches.  Only YOU have the APP on your phone that lets you know WHICH entry switch was randomly selected.  Of course if you were to invite a …let’s say…’custom cabinet maker’…for instance…to see your warehouse ‘he’ (or she..if it’s not a he) can suggest incredible options…(of course if it were ME…I haven’t worked on anything newer than the 16th C for a couple decades so it might be unusual….
waiting for the crunch labs cereal
I wouldn't be surprised if all the firehouses started using the piston. What a f'n genius. 🦾💪
"i know it shouldnt. but as a handyman by trade, that ball crashing through the wall hurt my soul."
This crunch lab box is stunning. I’m 34 and I would get it for me. I only know sound engineering. None of this mechanical stuff. This is simply amazing.
"O-My-Gosh

I don’t even know how to react to his AMAZING WAREHOUSE"
This is why Mark is the best. Nuf said.
I need this toilet lol.
"Mark Rober: I made a secret passageway to a warehouse!
Mr.beast: WRITE THAT DOWN! WRITE THAT DOWN!"
Except you can see the light coming from under the book shelf so anyone can see there's something behind it.
For April Fool's day next year you need to make the starting room Crunch Labs decorated
"6:29 ""And clearly you just told 22 million people how to get in to your office""."
wow
"is crunch labs just like kiwico? does that mean you're technically a competitor now? how is that going to work considering you've worked closely with them before, its a cool idea its just nothing new"
Awesome idea
6:49 but mark what if I actually want a Diet Pepsi
"Mark,  you misssed the word ""place"" in the title of your video."
Congrats
"Those kits are cool, but are they that advanced? You should have some different skill levels tomget"
Mark is like that really cool uncle
Um… is the Build Box exclusively for children? 🤔
Kiwi co I bet is not happy about this lmao 😂
Mark I love your videos. How do I get a Phat Gus Plush?
Wow Mark Rober this is amazing love the new lab
Turn it into an escape room as well so I can solve it
Bidding into foam is cheating >:(
didn't this guy get sponsored by kiwico a few months ago
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. 🥴
Why are you encourage kids to touch literally everything in every waiting area? 😂
this is so cool mark congrats and best of luck!
"The camera shots in this video are crazy underrated.  As much engineering work goes into the content of the videos, there's got to be just as much, if not more engineering prowess we don't get to see behind these shots."
My son Finn said that Mark Rober should put dart hole’s in all of the boxes and the people who order it will think they got the ticket. I died in laughter.
Willy Wonka of engineering
"Next we will hear, Mark will be starting his _own_ space missions."
This is amazing
A modern day golden ticket.
"Mark could create a treehouse museum but for engineering 
It would be a great playground for kids! Awesome!"
Do you think u could ever send them to Canada
Yeah that's just insanely cool
The bookshelf can see the light under
I feel like Mark is the type of person that can make things in the movies that seems impossible possible.
I can't wait for the Nuclear Power kit :3  The Thorium one that won't make you loose your hair.
yoooo
"Nobody will every get that 10,000"
woah
"""Hint"""
That’s some next level Willie Wonka fun there….what a cool deal.   🇺🇸🇺🇸
Mr.Rober I love this I hope that I can get it
I wonder how much money his eletric bill is
a rob dyrdek fantasy factory for geeks i love it discovery+ needs to make a show with you!
You should make glow in the dark hot wheel cars!!!
This is mark’s batcave
Amazing!
my grandpa built something very similar but stored it with very high priced valuables
For some reason it always makes me sad seeing the stuff where someone can spend a day with their favourite like Youtubers because I know that’s never gonna be me because I can never afford one of those boxes and I know my parents wouldn’t either Mark if you see this I’m just glad that you noticed it
The ultimate geek’s dream
1:01 thats more than 10K
Someone help because it’s driving me crazy.  What song does he have playing at the 6:40 mark? Please lol
Kiwi Co not gonna be happy
He really built a fantasy factory
He just made an off brand of Kiwi Co.
Not very secret anymore 😕
Actually at 6:26 you have  mistake so average person walking in would definitely know about your secret lab- light at the floor from the lab is very obvious
Watch Trent Sports Trick-shots
He just gave up the secret for us
Reminds me of Gary’s lab in club penguin
Can I get that bike
Mark did you and kiwi co partner
Coolest video mark has uploaded to date
When an engineer tries designing. LOL ouch
shee
14:45 the watermelometer makes my day every time he says it
Sadly I'm in Asia and I can't travel to America or the UK or australia
You should have the hot wheels track connected and have multiple cars going through the track at all times simultaneously.
Oh hello marques!

Respect for the Cameraman for shrinking and recording his POV while riding the hot wheel.
Wow you are like the science mr beast
why is this video not sponsored by Crunch
"""Failure is the best teacher."" - i forgor who made this"
this is just a refresh of every vid... and I like it .
ive been in that dentist office o.o
"""No Mark Rober's were hurt while making this video"" WAIT THERES MORE THAN ONE?"
remember contests like these have no purchase nessasary i checked it out on the website still found a way to make that fun
New best video no doubt

Has anyone won the $10000 yet?
I want one! How much to build a Crunch Labs 2.0 for me?
Pvz music!!!!
Ngl I thought the nerf guns would be modded. Kinda disappointed there. Also nerf hypers hurt like a bee sting.
So its just kiwico but w/ a video
hi Mark I really want to get one of these crunchlabs toys but it does not deliver to dubai please fix this.
"{Rei} Rei goes ooohs~ >n.n< Rei wants the boxes, but we has a much olders body than Rei actuallies is. *Mewmews.* >o.o<"

The secret lab is really cool!
11:10 ow
"Mark Rober: spends forever making a secret warehouse.
*proceeds to show that secret warehouse to the entire internet*"
wish I could get one but I cant because I am leaving to italy
Mark Robert swore at 17:03
that cannon would literally be illegal where I live
"If Batman shows up one day, it’s Mark, I’m telling you"
Hahahaha
You had me on thus video with American Gladiators and Nitro. Time to re-engineer  those games and bring it back!
sooooo coooollll!! :D you're fantastic
Holy crap! Another Mark Rober video!!!
... it's bigger on the inside.
I would love to sign up for CrunchLabs but we just don't have enough money to pay each month.
"View 2,846,296 like 228,000"
"Unfortunately, there is light shining beneath the bookcase. . ."
"I really love what you do, and what crunch’s mission is"
Ahhhh l want one but I’m 58 ..lol
American Gladiator was an awesome show! Hi NitrO!
This video will be the most watched video on this channel. Impressive Mark
is the 2 month giveaway only today?
That was probably the most effective commercial of all time.
Reminds me of gravity falls
This is like the lab frame breaking bad I like it 👍
"""the average person will never find"" Me- hahah, not a secret anymore MARK"
Best infomercial ever!
Cool
So you're all about making money. Nice.
This is awesome Dude! your own warehouse too. sweet bro
"And Mark dose it again… making me wish I was a kid again. Since that will never happen, why not make some stuff for the older generation too?"
I think I want to get that crunch thing for my girlfriend because the school system did her dirty and she is way smarter than she knows
We just need more Mark Robers.
my guy made a minecraft secret base IRL
"Even though I'm 19, I think I want to do the Crunch Labs boxes. I've always wanted to be better at building and creating, and I feel that can finally happen with these. Thank you for making these!"
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ඞ
That’s awesome but it’s not a secret lab now is it
What would kiwi co think
That’s awesome but it’s not a secret lab now is it
Finally. a workspace that’s like 10 times cooler than Google’s offices.
One time I I had threw my frisbee and somehow it went up over some tree branches and down so smoothly in real time no CGI I don’t know how I did it try to re-create it didn’t happen😅
"8:28 Sure you have: Kiwi Co. Don't get me wrong, this is cool and all, but it's disingenuous to pretend Kiwi hasn't been doing this for several years already."
Imagine how cool it must feel to have your own secret HQ. Probably real safe too.
"I like how the eagle statue opens the door to every engineers fantasy. Now imagine if it was a griffin instead of an eagle, a fantasy creature opening the door to a dream like fantasy."

"This is probably the coolest thing I have ever seen.

Thank you Mark"

"You should make a 24/7 livestream of the ant farm, it seems super interesting!"
All I could say through the whole video was BRILLIANT! This was such a natural next step for you! You're a natural teacher! We're super excited to get our Mark Rober boxes!
Thats actually so cool
i love breaking bad
That hot wheels track is amazing
For a final project in my biotech class me and my group made a crossbow that fires when your attention is measured as high. I now see that is nothing.

"He actually became kiwico, his past sponsor"
What’s the building out side is it underground
"I used to use an airhorn on my bike in downtown Chicago. It's a great way to get the attention of BOTH pedestrians and drivers. Pedestrians, because they have a tendency to cross the bike lane without looking. Drivers, because they have a tendency to merge into you or turn in front of you. Aired it up using my bike pump. Best purchase I ever made while I was riding my bike to commute. 

Great video and shop....every geek's dream to have a shop like that. I know I've been eyeing our basement."

I really wanna point out how the prices are not high at all. Sure its an „luxury toy“ but i expected more then „just“ the 25 bucks. I am sure he could get a bigger revenue if he wanted to. Props for not selling it overpriced by using your brand.

Bruuuu mark can you pls make one for teens cuz I would love to do it
This. This is the goal. To be so smart that you never have to grow up. I was smiling ear to ear this whole video.
Congrats! It’s stellar. You should be proud of the epic way you are sharing your gifts and inspiring young minds.

"Mark, I’m a closet inventor with over 100 inventions that the world hasn’t seen, but I’m not quite sure how to bring these ideas to light since I do t have the time or money to pursue them. I have 4 little boys and a wife. And also having the title of “favorite uncle”, or as my nieces and nephews call me “Funcle”, I have expectations to uphold. *41 btw* 

Anywho, any way you could help me out with my predicament, I’d surely be appreciative."

Comment for the algorithm
5:30 I can guarantee you that is not grunt proof
"Mark this is a brilliant idea but for us older kids who like/love engineering, can we have a more challenging..challenge?"
Isn't it the same thing kiwico does
Bruh I wish I could have had these things when I was younger.
that's every childs dream in my opinion
Mark took mystery science and enchanted it
The build box is such a cool and unique idea. I'm sure many parents and kids will love it!

Phat Gus Plushies!!! Whaaaat!
This is seriously something out of a movie. I would give a lot to have just a cool secret entrance like that.
Plot twist. Robbers rob your office and find the secret lab accidentally
This mkhd. Now toss that frisbee. Peace ✌️
When else when they heard Willy Wonka they thought of the mark rober mr beast collab
This is the closest time I’ve been to a mark rover video
I'm not in America but I would've loved to do those monthly challenges :l
Do you hate firefighters? I can't imagine searching this building for survivors during a fire when filled with smoke.
"MrBeast: Builds Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory

Mark Rober: Builds Mister Magorium's Wonder Emporium"
Dude I want that lab so bad
"It's nice, and I really need to know where you got that wood paneling... but the bookcase gives itself away. When a bookcase does not touch the wall, it's instantly suspicious and I can see the light coming from your secret lair shining on the floor underneath the bookcase while it is closed."
These engineering toys ought to be in every school.  Well done on turning another fantastic idea (maybe your best) into reality.
Was not expecting to see Marques in this video but it made me smile so nice work
omg i love the little kits
Pov:you build a secret base in single player
So you stole Kiwico's business.
@DanTDM should buy this for his son in a couple year

Or people who just run water over their hands.
Mark is becoming Mrbeast guys
"I think this is really cool, but all this is advertising you're just yanking money from little kids who think it would be cool to go to a big science place and meet Mark Rober."
You are so amazing Mark! The warehouse is awesome!

just imagine his kid coming here!! so lucky 😂

I love you Squirrel videos
You should do a colab with Stuff Made Here to set up a basketball court in your open space where it is impossible to miss the hoop!
We need Squirrel Maze 3.0! 🤍🤍🤍
Hey mark I’m 10 in 5th grade and me and my class made a basketball hoop out of cardboard
Mark you are so created! I’m definitely going to get the box! Thank you!
"Trust me, you have been the favorite uncle for awhile now"
You've got light escaping under the bookcase. Kinda gives away the secret entrance.
Mark is making the world a better place.
-It's a secret to everybody-
I don't know what the visibility of the foam is when on the balcony but maybe you should have a sign saying whether it's active or not just in case somebody jumps when they shouldn't.
I'm guessing his security system is also insane too. Like his squirrel course with traps and  holograms and lasers lol
Mr beast 2.0

I recognized that cannon immediately. I loved  watching American Gladiators when I was a kid.
"about 15 yrs too late.... fantasy factory was already made, bro"
Omg hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
This is so freaking beautiful! I'm so freaking proud of this moment!
I’m going into 7th grade next year and my dream job is to become a electrical engineer. Crunch labs sounds like the perfect thing to get me started. Thanks Mark!
@Naxoriss Thanks for the shout out dylan 🤓
"The ""a"" should be spelled ""an""."
I feel like you've gone from fun honest builds to commercialization very quickly... loosing interest.
Will you be doing years worth of projects that if we choose annually we're not going to have to worry about repeats anytime soon?
I'm willing to bet Willy Wonka and Batman would be jealous.
"Between you and Stuff Made Here, engineering has never looked so cool. Thank you for igniting passion in people to know more about all the things you do! 😂"
So I guess Kiwico will no longer be a sponsor?
"Make the bookshelf better sealed to the floor, you can see the light through it"
That Claymore tho... 😍
"Mark: let me introduce crunchlabs.
Me: immediately subscribes."
I think Mark got the idea from being with Dude Perfect

I love your videos they are so cool and I want to be an engineer when I grow up like you.
Crunch labs sounds like one of those hydraulic press channels
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmm New video :)

I swear Mark is jus the nicest person in the whole world :)

@MerkinMuffly probably yes probably not
Was he suppose to do a 10 part teaser trailer leading up to it?

"""I built a secret thing""  Proceeds immediately tell everyone about it."
im a 34 yo engineer and i wanna play with them toys from crunchlabs lol
i am going to get cruch labs create kit
I want to see this but I live in Australia
So now Mark Rober is gonna promote his kits more than kiwi co. Pretty much what they are.
Mark Rober is the least villainous mad scientist to ever exist.
Epic
You guys think it's possible to form a symbiotic relationship with ants and have ant farms that they automatically drop off their dead for us to eat and we feed them in return...
keep it up bro u always inspire me to learn and engineer and pursue my dreams of being a computer hardware ENGINEER
Dude! This is truly amazing. Thank you for doing what you do!
"Mark Rober is one of the coolest guys ever. 😎
Watching him has been inspirational for me and my son moved on projects together because of Mark. I just got done watching this with my son. We're both freaking out just how much cooler he just got. This is huge. We want to visit now. Lol"
"I've just got to say, you've been super inspiring for me to pursue engineering. I've been watching your videos for years now and they just keep getting better and better. Unfortunately, I never exactly have enough time to do your engineering class, but just watching your videos have really made me want to give it my all, which thankfully I can do with my school's robotics team. Hopefully I can be a great engineer like you one day. Thanks so much for everything you do for all future engineers out there."
Robber?
Mark Robber's a great person
"I love ❤️ your videos 
Can I get crunch labs"
you can see the sculpture from backyard scientists video with the melted aluminum!!!
Mark you should get a subscriber and let them come to Crunchlabs and explore it
please send me a email
wow that billed box is really cool except for the fact that its a direct rip off of tinker krates that I know you've heard of because they used to sponsor youre videos
"Amazing Mark! Thank you for sharing, you rule!! Woohoo!!💥"
Okay your the coolest uncle now
2.2 million views by the time I saw this. Chance of winning Platinum ticket? Probably 1 in 2.2 million and dropping.
you should build a roller coaster there
Where did you find dexters labortory ????
You are the King sir! My brain would have exploded out my ears with excitement over something like that when I was a kid.
Dang mark throwing hands with KiwiCo
"Dear Mark Rober, Please build a nuclear reactor. Dear GarryTheWorm."
the cannon does more damage than what hacksmith builds
I think he should make some sort of show series outta this with kids. Kinda like the baking shows but this is has teams or something that build things and get to be judged or make it a competition outta of it and hold it there
We are so excited about this!
Your son probably loves it in there
He said willy wonka…mr beast colab leaked??
"It makes me so happy to see people —as talented, as kind, as awesome as wholesome as him— succeed."
Mark Rober is this generation's Bill Nye.
That guy seems smart he' should be an engineer'

how many secrets does this guy have? First the online classes and now this. Mark is insane.
i heard pvz music thank you
his neighbors: why does he need a really big box on the side of his housr
Maaaaaaaaaaaark! You can see the underglow of the lab's white light under the bookshelf
"I think you need something bigger next time
it's so cool"
Mark you do realize that you just gave every waiting room person a nightmare. Every kids going to be playing with the decor in the hopes that they can find your Lab.
I love how no one would suspect the light coming from the book shelf. 6:27
This is the most awesome place ever especially for kids so much fun! And i want to have that someday!
kiwico rn: 😑
"how does mark rober only have 22 mil, in my opinion he should have more than mr beast, mark, you are a legend and the best youtuber on the planet"
The solenoid that keeps the door shut seems like a potential code violation...
"Such a childish video, as an actual engineer, I prefer his videos with actual engineering."
"Ohh so you called the warehouse crunch labs to write it all off on tax as an office/storage space for the crunch labs kit facilities, I see 😎 I'd do the same don't worry heh"
your lab must look like the fairy godmothers(shrek) factory from the outside
I love what you do for the children of America! You teach them well on how to understand well and become smart! You should go international in all countrys who speak English. Thank you for all your work!
Woah
would you ever consider making a crunch labs box for teens?
"This is so cool, I wish I could visit"
"Did anyone else notice around 6:26 how there's light shining under the cupboard, giving away the ""secret"" entrance?"
*ME BEING SHOCKED*  :00000 OH MAHHH GOSHHHH

What if you hacked an Amazon Alexa to make chopsticks say and play music instead of the Amazon Alexa but still have custom messages available.

Nice.
I must say your tidy tool wall should be an inspiration to Will Prowse. But he is much better at batteries!

This has the same vibe when Dude Perfect first moved to their new HQ. More opportunities and expansion and has everything you would ever want. Doubles as a workspace and a fun zone.
ITS THE BACKROOMS LEAKED
"what if during the emergency jump to the first floor, you instantly remember that the form pit was not put back the same place yesterday."
I wish I was in the one day that will be so awesome everybody seeing me and I want to be like you something to impress someone why can’t you arrest Mr. B’s with that toothpaste rocket that was cool I love your videosBut that’s OK

"You are BY FAR my favorite creator of all time. You’ve grown so much as a YouTuber! You started by putting 2 iPads in a jacket, and now you’ve grown to planting 20,000,000 trees,  saving the ocean, getting the highest average view count on the platform, and building you’re own dream of a warehouse. Keep up the great content, and know that you are a great content creator and a great person overall."

I think he made those secret passageways just for fun. 

Moreover, his nephews probably have other uncles as well."
I have a very serious question though. yes he's my favorite creator but who is he competing with when he needs secret passageways after everything? Who is hel threatening his status as best uncle on the continent?
@Sparkleydog1234 AJ {rip technoblade}  mark helped at least on the ocean one

Okay this is crazy
Straight up copied kiwi co
Nitro is the best
you should do a video on the most optimal paper airplane and the physics that goes into it
You should tell the Fed about pneumatics so they can get a soft landing
what about the giant spot of light under the bookshelf lol
A cool idea would be to mix your movable bowling ball and a drone to trick your friends
It's all fun and games learning to be an engineer until you get to thermodynamics.
"Amazing workshop just one question, if you get the platinum ticket in Australia what do you do?"
That place is awesome!  You make science/engineering so much fun.
this gives me breaking bad kinda vibes lol
"Mark is on such a whole other level as an YouTuber, each one of those builds could have been its own video, but he Crunched it all together with a massive revelation."
"Its fun how he says nobody would suspect that there is a secret room in the office, when you literally see light coming out underneath bookshelf."
guys the QR code in the video is a rick roll.
I feel like the office entrance needs to be activated by a statue of Shakespeare like the 1960s Batcave!
1 and a half minutes in I love the lay out hope to be able to have something like this of my own one day
WOW

"Mark, did you notice that you can see light coming from the floor behind the bookcase?"
That's where he keeps Nile Green
"To me, these are more like american dreams than engineering dreams..."
1:30
You can see a light coming out from under the bookshelf. 9.8/10 easy fix for next time.
"I feel like crunch labs is produced by kiwi co. The boxes & packagings, materials, and booklets are very similar."
"hello, I am lovin the videos and seeing how each video makes me smarter, I really want to support you and get those monthly boxes, but I can't afford it, so im doin my best on saving to try and get at least one box, see ya."
Everybody ganster until you put the seat doing and it still locks you in 😳
I wish someone like Mark Rober was around when I was kid. He makes engineering & science fun
@canadiancontrol you best me to it! He's the next generations Bill Nye.
BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL!
Awesome I want it. My pipe dream was always to build a secret underground base under my house with a secret entrance in the cupboard

Dang Mark….just Dang when u put ur heart and mind to a cause u really go whole hog
This would be The Batcave is Batman actually had a sense of fun.
It’s a great secret door in fact it’s so secret that the light under the bookshelf doesn’t lead you to the warehouse it leads you to your impending doom in the backrooms
So basically trying to be mr.beast. lol

Really happy for you mark

i bet your son is totally enjoying this!
Kiwico be like: you betrayed us mark
Yes! A chance to meet my wannabe
all of these are like massive hazards lol
remind me of a new age Rob's fantasy factory
I don’t know why but this looks like Gus’s meth lab in breaking bad
You have done what every child wishes to do in there bedroom
17 minute lab
Does anyone else notice he sounds a bit different
So I made a nuclear base inside my closet
I really want to see collaboration between stuff made here and this guy 🙏😍🤯
This is so epic! I love everything about this. Especially how Mark uses his skills to help children who aspire to be just like him one day. Keep it up Mark you are so inspirational!

I got an idea so u can have a bed that can massage u but how to turn it on is by pushing in a certain place on your pillow idk if is already invented if it is not I think it will be a fun thing to build
That’s what she said
Only Mark is so successful that he only sponsors his own businesses.
This might honestly be the coolest thing I've ever seen. This is every child's dream I feel. The hot wheels track is a very nice touch
My doter made a go cart and a robot one her one she wants to be and engineer.
This is the sickest thing I’ve ever seen.
I love the plants vs zombies music
MARK ROBER JUST LOWKEY SHOUTED OUT *ULTIMATE FRISBEE*! BIG WIN!

Hello
*Mark Rober is by far the coolest Uncle ever*
Mark you are a fantastic role model for kids of any age (I'm 49). And as Snoop would say......you are the Snizzle!
Surely Mark didn’t miss the light protruding under his secret door. I’ll be checking for light under every bookcase from now on ;). Keep it up Mark definitely the most unique YouTuber to date.
I'm so sad it doesn't deliver to Brazil 😓

Hi Mark I'm definitely going to ask my parents to get the crunch labs engineer kit thing they look really cool keep it up

When I saw the kiwi crates, me and my little sisters had so much fun making them and when I saw your classes, I had to do that as well so seeing that you have now made a mark rober engineering crate makes me so happy and excited!!

"You're such an incredible human Mark, thank you for being you."
Mans building secret bases as if he's in Minecraft
"As soon as I get a Mark Rober video notification, I instantly stop whatever im doing to watch. Love em!"

ID LOVE TO VISIT HERE! 💚
Noooooooo u don't ship to Norway?🥺 great video tho. My brother would of loved this! He loves you're videos. Have a great day Mark
Boohoo the toilet seats up
My mom will probably not let me get crunch lab
"And Mark dose it again… making me wish I was a kid again. Since that will never happen, why not make some stuff for the older generation too?"
@Anon Ymous lmaooo
So like a bingo robot or maybe a prune juice dispenser? A defense system that goes off when kids step on your lawn might be cool.
I love his new crunch lab boxes... But hope is it different from kiwiko?
Hoping to get a ticket
Ouch goes kiwi co

Stuff made here is gonna make a moving target that makes you get the shot every time

They don't ship the crunch lab to india😔
This might have been the best mark Rober vid he made
Can't wait to check out a crunchlab box
This dude breaks the internet every time
How amazing would it be to see mark robert and hacksmith industries collaborating
Who doesn’t won’t to live here
Imagine Mark as your uncle... It will be like Phineas and Ferb but wayyyy better.
The kind of place an adult can feel like a kid again! Congrats Mark!
I'm new to Mark's channel...so is Rober homies with MKBHD and tossing a Frisbee with him???

Mark Rober just made my childhood dreams a video
I love you. I would order a box but I would rather leave supplies for kids rather than just an eager adult 😉

"You make it seem like that’s as many boxes as you have in your first run but you obviously couldn’t do this with so few. If that’s all there was then even if somebody watched this video the second it was published, they’d be sold out by the time they got through the video… but it all looks cool. Seems like you’re onto a winner no matter how many boxes you actually have."

"When Mark said ""its important to fail a bunch"" I teared up because it's so important for kids to learn that it's ok to mess up. Super inspiring!"
"Yeah really success isn't anywhere near as useful as failure, I wish someone had explained that to me when I was young.  I keep trying to remind myself but lifelong conditioning of being afraid to get it wrong is hard to shake."
This is literally the most important aspect of anyone who's creative.
I wish all the YouTubers who ever made a bottle flip video would post a video of their failures so the kids see them.  Because I can't convince my students that bottle flipping in the school cafeteria with their drinks could be a huge problem for others if they fail.

I am 10 and I want you to make me a robot shark pls😎😐
I'm disturbed by the implication that Mark actually has competition for coolest uncle. Who is this secretive yet equally awesome uncle?
"I'm not crying, you're crying..."
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOWS
Cough cough kiwico
What secret are u talking about
Nitro was always my favorite! We'll done 😊
I really think Mark might be the coolest person alive.
Mark just gave the biggest middle finger to Kiwi Co.
Mark Robber and the Crunch Lab Factory... We all know where this going...
This is awesome!
"just curious, is the crunch labs youtube channel yours?"
Mark Rober is just playing Minecraft in real life
"You should have a competition of
Who makes the best product and let them come to and use their product in your next months engineering

Is it just me or is your nerf armory not that mark rober'y enough.
"You should turn the entry into an escape room type entrance. Where someone has to find all of the clues in order to gain access to the lab. Since you are going to be changing up the entrance every so often anyways. Also, my 3 kids are super excited to work on the CRUNCHLABS monthly boxes. Honestly, I'm excited too!"
if I make it to cruch labs I NEED a phat gus
I bet the smell of pine is super strong in there.
I like how you could see the light from the warehouse fron below the bookshelf
These boxes need to be in elementary and middle schools
I really wanna know who his competition for the coolest uncle is
I wish I could go there it looks fun😢
Why does this look so similar to Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory?
And being able to think like an engineer would help if you got the Platinum Ticket so you would think on what could open and how
so... gravity falls?

"Mark, I want to say what you are doing for the next generation of engineers, or even kids that just wanna make a cool toy, is extremely heartwarming. You make this random person on the internet proud of what you're doing, and I'm glad that people like you exist in this world.

I absolutely love science, and I'm looking to potentially go for engineering myself. It has always intrigued me but never clicked until more recently in life. I wish I had someone like you years and years ago to really get me to take that push forward a lot earlier, so I could really grasp my love for tinkering and science.

Keep on going Mark, you're an inspiration to so many people."

"Build boxes are cool and all but I think there are a few issues with them that prevent them from being proper tools to instill an engineering mindset. One, you have exactly what you need, nothing more nothing less, and it’s exactly what you need, a real engineer doesn’t even know what they’ll need until they figure it out for themselves, but since you’re given everything it doesn’t let you experience that. The other thing is that it tells you exactly what to do and how to build it, once again a real engineer has to figure that out on their own. Ive been interested in engineering but I just don’t think I have the mind for it, and its hard to get that mindset when the things im missing aren’t really being taught. I know it would be hard to implement these kinds of things in a build box, but you’re an engineer, I believe you can find a way, you always find a way"

"Hey Mark Rober! I know you probably get this often but I am a huge fan of yours and I have been for a while.  I really hope you get to see this. You have inspired me so so much, since I was 7 I have wanted to be an engineer and you made me think that it’s possible. I would love to be an aerospace or biological engineer and I would love to work for nasa it has always been my dream. I even go into a really difficult high school in my area to get into for manufacturing and engineering. You have inspired me so much and your videos definitely get my brain going. Thank you for letting me see it’s possible! I really hope you see this and maybe even respond! I love engineering so much and people never take me serious when I say that because of being a girl but you have made me realize I can do it if I work for it"

"Hey mark, i have a quick question: i run a small twitch channel in German language dedicated to engineering. Software, electronics, 3d printing, lasers. My goal is to get people into the field of technology, tinkering and engineering. I was wondering if it would be okay if I built those boxes on stream and make them twitch chat controlled. Some of my viewers already have kids so this might even be beneficial.

Would that be okay? If not that's totally understandable. I'm also not going to link the channel here. I that's a rude thing to even ask: here's my favorite excuse. Language barrier. 😁"

This is so cool I wish to be an engineer when I grow up I love mark rober😃he so cool

Dont get me wrong this is cool but it is deffinatly not secret you can see the light under the book shelf I would deffinatly think about this when you chage it
I have a hard time believing that you wouldn’t suspect a secret entrance when you walk into a giant warehouse only to find yourself in a small room with no doors inwards… but I have an easy time admitting that it’s super cool.
Imagine the warehouse being underground or in a mountain. Then it would be more mind fucky.

Mark basically made the Fantasy Factory.
"Maybe Mark can answer! Men need a logical reason to remember a rule. to leave the seat down. It's not that they don't want to, most do! Been asking for centuries but no answer has ever been given. For you, it's a factory of mostly men I assume so why have that? I don't understand! It benefits no one and only hurts everyone by leaving it down! Ahhhh 😭😂"

"I was thinking about people working in skyscrapers and if there's a fire and they cannot escape.  If everyone's desk contained a magnetic panel and in each corner you could pop out a window and there was a copper or aluminum tube that goes to the ground, you could somehow put the panel in the tube and step on and it would fall but since you are on a magnet in a copper tube or aluminum tube, it will fall slowly enough that you will get to the ground safely due to Lenz Law.  Ok it needs a lot of engineering but if you watch these videos of Lenz Law there is a way to do this."

"Mark, please support Ukraine in our fight for freedom!"
now to open a kfc and start cooking m3TH
Your awesome and it’s my birthday 🥳
I can just see Mark Rober going down the pistons with a coffee in the morning and being like “okay team what are the ideas to launch ourselves to the moon using only a nerf gun”
I literally stoped half way through this video and bought it I’m so exited for the crunch labs crate.
i love those boxes! to bad that you don't delivery to my country :c
This is crazy great job mark love your vids
i want to win so bad i love your videos
"half-life 2 inspired ""super secret"" entrance"
being a engineer has to be cool
Oh so cool.
This but with cars and real guns
im just waiting for someone to jump into the container only to midair notice someone moved it
I hate it when people close the toilet in a public place
"these crates look cool, but whats the difference between these and kiwico crates?"
"This may well be the greatest thing I have seen for the benifit of kids and the future I have ever seen.  This is something that kids will really learn from and be inspired by rather than the useless crap they are increasingly subjected to at school. 
Takes a special kind of person to put this together and watching your vids I always respected you were but this is truly next level stuff. 

Well done mate. I hope this is even more successful that what you dream and I am sure it will be. Hopefully things like this catch on around the world.  It is a fantastic contribution to the future of kids and a productive, educated society."
Kiwi Co. be sweating
all kids dream
Awesome !!
YOU SIR. are a blessing to this world :)
Nothing has made me want to be a kid to experience something as much as your box has
"Yeah, as far as those fireman poles go, I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to squeeze your hands on it on the way down, I typically use mostly my legs and use my hands more for control"
Are we gonna get a video about Artemis I(since it’s launching soon)...?
"2:32 or the fireman’s pull





get it"
That hole was smoking... 😨 0:42
Just Ignore the glowing light from under the bookcase lol
The only thing missing is Rob Dyrdek lol
Kiwico: *wants to know your location*
"neumatics is, within a range always perfect and auto sensing/adjusting, nay auto metering!  that is a force in itself dont you think, my sciencey guy"
Bro… MKBHD fans in the house!
Mans got redstone irl💀
Ohh nooo there is no shipping to the Saudi
I wanna see micheal reeves and mark rober collab
I'm 21 and I would love to have you as my uncle! This is a childhood fantasy!
Why it is not in Pakistan😞
This is age 3-99 ultimate school playground 💥
2:57 Amazon in a nutshell:
Not a secret if you tell everyone
for your use of neumatics i want you to take over from the other video guy as my science guy for now
You know what would be a cool security system? A toggleable floor using your fluidized sand technology.
This is amazing ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Kiwiko is out of business now 😆!
Bruh I saw the nerf wall then I loved the room
P
"Mark Robert be like: just push this button to open the secret door

the robbery: Ohh thank you for the tip"
The bottom of the book shelves has light bleeding out under it.
this is so awesome I cant
I thought the toilet-seat-up-sensor/door-locking-solenoid was going to be part of a mechanism that detects when the seat is up and after a duration of time that automatically puts the seat down.
Dude! I named my cat Nitro after him! LOL
Incredible
This is the absolute dream!
The average person watching: 📸
Bahahaha....Dexter's Lab 2.0!!!
If you want a complex idea you could attempt to design a walker using a lambda linkage
You spent so much money on this but low quality finish on those door ways 5:55
Making sure it’s not NileGreen.
A hitmam just goes here lmao
"Hopefully you have a fail safe in place on the ticket that way someone doesn’t try to duplicate it and claim they won, with a false ticket."
On the gravity falls anniversary too 😭 💕
I wish you do for Arabic translation
asking my mom if i can get one
are you trying to make me jealous or fulfill my commands?
commands/wishes
3.0 squirrel trap please
i had to grab a soda and ice cream for this one
mark im sorry but ive seen to many movies
"Gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie gimmie






of course not to be rude"
This feels like one of the labs you would see on the science channel.
RYAN RENALDS IS THAT YOU 2:39
You are now the new Bill Nye!
So THAT's where the domino video was filmed!
Someone has been to Omega Mart at Area 15!
"Me: Alright guys, we're gonna make a secret base...
**Mark Rober intensifies**
Me: ...in Minecraft..."
Discs in the launcher look a little to Flippy for my liking. If you've got any resembling the flight of Felons of Firebirds HMU.
I wouldn't of been surprised if in the video Mark showed a secret door that led to a secret underground volcano base.
"In my next life, I would build a place like that for myself.....

In the meantime, what are you offering for adults????"
"hi mark!! im so much younger than you and i fully understand and absolutely ADORE your videos! (im 11!!)
your videos are inspiring me to be jst like u!!! this video is amazing, and i i hope u have a nice day. :D"
13:28 such an obvious cut 😂
I can't wait for the first winner of the platinum ticket to get to crunch labs and basically have to solve a unique escape room but to enter instead of escaping
Uh for the fire pole thing I thing that u could’ve just used the things used for rock climbing but looks a cool :)
"Hey Mark Wonka, can you stop using frikkin watermelons (any food) in your videos? Think of the cheeeeeellllddreennnn"
Cool! Now we have kiwi co and crunch labs!
Can I work as the receptionist?
isn't what kiwico already have done that?
Is gun a superpower
What about a durian u never did a durian is spikey and strong try it with the  tennis  launcher thing
did anyone else hear the plants vs zombie music lol!
🤯🤯🤯 AMAZING!
If one of us gets the ticket how will we be able to contact you that we got it?
First
Pagman
Breaking bad
i would love to see you try to recreate the giant guitar amplifier from Back To The Future. That would be a cool addition!
8:35 I see you got that metal statue in the background from backyard scientist
Bro made minecraft irl
Mark - can you contact me?  I have a VERY RELEVANT (lifesaving) application for your pneumatic elevator.
You could've shown me a picture of the warehouse and I would know Mark made it.
I love your video mark its awesome😀
Congrats. You’ve just awoken the paranoia in millions of people who will now go touch every object in places. I’m one of them
Love it! You and Jimmy sure are pushing this entire thing to a whole new level. You guys are just the best! 👍
Mark rober Ur a legend also to all hot wheels fans out there watching this video i bet the two timer will go smoothly on that track
"I've never understood people who wash their hands AFTER being to the toilet.
Your hands are waaaaaaaaaay dirtier than your junk. Plus, if you wash first, your hands might actually have time to dry, meaning fewer particulates will stick as you go around touching door handles, etc."
The only thing in my mind now is a Crunch Labs vs KiwiCo ultiment showdown. Preferably on the White cliffs of Dover or the end of Australia or somewhere epic
🔛📩🔝💰🔛
Infomercial.
🔛📩🔝💰🔛
Imagine if you were Mark's other brother and the regular not-cool uncle.  That would totally suck.
With out a doubt the most influential youtuber of all time!
🔛📩🔝💰🔛
If you don't do a nerd battle I will cry for years
"No one:
Mark Rober:Im just gonna put a small nuclear silo just to make my workers in business 😊"
🔛📩🔝💰🔛
Mark Robert is straight up a fun loving batman
"Have rob Derek on,  fantasy factory"
🔛📩🔝💰🔛
Plot twist: There is actually one more secret door from secret warehouse to even more secret warehouse
Think critically nor physically
He engineered the heck out of this 😍
E
"Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day"
YOU SHOULD HAVE A NERF GUN BATTLE IN THERE AND YOU SHOULD USE THE GIANT NERF GUN YOU MADE!!!!!
FATGUS
I wish i could visit your office looks like so much fun
"You gotta collab with the channel ""stuff made here"" 2 big brains in one package"
$300 for a year of it? Kinda over-priced.
Mark is fr legendary🔥🔥🐐
Dexter’s laboratory just got real
Mrbeast 2.0
Light under the book shelf... Not sus at all
>>>📩🔝<<<
Your the new bill nye but for engineering
Looks like rob dyrdek's fantasy factory
Great Mr Beast parody Mark.
This is epic
Wow. Just wow. 💯
double checking nile green is not lurking
i genuinely cant think of a cooler youtuber🗿truly the goat
I've got a platinum ticket
You are a real life superhero keep up the great work !
yo
The fantasy factory of engineering
7005th
Ho ho ho
This is better than any Watchmojo top 10 video.
It might be in the  painting like minecraft 🙂
>>>📩🔝<<<
Mark you are a genius. I would be so proud to have you as my son or grandson. Keep doing what you are doing!
Rick roll them
I’m 21 and want to sign up
I wonder who does the cleaning duty
My favorite enginner in the world!
"Literally taking a dream from the dream realm and transfoming it into a reality, nicely executed Mars Rover!
Hope I can make it happen someday!"
Dam  I wish i could do that but i'm broke T^T
I would pay money to go there if it was a tourist attraction!
I see
DEXTERS LAB IRL
Its the batcave
Looks like Lucius Fox desk.
"I'm an engineer, professionally, and I want this Box."
The plants vs zombies music is a nice touch
What millionaires do with their money ...
"legit, congrats! You been a massive inspiration over the years."
Hi
Mark Rober is that one uncle in movie's who's niece and nephew's adore
"This is straight out of an epic sci-fi movie, probably the coolest thing I've seen this year."
That Willy wonka room looks better then mr beast’s
Engineering Heaven
i love you
i love building
"I love it !! Even tough I'm already 22yo and a Biomedical Engineer, I still want to visit the place 😁"
Wow this gift will be a dream come true for many children 🎁
Mind freakin blown guy..🤯
My kid wants to see you a lot you are his favorite YouTuber he’s is 8
Where did you get the foam pit blocks
"Your crunchlabs idea is spot on Mark. As a College Prof for mainly science courses (biochem, analytical chemists, instrumentation, etc) it is pretty clear the lack of critical thinking and intellectual curiosity in newer generations and fostering those skills is a necessity these days."
"The secret door room, i feel like it is every childhood dream you just realized. Such a cool video, and luckily for us we have someone like you on yt."
I think so to
Oh my word. This is so extra 😂
Getting a Lab facility is the new youtube meta
"Congrats Mark two questions one is can you do a few more of the live streams you did during the part of the pandemic really enjoyed that style of content, The second question is what is the selling point of your boxes vs kiwi co / what made you want to make your own alternative."
"This looks familiair. A secret lab, even with a big red button. Does Mark also have a sister called DeeDee?"
It’s supposed to be fantastic Gus
I've always wanted to have a go on a fireman's piston
"Wait, no"
Someone has visited meowolf recently
"The secret lair was the only thing in the way of mark becoming a supervillain and now he has is


We are screwed if he gets a little too angry with the world one day"
why all these greenscreen scenes?
Wow hi
Hey mark who does the cleaning duty
Shout out to Gus 🐿
Um.. I need to have a kid STAT!
Love it! Living Vicariously through you!
"Wow, Amazing!!!"
Mark got himself a slice of the Kiwi pie. With a Crunchy base. A true genius.
I am a child and I was the exact same and I also wanna be a mechanical engineer!
I like how he put pvz music lol
Anyone Feel Like This Lab Feels Like Zac King's Lab But Better?
Is it worldwide
This is awesome😂👏👏✌🤗
"I thought this was a MrGreen video at first
I also thought it said uploaded 3y ago
I am clearly not as intelligent as Mark Rober"
dis is sooooooo kool
what are the chances that the same person gets all the tickets
Kiwico 2.0
What about Kiwi Co.?
Sciences versious of Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory
i want to do it but i don't have enough money
This is the best engineering video I have ever watched
Wish this was in Florida :(
"Knowing Mark, he probably even has a magic device to make the building seem smaller from the outside."
You are an amazing human.  <3
Fulfilling his dream of having a Dexter’s Laboratory
This is the coolest thing ever
can i come try hit that bullseye that wins me a million dollars? could use something like that
"If it's not under a volcano, it doesn't count."
"Will crunchlab be available in Europe? In different languages? My son (11yo, Netherlands) would love it."
It’s like when someone said they got the ticket but they didn’t
Look rope where do you live and what do I do when I get the ticket?
Since you are still 8 years old.I don't see a problem
This is so cool!  I'd love to build a trebuchet with y'all one day
"You're my hero, sir 👏👏👏👏"
I'm gonna have kids JUST to order this
Nice secret entrance that noone has seen😉
It's nice to see you encourage perseverance. The gaming channels have it too! :)
EPIC
"Plot twist, Nitro lives in that spectacular warehouse."
"“8 or 12”
I’m 15 and want crunch labs."
Earlyish
Mark rober and the engineering factory
well if i do get it but im not in america hows that gonna work
that not a cannon that's a gun!
Now we know though so we could get in
I like it how chopsticks continues playing throughout the video
Wait why are the Pistons not dependent on the mass attached?
Mans is just living our dreams😭
*I am actually impressed…*
I wish I could afford my own place :(
Absolutely a fantastic video.
"To cite Myc from Inside Job, 'every day you edge closer to becoming a super villain' XD"
My 3 y/o son is obsessed with cars! I’ll have to show him the track! He will love it!
The underside of the bookcase is a dead giveaway. Umm why is there massive light like that bookcase is a door? 😂
"I never knew this but he plays ""graze the roof"" in his videos."
Reminds me of Questacon
Am I the only one fanning over Nitro? 🥰
GOATED content creator
Mark Rober pulls bitches
NITROOOOO
YESS NEW VID
This is just the pinnacle of our future people. We must let our creativity to the next level by all means necessary!
So question. Do you have to turn all the speed boosters on to run the track? Because how awesome would it be to have some sort of sensor set up so when a car is x distance away it auto turns on and then turns off after the car leaves it. Would make the track a lot more fun if it just always worked at any moment.
mark you are literally the BEST youtuber ever!
"""...which just might have cemented my status in my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle...""

Dude, that quest is over. I've never met you and you are BY FAR my favorite uncle. And I'm 32."
Ideas: YouTubes have a competition to see who has the coolest warehouse 🏠💡
no more kiwico sponsorships anymore i guess
how about making custom kits where you can pick up any pieces you want to build your own ideas?
Breaking News: Mark Rober’s New Lab Has Just Been Declared As A Modern Wonder Of The World!
Wow Nitro. What a blast from the past.
Are we not going to talk about the fact that Mark is literally piggybacking off KiwiCo's success?
Hello Mark! Just when youtube got boring you posted again :)
Crunch labs is awesome im buying one even rho im 15
"Know I know... If I ever get the chance to meet Mark Rober, I'm  definitely bringing quarters!!!"
Oh this is is a nice eagle can I- OH MY
Dude is living the life
suggestion for #7 why don't you make it the thing with the squares to measure the speed of the catchr
Chopsticks is my favorite invention you made
"me and my failmly watching this. mw brother gets the smirk. 

i am just wating for my little brother to cause mayhem."
"waiting for mark to now come out with hits like, Beat it, Billie jean, Annie are you ok, etc etc."
Pretty awesome!
sometimes I wish I was an engineer instead of a vet lmao
That’s awesome. I love that you engineered the toilet to lock the door and not to just put the seat back down.
"If your reading this, I pray that whatever your struggling with will be better and that everything will be OK. 😇"
Mark Rober is going to become the next eggman
-  👍 👍 🔧 -                                             👀
"9:50 Mark Rober confirmed to be Darth Maul.

*Duel of Fates intensifies*"
Or the Third Sister (or a few other characters I decided not to list)
This is probably one of the best videos I have seen from you Mark! Love your efforts!
Delivery men after seeing this video: turning everything on the shelves
Yooooo posted on my 18th birthday let's go
I'm sad
f for kiwico
thats cool
You are amazing
Every Marks video makes me believe in humanity again
What was the song at at: 0:11?
Best 17min commercial ever!! Lol!!
@markrober why can’t you use water in the tubes
I am in awe and inspired
This is so cool wish I could have that
Wow That’s amazing Mark! your videos are always so awesome and inspiring you are definitely my favorite YouTuber!
I love your video's
"Lovely Idea Mark, but how is KiwiCo going to take it?"
Secret?? Hmm everybody knows it now is it still a secret thoo?
The whole “no Mark Rober’s we’re harmed in this video” implies that there are multiple of them. Cloning lab?
"This is just incredible! My hats off to you mark, loved this project a lot mate!"
Speaking of Fhat Guss did she give birth yet
>>>📩🔝<<<
Mark sounds different In this video
Its amazing but people will know it’s there because it’s just a massive warehouse with a tiny office so from outside people will know
Foam pit on wheels…. Just look before you leap.
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL
You know. These secret passage ways aren't so secret if everyone knows about them.
Wow that is very cool how did you build that!
"Mark ""Dexter"" Rober."
"Oooo, what does this button doooo?!?"
You're doing some really great work here Mark!
Great vid mark keep it up
"Take that, Colin Furze!"
This is one of the best videos I’ve seen in a while
So cool
KiwiCo: 😐
KiwiCo rolling in their grave.
Where can I get those horns?
"Yeah... You lost me at ""men are pigs."" I'm not wasting my time watching a video by somebody who thinks I'm a pig."
Its offical mark rober is tony stark
Thieves: Interesting
wow so cool
"mark just might be the word ""wholesome"" personafied<3

the stuff you do is amazing"
There goes the KiwiCo sponsorship. 😅
"I was so excited when I saw mark had posted, he never disappoints!"
Hey Mark on Number 5 is that Plants vs Zombie music ?
This video is gonna have a lot of people suspiciously looking behind pictures and furniture at their doctors office looking for secret passageways
Your amazing
Wish I had your money and time wasted
"You dont burn your hands in firepoles If u ""hug"" it with your arm"
Why u be wasting watermelons tho?
Danseez is the best song
6:20 amazing choice of backround music
I wish I had Mark Rober when I was younger
Super cool!
You should change your nerf guns with Airsoft
i love how there was plants vs zombies music just randomly in the video
i love your videos can i have the toy box thing (23313)
So kool for the younger folks.
mkbhd and mark rober crossover???? sign me up
New video!!!
B
"Mark, You are a modern hero."
I used to think there really were kids with dexter´s lab style hideouts like these lol
Mark Rober: Sheer genius!
I love this!
Secret passages? Goofy ways to get around? Mark Rober is living my best life and I don't mind.
Wait wasn't that mkbhd throwing frisbee
OMG
Really stepping up his production and I love to see it
>>>📩🔝<<<
"You should vantablack or something below the bookshelf, you can see light spilling from behind. But other than that this place is a dream come true."
I’m 10 and looooove your vids
"You’re an inspiration, Mark"
>>>📩🔝<<<
Where is the big nerf gun ? #9
The 8-Bit Guy is now intensely jealous.
These boxes will sell like hotcakes. My nephew will love these
Wish this guy would run for president.
What a great sales pitch 👏
I love how two big YouTubers have both released their own Willy Wonka factories in the same month. New trend incoming? 😂 this is awesome :))
Gravity falls secret
"This is soooo ! Cool I can't wait for the final thing
I really like your videos!
Keep the hard work up!"
"I love how ""subversion of expectations == comedy"" in your book. Really you have just realized my childhood dreams and I'm honestly not even jealous. You are the only person on this earth I would not be jealous of when achieving this."
>>>📩🔝<<<
This is straight up Dexter's lab
Something like this could only be behind a humble bookshelf. Nothing else would do.
let me go inside
This is every kid’s dream
"Mrbeast: I built Willy Wonka's chocolate factory
Mark: I built an insane secret lab
Everyone: I can't decide which one's better"
>>>📩🔝<<<
Seems like a perfect place to set up Home Alone-styled traps for the scammer mafia if they ever come looking for you 😏
Mark becoming batman irl
this is goated
I saw that it was called crunch labs and as an animator in the industry I think it just triggers some subconscious ptsd because I stood up and went to go make some coffee
"ok, mark rober, the hacksmith, colinfurze, and simone giertz (and I forget who it was with the awesome lab...)
you guys seriously need to collab for a superhero series, lol
the hacksmith is building modern stark industries
mark rober has the batcave
colinfurze is just a mad scientist
we're having IRL superheroes who don't fight with violence, they fight with youtube videos, and brains!"
"I love this so much, not only the warehouse, but also his new brand I am definitely going to have to buy one"
inspiring kids to be engineers instead of inspiring them to be drag queens will make the world a better place 👏 👏 bravo Mr Rober..
I think firefighters could benefit from the new and improved fireman’s piston
"Uhhh... I think you missed the meaning of Secret. The warehouse part is not a secret, unless you make the shutters and back door hard to spot outside. Can clearly see through the holes on the shutter side... Also a warehouse is huge, expect people with One Digit IQ? Hahaha. Peace."
Its just insane how many IQ he has
Hold up! This box is only for kids? Not for 28 year olds? It honestly looks pretty cool. Great job Mark!
"20 million, hah, cute"
RIP Kiwi Co
This business model is genius. There are produced now customers literally every single day!
Tony Stark!
"Mark: ""So instead of the fireman's pole, you have the fireman's...""

Me: ""Pump. He's gonna say pump. It's so obvious.""

Mark"" ....piston.""

Me: wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu"
Can you do a video about water powered cars?
he should build a giant frisbee launcher
This is he best YouTuber merch ever!
thanks mark rober
seems cool
"Seeing this makes the childlike ambition go wild.
But then i'm immediately sadder than before because i realize i'll never have something like that."
"Dude this is exactly why I love you, you do so much for kids who just want to have fun and build stuff, I'm even considering over the summer asking my parents if we could get crunch labs and just have tons of fun"
"This is extraordinary!!!!!!!!

A dream of mine is to have a secret bookcase that leads into a secret lab with secret passages!!!!!!! SECRET PLACES!!!!!!!!!😂"
I remember people speculating that Mark was up to something big. We had no idea!
I wish I had 0.1% of your brain power. 🧠
"yeah no one would probably be fooled, yeah dude isnt using the majority of this building..."
New mark vid!!
that's actually cool
very cool
Wow this is so cool you're videos are so well done and great
Congratulations Mark! Ir really seems like you dreamed about this place your hole life. It's a great achivement for you. And what you do encouraging children around the globe si awesome. Congrats from Argentina!!!
nice
Take my money
Time to go tell my parents about this
I see a new Mark Rober upload and I click. It’s that easy guys
This is definitely giving dude perfect hq 2 vibes
>>>📩🔝<<<
Mark is quickly becoming the Bill Nye of this generation. 😂
📩🔝##
"It's great to see, my daughter's a bit to young but I may stock up on some boxes once I get a handle on the money situation in this economy. It's been really rough but we will all get through it somehow."
I would never get anything done for the rest of my life if I had access to a lab like this.
>>>📩🔝<<<
Does the Crunch lab box ship anywhere or just us?
Would you consider making a build box for children younger than 8?
it looks EXACTLY like the lab from breaking bad ...
>>>📩🔝<<<
Yyyoooo
Come on im asian and use malay ringgit so im malysian so i cant buy
You can see the light under the self haha
"5:22 SP s16e1, finall scene"
Clad that atleast one person understood what I meant
So cool
If i can have 2 jobs ill be a chef engineer when i grow up
Built a Minecraft base in real life
"lmao I love how ""nobody would find it"" while there's a very suspicious bar of light glowing under that bookshelf ;P"
What if you get a ticket in another country than the US?
i love your inventions and your youtube where you wil help others (i am the same) also i am photographer and what i one day wil build is a lens for in the dark becuse i am a night men haha and it can be verry handy to have (and a beeft up stormchase car)
Ww
„And I‘ve just never had a great answer for that specific question“ yeah you had Mark. You had one and they were you greatest and most loyal sponsor. If this isn’t a joint venture I feel like you just ripped of Kiwico like crazy.
Pov: it looks at first like dude perfects place
You should see about selling them at stores like Walmart or even a place like Barnes and Nobles
The melons must suffer!!
This video is the smoothest commercial I have ever seen
Congrats
Only Mark Rober can make a 17 minute long commercial look fun
for real where do i enter my credit card info
Lol true
"That’s why I liike,
Nestlé CRUNCH (labs)
WOW!
This was the HIGHLIGHT of my day (and I did some CRAZY FUN stuff)
Keep it up!"
Everyone look for an oversized tooth decay poster
The secret door in the office needs a seal at the bottom for light seeping through.
📩🔝
who is this for?
📩🔝##
You are one of the most amazing person to be gracing this planet with your existence and sharing that experience with the world.
This is the Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory for smart people
This video is absolutely mental. Thank you.
Life Goals
📩🔝##
You can see there is a passageway behind the shelf by the Light that shines underneath it.
KiwiCo sweating hard after this video….
"OMG
That is an amazing place to work
Between you and Chris Ramsey
You are both awesome
Him with his puzzles and tricks and you with your glitter bombs and that warehouse
Thank you so much for sharing your videos with us
🙏💜🙏"
"Amazing! But we could definitely see the glowing bean of light under the bookshelf, as well as the scuff marks under the statue that triggers the door :P"
Just incredible❤️
"Mark, you're insane! 😮"
Under the secret door you can see light
Hi mark
"Its just the coolest thing to see how much he and his channel evolved over the years!
keep doing what your doing mark!"
One of the best news this year already
I want a secret lair!
"I don’t know how to say this other than “Congrats!”. You’ve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it’s so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."
Amazing video
"I would absolutely LOVE to come to your lab, but I don't have any cool ideas of things to build like you do, I would be so nervous"
"With NR 5, you can see the light under the bookshelf
Can you push another soda button?"
Hey Mark not to be that guy but where is the squirrel maze 3.0
so fantasy factory engineer edition
"Mark is actually a genius. He literally made a way to fix peoples unsanitary habits and also made all of our childhood dreams a reality. 
PS.  There is literally no imaginable possibility that you aren’t all of your nieces and nephews favorite uncle."
Facts....watch the nerf gun video. Mark definitely wins Christmas every year.
this is insane
you nailed it bro.
I just dream ✨️ to be able to buy all your boxes 📦 and give them away to kids around the world 🌎
Why are all the science nerds lookin like they were once jocks LOL
"OMG I actually get a chance to meet you. Sadly my family doesn't have much money, so I guess I'll try and get a job real soon"

Now it’s marker beast

You built the base that I build in every Minecraft world 
😅"

"SUCH A NEWS, so cool !
Wish you the best in this new venture."
.
"since you release a monthly video, you could have the person that comes to see the crunch labs be featured in a video... just an idea you might like"
if this isnt trending ill be mad.
we need more people like mark rober
I'm going to sign up for the one year
Does someone know what song chopsticks played?
and I’m out here wondering how the copper cable is spinning around my double a battery lol
Not a lot of equality in the bathrooms there...
Not a single upload that isn’t a an absolute banger
Except I can see the light coming from the crack under the bookcase at 06:24.
:O
I'm definitely going to buy it
"Holy Guacamole, this is amazing"
ik it's for kids n'all...but gosh I love this stuff

So you grew up off Rob Dyrdek and his Fantasy Factory...Cool😏
"Flawed hand wash alarm. All it takes is for the handle to turn on, not necessarily washing their hands."
Day 4 of asking mark to make a gigantic 3D printer
You are awesome!
I teared up from how wholesome this is
Bro has like a thousand things he works on everyday
daddy
I need a phat gus plushie
I find it crazy when youtubers are secretly working on stuff like this for a year or more. Never once saying anything or hinting at it somehow. Makes me wonder what else mark is working on even now
He employed every amazing strategy including the willy wonka golden ticket
I can play piano
te amo amiokr riober :()))))
"HOLY I had no idea that my favorite tech tuber is also a very skilled pro Frisbee player, when I saw the ""Frisbee player"" in the video I thought to myself is that Marques Brownlee? and I search it up AND YES!"
why does this sound like an end?
"Oh no you’re bad go gosh, giggles!"
(:troll:)
"Hey Mark, love the crunch labs packs. Will you offer any educational packs so that teachers are able to bring these lessons into classrooms? Love the design process and it would be awesome be be able to bring this to students!"
This is a great idea! I know I would have loved something like this as a child.
Wow
Mark is the Bill Nye of the next generation and I love it
This is soo cool.
Yesterday a friend asked me where is my happy place. I told him I didn't have or know of one. This is it. This is my happy place... and I'll never be able to visit or have one of my own. 😭
yes but mark THE LIGHT UNDER THE BOOKCASE THE LIGHT ITS VERY VISIBLE
At the start I was wondering if it was a Mr Green video
We need a subreddit where people can show their kid‘s Crunch Lab Progress/ results. Or their own perverted creations completely abusing the provided build parts…
Do you ship to Canada?
"A 17 minute commercial...







I'm not even mad"
"I''m glad I wasn't the only kid obsessed with the Assault event from American Gladiators.

Though, if I had the means, I probably would have built the whole course with the crossbow and rocket launcher.  Gotta fight back..."
Can’t believe I’ve been here for over 5 years I am so proud 🥲
Awesome and wholesome as always love it☺
Simply amazing 💕
4:06 me after my mom is chasing me because I didn't do my chores

I RLY want to go to crunch lab!!!!
soooooo.... you selling that toilet seat contraption or what?
I love this. You always have the best ideas.
How long does The Hot wheel track take to complete? @MarkRober
That's as secret as the Fruze tunnel.
Congratulations in accomplishing your childhood dream👏🏽😁
"My inner child was screaming just thinking what it would feel like to actually find the platinum ticket. Then I remembered I am 26 and should probably go to an actual kid. Congrats Mark, you have built my dream place <3"
Why not just make a toilet seat that closes itself?
"Dude, could I come by!?! Love this spot!"
The issue with the shelf door is that you can see there's a doorway behind it because the light shines underneath it
Did mark just become art attack but for engineers?
6:26 the light coming from under the book shelf makes it pretty obvious that there is a room behind it

Hello can you make a combustion engine
Thanks for letting us live the dream with you Mark!
crunch labs looks amazing
i think mark rober might be the coolest person in the world
Is he Mr.beast?????
You are a wonderful human being.
"crunch labs kit, but only 1st world kids could have it...."
why now
"This is super cool, but just don't make the mistake of accidentally leaving light below the secret doorways, since that always gives everything away."
Pov half life 2 6:43
OK all cool. But 😞 the crunch labs in a box look disappointingly _exactly_ like Kiwico and are even monthly too.
Master; genius!
"Only Mark Rober would show a secret engineering lair behind an office, show it off to the world, and probably still keeps it a secret."

I want something like this so bad!!!
Lets see you make a robot that can juggle.
16:26 I just wanted you to know that I saw that clip 😂
Very cool !
Ill live there!Its so cool!you've outdone ylurself!

no they’re not
Early
Firemen piston what??
Your son is going to love this
Mark is just the best person to ever be given this amazing positivity and he puts so much work into his videos. Keep up the great work 👍
Your so friggin awesome! Awesome warehouse
Oh I so wish that I could…. But since I live in Canada….
DAYUUUUM
"Cool place, except for the cucked toilet"
8:09 omg tinker crate 2.0
"This is awesome, congratulations"
"7:21 actually, 1.1M"
Mark Rober just evolved.
Kiwi co copy
This video is ironic because it’s gravity falls 10 year anniversary lol
No more kiwico sponsors
"I love it, i would love to have manual in multi languages :)
The idea of building and after that still have a fun toy is amazing for kids. 
In future future, when i will have some kids need that for them."
Is it only me or you kinda took the idea of willy's wonka factory of mr beast
nah
This is super dope! Congrats!
I was hoping for squirrel maze 3 but this is cooler
Imagine flushing a bug then getting lights flashed at you
Soooo wanna make a box for adults or teens? A grade up per say
I heard kiwico going oh sh*t all the way here.
This lab cave makes Bruce Wayne jealous!
Litteraly gravity falls
Woah just woah u  mean this is real and not cgi?
2:36 Please make a really big version of this

This is awesome in so many ways. Mark keep doing what you love!
I bet Mark Rober would be amazing at Minecraft redstone
Can I have one of you have guns I am a subscriber

mark rober you are insane in the most awesome way possible
Remember To Pray Before Eating And Drinking. Spread The Gospel.
Can you tell me in the next video if you can get The Crunch lab boxes in Australia
You should try something new like hanging out with Matt from OFF THE RANCH
Dexters laboratory vibes
Just don’t pay attention to the light coming from under the secret door
Can you one in Boston for me cuz I have altisum like your sun
Did I just watch a 17 minutes advert?
i like your vvids and i love engineers and stuff but my dream job is to be a nasa or spacex space researcher
I want to get it but it is way out of my  budget
Ay chopsticks is back
"Love your work, keep going"
wow. just wow.
As an ENTP 8W7 and you as an ENTP 5w6 (the natural INTP enneagram) I'm so happy you exist thank-you for you and ALL you do - You amaze me seriously keep up the amaazeballs of all whom you are you most excellent engineer...!!
THIS IS REALLY COOL NGL.

I love you
Ok but why not a giant sphere pit next to the cube pit

Just kidding I really want to see the base though"
Its 300 canadian
"That looks super cool! Is there any chance of the boxes becoming available in the UK, or other places? I would definitely buy some."
When you see Mark Rober made a new video
"*Be me, a Cybersec major in college*
*Sees Crunch Labs toy builds*
*Insert Spongebob ""I don't need it/I need it!"" meme*"
At 6:26 there’s a dead giveaway for the secret passage with all that light coming in from under a portion of the bookshelf.
Dexter's lab
That place is mind-blowing amazing! it looks like something strait out of a movie!
"6,400th comment"
5:40…… This is a superpower that most people don’t TRULLY understand…. “Mark Rober” said it best…
My son would love that hot wheels track. Think I may build one around my house for him 😊
Nitro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You know mark you some how keep amazing me I hope that in 5 years I will be just as amazed dont forget what you started it for.
Now you got 22 million people jiggling stuff in random waiting rooms....LOL
The only problem about this is that I am not a kid anymore enjoying that amazing engeeniring box. Anyway awesome Mark!
How the fuuuuuu did he get a shipping container
This is hands done the coolest thing ever. Please tell me to will be posting more often now so we can see more of this excellence.
You're too cool Mark Rober! Please Chill.
Thanks for the invite.
"This is my dream. As a youth, I see this as a place where creativity is what builds it."
Best mark rover video ever
.
Like Mumbo Jumbo but irl
ultimate Frisby was invented in the town I live in
This is a 17 minute commercial for your product.
Me as an empath sensing Mark Rober is happy
Not to be a Karen but isent that just a copy of kiwco
so cool
Mega Colin vibes
Definitely not just ripping of kiwico
"Can we not get it my
Monthly because I don't have enough pocket money monthly"
Mark you should team up with Stuff Made Here for a project!
"Mark Rober and Gus Fring, collab of the century"
"And with this, mark has pushed himself from legendary to godlike."
As soon as I saw nitro from the American gladiator I knew this was gonna be worth the click
That's fun and lovely but only in us not in eu:(
What colors are on that T-shirt ?
"Day 1 of asking for a shout out (Sorry if this annoys you)I have always been wanting a shout out on a video. So can you please give me a shout out on the next video. (BTW you are probably not even going to see this comment. If you tell me to do this on a different channel, I will because I don't want to annoy you."
15:48
Only Mark Rober makes me question my life choices of work. Should I just quit and start my own engineering projects instead?
I imagine mark with Mr beast making an epic video like this one but with cash on the line or something idk
Mark. Take me with you. Please And thank you
Kiwi co feeling the crunch hehe
"this is cool, Mark! Great job! :)"
Okay but like real talk could I just pay to visit?
cool
“Why don’t you gentlemen have a Pepsi?”

Breh the nerf guns make this dorky but funny ish .. get an airsoft gun u wont >:]
This is the only channel that both my daughter and I watch. Now I can build Rober-majigs with her too. Ok ... that's pretty neat.
"Soo do you need a live in nerf ball wrangler?
Cause this is cool lol.
This warehouse looks amazing."
Love your content
This is soooo cool I love how it is secret too!
Kudos to Marques!

"love to you mark for inspiring so many people, im currently in my second year of mechanical engineering and i love how you teach everything very clearly and very entertaining"
The only give away to how to get in is the fact that there is scratch marks around the eagle
i wish i can have it but my mum said i cant get it :/ an i live in Australia anyways
Excellent. Kudos.
This is my dream I’ve always wanted something exactly like this.
If Batman and Bill Nye had a son.
He just re-made kiwi-co but better
dude you literally just told us
Kiwico punching the pillow rn
I really need to stop watching this kind of videos
Thus is awesome
i’m eating pizza while watching this video
Anyone else reminded of gravity falls with the entrance
"Awesome, it looks like a fun place!😎👍🇨🇦"
The light under the bookcase is a giveaway to something being behind it.
"Platinum Ticket haha. DADDY, I WANT A PLATINUM TICKET! GET ME A PLATINUM TICKET!!!"
this is so cool
"Yeah, Mark, if only there were any other crates for kids that you totally didn't rip off... Hmm, no, I suppose there aren't..."
And don't even get me started on how your private Disneyland is definitely not the place where your 10 unpaid interns will be designing the toys in CAD for uyghurs to build somewhere in China.
What about a crunch box for someone that's maybe idk.... Like 32 or something
"This is so freaking amazing, and it’s so awesome that you’re sharing your passion for science with the world in a new way!!  Visiting this place would be a dream come true for any of your fans."
I love your channel and all the badass creations you've designed & made easy & fun to understand
KiwiCo be sweating...
I like how the piano music changes to the original music
You make a building box for kids but I think it would be fun as an adult
at my school we are learning about space and me and my freinds are doing the mars rover you made🚗
Will you ship to Kanada?
Hlo
Great video
I want to become engineer
My passion for engineering grows every time I see a mark rober video ❤️🥹
Can we agree that we millennials are basically kids with money? And that's kind of awesome.
I will never understand who could be cool enough to beat Mark Rober in the favourite uncle contest
My dream lab 😍🤩
All the 1.2 million people interesting….
I swear mark has to much time on his hands
:)
Kiwi co just got salty.
"i don't understand how he does this. he makes a video every month, but then has THIS. like when does he have the time to make a full company and huge warehouse??"
Real ones don’t flush the toilet or wash their hands
Early
"Do a carbord plan 
air fight"
First MrBeast and now Mark Rober… what a crazy world we live in
do you ship in Canada?
"This is absolutely fantastic and it's no wonder why you have 22 million subscribers. You are gosh darn awesome Mark, never stop pushing science to its brink!! 💯"
i will learn engineering just to work here.
You can see the light 💡 bottom of door lol
I wanted to buy this for my daughter BUT you don't ship to Switzerland :(. Why? There's so many countries in that list...
It must be really cool te know that there Will be a entire generation of engineers that you inspired to become one. Think of all the inventions that Will be maid because the kids love your enginering thanks to you
Can you guys some day invite subscribers
omg this is so amazing i love it!!
Bro literally copied Kiwi Crate 💀
That was the best advertisement i’ve ever seen
Nice.
"Nobody:

Mark Rober: Builds a secret room, then continues to show the entire internet where it is and how to access it. 

I love this guy."
But theirs a glow under the bookshelf exposing the secret room
A LOT more appealing compared to those american 'high class' apartments and such. Probably costs less too somehow
Here's an idea for the future my friend I suggest maybe creating the same opportunity you have for kids but for adults who lit's too like cool stuff like you build To that way the adults can have some fun as well because some adults like me who is 23 like building stuff and like a challenge and think like a kid sometimes
"oh, wow"
I would like to come because it looks so much fun lol
Mark and Marques
"words cannot describe how jealous i am this is soo cool
i feel like everyone has dreamed of their own building treehouse thing when they where little 
the nerf clean up must be a task and a half though"
The passage should not be lit until the door opens. It shows light under it giving it away in the video. Love the vids as usual!!
I used kiwico before and I broke one of the parts by accident XD
"THIS IS A SCIENCE KID DREAM,🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲"
"I have a question.
What if you life in German?"
Woooooof
so cool
Gonna be the hottest toy around
This Is Awesome
"Even though you may not in for just money., this could possibly end up placing you in the top 5 richest YouTubers with a little help from shark tank. Wishing you the very best.  Much love ❤"
0:30 Of course mark is still alive because he posted.
That a lot
"I'm gonna buy it for me. I see no age restrictions there.
absolutely beautiful - 300$ / year is a real nice deal for 12 boxes."
love this guy
"""Greatest thing I've ever done? Discovering Mark Rober."""
hi
"The can see light coming in under the ""secret"" bookcase entrance....."
Great idea :)
Well it’s not secret anymore
Not so secret anymore 😏
This is literally a knockoff of the secret annex
There's so much room for ACTIVITIES!
"Yo, this Dr. Kleiner?"
Who else is wondering who is competing with him to become the favorite uncle?
The Dude Perfect of engineering
You are my inspiration to become a rocket engineer but sadly even if I got the ticket I'm on the uk
0:09 me wondering why there’s so much room with no door to get in
its been 1 month since he uploaded..
Beautiful! Outdid yourself again Mr Rober
Rob Dyrdeks fantasy factory for nerds 😂👍🤦‍♂️
"ALSO, pls team up with NileRed, it would be a great collab"
So I guess the people at KiwiCo aren’t his friends anymore
"DC Got Batman with his batcave, we have Mark Rober with his secret engineering lab"
this is so cool! i wanna win the ticket lol
Just fantastic and amazing. I try to transfer your spirit to my students!
Did nile green upload to the wrong channel?
He really transitioned from science guy to trend guy
The first time I watched this video I was eating Watermelon
You’re amazing mark
Is the crunch labs available outside of the US?
Just had my DT gcse thanks for the video it helped me recover from the exam
"imagine if every teacher in schools have passion like you, the world will such a better place ..."
"You are such an awesome person, and believe me when I say that I don't give that compliment often."
bruh the light under the bookcase
"You should never use an ornament as the main lock, use it in combination or one or two other objects like a book and a switch. NOW THE CLEANING LADY CAN BUILD THE NEXT SUPER WEAPON AT THE LAB while you are at the Irish Pub drinking Jameson with yourr buddies!"
Low-key reminds me of the fantasy factory
Why do you like using watermelon so much
"So this is what you do when you have tons of money and nothing but time, eh? Must be nice."
wow
"If i had a choice to choose whom I want to be  in the next life, if there's such, it would definitely be Mark."
"""Welcome to the least secret Secret Office in the world, all 22 million of you!"""

!!!!
"All of this creativity to have a secret lab…. AND YOU TELL THE WHOLE WORLD. 

I hope the world will keep your secret!"
CHOPSTICKS
Honestly I would know because the bottom of the shelf is emitting white light. Kinda hard not to see.
Crunch labs is the coolest real life lab no matter what people say.
This is simply the coolest thing ever!
Ye
Aayyooo hi sacred
@marestic should be seeing it on the news in 10 years
bro is gonna build a house on the moon in like 10 years
We have to stop mark… he has become to powerful.
"Love your videos And salute to you 
You are filling the new generation kids with creative ideas💡 ❤"
New to your channel and simple put….inspiring!
I saw a white tv
ahh yes more recruitment for the mechanicus
Hey Mark! This is a great video! Thanks for the great monthly videos. Ever since I started watching you videos I started to have a deeper connection to math science and engineering in general. Your one of the people who inspires me to be an engineer. Thank you and keep up the great vids. :D
"Mark, you should have had a Stark industries and cross out Stark and replace it with Mark"
"I am almost 50, and I want this soooo bad! 😂😂😂"
""
"If/when Mark retires, he will have created thousands of new engineers to replace him. This is fricking awesome."
Zombies  attack the lab. mark: uh uh uhhhhhh NERF RIVALS
This looks like DP HQ
"I think just hanging out with Mark Rober for a day would be cool, regardless of age. He just seems like a really cool guy."
Mark Rober video. All dopamine levels replenished
Kiwi co probably feels a lil betrayed after all those sponsorships
Secret rooms are every child’s dream
"Amazing space for creativity, passion, and above all...fun. Thank you for reminding everyone with every video how fun and cool science and engineering can be. Congrats on bring your dream build to fruition."
This is some bill nye the science guy stuff I love it
"I can already see the video ideas, and more mr beast collabs"
I’m a seasoned ME and even I want to build these kid toys! 👍
I’m 27 and I’m getting a crunch box. Better deliver to the uk mate!
Hope I get the platinum ticket!
The toilet one is a girl who lives with a boy’s dream
Badass
You should make a baseball bat with adjustable power levels so the minimum would be like swinging bunt and the max would be Barry bonds swing
"You gotta admire the fact that the Diet Pepsi button opens the door XD
Top notch security, like who drinks Diet Pepsi???"
this feels like a movie
Why the heck are you wearing catchers gear
"This is unbelievable!!! I can't imagine how much thought and effort was put into this massive project! Congratulations, Mark, you've built pretty much every child's dream lab :)"
Mark I never knew you liked plant vs zombies that’s the roof theme
10:53
"i really do like science, especially when things get theoretical 

.... i just dont understand any of it"
random thought you should try to work with nintendo to make more labo games
Amazing but you kinda pulled a fast one on kiwico
if you guys are ever hiring interns i’d love to just help around the shop and learn from you guys
"Idk Mark, its not that secret when the sliding door has a huge wheel at the bottom and light is visible. lol but its a childhood dream come true"
YOU CAN SEE LIGHT BENEATH THE SHELF SO ITS KINDA OBVIOUS.
Wow.
This is awesome! I love it!
one day this guy is gonna invent a literal wormhole opener
i want to go
this is something that i need to say and i want you to know mark rober that i really enjoy seeing the idea process and final product of everything if i ever meet you be prepared for my adhd mind to show every idea you could think of see you possibly
Woah 🤯
I love this living childhood fantasy.
I'm so happy for him 😃💙💛
This dude is actually Tony Stark.
😎
Willy Wonka factory for engineering?  Heck yeah!
"Dude this new crunch lab thing is awesome! I hope I can get some of those! I help my dad make some wooden things, they are inventions, he isn’t a engineer, but it’s still making things, and making something cool, and functional, would be even better!"
i cant believe mark rober would resort to money laundering using an office front
if transport to san fran was possible i would prob be more likely to get this for my niece. as is.. its up in the air.
I feel like ive seen the start in my dream
Im getting some serious fantasy factory vibes. You should totally team up with rob dyrdek. He would be down to save the world with you.
This guy is one tragedy away from being a super villain
"What you are doing for children's education is amazing. I wish I had some of these kits as a child,  I would have built tf outta them."
"“The average person wouldn’t be able to find it.”

Very cool but I have a suspicion in future years we'll be looking back at this video in the trial as the turning point from cool fun uncle to creepy basement supervillain
Isn’t this kiwico?
"Is it your three children?

It wasn’t"
You are so awesome
not very secret mr mark.....
can you make like an adult version of crunch box 😭
Hooooooooow
"*Secret tunnel, secret tunnel, secret secret secret secret TUNNEL*"
why just why mark
If I had the hot wheels track I’d put like 100 on and never turn it off
being Mark Robers neice or nephew would be so cool
YESS WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISS
When can you buy this in Denmark?
How does he know that I play soccer and the piano and I study a lot of math? 🤨
"If the secret lair is 10x bigger than the official building, I think people will notice from the outside. Also, there's a light shining under your bookshelf. :D"
"Mark, what you are doing is just so amazing!!! So humble and awesome!"
this is so cool
How would you “fix” the problem that at 6:26 we can see light underneath the secret passageway? It might be because we already know that’s the door but what if someone oblivious of the secret passageway spots light below the bookshelf?
Just turn the lights off inside the warehouse when it’s not in use?🤦‍♂️😂
"Don’t Worry, Mark Said He’ll Change The Lobby After Filming This Video"

Saw that too! Integrate a small panel at he bottom that raises up when you turn the statue.
i love the Plants vs Zombies music in the background of that part
this guy needs to grow up.
gustavo fring
Imagine your in a nerf battle u jump down and the container isn’t there💀💀💀4:25
I hate to be that guy but isn't the automatic toilet seat-based door lock a fire code violation?

This is my evidence and you should do it too."
I have the monthly kiwi ko membership and it is SO cool
This is every kids dream
"Mark Rober thinks of everything. Also, Mark forgets to cover up this bright light coming in from under the bookshelf!!!!"
You should try doing a Collab with e HackSmith what you guys could create would be amazing
i’ve loved science before i even watched your videos :)
Are you going to replace KiwiCo sponsoring a load of channels... Because looks remarkably similar?
wait how AREN'T you the favorite uncle??
rip kiwico
"Mark, you are officially the coolest person i can think of off the top of my head"
ha i found your secret lab
It's not a secret passageway if you tell everyone about it.
I spoke too soon aparently
You're a super hero Mark.
"Next you'll be saying that a Dorito chip invaded your mind and that you have a twin brother, who is the exact opposite of you"

It’s a bat cave minus Alfred. I’m a jealous wreck.
Got it I simply won’t flush then wash my hands check and mate
"i mean honestly for someone as amazing as mark, the bookcase entrance is kinda weaksauce.  u can see the gaps around it and the light from inside the lab shines through under the shelf telling you something is behind it"
The pain of not living in the usa...
This was 2 hours ago and this video has 2 MILLION views!
"Oh wow diidnt realize he passes 20m subscribers 
congratulations"
Kiwico in shambles
that is a lot of money for someone in poland
Goofy ahh uncle
He literally created our Minecraft Secret Base in real life. Mark can do anything.
You need to obscure the light coming from behind your entrances because they don't look so secret when they glow.
That’s cool I want to go there
I know you won’t see this but I love you and everything about you I just hate puzzles like crutch lab cause I end up messing up the project like crutch lab love the idea but whould not be able to do it you are most likely the closest thing to my dream life I whould love a crutch lab warehouse like this so just wanted to say love you and all you do you are amazing all your videos make me smile
i dont even leave my room if i got this my parents would'nt se me again
"I think I speak for us all when I say that there needs to be a more adult version of the toys 

Featuring slightly more complex versions, maybe even something that gets built over time. 

Please try and make this happen"
OMG I GOT THE TICKETTT
This is beautiful
"Mark your videos are the coolest. I love your videos
 🤩🤗"
"This is a cool project, if i had kids i would buy them this boxes."
I want to get one but don't wana take that chance away from some lil kid! I know that would just set their life on a whole new amazing track!
Marks voice sounds a bit different. You okay?
This is just a Minecraft mumbo jumbo house irl
"You're kind of really awesome and I really want to be like you when I grow up

thanks for this :)"
BIG W
Can I order this box even though I’m 23 😂 heal my inner child
This has Dude Perfect warehouse vibes
"Am I the only one who pointed his smart phone at the opened Crunch Lab box in the video to test the QR code?

BTW, my uncle is a fireman and when he refers to his piston ...."
please tell me there is a bypass and a failsafe on the no. 6 (toilet lock). Otherways someday you might find someones more than crispy remains in there if there is a fire and the power gets cut with the solenoid in the lock position.
"Glad you went with the design i described on ur original disc launcher collab vid (its just the obv design lol, not taking cred).
Whole heap of jelly, i was one of the first people to be part of the Questacon science schools, I was given a scholarship designing science demos for use in schools but promptly got hospitalised and spend 6m recovering and couldnt do it."
Can everyone just notice how he made a literal arcade out of wood?
"I know there is a very low chance anyone sees this but I have a question can people in the UK also receive boxes because I love engendering and science it’s what I have have always wanted to do and the thought of having the experience to have a full on video to learn about engineering gives me so much joy , btw
Everyone is beautiful in their own way have a nice day or night"
You are definitely my childhood hero!! 🦸🏻‍♂️🦸🏻‍♂️
"Super cool secret door, but I'm sure you're already aware of the light peeping through the bottom of the book shelf door that is a dead giveaway. Either way this is the dream secret lab."
"I am unsure how to feel about this. On one hand, the fact that you made this to help brings forth a feeling of happiness...but also a feeling of innate FEAR. What you have done here reminds me of school. The one place I have come to look back on, not with longing, but the opposite. What this does is remind me of days I look back on with DREAD. So...why? Why do this?"
"the bright light in the under path of the shelves may be a bit of a giveaway, might need a raised floor to step over like a sealed hatch from a truck but you are probably aware of it"
Mark is actually working on automating rocket artillery out of Ukraine
He made his own version of tinker crates that used to sponsored him
Wait until I pull up with the engineering factory inside of the largest crater on Earth
You've made a Batcave.  Which makes you Batman. Which makes you my new hero.
no fair I want one!!!!
Mebeast beast like “hold on you can’t just top me like that that’s illegal”
well done - bit pricey at £20 per month though
This actually amazing
I’m happy you did a video after long time again.
"It’s nice to see ambition pay off congratulations on all your success, and thank you for using your influence to help kids see the value of science and engineering."
THIS IS MY DREAMMMMMMMMM
what if my crunch box gets porch pirates
It was better when you showed the process of construction of your cool things
"We need the host insane Collab in history, with the biggest YouTubers"
Wow
you are the best
This is probably my favorite thing on the internet. Can't wait to know more about what is going on be builded there. It's the dream 🤩
I know you will life
Too cool!  I hear Tony Stark is jealous of your lab.
I feel like someone is going to jump off the 2nd floor not noticing someone moved the foam pit. Wiley E Coyote style. :)
The thing is Mark there’s a light underneath that book shelf that people can see
"Mark Rober just casually ripping off Curiosity Box
8:25 - He pretty much says nothing like this has ever existed ........... yeah, sure buddy"
@Luminate it's Vsauce's monthly Science box
Wth is a curiousity box lol
Ok
"Yep, I don't get why he doesn't say ""there are others like this out there but here is why mine is better..."""
What is curiosity box
Mark Rober is becoming Batman
"I wish SO much that this was a thing when I was a kid, I'd 10000% have got it. I'm in England, I hope this can be distributed to the UK some how for us guys, we need it."
Well I can see some weird animations set here lol
So Mark Rober has become a Mr Beast  clone. Pretty cool I guess
Congrats this is the most insane thing you have ever built! Keep going Mark!
"2:45, how about me that is overweight? is it still gonna hold?"
@KyleNamite so like 1m?
Yes. It can handle any weight.
Am I late?
Typically when people build children's playhouses they're for children.
Wait mark must’ve got inspiration from mrbeast latest vid on YouTube no doubt about it
But when is this in dutch...
What an incredible vid as always Mark!  I can’t wait to see what you have in store for us in the future!
Behind my secret door are the nuclear launch codes
i hope you get this and fly me out to meet you
Mark Robert is it true that pennies are going to be extinct soon?
"Climbers thinking ""oh... the auto belay device works the same way...."""
"Mark Rober is possibly the only person in the world who can say, ""I hid a factory in my house."""
"... it’s not his house...

it’s a warehouse"
**Laughs in John Kramer
Lolll
I mean i wouldnt be too surprised if Mr Beast did that
I would suggest that he is not the only one
"This is really great 👍,  i support the new move"
I Washington 1 602 yay
EVERY KIDS DREAM!
hi mark you inspire me to be a engenire when i grow up. My birthday is oct 12 and i am turning 12. I would love to be in one of your videos and visit the crunch lab. I would love to build things with you and even have a nerf war with you. you are my insperaishion and my and my hero.
Bruh i live in canada so even if i got a platinum thingy i wouldn't be eligible to go there
Why are you showing us this video if someone steals your items
I need to make myself one of those going down thingys
when can i move in
Kick
Mark seriously is a real life gyro gearloose.
"Team trees
Team seas 
Now: Team memes"
no love for adults?
@Demoman his product is targeted for 8-12 yo kids
Wdym
"Dang, y’all hiring?"
Mark really is a legend
He is Willy Wonka now :-D
Crunch Labs = Mark’s Clubhouse
I love that Mark is one of the only youtubers that uses the nostalgic no copyright music. Really brings me back
It's like the Fantasy Factory for engineers. Awesome!
mark you are a great person thx for everything
"Mark, build a roller coaster. That's all, you need it. EDIT: OR A ZIPLINE"
or a train with a train track build into it
mark rober is slowly turning into make it real
Instant like and comment mark rober you mad genius 🤣
This is really awesome Mark. And now I know what I'm doing for my nephews birthday
"Hi, I am your big fan. How can I get one of your engineering complects if I live in Europe, Latvia? Please answer."
This is the next Mrbeast challenge video
When is squirrel parkour coarse 3?
You just single handedly shut down kiwi-Co
i hate to be that guy but your crunch lab monthly crates are basically a copy of kiwico
small note: you can see the light under the secret entrance to the lab! you may wanna fix that in order to keep it SUPER secret! (or at least keep it in mind for when you revamp the room)
go away bot
Congrats and goodluck
HELLO
I always wonder why he always uses the plants vs zombies soundtracks
I'd be very interested to know what the max weight on that fireman's piston is.
you are the next bill nye
"I wish i could be inside that building… enyways! Your knowledge is like 70% of god,s knowledge."
"Sadly, its not a secret anymore :[ BUT YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB!"
MrBeast if he was an engineer.
3:47 I’m sorry…STOLE!?
"You're awesome, Mark!"
:O
Breaking bad wishes they could.
"Gawd I wish I was a kid again to experience this shizzle. 
This would have been exactly the kinda thing I would've loved."
I signed up for the crunchlabs boxes! Im going to be a awesome uncle! Hahaha thank you
Is getting closer and closer to become either Umbrella or Ansem.
CAN I PLEASE COME WORK WITH YOU
A true engineer
My son is going to love doing this thank you Mark!!!
Should've been called the fireman's pulley
he made a 2x2 piston door in real life
Can I come and work for you?
I wish I personally knew Mark. I could chill in this epic lab and learn even more stuff than I learn from his videos. Mark's so cool!
Fireman's piston... hehe
you have one of the most awesome jobs there is. Really really cool what you do
He should try a cellar theme going underground to abrand new world
Ik I’m not gonna get it but ok :(
you scared me
So the obvious question not addressed in the video:  what happened to KiwiCo?
engineering isnt about following intructions tho
Fantasy Factory vibes 🤘🏻
He just robbed a dennys
"KInda off topic but have you ever thought about doing a ""survival science"" episode/series? Cuz earlier this week my neighborhood lost power and when I showed people in my apartment the water bottle flash light trick, a bunch of them went around setting them up to give the whole place some light"
As someone who is currently following an engineering study at university level I am really happy to see how engineering is made fun and understandable for kids these days. Great initiative and I am sure I would have loved something like this if it was there when I was twelve
GTA casino heist.
"as someone who handles money all the time, 10k is a single strap of 100s. its much smaller than that glass case."
I thought nilegreen hit you with a train
Dude! You are a freaking LEGEND!!!
"I get in my head about the state of the world these days, but then i watch one of your videos and i. Reminded how much purity there still is in the world"
Ayyy let's go
Calm down Mark.
6:26 not so secret when you can see the pathway under the bookshelf
KiviCo rip off?
"You had me at ""Nitro"" 🤘"
"hi hi, could you make a video about the perfect way jump? like in volleyball or basketball?"
"The average person wouldn’t, but gravity falls fans would"
ok
This is Rob Dyrdek’s fantasy factory for science nerds. I love it.
Takes so much time on all his bangers much respect
I really want to go here for my birthday now!
all this stuff is so amazing and you're bringing on young Talent into the world of engineering
this was super cool :D
Would love if there was a graph behind the diving foam pit so you could use recording software to evaluate people's dives
i love the fact he makes the far side contraption. i just looked at it before watching this video
Im way too lazy to be an engineer
So what's the purpose here? To make every single person in the world as jealous as humanly possible?
whenever he makes a video it makes my day
Legend
"6:18 I did NOT expect that music, I learned that song with my friend on piano"
@Demoman It's Graze The Roof from Plants VS Zombies
"This song is everywhere, it has so many variations and it’s freakin amazing"
"6:48 Yeah, the Diet Pepsi button... smart choice. I would have never pressed it in a million years."
New Bill Nye:
Nice that even Arun was there 😁👍
Just make sure you cover up underneath that secret door. Or the secret entrance won't be that hard to find with all that light shining in from underneath lol. Either way it's so cool 😎
only mark could get 1 million in less then 3 hours
You should make some “hard to build” toys for adults - wanna be engineurs
You are the one who inspires me to pursue engineering and this is amazing how big of a parcel did you have to buy but never the less you are a amazing person and keep building I want to thank you for inspiring me in managed to create a build to order cafe in my school using a converse belt and you inspired that and thank you
Mark Rovers child is gonna have the best time of his life in there
Mark went and made a better kiwi crate
Seriously cool place. Rob Dyrdek would be proud
"I have a Relly ambitious idea basically a drone to separate Carbin frum air, but I don't know how to make it can you?"
Do a colab with Colin Furze!!!
💛💛💛💛 1 Million views in two hours! Wow💛💛
"Can we all agree how much time and effort he puts in these videos. He’s awesome and kind. I think he need some of that back. 




Ps: at 3:51 is soo cute"
7:07 plants vs zombies song
Why are you always shouting?
The lab is amazing and we too are super stoked  to try the kits! Wish our neighbors were as cool.
"Aww.
Only 17 minutes? Looking forward to a monthly video kinda bites when it's such a short offering, it seems like there could've been alot of interesting things to talk about too.🤷‍♂️
Oh well it's still a 👍 from me.
😅👍"
This is so cool
Mark Rober is basically living our childhood dreams for us.
So uh Mark are you hiring? I'll be the janitor that totally doesn't play with all the stuff.
This is my childhood dream that i never had.
"wish all the best, maybe we need more than just Kiwico"
This is truly amazing!!
Just ordered mine. I'm gonna be 35 this year... Got my wife's permission.
Classic Mark
Colab with @Hacksmith when?
Now more then one million knows about this
Totally not seeing the light under the bookshelf
the crunch labs thing looks so fun i might even quit doing kiwico
"> ""Sir, i need 3 of those crunch boxes""
- ""ok. Cool, your kids are going to be very happy!""

> ""Yeah... My kids..."""
"This is like Fantasy Factory, except for science!"
Loving engineering is great until you go to college and get hit with the worst professors and workload and lose all passion for it 🙃
Man’s doing red stone in real life
"Thank you. You don’t know how much this means to my son, whose school does not have enough engineering-type lessons."
And now you are the engineering Willy Wonka
"i love watching how h'es grown and even more so, used his gift AND his audience to create something truly positive in these seemingly very negative times. much  love mar,k, youre a true banff"
You are a true legend Mark would love to see you in NZ some time bro lol keep up your truly awesome work
Love the videos
"Yup, totally not jealous."
bruh the ball went threw the wall 0:33
"Honestly, congratulations and thank you for doing such an amazing program. I can not wait to see the generation you are inspiring comes up with."
instead of normal hotwheels . you should put a regenerative led diode using wheel turn as energy so that when you launch several hotwheels it will all look like beeps of led from far away showing where they are LOL
"Mark i think we all know that there is such a small chance to get the box with the invitation, so mabey you could do somting else to get the invitation like somting a bit more fair."
this is why we love you mark
You took kiwi co.'s Idea and mad it better. :)
self indulgent nonsense.
"Correction you,v just told 22 million people"
Mark Rober everyone. The leading cause of feeling like a kid again…
the videos from the box includes subtitles or audio on spanish??
kiwico?
Yo
What a legend!
Very cool marky
NO WONDER YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG!
Fascinante!!!!! Ojalá estuviera en Argentina! Muchos éxitos!
I’ve taken a lot of engineering classes in middle school and high school
"You should put the eagle on something that spins naturally, otherwise you can see the scratch marks on the shelf"
This is super cool.
"You know what would be better than a nerf armory…an actual wall of guns. MP5, M1, M4, AK47/74, Ghalil, Styer Aug, 1911, MP40…"
"Back in the day My intro into Science was not a toy (though to be honest many of them ended up in my experiments from my book on '700 science experiment') but it was the Child's Chemistry Set my dad got me. I had chemicals and substances for weeks to explore the coolest stuff. Luckily I had a normal upbringing since half the stuff was potent enough to either blowup, poison or irradiate half the town I lived in."
"Let's make a secret lab nobody will never find. . .


Now let's show everybody so that they could find it"
"Yes! i play ultimate frisbee all the time and on a team, and i’m so glad it got the recognition it deserves! Thank you Mark, and congratulations on the dream warehouse."
The intro ks so crazy it sounds like mr greens parodies
What if you created a prank test tube that when you use it self destructed
Wow it's only been 2 hours and he has 5.8 k comments
Nice
Great product!
What if you created a prank test tube that when you use it self destructed
You make me wish to be young again with a blank paper of my MINT interests😢😅
What if you created a prank test tube that when you use it self destructed
Time to check every single place I know to find Crunch Labs.
Hi
do you ship to eu
"secret doors are cool but theres one problem with them.
house on fire
firefighters comes
finds no one is in the house
firefighters leaves"
"“The average person”, minus everyone who sees this video"
Just…. Wow. Taking your passion and turning it into a career makes you successful. Taking your passion and helping others with it makes you a hero. But taking your passion and changing the lives of future generations by inspiring them with it makes you a super hero.
its like his newwst secret den for creating amazing engineering innovations
Your such a inspiration! Love your vids🌼
Tomer should be a 60 second water running time limit
This is MAGICAL! ✨
Can I be your nephew???
Wooow nice congrats
New vidoe
This is so cool I wanna come
"Firefighter. Speaking of which, don't tell the fire marshal about that door solenoid!"
love your vids and want to be a engineer.  :)
You are truly a gift to humanity
I’m worried about marks team
omg how fun!!!!! 😄😄😄😄
My cat would sit there all day watching the hot wheels car
My man’s living my dreams
Nais
Now I am the Master
"“Endgame is the most ambitious crossover ever!”

Mark:"
"I have an idea for you. How about integrating all those kits to make 1 big project, either using the parts or being fully constructed. Ehh, just an idea"
"This made me cry seeing how Mark achieved this, it just fills my heart with happiness."
Where is the pool
"This is like DPHQ2 and the Fantasy Factory had a baby. This is engineering heaven on earth. Congrats on the achievement and the launch of the box, Mark!"
What if you just wanted a diet pepsi instead of a secret base
"Mark Rober is gonna have the most fun zombie apocalypse bunker someday

'Create Innovations to defeat the zombies here, in my Zombie Robber Bunker!'"
It gives me chills :)
Collab with jackass?
Simply keep it going mark! Stay great as Always
Neat
The light that shows from under the bookcase kinda gives away that there is something behind it. That or there is a lighting system under the lip of the book case.
Hello
Rober's fantasy factory
"Awesome!!! But after buying all those kits and getting gear badges, we just get some connecting gears in the shape of a rectangle? I was hoping for something a little more awesome - maybe a giant fighting robot that's a combination of all the other kits? ;-)"
"Hmmm do I see a 
Crunch labs vs Hacksmith video in the future? 
(This video is amazing by the way)"
U make the world better place in many possible ways ❤️❤️❤️❤️
2 hour and 1 million view this is a great video
"Every year, Mark's inventions keep getting crazier."
22mil nice
"i love watching how h'es grown and even more so, used his gift AND his audience to create something truly positive in these seemingly very negative times. much  love mar,k, youre a true banff"
"As someone who wants to go into engineering, one of my biggest worries is that I started too late and don’t have the knack for it that you would get at a younger age and so, I think it’s great that kids nowadays have opportunities like this to foster their creativity and love for engineering and science at a young age, you are truly an inspiration for the next generation mark"
"I started uni at 26, i’m going for 8 years to get a masters in engineering, i know its not /that/ late, but there are older people on my course, it really is never too late, you got this buddy, i believe in you!"
"It’s never too late to start it!! A lot of my fellow students in engineering school had a lot less hands on experience then me, but the curriculum is designed so that anyone can learn. Focus on learning lots of math while you can, it’s the hardest part of engineering in my opinion."
But do you have a working tardis?
"Me every 10 seconds: 😮😮😮😮🤩😮😮
Thank you for your videos Mark!"
You're the best everrrrrrrrrrr❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Yes, motivate"
How much do you want for that train horn bike? 😂 is so cool
Early
"Even knowing that the secret entrance is the diet Pepsi button, I still can't find myself selecting diet Pepsi"

"This looks really cool. If they ever plan on making more complex toys ill consider buying it. 
This is mostly for children"
Real life Dexters Lab
"I love that you get to live out your dreams! Godspeed Mark, Godspeed."
That pneumatic pole does not look OSHA approved
Congrats - I can tell a lot of work went into this launch. Great job! 👏 That warehouse 😍 - would be awesome to checkout in person
The amount of restraint he had to not play the Dexter's Laboratory theme once during this is amazing in itself
he cheats in real life bro
"@ 17:14  Congratulations mark I am in awe of your you're experienced techniques and the way you utilize yes you're Platform reach. This is something I would absolutely love love to do R&D at.  I am an  Struggling inventor andMy inventions are Intended to make the world a better place. I want to give my invention to the world it is a solution based solar Voltaic cell 
 1st of its kindPurely theoretical and call as I have not been able to do R&D on it  Just a hint the cell uses Jupiter gel/fire ice,   Graphene, And a fennel lens, Along with some wink wink proprietary information lol."
Love you mark
not secret now
My kids are going to grow up in the world I always dreamed of because of you. Hats off to you for inspiring a new generation of engineers and building my dream workshop! 👍
"@The Suited Engineer you sound idealistic, idealism is pretty much dead at this point of history and I'm an engineering guy, the world is getting worse, it is undeniable"
"True, but one of the main reasons both children and adults should be inspired to become engineers is so that they can try to solve problems like that and make the world a better place. Gloom and doom isn't going to solve anything."
@The Suited Engineer more like a realistic kind of guy
Dang. Someone is a glass half empty kinda guy 😬
"Yep, this is very secretive, only a million people know about it"
You made me want to become an engineer because of you
In the office through the secret door you can kind of see a light shinning through
kinda hard to go there when your on the other side of the frickin planet :P
"Mark seriously has one of the most entertaining and most interesting channels on this platform, and it makes me want to try making things even though I've never engineered anything in my life before."
"“This is what you see!”
Yeah, and a big bright light under the shelf lookin’ like something straight out of ghostbusters."
"""The average human will never find the secret entrance!""

...Well, they will now, since you showed it to everybody."
"Mark, is it possible for you to make an engine run on water? It'd almost be like a better tesla"
show us where the oompah loompahs sleep
That's a lot of light coming from underneath that totally normal bookshelf. 👀
"I kinda miss when Mark’s vids were actually experienced difficult engineering projects and not targeting 5-10 year olds… 

I understand that’s the target, but I hate calling 10 year olds engineers because only <1% of them will actually have the competence to become a true engineer. It’s not as easy as following tutorials and putting gears together.

That said, Mark has done great things for the community and I have the utmost respect for him, but Ill have to stick to the Stuff Made Here guy for the WOW factor."
Video idea: rubik's cube robot vs fastest rubik's cube solver human
Make a soccer goal kicking robot
"So, you basically supported Kiwi Co... and then  decided to take the idea and become a competitor?"
Mark Robert is like a young Bill nye
In Person
3:27 “arshalde”
What a goated individual
"awesome, but the toilet seat thing sounds like a fire hazard"
"Wow I Just Want To See The Foam Pit, The Nerf Guns, The Glitterbombs, And So On"
Wooooo
"That is every child’s dream

I want it NOW"
mr beast said he hates you because if you cared about natrue you would plant 100 trees
this Crunchlabs programm sounds amazinv. too bad it doesn't ship to my country. but its cool anyways
secret passages are basically useless but i want one just cause its cool.
One of those twirly chairs was at this museum I went to
Really makes me wish I was a kid again.
That was perhaps the most nonchalant Marques Brownlee cameo I've ever seen
"Mark, I am a senior citizen, twice your age, and I want to thank you for the joy that your videos give. I think the greatest thing you do is show young people how to live... how to contribute... how limitless their futures are... how to be a great Dad (LOVED the video with your son)... and how to have passion to make the world a better place through engineering.  I couldn't make the grade, nor the tuition, back in ""my day,"" so I chose a different path of service, but never lost my passion to create.  Even now, in my little retiree's workshop (about a 100th the size of yours!) I still fabricate solutions to problems and generate gifts for friends and family. I hope to do this to my last day. You are a credit to your wonderful Mom whom you lost WAY too soon; to that awesome son of yours who uses his talents to bring joy to others; and I suspect even Fat Gus admires your engineering prowess as he thwarts your efforts with his intellect superior to mine, anyway! All the Best and With Respect, Richard A."
Keep it up Richard :) You are a true fan :)
"You sounds like just the type of guy I wanna be when I’m older, creating and design new things when I’m retired and watching YouTube!"
"This comment really made me smile. Keep going, Richard!"
This comment should be pinned.

Utc Plymouth uk engineering school
That's so very sweet mark. I appreciate you taking the time to make learning fun. So many kids will appreciate this. Keep it up! :)
"Mark Rober, you wholesome son of a gun you!"
I am always so excited when you post a new video! You are so amazing! Thank you so much for amazing content!
So awesome for kids!
It cost too much
With every upload Mark is beginning to become more like Mr.Beast
"Would you consider doing some more advanced engineering kits? I’ve always wanted to build a drone with a camera from scratch and code it. Although i know I’d learn lots of new things from the kits you are about to release, i feel many older, aspiring engineers would advance from this stage fairly quickly. I reckon there are lots of others who would also love to buy more advanced sets. Thanks Mark!"
+1
"Heck yea, a teen-adult box line at some point would be super sweet! I like your idea as a first. (Same desire here, and tiny high res cameras are cheap now, drone doesnt have to be anything special at all, the principles and building is the important part of course)"
@NevFN just say on the box supply your own “this model” arduino.
He can’t really do it unless he creates a rip off arduino and sells it
"@Ahdok I would imagine that at first, a kit would come once every 2-3 months as they would be intricately designed and would take longer to build. Even 1 or 2 advanced builds would be an incredible start for adults to get into engineering. I’ve considered becoming an engineer myself recently but I don’t know many places that i can start. I think the best way would be to dive into a practical build to experience engineering first hand!"
Mark fr must be an amazing Dad
This looks straight out of parks and recreation. Do you need someone to do the paperwork?
if i won i would have mark make hanzos bouncing arrows :D
It’s looks like it is from a movie set
Great 💡 ideas
Mr beast already did Willy wonka. Please don’t stop on that line fam lol
"Smiling, thank you and have a great month."
I feel like nobody who watches him know what he is saying when he is talking about engineer 😂
Why don't I just touch the sink and not wash my hands
"I like the idea.. But honestly there is a huge gap at the bottom where you can see the light coming from the other side of the ""Secret doorway"".  An engineer must have a solution for that!?"
Do grandmas qualify?
Mark makes the best vidos ever! It’s amazing
Holy moley!!!! The best and greatest place on earth if you ask me !!! That’s amazing!
"now which toy would you like ""yes"""
that looks like corridor digitals office too
so cool! are you going to translate the videos and explanations of your crunchlabs boxes in french? and sell it in Europe? thanks!
Stark?
The new Minecraft update looks great
today must've been a very sad day at the KiwiCo office
You're truly living the dream! Congrats on building your next-level mad scientist's lab. Can't wait to see what amazing builds come out of this!
Well it's not secret anymore now is it
"I'm a simple men, I see Marques I like"
"Sorry if this is already answered, but is there a lower limit of age for your course?"
"I love your ideology to engineering, because u live out all your child fantasies"
i like this guy
Mark please build a particle accelerator
I leave the seat down do when I go my sister gets in trouble for not flushing
Dude this is awesome I wish this was a thing when I was a kid! Ngl tempted to just getting for myself as an adult...
"Kinda random, but his voice is sounding somewhat like Jojo Siwa at some parts"
I’m huge fan
"Ok welp Mark is officially Stanford from Gravity Falls now- Both have a big secret lab, are great guys, and are both wild smart - and honestly I’m not sure if I expected this to happen or not"
"5,767Th"
"started watching, will he survive tho?"
"uh, .. mmm,..  not sure how to break this to you.... But you are not supposed to use your hands when you go down a fireman's pole."
Hey mark I’ve been watching ur channel for a while I am about to build a diy fan but do you deliver to canada
"Ordered a year!  Thanks Mark!  My 5 year boy is my mini-me, he is gonna love this!"
You just edged out Whistlin Diesel for best warehouse.
Is Mars Rover teaching kids how to build a road side IED with tripwire?
so mark has like 500 friends? or does the word not mean anything to americans?
Are you time traveling back from movie idiocracy? Finally! Lets make kids think!
Its official guys... Mark Rober is Batman
this is amazing i have ben waching you for 2 years so this is just unblevibel😉😉😉
Thomas Edison's secret lab but like Mark Rober's secret lab
😂 why am I not surprised?
advertising a product for a long time just to become its biggest competition lmao
That lab is one of the coolest and most inspirational thing to do with a warehouse. Can't wait to see your adventures!
drug lab
This is super cool! I kind of want to make my own fantasy factory when im older.
"I feel like there are only a few people interested in doing this sort of thing, because a lot if people are so engrossed in video games. I'm happy there are other people that are genuinely interested in this sort of thing."
What if he stayed with NASA youtube would not be the same in my opinion.
this is amazing
Walter white
Does ist deliver to Germany?
"I dunno how complete that previous build room is, Mark.  I don’t see a refrigerator full of smashed and peeled watermelons."
If only someone like Mark had designed Dubai…😅
awesome 👏🏻
"this is so cool, I wish I could afford to participate!"
"Admit it, you want to be Mark rober"
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
Video idea: make a giant balancing bird
lmao kiwico
Jeezo Mark! I’m so chuffed for you! For that space! And for all those kids who’s futures are looking a little brighter with your inspirations! You’re a gem of a human! Congrats bud! 🥺🥰👏👌
4:38 what is MKBHD doing here?
Bro this i am speechless about this its also my child dream omg the nerf guns
I want you to mess with scammers!!
Honestly all I can say is wow
So cool
So that's why mrbeast is bald
I wish it was nation wide
"love this so much, it’s so you"
Won’t you gentlemen have a Pepsi?
I love MARK
This is Awesome! (Like me :P) Wish I could visit this place sometime. :)
"11:08 Gear badge: ""Claymore"""
Dexter!!
Stoked!
"this is amazing Mark, love the crunch lab. I just graduated college and did a similar community project where I designed and implemented STEM kits in my community. let me know what you think,  Science Circus Whittier"
I feel like this is the end of an era and the beginning of a new one
what if he missed the foam pit?
I want to be a kid again to get the Crunch Lab Box-and Im 56. Love this for kids!!!
I think I was I was the 1M view omg OMG
so no more kiwiko sponsors
Yes
Would makes sense
I agree
Yes
Impressive. I wonder what videos will come out of this
"If there is not a full video coming of a full-on Nerf war, I quit happy"
This is so dope bro congrats
"Mark, your so darn epic. I love your content your brain your desire to create teach and share. Top tier youtube content. Pura Vida"
I hope anthony can have a ticket
try the tennis ball launcher on a nokia phone
"Hey Mark! Protip: the 6 dart revolvers can be *very* quickly fired if you hold the trigger button and pull back the slider very quickly. If you can stuff more than 6 darts into a single cylinder, it could be a devastating high for rate pistol, as well as really lightweight and accurate"
Mark you are absolutely the best guy ever! I love your videos but your cause is even more admirable.  Awesome job and congratulations on the endeavor and I looked forward to seeing this grow!
Hey mark I’m an orphan and if you need a son like uh just maybe umm if u want a son like…👉👈🥹
With the platinum ticket @Mark Rober has become the Willy Wonka of engineering 😀
I'm 19 and currently studying engineering and I need these crunch lab boxes in my life!! Love what your doing Mark. This will surely inspire tons of future engineers.
"Since middle school, I've thought they should make bathrooms that don't open without washing your hands (with an emergency button of course)"
redstone in real life
this is epic
So THIS is where you've been over the pandemic :D The wait was worth the payoff
@15:00   Scares the ever living c*** out of me I have never seen a tennis ball smoke that much of a hole.
Bill Nye the Mark Rober Guy!
"Its beautiful Mark, makes me feel like you've officially made it in this world, and its still uphill for here. There's always gonna be a bigger problem than past ones, and they have the potential to be solved, by you!"
hey*

Never wanted to be a pizza delivery guy until now
WOO HES BACK

No but like having Mark Rober as your uncle would be amazing
Wow this is impressive
My dude’s out here building Odd Squad HQ in real life.
First
Hi mark I’ve been watching your videos sense I was very little and I have been a inventor just like you made my inventing life Thx for the help
Also can I have a shoutout
Dauerwerbesendung
Where was the sand spa
"Supplies being limited for this month is kind of misleading, since you can mail your entry in."
"So who's going to say it? ...
Mark Rober is now officially the American Hacksmith"
11:08 Gotta love that kiddy Claymore lol.
Mkbhd easter egg
This is actually crazy! Mark Rober FTW!
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
All of this stuff is so cool Mark! I can't imagine all of the work that led into this stage - keep working on your lab and inventions!
This guy is amazing
You are a genius with a giant ❤️
I loved this video its so cool that u made something like this
Did he just invent Kiwico? 🤔
"It's only years later that the kids will realise what it takes to be an engineer when they will get to learn probability, statistic, linear algebra and Calculus...."
Is this international? / do u ship to the Netherlands
Or the bright light shines from under the bookshelf
"Mark is BY FAR the most entertaining engineer of all time! Not only that, but this guy just straight up listens to his audience. Great job Mark!"
Very cool i love the lab it looks awesome
"Mark: ""Noone will find this secret lab""
Giant garage door with windows leading into the warehouse: ""Am I a joke to you?"""
@MarkRober why don't you ship to india
Mark is the coolest uncle to ever exist
That is epic
I think i love you. This is amazing
Omg I want that sooooooo badddddd
Unfortunately my kid is not yet born...
"mark rober: the smart kid in school that got ahold of a camera

(this isnt meant to be negative towards mark)"
I would love to spend a day with you ( theoraticly) but i am from and live in germany
I know you dont care but i have always wanted to go to Germany
"Nobody’s ever gonna find it!
*Proceeds to show his 22 million subscribers."
it would be cool if you made tunnels in the walls then a room that you can only access thru the tunnels!!!
the question for crunch labs is could i use honey with it
This is like the best shark tank !
I love your videos
I feel like his vids are so famous that under a million views and under 3hours is still a valid accomplishment lmao.
"this has to be one of the coolest things i’ve seen on this platform, it feels like you’re living a literal dream inspired from dozens of movies and shows almost like it’s nearly impossible to think this could actually happen to yourself. it’s kinda sad but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
My guy became a salesman
omg wow this would be my dream house (if it was a house) lots of creativity put into it. Very impressed
I need to know where that toothache poster is pronto!
I love you if only for the toilet enhancement.
It's 10 o clock at night!
I wanna work there Mark. Hire me i dont need salary :))
legend.
"Mark Mark Mark Mark 
Mart Rober the science guy"
what if your a kid
"Wish this could be kids science curriculum! Amazing achievement, Mark. Congrats!!"
"I'm 63, this is the kind of thing that makes me wish I was 13.  Gotta wait for my kids to reproduce."
"“I know what you’re saying. ‘Well it’s not exactly a secret if you just showed 20 million people’”
Me bouta comment that*"
Here before 1M
"I’ve legit always wanted something like this and now, It’s here. :) and I get 12 chances to see my favorite YouTuber engineer!"
mf got the whole rick & morty garage
You are an amazing human. Wishing you the best.
small note: you can see the light under the secret entrance to the lab! you may wanna fix that in order to keep it SUPER secret! (or at least keep it in mind for when you revamp the room)
Pfp Bot
AH! You just told us how to enter!
"Mark, you made being a kid FUN AGAIN (even for us
adults)...i really appreciate you..you are a real life modern day Willy Wonka."
MRWHOSETHEBOSSS YEAHHHHHH
All the stuff is dope. But the kid im me wants to play with the hot wheel track
I love the idea of crunch lab and the office looks amazing.
I want to go to your lab
"“$10,000 in a glass suitcase if you can hit the bullseye”

….brb

Where are you going?

To get a ladder, a hammer, and some safety glasses…

Why?

Fuhgeddaaboutdit"
With youtube it would be hard to create invention stuff that is cool and fun to enjoy to watch.
Mr. beast in like you
SEND ME ONE NOW ples?
"I like how @ 6:26 you can see light underneath the bookshelf, indicating that there is something behind it.🤔 Overall great video and SWEET warehouse!"
POV: you cant keep up with the first commenters
W
What’s the difference between the $24 and $27 boxes though? Doesn’t really say on the site
"I’ve been asked about what I want to study in collage, I’m a freshman next year and even my younger sister in 7th grade knows what she wants to do, watching these videos, I might want to study engineering."
Hi
"Crunch labs is great, but RIP Kiwico."
This one kinda pogg tho
"I am so excited for everything coming in the future, I am 16 and I lovee engineering, science, and ect behind everything, I am so stoked for the new Crunch Lab boxes !!!!"
Just be sure to check and make sure the foam pit is in place *BEFORE* you jump. 😂
I made a crossbow out of pencils yesturday
"It be fun if i wasnt, oh no, in another country"
"Hi Mark,
If I am getting that ticket, then I need to be able to come within the next 2 weeks because I am moving to Israel in the summer!
Super cool lab and I think that it is amazing.

Thanks,
Ori"
@mohammad maharmah We want to move
@mohammad maharmah what?!
@mohammad maharmah no
"Are you forcing a Palestinian to move out, of thier home?"
"2:09 I would've just used a cushion

Edit: 4:20 Nevermind"
He kinda ripper off kiwi co. with crunch labs
That’s where he makes meth with Walter white.
i don t understand why the girls aren t rouning after you!!!
EPIC
not secret anymore…
yes
OMG
mark whenever i see a new video by you i gasp and grab a bowl of popcorn
Dude you truly are a creative gift to humanity!!😎😎
mark is litterly a real life tony stark
"Can't wait to come visit your home! At night, alone, while you are sleeping."
I got a patent I’ve been trying to build I already know what I need to do it’s huge if I can get if off the ground could use some advice
So crunchlabs is basicly export valorisation against kiwiko?
This gave me goosebumps
"Cant order from Switzerland, im so sad ;("
I love this idea so much. I only wish there was a box for people who are interested in engineering but aren't kids anymore. Congratulations on the launch and major props for all the years of hard work that you've put into this and everything else you do.
"So in other words, if I DON'T flush, and DON'T wash my hands, the alarm won't go off?"
Hopefully he doesn't copy the boxes from the existing one. That would be a scandal.
early
Just like every minecraft world i have
You are an AMAZING human being! I love your videos and I love how generous you are. So nice to see someone trying to pass on the passion for engineering. Keep up the great work!
This isn't real. You cannot convince me this is real. This stuff doesn't happen in real life.
"Absolutely love it, however you can see light from underneath the bookcase"
How often do you use calculus as an engineer?
"Me who thought he did all of his videos in his garage: I’ve been tricked, backstabbed and  quite possibly bamboozled"
Kiwi co gonna be mad
"Awesome Mr Rober, all the best with your venture!"
"9:10 It's fascinating how extremely wholesome yet violent his inventions tend to be, I love it!"
I like parent who don't know his kids age 8 or 12 lol
yeah xd
thats just epic. I have nothing more to say
"watch out kiwi co, you got some competition coming your way"
Is this only for Kids? Asking for a friend.
Make giant anong us
O-O
Immediately placed an order for crunch labs. I can't wait to do these projects with my kids.
Can’t wait for you to do another collab with dude perfect! You should show them this place!
Sofa king cool.  Would love to know how much it cost to set all that up!
the PvZ music for the secret entrance part
Mark I think if you found any cross crunch labs you could post with them and or explain how to combine certain sets but have them figure it out after it happens like 5 qr codes come with these fore mentioned
Forgot to mention but thank you for making this videos
This guy's the best
You're totally awesome 😁
I need all these toys
This is so amazing. Keep up the amazing content.
What about the massive amount of bright light coming from under the book shelf?
But i use £ instead of $ so how do i change and how is the delivery gonna work??
wow. I’d love that lol
What’s wrong with you
You should do a collaboration with Elon musk!
Wow that package is really cool! Amazing way to connect with the young.
no mark rober i want that so bad but iam in a different country rn
This guy rules
5400
Mark congrats!!!!!! Amazing person with an incredible mind and soul!! ✌🏼😝
NEVER LET THEM KNOW YOUR NEXT MOVE.
i watched everyone you posted
Will the boxes get shipped to us
This warehouse reminds me of dude perfects
1 million views in 2 hours…
LETS GOOOOO ANOTHER MARK ROBER VIDEO
You can see light coming from under the bookshelf other wise EPIC
fist live
Love it <3
Ok - Wow.
👏👏👏✌😉👍
"I want that, but I’m almosen 30 with no kids and don’t want to take it away from some fortunate child"
MrBeast crossover when
D U D E !
Whose his friend who plays frisbee?
Ill take your entire stock
Hi mark I’ve been a fan And I like your vids
OK this is cool as usual - great job Mark!
"This is basically a 17 minutes long commercial, but this commercial is so cool I’d happily watch it again 😆👍🏻"
So I guess I’ll be canceling Kiwi Crate
*cough* breaking bad *cough*
Am I early?
I guess after video I’ll try to break in since I know all the secrets
I forgot about you 😂😂😂
1:40 Practical and cheapest solution; Gloves.
"That’s because your pole is painted. You need a polished stainless pole, then it works correctly"
I can't get one because I live in Egypt
Imagine if kiwico helped mass produce the crunch boxes.
"The dentist looked at me weird when I tried to pull all the levers and push all the buttons.
I will find that lab Mark, I will...





I live in Australia though so maybe not"
All fun in games until you see the lights under the bookshelf
Mark WILL be responsible for reshaping our youth and get the future generations to move our nation forward in engineering!
"brooo you should hav caled it Crunch Works like the legendary lockheed martin Skunk Works.
thb it was a mised opportunity"
"Well, I have a new goal in life"
"Wow, Mark. You had us at hello. My son was jumping out of his skin by the time you hit the ask. 😆"
He literally just built a minecraft redstone houseXD
"First thing i thought after the warehouse reveal, was Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory."
It would be cool to see some community 3d printed Nerf designs on your wall! Are you by any chance familiar with that group? r/Nerfhomemades.
"You have done one of my childhood dreams and made Dexter's Lab.
The want to make one for myself has just made it up much higher on my list of life goals."
Why mark rober doesn’t wear his wedding band anymore is he divorced ?
My parents say no so even if I buy one and get the ticket I can't go
Gotta make sure to have a sign to indicate whether  the foam pit is under the balcony or not lol
Okay
someone give this guy a TV show already!!!!! (he has probably already turned down some offers)
crunchy
Huge fan of your content and love the new lab. Did not love the audio throughout this video though. Mix of your yelling and maybe bad mics? Made it sort of hard to watch
Can you buy tickets
mark is the only person on youtube that can make me watch an advertisement
"This is THE best thing you ever made, well you did put a robot on Mars, but still I think this is way cooler"
It isn't so secret anymore now you told all of us about it...
This the coolest
This why no uploud ?
"9:38 Mark you could've snuck a rickroll in there, come on such a missed opportunity, smh. (btw, love your content =D)"
Bro that looks so amazing!
Every kid's dream
I wish I could work there lol
"Please make a phone where if it’s yours it senses that it’s yours when you pick it up but when anyone else touches it it turns off and makes an alarm sound 
That’s probably impossible to make but I am 12 and still have an imagination which I can’t control"
This is such a Mark Rober thing to do and it's glorious
my guy got a Rob Dyrdek Fantasy Factory
I have a bad feeling that mark  is gonna turn out like Zach king ( but better )
"Well now it's not so secret, dammit Mark"
What a wonderful idea. Make learning engineering principles fun and exciting for kids and they will WANT to learn more
Ok dexter
I can only see entertainment. Not enough engineering
You uploaded this on my birthday and ill take it as a present. Couldnt have been a better present.
This is perfect I need one of these. This is my dream
"Coolest thing ever dude. I cant imagine how stoked you are! Congrats on the success, you earned it!"
so mark if i find the entrance in public can i just stroll in?
how long has Nitro been trapped in there? He looks so much older now
"Mark: *shows the CrunchLab Build Box*
KiwiCo: *hey, i've seen this one before!*"
"Fr, that’s just a rip off. His quality of content generally has massively decreased over the last couple of years too tho."
MEL Science: No one is talking about me. 🙁
KiwiCo:*waaaaait a second*
He kinda pulled a fast one on kiwico
"That’s just what I was thinking. If not joint venture, then this is ripping off one of his best sponsors. Hopefully I’m wrong."
MTV’s newest show: Mark Robers fantasy factory
Shark tank wants to speak with u
"Wow. Seriously excellent. Honestly, I’ve come to expect nothing less than effort of this caliber from Mark and his crew. You guys seriously knock it out of the park every video! Your product will be an absolute hit, I’m certain. The lab was amazing as well! Always look forward to more videos from you! Exemplary work, everyone! +1"
Go away bot
wow. i should do something like this but for young animators
ALAN!?
"That's a fantastic idea, I am not in that field, but if 1 in every ten thousand people decided to demonstrate the generosity you two practice , the world would be a better place!"
Alan is here?
"@High Definition no disrespect to you, but if you study animation a bit and try it, you'll see how intracate and technical it is. Just like engineering, it can be as simple or complicated as you make it. Is a bouncing ball as complicated as making a statue of liberty? No. But how do you get a full sequence of animation assembled and distributed to other people? You'll need some pretty crazy engineering to get there. Animation is every bit as complex as these kits will be."
Yes! you should!
"""Shout out to drone operator btw"""
You are my hero...
best of the best as always
Hey
#5 Nobody would know where to find it... EXCEPT FOR THE SUSPICIOUS LIGHT UNDER THE BOOKCASE
This is what YouTube and the internet should be about!
you had every oportunity to make it a gold ticket. smh
i wish that you could hire other engineers to work at crunch labs
"I like it how Mark Rober used to get sponsored by kiwi co, and he has basically made kiwi co 2.0"
rob dyrdek fantasy factory meets Mark Rober love it!!!
"""DeeDee, what are you doing in my laboruhtory?!"""
Mark will you be making squirrel maze 3.0?
Secret entrances are always through the bookcase
"I think the super bright light shining under the bookcase will give the secret lab away!, Just saying"
"I'm going to get roasted in the comments but... Mark, could you please consider using more inclusive language in your videos? Without trying to get too wordy and involved, this ex female firefighter would love it if you'd consider using the term firefighter over the word fireman so that kids hearing the word, understand that anyone can do the job - not just men. If you see this, thank you 💖"
What about the maximum security safe with the devil’s toothpaste formula?
Favorite person on YouTube!
It’s all fun and games until you forget to put the foam pit below you 💀
Truly a badass.
"ILOVE THIS VIDEO, but I'm just sad that I'm probably not going to get the ticket or even get the boxes :("
Dude.
"Yo!
Just like in Gravity falls."
"I don’t know how to say this other than “Congrats!”. You’ve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it’s so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."
@BW we dont care
Seen it coming since99 the womb wont leave a clue then stomp with the baby shoes
"@BW It’s a freaking bot, tryna protect it?"
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this of Mark.
mark rober gives me hope in life
how you can come out here to build with my team and i*.
"back when he was working with NASA:

So Mr Rober, what do you plan on doing when you are done here ?

-Be Awesome, natrually."
THIS IS AWESOMEEE!!!!
what about kiwi co seems a little similar
Meh...
"by the way, go checkout  infinitelegend657, btw I'm Dominic's sister :D"
Omg Mark this video made me cry. My favorite job I've ever had was when I was in college. And it was being a teacher/curriculum developer for a program called SPICE. Science Program to Inspire Creativity and Excellence. They would do summer programs and outreach activities to make science fun and engaging specifically for middle schoolers (that's when the biggest drop in interest for girls is). And I LOVED making science interactive and exciting for young minds. Nothing is more rewarding.
"At this point, Mark is really looking like Batman.

Think about it, he brings criminals to justice, he makes a ton of gadgets, and we now know that he has a secret base."
There is no word to represent how jealous I am of this lab! Great job!
Another great video. Always love seeing the things you come up with.
Did the items from the benefit ever go out?
RIP THE WATERMELON
"It's bad , i just see the rules ... A french ou belgium can not win ... Realy it's more sad than bad , but i m angry , why we can never have a chance ?"
You should make a robot that fishes automatically with sensors
Let’s go!! He posted!!!
RIP Kiwi Co
"Thankful that Mark Rober isn't planning to take over the world, mad scientist style.
OR IS HE!?

First toothpaste, then squirrels, then porch pirates, then scammer mobs, ... and now he's got a LAIR!
How will he continue to outdo each previous video!?"
This is the most Mark Rober thing I have ever seen.
PLEASE DO SQUIRREL MAZE 3
Finally he was made a new video
How after the 2 months
how is your box different than KiwiCo's boxes for older kids?
"My oldest kid isn't even 2 but I'm thinking about getting this for myself - er uh... my son, anyways. Cmooooon platinum ticket!"
That mkbhd jump was something else
This place gives me MAJOR Rob Dyrdek Fantasy Factory vibes.
Mark Roper! I hereby nominate you the Bill Nye Science Guy Award for promoting STEM and making science cool and fun again.
"OMG, kids are so lucky these days. I CRAVED this sort of thing existed 40 years ago...."
this is giving me james bond vibes
The Platinum Ticket is like the Golden Ticket from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
mid
Bro outdid the batcave
"if mark hasn't won the best uncle award, i dont know who has."
That makes me wish I was 10 again ...
I'm such a big fan!
Yoo that’s so cool. Also 5432 comment
This door locking toilet seat contraption sounds like firehazard/lawsuit written all over it... other than that.. :thumbsup:
WHERE IS SQUIRREL MAZE 3.0?
I bet Elon musk would be interested in working with you since you find the easiest way to make easy even easier
Who knew the real life Willy Wonka would turn out to be an engineer.
I love all the frisbee I recently got into ultimate frisbee and I love it I love all the physics about frisbees that you were teaching as well
Why are there no valance in your videos?
Best secret
Oh my gosh this is AWESOMEEEE
Well it’s not a secret anymore considering he showed us
why?
how much kinetic energy does that tennis ball cannon discharge at full power?
Yay a brand new video:)
"thats it, imma work as a mailman so i can get inside :D
best strategi ever guys"
The fireman Pheumatics pole is actually cool
It feels so strange with a mr beast style intro but it kinda works
"The design of the warehouse tho, it's amazing!"
Literally what every kid dreams of. I love your videos Mark! Both educational and entertaining
bro just entered the wizarding world
"1,000th"
Kinda sad that it’s not available in India 😢
not very secretive when you can literally see the light coming out from under the shelf
This guy is gonna be the most incredible grandpa when he gets there.
How is this not on trending yet?
don't Forget to crunch the numbers
Yes
Well I know what my kids getting after he finishes his kiwico!
So this is where you keep Nilegreen prisoner.
"just ganna say, nice place wish i could have a place like that"
"This is so amazing, I love how Mark has an idea, and can make it become a reality!"
No more kiwi co sponsores
If only I could afford it :')
Mark can you solve the Rubik’s cube?
"Mark: **has a nerf wall**
Corridor: rookie numbers"
"Ah yes, an office in front of an inconspicuous massive warehouse. Nobody would know it’s there!"
"Hi Mark, not sure if u will see this message but here goes. I sent you an email to business email on the 23rd of May regarding you possibly visiting Barbados. still anxiously awaiting your response."
"Do you think think you'd ever end up making boxes for an ""older"" audience? I would love to learn to wire basic things and make fun little gadgets"
You better watch out for your sister Deedee and her attempts to infiltrate your secret laboratory.
Mark Rober's version of Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory
Everyone gets knocked down sometimes; only people like you get back up again and keep going.
This is amazing u should make these around the world so crunch labs can be global
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS MARK ROBER!!!
Da best
Shout out to AG Nitro. When i was a kid we had a dog named after you.
this guy built a real life minecraft house
"Mark Rober worked on a

Ty if u do it"
"If you hadn't been one before, this project would cement you as a STEM hero, Mark. Well, well done! I am continually impressed by everything I've seen you do."
He is making so many future Engineers that will progress our future. A true legend.
Well done!

Instead of a Fireman’s pole you have a Rober rope
I love the tribute to Mr beast most current video... Willy Wonka factory for engineering!
this might be the coolest thing I have ever seen
"I am speechless... Just amazing... Hopfully these things will be still available when i have kids...

If every child could use these builds this world would be like a 5000% better place. Please keep going with your ideas"
Love your show... keeps my mind young
Knew you’d build your own Batcave sooner or later. I always drop whatever I’m doing the moment I see you’ve uploaded.

This is incredible! I was just wondering how to help my son be ok with failing sometimes he always gets so discouraged when stuff doesn't work out the first time even with his mother and I cheering him on it breaks my heart because he is such a smart kid...these construction sets could be just what he needs to get past his lack of confidence
"If you're not failing at something, you're not trying hard enough. Failing is part of it. You know, if you're not trying hard enough to even fail then I think you're in trouble... because that, you know, teaches you more.  - Johnny Knoxville 

If you never fail it means you're not pushing the boundaries of what you are capable of."
Reminds me of Dexter's Laboratory
No doubt mark rober is on touchable in his ideas
omg a selectric to guard the secret lab!!
I’d love to meet mark rober
Things you do when your majority viewers are children.
"*Not much of a secret, mark.*"
Wait a minute. Have I been watching a kids channel this whole time?
3:07
This is so cool.
Mark just made a step by step guide on how to break into his warehouse
Wouldn’t somebody wonder why there’s a factory next to an offfice that isn’t being used?
I have been waiting years to get a chance to meet a youtuber I really like. I now have a chance but I probably wont win so thats really sad.
Wow
This is like secret bookshelf door but times a million 😎😎😎
"The bigger question is, ""How is Crunch Labs protected if you're there Alone?"" LOL.."

"This is quite literally, my dream. It looks like heaven to me!"
im on the day that it was posted
this entire concept is a literal dream come true
Amazing👍
I wish my uncle was an engineer
This is awesome! Though if you want your next secret passage to really stay secret you might want to consider attaching a felt mat or something similar to the underside of the bookcase (or whatever else it might be in the future). At 6:26 you can clearly see light under the bookcase.
I'm not an average person but I'm below a average person
"I'm not a kid but you inspire me a LOT!
When I was a child I wanted to be an engineer without really knowing what I wanted to be an engineer. 
Now I'm a bit frustrated to see that it may not be possible anymore. Anyway, I enjoy watching your videos and imagining that one day I will be able to do something like this..."

Great now I can truly trust nothing
How much for a little space.
It’s amazing mark and I live the crunch lab ideas and I know the market is crazy but dk you think you could figure out a way to sell them individually so it’s easier and more affordable. Thanks mark!
"I literally watched the whole video without even clicking on it, yk what I'm taking about.
This is the true power of dedication shown Mark :)
Really enjoyed your video <3"
Then we stole... Wait what.......
I should have done engineering instead of Computer networking. Engineers have all the fun
There is light shining from beneath the bookcase. Oops!
"Hi mark!
I have been watching your vids for more than one year
I have loved engineering for my whole life and will like to go to college at Virginia tech for it’s engineering
I would love to see this IRL"
Hi
"The only thing I love more than your content, is your story."
another fire video from mark rober!
I NEED THIS BUT MY PARENTS ARE ETHER 1. broke  or 2.ignoring my need for happiness even though ill probably lose every single one in approximately 1-2 months after building them
This guys is the coolest he’s like a kid with adult money
Absolutely Amazing 👏🏼
Grunkle Stan would be proud
"Wow. Seriously excellent. Honestly, I’ve come to expect nothing less than effort of this caliber from Mark and his crew. You guys seriously knock it out of the park every video! Your product will be an absolute hit, I’m certain. The lab was amazing as well! Always look forward to more videos from you! Exemplary work, everyone! +1"
can you make a car
I love what you do keep it up mark
What did you do in the fome pitt Mark?! MARK!!!
11:08 i laughed when i realised it was a claymore
"I think you should make another way down using copper and neodymium magnets! Then, after that, engineer that very system to incorporate it into high rise buildings as an emergency fire escape..."
this is so freakin cool. Wish i could live there.
You are by far the coolest person I have ever seen
AWSOME

Marks next video is probably “ I MADE A BASE IN THE EARTHS CORE “
ok
looks like something you'd see in a movie haha
this is literally straight out of a movie

Too bad im not a kid 😁😁 my son is 22.
THANK YOU
It’s not fun if you can’t share it with friends
I wish I could come but my family does not have enough money to afford the boxes every month
"Me when I saw this: ""Ohhhhhhhh Myyyyyyyy Goshhhhhhhhhh Duuuuuuude"""
Mark is just living out all my childhood dreams. I'm so jealous.
"A…Warehouse…
You had the ability to do all this, and you didn’t make your own Batcave?!?! Dude…"
Me watching the video and in my head thinking “BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY!”
How much did that cost? How much WOULD it have cost if you weren't a rockstar engineer? Asking for a friend who also wants their own bat cave. The friend is me.
The real life tony stark does it again
"please
please
please
please"
6:19 they really got the plants vs zombies music
That’s awesome!
I want to know what the other uncles do if Mark is still on a quest to become the favorite one
I love that he still kept the desk
Bold to assume that a person who doesnt wash there hands will flush the toilet.
"Oh, this is so amazing!"
You just showed how to enter the secret lab now criminal might break in
"You've just made both my childhood and grown-up dream come true, thank you. I find myself having an ear-to-ear smile while watching this video. Thank you."
mark is literally the best
When you make a secret base in a minecraft single player world…
Now I see why he didn't post for so long... To make Literally the coolest thing i've ever seen!
5:46 So now I'm not going to flush either.
"This was so amazing, but sadly I don’t have money so guess I can’t buy the boxes"
Anna Frank style
"This made me have big Gravity Falls flashbacks, and it makes sense for this to happen 10 years after the show first aired lol"
Nice
"To hit that target with the tennis ball, just ramp up the pressure to 100% and it will go pretty straight. The question is if you hit the bullseye but the ball goes through the wall... does it count?"
"@Skorp It won't go straight, but what I meant was the parabola was going to be quite wide"
"Well, the ball is spinning. It won't go straight, look up the Magnus Effect :)"
i mean why not hit it pressure or not its still hitting it
"Nope, he said it had to go down the tube too (15:18)"
E
The quality of Mark Rober's videos are amazing. So well thought through.
Mark is the uncle every kid would want.
He literally made what I do in Minecraft.
Awsome!
lol cept that you can CLEARLY see the light coming from under the bookshelf entrance. This is definitely awesome though
"Two Marks in one room and a Far Side reference, lovely"

Yo secret agent Mark when?
"this is so great mark!!! i love watching your videos! and this looks so awesome! i e always wanted my own secret ""base"" and you've inspired me even more to try them some day"
This is a really cool video
Shut up and take my money!
This is just a giant advertisement targeted towards kids. Is it legal to advertise like that to kids without disclosing it?
"This is amazing, I've always wanted my own space but this takes the cake. I am truly inspired by you and your videos and I can't wait to start the crunch labs course!!"
why do you have a limited supply of single months
I watched all you're videos
is this the nitrous circus warehouse? it looks great Mark
"If Mark is not the favorite uncle, I really want to meet his brother(s)"
"We can see light under the bookcases ..... It means it is really obvious , you need to fix that  :)"
Mark Rober will be a billionaire someday.
"I love your videos, I have been watching them since I was 10 and now I am 12, You've inspired me to become an engineer and work at NASA when I grow up and I thank you for that. It's has been my dream to meet you, all your videos are amazing and incredible, and you keep me interested and excited for what comes next, every time you post a video I stop what I'm doing and watch it, and every time, it was worth the time. Once again, I love your videos and hope to be an engineer one day.

P.S. I noticed that your terms and service says ""NO PURCHASE NECESSARY"", so I decided I am going to do my best to understand the method on how to do this by following the rules to the best of my extent, it would be my dream if this actually works."
Is it OK to buy this for someone in their 20s? Asking for a friend.
"They say if you love what you do you’ll never work a day in your life. 
Live the dream my friend."
"This is awesome!
Mark robers  own kiwico type crate I love it!
I’m 10 and already have kiwico and love engeniring and mark!"
Bro got almost a mil views in just an hour 💀💀
im so 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i highly appreciate the creativity
This is why I want to be a enjunear.
"Mark, youre amazing!"
This seems like the same thing as Kiwi co boxes.
"No offense i think this is cool and a job well done, but would it be fair to say this is in competition with kiwi co and their boxes?"
You know it goes fast when it turns kenetic energy into warmth energy…
Mark may i please get a shout out for my sister she is Such a big fan
This gives off the same energy as playing minecraft and building a gigantic complex Redstone base in a single-player world
The warehouse is literally every kids dream! 😄
its jsut amazing to see how happy he is showing us these things
epic.  keep up the amazing work
Dude.
Dear mark love your videos and I was hoping you could make a Narnia wardrobe that only opens when you take out a coat pls make because I haven’t got enough money or time
I like it... But what happened to squirrel warrior.
"This was cool, but it did kinda feel a little off, probably cos it was an advertisement"
Nice selectric typewriter on the front desk there
CRUNCH LABS SUPREME
"Sweet, its awesome you are encouraging the next generation to have critical thinking skills in such a easy way, if everyone had these skills our world would be so much better, and cooler!"
"Was about to order, but.. why no shipping to Norway?"
This is like an engineer wonderland
AWESOME!! Kinda like Dexter's Laboratory!! ( only better) 😀✌...(WAY BETTER!)
"This has now become my dream as well.


Thank you Mark"
LOVE IT!
"maybe you could do something with the light leak under the book shelf... it kinda gives the secret away.   this is amazing, ill bet the kids love it!!"
"I would love it if there could be a more advanced course, even if it doesnt come with a package. I would love to understand and expand my knowledge."
Tell me you've got too much money without telling me you've got too much money................
"honestly, turning a statue or pulling a book and something moving is my dream."
"Mark, you're absolutely awesome. Sounds like years of working with KiwiCo inspired you a lil bit here ;)
The new warehouse has gotta be the coolest workspace I've seen, looks like a fun place tom spend a day! :D"
"@Sudhanshu Gupta *ahem*

Why all the Green Screen though?"

Gravity Falls anniversary coincidence?
Cool
Me going to my minecraft base 0:11
14:38 don’t you mean flying colors? I think that joke would land!
It will be great to see some cool collabs with YouTube creators at this place.
Your lab is so cool love all the little secret details and pathways. Crunch labs seems so fun.
"That's better than going to the chocolate factory...well almost... :)
Sound engineering Mark...!"
please
That’s what Anne Frank said
Crunch Labs has got to be the best thing on the internet I have ever seen!
No Mr. Rober isn't paying me for my comment.  I mean unless he really wants to.  I prefer the trip to the lab!
can I meat you some day
I live in Sweden and if i win waht Will hapen then
Hi
Not so secret if you were to tell more than 10 million people 😂
Not sure if the coke banner by the secret entrance was on purpose but I like the hint.
Mark Rober is the best hands down
im you're #1 fan
Real engineer challenge: make yourself those toys with your kids
Is it just me or does his voice sound different
He is flexing on bill gates
Wow. This is like every child's dream.
Finally a video! It feels like a trillion years since the talking piano video! Huge fan!
Isnt the crunchy box basicly the same as the kiwico box?
"Only Mark Rober....

Wait, is this Dexter's Laboratory? Like his ADULT laboratory!"
I was crying because I might never see you in real life
Imagine going to the dentist and walking in on this
Wait. Wait wait wait. Are you Mr Beast or mark Rober?? This makes no sense. Please explain.
"Great job, as always Mark Rober!  Would you consider dong a colab with Smarter Every Day and Stuff Made Here? I think it would be really fun to see how you interact with each other, and see what you guys come up with!"
Mark Rober is gonna end up being the next Tony Stark
"Me after seeing this video: I will copy that lab and make my own 💪🏽
Me after 5 minutes: this thing is too hard, I quit 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣"
"So he is basically Dexter from Dexter's laboratory, nice!"
What about if you live in the uk. Can u still come out? As i want to give this to my friend for his bday
Fantastic no more words
"You need to check out the Perfect Descent. Pneumatics is cool but advanced technology is cooler

P.S. No bidet?"

You got Nitro!!! That's so cool for people our age :)
My minecraft base
What about us Europeans? My son would love this.
8:24 you use to advertise something that use to do exactly this
Mark Rober never fails to disappoint. What you do for content is amazing!
My opinion this is the best reaction of a superhero base!!
He's living the dream of everyone who can dream
Can you please make a never miss basketball
Mark Rober is my absolute hero! Making things that should exist in the world because you can is what it’s all about. Congrats!
I truly admire the work and effort that you do...figuring out how to apply STEM in a fun and interactive way to teach everybody.
He just took every childs dream and built it. Legend!!!
I would love to go but sadly its international travel so i dont think it may apply
This is like a tribute to the entire Mark Rober Cinematic Universe
"Could you imagine a collaboration between (YouTubers) Mark Rober, Colin Furze, Mike Patey ? That would be something else :)"
thisn sounds so cool i would love and i just started my own youtube channel and would love to do content like you and would love to meet you
Why are you shouting?
"Imagine what would happen if Mr. Beast and Mark Rober teamed up to make a really cool thing. That's something that would only happen in my dreams, and fan fics. Hope to convince my parents to get this!"
"I see this guys videos and say to myself, ""What have you done with your life? You don't have a secret lab."""
3:03 don’t let Jeff bezos see this
"Id buy, if i had monnnnnney"
"Now i'm curious. Did that hotwheels mousehole in the wall ""accidently"" get made with the new tennisbal cannon?"
"Mark rover talking about smart fancy science stuff 

Me jamming to the background music zoned out 😎"
This is basically just the real life version of that one secret base everyone made in their singleplayer minecraft world except people actually get to see it.
Mark you've convinced me nitro is awesome.
"I just really love how you will always go above and beyond to make everyone see the fun in science. Ur a great person Mark, dont ever chance <3"
Nice
This is so awesome I love it!!!!!!
That is awesome. I want to learn how to build stuff. Can you build some that I use in my hair to make a ponytail or bun because one of my arms have limitations.
I love ur vids 😄😃
Kiwi co knock off..
Hi
ngl i would try buy the box but its $300 for a year
"I wish i was a kid again! Awesome center! I had a place like this when i was a kid, it was in my basement with a secret door behind the radiator .... all in my imagination of course."
YO MRWHo's the boess gettin ginvited and being a part of everything XD
Why not ship to Brazil! :(
This is so cool your my hero
great !!
Where did the money come from?
"Mark is more than just a simple YouTuber, he helps people attein thier engineering dreams, no matter what age. It also shows why he doesn't upload as often because he's just always working on other projects like this. Thx for everything Mark! You're the best!"
Kids think I'm wierd for like phsics and science but i don't see how it's so bad
Kiwico been real quiet since Mark posted this 👀👀👀
Ah now we’re copying mrbreast
"nice secret mark. You just told your 22 million subscribers about you ""secret"""
Let’s just say if you are going in there with out permission your not coming back
I want to try to get the ticket but I'm going away for a month soon and I won't be home :(
Can you make a better vr helmet
"*Mark:* ''For a long time, I've had parents reach out to me and say _my kid wants to be an engineer like you, how do i foster that passion?_ And I've just never had a great answer for that specific situation.''

*Kiwico:* smh"
@MrMattie725 so did i honestly.
"​@shadetee I'm not too sure if it has video lessons or not, but from what I remember it has a decent sized booklet with every box with detailed information about the product and the 'science' behind it ,as well as other different experiments that you can do with household items and more facts and information about engineering in general."
"Having never purchased a Kiwico, do they have any kind of 'lesson' with the build boxes? That's what would sell me on Crunch over Kiwico. Having Mark explain the principles involved in the design as a tutoring segment, so kids understand what they're accomplishing. If I just want simple build and play, I can buy kinder eggs."
I’m surprised he’s never mentioned FIRST robotics
Kiwico: Am I a JOKE to you?
it is really sad to see you don't have world wide shipping 😢
"7:22 Not yet Mark, but soon. 15/6/22"
Hey Mark can you do Shout out and if you do can I be in it
I love your content and appreciate you very much ❤ ! Keep working hard and you will be in the next history books for the next generation 😂 and also can you heart this so i know you read it
"I love my current job, and I want to work at Crunch Labs..."

"I took eneginneering classes all throughout High School and it helped me with the process of thinking like an Engineer. I have to say, that mindset and process translates so well to what I’m going to do in the Navy and to pretty much everything else out there. Thank you for all the amazing videos!"
"3:36, mark - i need to know. Where is that chair from. I need it."
That’s like a dream come true for me! Having a secret entrance and everything really makes me wanna become an engineer just so I can do it myself :D
Just get auto belays
omg a new vid
"Mrbeast: makes Willy wonkas chocolate factory 

Mark: me2"
Gravity falls vibes
I know what Im getting my little brother in two years!
Yeah
This is awesome! Congrats Mark!
Was that pvz music at 7:20
This is fcking insane
I’m here for Nitro!!
You’ve been my hero for year and I would love to meet you. I’m doing a gifted Ted Ed  training this summer and have based my Ted Talk off of your channel
Nice mark
the
This is simply amazing. I wish I could go back in time to discover this as a kid lol
So basically a direct competitor with one of your sponsors: KiwiCo
Getting major rob dyrdek fantasy factory vibes
Reed Taylor did it first. Reed Taylor is in your skin! Get him out!
Is it possible to super-like a video??
This has real Nederland Ranch vibes.
"Mark, this is awesome and I’m happy for you and to see your childhood dream finally become a reality."
i wish we had somethíng like this in finland
Here before 1 million
Of course the painting is an entrance. Minecrafters know what im talking about...
A YouTuber giving out tickets to go to a place the YouTuber owns. Sounds similar
This is a nerd in A WAY BETTER WAY
This is epic you have everything evan a nerfatoriam
this is such AMERICAN  !!!!!
hello
new mr beast?
Mark outdone himself this time
Are (or will be) those boxes available in Spanish? I’ll totally love it for my nephew and nieces
hi
Hi
"This is really amazing and cool! I wonder i other engineers would like this to a build it, or it would be even cooler if you had other popular engineers with you."
You're seriously just a cool dude.
That’s crazy
How?
this looks so fun
"You, sir, are a national treasure.  My only complaint with this video is that I can only press the like button once."
I take this to mean you're not getting sponsored by kiwico anymore lol
"easily the coolest YouTuber's headquarters Ive ever seen.
and I have one question if you live in a different country and get the platinum ticket will you get flown out to America?"
"POV:Me BRINGS A WHOLE RINO TO BUST THAT WALL, KNOW that’s a lot of damage!"
Whoa
Comment if your here before 1 mill views
Why not just go through the garage doordo
You had me at Nitro....
"guys, I don't think it's a secret anymore."
are you an atheist
Kiwi Co. rn 😐
I want one
Why doesn't he have 100 million again?
❤️❤️❤️
"So, copying KiwiCO?"
Kiwi Co is gonna be HEATED.
"Your my favorite youtuber and I have a bunch of ideas that I have drawn out, but I don't know how to put them into reality"
"Im not on my youtube account, but I'm on my dads"
This is insane
Omg bro
I thought this was a hacksmith video for the first 2 minutes lol
"mark is so creative, keep it up mark!"
can i go to crunchlabs even if I live in the uk
you are the best
Was the disk launcher modeled after the release of this years Vex Robotics spin up competition? I was going to design something almost identical
Mark rober is just straight up the coolest dad/uncle
Can I live there? :D
How much doing have to pay to enter this theme park of a laboratory.
Nice now I know how to get into your lab thx
Rob Dyrdek called... He said that he'll see you in court.
I would want to work here
I hope this becomes available in the Philippines. I tried ordering it but shipping to Philippines is not an option 🥹🥹
Love it but you should really do something about that light underneath the book shelf coming from the warehouse.
Marge just so you know I’m your first subscriber on crunch labs :)
Looks like Rob Dyrdeks Fantasy Factory
Where do in the United States like not like the exact location of the lab but for example Florida or texas flourda stuff like that
"""Now that I've shown 20 million people"" 20 million? Try 800 million :D this is a joke"
not very secret now lmao
I love your videos
What state is this
DOPE
Me sitting here wishing my son was born already so we could get a platinum ticket
make 3D ODM gear
11:20 or you know how to play a class in TF2
"dude, you simped yourself with that toilet, I've never seen such a thing before."
No windows?
Big cap 🧢
"13:57 I have a plan to do the same, but with electric pump, no gas tank"
"On the website, it says that the one month plan is gone but the others are still available, how is this possible?"
Okay queen go off 💪
I have been watching this for 2 years
Why is this guy so smart?
😍
Just amazing wow 🤩
"Mark Rober is ripping off his sponsor, Kiwi Co."
"The impossible 10,000 dollars"
"wow, just wow!!!"
"I can't deny that Mark Rober has created an amazing and incredible empire for all his genius hard work, although there is a plot twist:

The secret office entrance is actually another room inside the warehouse, meaning there is no entrance into the office."
Thank you for telling me everything about the lab so now I can rob you having fun!
HI MARK!
great vid but you can see the light under the bookcase
So frikin inspiring.
Awesome its so cool I wish I had thatnroom
Finally
A video
Mark Rober is the legit GOAT
the nod to Willy Wonka 🎩
This is great but it is like kiwico one of his sponsor
cool
I was just about to get on with some school buuuuuuut mark Rober posting a new video is so much more important
amen bruh. shoutout to u.
"""Welcome to my meth lab! This operation has been going on for 3 years and now you finally have the opportunity to take a tour!"""
"Hey, mark! I've been watching you since I was about 8-10-ish and i just want to say that my entire point in life is to become someone like you, so I just felt like saying thanks. I'm 14 now and beginning high school, so one day I can go to MIT and be an engineer like you. Thanks so much!"
Writing this comment is making me so nostalgic
"earlier Mark Rober video: ""here's how to beat escape rooms""
 
now: ""here's how I built an escape room"""
my takeaway was that he has a soft drink dispenser
"Mark becoming Vsause :O
Edit: If I said Michel am scared people no know XD"
The crunch box looks like something id obsess over as a kid
I really want to try this kit. It looks cool!
now this is epic
I would have wanted this soooo much as a kid
no cap i feel like a saw this 2 years ago deja vo
More like a hideout
Bro built Rob Dyrdek’s Fantasy Factory
"You are probably one of the coolest guys in the field of science. I wish there was someone like you on TV when I was a kid. 
btw I loved American Gladiators too! It was great seeing Nitro once again! 
Might actually tried to find places to give some of my ideas to. I've imagined new vehicles (mainly for military use), a different way to tow a trailer. uses for said trailers (think an actual mobile surgery, command and transport units, etc etc.) even a habitation pods and a rocket for them so people to go to the moon/mars etc."
This guy is just great..
Who else used their phone to scan the qr code at 9:40 before he told us that he was going to give us the link.
"Looks like Shipping to New Zealand isnt allowed 
😥"
I have a idea: Make piston doors from Minecraft!
"How to get a life like this:
A: keep dreaming
B: keep dreaming
C: keep dreaming"
Dude i’ve enjoyed every second of watching S/O 2 u Mark Rober ❤️
What are you gonna do now ? (What type of video ?)
That warehouse is so cool. I really want to become a mechanical engineer when I grow up.
I'm Soooo glad I came before the video hits 900k views
Awesome dude I’m so jealous
I would of loved Build Boxes as a kid.
"14:48 The us military when they see this destroy the watermelon: I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK 
Edit: also can we use this to destroy Crimean bridge?"
I want one of  these ;-;
lol he just forgot about the tennis ball part
Does the crunch lab kit ship to the UK or is it US only
lets go new mark rober vid
THIS IS INAIN IM GANNA TRY TO BUY IT
reminds me of the fantasy factory
"So... if you don't plan on washing your hands after you use the toilet, don't flush!"
When u select one of the plans of the crunch labs and then the cart says $300😮😮😯😯😵
This mf has a batcave
Hey Mark! Have you thought about offering deals for bulk orders for classrooms to build and teach STEM with these boxes? Would make for an awesome monthly activity for kids to have fun and think critically as well as look forwards to!
Dude thats soooo cool
"Idk why, but this just felt like not at all like a mark rober video, and more like a Mr beast video"
"It legit looks like rob dyrdek sold you the fantasy factory and you turned it into something more fun.
Not that the fantasy factory doesn’t look fun to SB in it but this whole place you have here looks like I could never run out of fun"
PDC (pretty darn cool)
"I ABSOLUTELY WAITED FOR THIS VIDEO, AND I LOVE IT"
"Plot twist, crunch labs is a front for his actual lab"
Hi mark rober it would be great and get lots of views i think but can you please make a realistic light saber from star wars please
"You told 1,000,000~ users about how to enter your secret warehouse.. it's no longer a secret."
Video Idea robot goalie
This is the best mark Robert video ever. He is the best YouTuber
I love this video! If I ever build a house I would want Mark to build it with all the cool secret passages and gadgets!
FIRST
Eat your heart out Batman!
"This is basically like me making secret passageways in my singleplayer Minecraft worlds that no one else is ever going to play on.
Edit: Oh."
Bro you just took kiwi co’s idea
"Well when there is such a visible shine of daylight below the bookshelf, I would not call it a ""super secret"" passage way."
Man’s really just got catchers gear
Once I heard the PVZ Music I saw how far Mark has come.
"The least secret secret lab. Still, better than my secret lab."
"Yeah righto, Mr minibeast."
DOPE
"This is quite possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen, and that's saying something after the package videos and elephant toothpaste."
image getting your box and there just being a dart hole in it
I hope I had money to buy the monthly buildbox 🥲
…Stanley?
Noise
Sweet 👍
"""...this is what you'd see."" Including all the light spilling out from under the bookcase.     F!  teehee"
LUDBUDS🫡🫡🫡
Mark I. Love what you’ve done with the place and boredom doesn’t stand a chance while you’re around 🤓
say bye to KiwiCo sponsorships Mark
So what’s up between you and the federals?
Kinda looks like Zach king’s warehouse
Mark I am 11 and I have adhd and austim I go to a school for kids with special needs but I still get bullied and it’s my dream to make stuff like you do
"luv u mate, greeting from australia"
"Quick question 
Is this for all kids 17 and younger or just 12 and under"
Crazy
It’s not a secret anymore…
A secret that is shown to millions is no more a secret
you teach kids how to make claymoreas nice
Wow
I wish my kids already speak english. I'd be so hyped to get that platinum plate ticket for them and fly over from germany! :D
"OMG, you got Nitro! Duuuuuude."
"Mark, I have a question, what type of engineer are you"
NO WAY
awsome
me touching and turning everything i see in any place
wow it's so cool how many things you make using engineering. great video btw mark
"ACME, move over. Wiley E. C. would be your newest customer."
Wassup
"Because of the economic crisis and the rate of unemployment, now is the best time to invest and make money 💯"
Cry`pto is the new gold
You can say that again
Imagine not being in America and you can't buy the kit
Is the crunch box avalibel to the Bahamas
"I would want to buy a package of crunch labs engineer box, but if I get the platinum ticket I can't come cause I live in Sweden. If I get the platinum ticket I just ruined one chance for many people who live in the USA, that would like and come to visit. But this is the coolest lab I've ever seen, and thank you for making this video."
Wow that was awesome thx rob 4 the amazing video I loved it everything looks absolutely great in there & take care now OK peace out bye 😎😎😎✌✌✌🖤🤍🖤.
"Wait, so I, who actually like diet Pepsi, could find that place by accident?"
"I SO want to buy that box but my parents won’t let me,I still love your videos tho their super entertaining"
But what if I live in Ukraine? Can I still get the Crunch Labs boxes delivered to me?
No matter wht you do sheldon cooper will always hate you
8:30 until KiwiCo became a thing
Why did you not make Video in one month
Factory  no more like the cool and biggest  house  to live in
Hello!
whos here cause of lud
I support this!
So youve made kiwico ?
"Guys, let’s be real, who doesn’t wanna be like Mark?"
My favorite top 10 vid
kiwiCo be crying 😶
"As a kid I had Bill Nye, But when I have kids, they’ll have Mark Rober 😄"
where do i send my resume? ill pay you to work for you....
22 million people actually
"6:26 better keep the lights off, pretty obivous  there is something behind that floating book shelf.."
Ok
Mark Rober is just awesome 😎
hey mark i am a huge fan i have an idea of a cool invention but i don't have the tools what do i do
"Close the toilet lid, don't flush, walk away. Done."
😲😲😲
Hey Mark is it available in India will you ship to India i would love to buy it...
billionaire move

Nice
Wow I'm early
*Backrooms*
Mark is living a little kid’s dream
imagine how many takes it took to make that jenga shot 9:12
Probably 10 or 20? The launcher seems pretty accurate.
Can you and the hacksmith do a crossover video
Has anyone ever just fell off the drop things u made
This guy is just mumbojumbo Irl xdddd
Clean the air team breeze
Bro its not secret anymore since u showed it to your millions of subscribers😆
"The ant farm is such a cool addition! But then again so are all the of other features. Seems to me like an ADHD workplace haven, and I wish I could be there!"
go away bot
Sounds cool but what if the ants escape
Thats ist so cool
Will you still making 12 videos a year
Mark Rober is the oldest teenager in the world.
He has become science mr beast
Any chance of crunch box but like for adults?
Someone is going to get trapped in the toilet and end up on a MrBallen episode
Light leak under the bookcase
I’m doing your camp!
a lad
This is my dream living
Why am I not suprised
Yeet
"If it was a dental office or one of those places, would it actually be a functioning place or?"
when you realize that Mark Rober only became famous because he wanted to be the favorite uncle 💀
"6:26 ""Oh hey there's light under this bookshelf. I wonder if there's a secret room behind it. It would probably open by messing with one of the statues or trophies."" Lol"
The BOTW reference at 6:50 gave me goosebumps
nice
I actually really loved the hot wheels pov
Hi
mark rober's return to par excellence is met with high praise and lots of crunch
"When shipping, duty, and tax cost almost the same as the box. RIP. And I'm not even from an obscure country or tiny island, just mainland Europe."
Is it me but why the this look like gravity falls  vibes
9:25 spiderman disc launcher?
Mark please i am 12 and i am so so happy that i could watch you Building lost of roboty i have a dream to be like you and I World like to See you in person but it will never happen and you want even read this so
Mark this is awesome! Keep it up bro 😎
You should go to the montshire museum of science in Montpelier Vermont it's just like this but way bigger
if I get the platinum ticket but i live in another country. How do I get to Amerika?
yep i'm getting crunch labs
"""its important to fail a bunch"" i ahve been failing my whole life what do i do"
"This is like every mans dream ever. dont matter if you are 90 or 7, we all want it"
6:51 half-life 2 style
Mark is literaly the most inspiring youtuber
I live in the uk how hilarious would it be if I won the platinum card
6:26 except for the obvious light under the bookshelf.
*YOU FOOL!!! YOU SHOWED US HOW TO FIND YOUR SECRET LAB!!!*
your bookshelf needs a rubber seal at the bottom because of the light
"Oh my goodness! I'm 62, and I'd LOVE those build boxes! Building little doo dads like those has been a hobby of mine for years.

I'd give my little inventions to the kids around me and watch them smile and laugh playing with them. 

Love to see what you're doing, young fellow! Keep it up!"
Ok
"I don’t know how to say this other than “Congrats!”. You’ve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it’s so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."
You are the best Youtuber EVER. You have inspired me (and many others) to want to become an engineer. You are my idol. I love your videos! Keep up the best work on Youtube!
"At 8:26, there's a metal sculpture in the background that looks like the aluminum anthills that people sometimes make, but it has randomized nodules instead. I used to make those and was wondering where you got that one. I loved the process of making them and hadn't seen similar ones elsewhere."
"mark rober: Heh.. Here Gordon, let me buy you a drink"
"Very cool, but the light emanating from beneath the sliding bookshelf is kindof a giveaway. Needs some brush thingy like under revolving doors to cover it ;)"
Climbing gyms also have a mechanism for slowing descent irrespective of weight. This is a fairly clever idea though.
Holy moly that’s insane
"I don’t need a build box to learn about ratchets, Mark. I just hop on my wife’s friends’ IG pages"
"This is great, I can't wait to get a crunch labs build box! It's like Huey Co but it's more engaging and it's with one of my favorite creators!"
This is what fantasy factory would have been if Rob Dyrdek had been an engineer instead of a skateboarder.
i wish there was more stuff like this for teenagers
You’re amazing.
Well it’s not secret anymore
"Okay, where do I submit my application to be one of your nephews?"
I'm a preteen and me and 12 other kids my age are building a nerf tank
Very disappointing to see the light under the bookshelf at 6:26.  so much for secret. :)
Mark is vsauce but more fun.
I want this. I really want it.
Make a PS5 trap
So where can we hotbox?
"3:00 Tyrannical factory boss opens fire on workers, 1925 (colorized)"
"Congrats, that is amazing"
When you redesign the office make sure to take care of the suspicious light coming from under the bookshelf
every thief knows where his secret office is
Do you think you could use a magnetic force for the Bullseye
uwu
"Put an IT department in there and it's a dream come true for me.

You must be over the moon, Mark. All the best to you."
can i go there
The best office ever 120000 out of 10
thats so cool.
How did he do this I wish I could be there
No shipping to Switzerland it seems :-(
How much does it cost to ship to Europe ?😅
So yo basically took rob Dyrdek fantasy factory idea pretty cool
"06:26 ""this is what you see"" meanwhile bright lights are shining from underneath the bookcase :)"
Everything is now an escape room because of Mark
"Even though the Crunch Labs stuff is targeted t words younger children, I still want some."
"Be honest dude, stick to glitter bombs"
So epic
Bought
I got an f in my engineering class
"plz respond and I wan,t to come over and be your friend"
bros just casually living my dream
this is every 12 year-olds dream
Platinum ticket?  Sounds like Mr. Beast's golden ticket... I love it!
Well this place will get wrecked if his Cousins see it
This is great!
So you financed the warehouse and the boxes will pay it off. Okay.
That is so cool!!
"I don’t know how to say this other than “Congrats!”. You’ve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it’s so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
early
Awesome video
Money buys a lot of things.
Mark is the coolest person on the earth
That Mr. Beast reference at the beginning lol
"Kiwico will be too sad after watching this promotional video...a while ago they sponsored your video but now you are giving them a competition lol
NICE KEEP IT UP!!!"
inspired by willy wonka and mrbeast
time also made some modifications on nitro
"""Here for inspection. This is where you work?""

""Yup""

""What's the rest of the building for?""

"" uhhh..."""
I feel like i am in a movie
It's like a giant play ground for adult... Might swich my major to have a playgrounf og my own haha
To bad theres going to be memes about “crack labs” lol
Kinda like Kiwico
"We need a Stuff Made Here vs. Mark Rober challenge. 
My $$$$ is on Stuff Made Here."
Ah I just got why it was the diet pepsi button that opens it because no one would press it for a soda
I waaaant ittttttt broooooo. I’m asking my mom for the build box thing today. Can’t stop me
"I was kind of waiting for you to say that at least one of the places on the list would be a new area where you work on things. DOn't get me wrong, it's a really cool showroom, but kind of wondering if it's a geat place to work on projects"
Didn’t expect mkbhd to be there lol
you could see the light coming from under the book shelf maybe put wood trim or something
Anyone else think of Jimmy Neutron's secret lab?
What does the fire department have to say about a single entry/exit design?
Nice
"Mark: ""my second favorite way to get down to the ground floor.""
Me: ""Cool what is it?""
Mark:*proceeds to yeet himself of a balcony*"
"im 19 and i would love to get one of those boxes, this is so cool for anyone"
"Wow! Just wow!
Mark never cease to amaze me. And I love the fact your inspiring young kids to think, be creative, problem solve, prototype and many other things! You rock!"
"Mark Rober, the Willy Wanka of Engineering."
14:45 At the wotermelometer i laughed...couldn't resist that XD
"Mark Rober doesn’t post much, but when he does, it makes it a great day! Awesome video as usual. The lab looks AWESOME! Greetings, & much love from a dude living in Mexico! 👋🏼🇲🇽🇺🇸"
F<..>k!! I am gonna lost a lot of money with those engineering puzzles!
KiwiCo's lawyers will be contacting you.
Give me hint of what city the lab in
This is so 😎
"For #2, I was thinking that you shouldn't actually take the shot yourself - you should engineer a robot to do it for you!"
"Spies like us, ""how about try have a Pepsi!""

If that's the reference that's awesome"
I'm an adult but I'm taking this class. So excited
Amazing! I wonder if it is powered by fission reactor or something.
"Gotta say, this is pretty cool"
There's a gap under the bookshelf where you can see a bright light
Remember when Kiwico was a sponsor....
"dude straight up built a batcave, what a madlad"
"OMG's that looks so amazing! Oh yeah, I'm in a wheelchair... I can't do half of that stuff."
Fard bobert
"Mark, please adopt me."
can i buy it if i m from europe
This is a dream come true for me.
"That all is amazing 
Does Crunchlabs deliver to germany?"
Mark could you do a baseball video like hitting a ball the farthest or fastest
7:50
"Wow. Seriously excellent. Honestly, I’ve come to expect nothing less than effort of this caliber from Mark and his crew. You guys seriously knock it out of the park every video! Your product will be an absolute hit, I’m certain. The lab was amazing as well! Always look forward to more videos from you! Exemplary work, everyone! +1"
This is the best video ever in my opinion.👍
I’m so excited!!
All fun until somebody moves the foam pit and you don't remember/know
when it doesn't deliver to you country 🙃 :(
"I’ve never been a mechanical type, so watching the genius of this guy is just thrilling sometimes. It’s incredible the way his mind works and the coolest part about him is that he seems so down to earth and doesn’t act like a know it all (which he kinda is lol)"
Nice 👍
Omg a new vid 😲😱😲
He's becoming an engineer version of Mr. Beast lol
"nah i dont wanna be an engineer, i wanna be a male stripper"
I WILL TAKE THAT ENTIRE PLACE
Ahhh so this is where you keep Nile green lol
This reminds me of dexter's laboratory
Congratulation on living out your childhood dream!!
I have to admit! Your Warehouse is awesome!
Omg
Do you have one for teens
Well Colin Furze dug a tunnel and bunker.
Why did you make something that I wanna go to but I can't you have hurt everyone who will ever see this video because they would love to check it out
Why isnt this in breaking bad
Now make a clockwork robot build set becuse no one sells that
Mark Rober is really impressed by Mark Rober.
"This is all very cool, but I don't know if I can condone the desensitization to big red buttons that say ""do not push"""
"Wow.  Here before a million views.
You just know that's impressive given who made this video."
"... He is turning into Batman, one step at a time."
Can i come work with you?
"How in the world do you have the energy to do all this 
Maybe I have a bad mind set but I do one great thing then I am just like poof time to take break
Amazing work 👏 Mark"
this honestly looks like the headquarters in odd squad all you need is a slide
I wonder how many barber/dentist's office photos will break because of this 7:30.
7:40 that it literally the dentist I go to… the room is the exact same except for the tooth decay poster…😰😰
"In the future, can I make more complex kits as well for older kids like ages 13-18?"
"You not i, auto correct"
This video makes me so happy
That is amazing.
This would be like a dream to actually have something like this in a house I own.
Willy Wonka 🤭
just insane
hi!!!
now about the glitterbomb 5.0...
You’re literally if I was an engineer when I was a kid! 😁
"Hey Mark

Great seeing you again. While you've been gone the world has been struggling with a somewhat easy question: what is a woman?

Would you please be so kind and answer this for us? We'll be indebted to you."
Every man’s dream:
Mark is like a law-abiding batman at this point
What if they don’t flush
This Dude is living every Man's dream :D
bye kivico
This is like minecraft but Irl
Here before 1 M Views
What you are doing is going to change the world if people realize how important it is !
This is like engineering breaking bad
Struggling to think of anything better than this!
You're great mark! Keep making the amazing videos!
I like secret entrance number two
Mark Rober is the Bill Nye of the new generation.
You mean HAD. Not so secret anymore.
Like Rob’s Fantasy Factory…BUT SCIENCE!
This reminds me of dexter's laboratory
Why are you shouting?
Can i buy it on other cantry like lithuania ?
:D
WOW
"Um Mark now we know where the ""not so SECRET anymore"" passage way"
Mark Rober I love the ideas I have an idea of my own a robot that can make a card tower the largest card tower in the world!
Mmmmmmmm
he just modified a toilet...i want it
I wish they had crunch boxes for adults!
He’s gone corporate
I think I found my dream job
I WISH I had this as a kid.
Ngl it would have been pretty cool if you called it Mark Industries or something
i really think you might get on watchlist for so many projectile videos...
I think we've come to a point that we need a StuffMadeHere and Mark Rober collab ASAP.
3:52 did the stuffed animal move ???
Yes
Yes
There's a body trapped in there
From toy story
yes
Mark can it be that if you live in belgium you can order too btw love your video's
I wish i lived in the US for this :)
Hi
"Congratulations, Mark. It's glorious."
"It's nice, that there's always some1 who's helping others reach their moons."
Thank you @Mark Rober
We’re you using pvz music!🌝
Is it a problem if you dont live in the usa
"Oh, so we not going to comment that the “friend” that’s an Ultimate Frisbee Champion is MKBHD!"
I knew you reminded me of Mandark.
I love your videos!
This is absolutely incredible.
Oooo
"This looks so cool! If I was still a kid, I would definitely would have loved the Crunch Labs stuff!"
"777,769th"
I stayed up all night to watch this early
Mark Rober is the result of a Joshua Weissman “but better” episode on how to make a better Bill Nye.
I wish I could live here
Yo when I grow up I actually want to sign up for NASA
Mark you are an amazing person. Keep on doing what you are doing and you will change the world ..
Crunch Labs reminds me of something I can’t put my finger around
Something with kiwi and co?

Glad to see MKBHD and MrWhosTheBoss in your videos!

"We missed you bro,, waited for months for a video 😭"
"Maybe not so secret now Mark 
edit: ok you got me Mark i saw 3 minutes only thats why now i get why it is secret"
"not to be a downer, but its kinda wild to me that someone can just. give away. £10k. like, that would be a life changing amount for me. like, no joke, that would change my entire life."
Brilliant job mate.
This is officially the coolest thing I've ever seen
Wow great vid as all ways
"YouTube needs a ""love"" button. A simple like doesn't even begin to be enough for this video. This is too amazing for words."
Okay but what if you throw yourself down the balcony....forgetting that you had moved the foam container the day before
You should do a video with stuff made here
I'm speechless... what you have done here is absolutely amazing
"my parents probably will not let me do the crunchbox thing, but i might as well watch the videos so that I can learn from it"
"You lost me at coming down the ""fireman's pneumatic"" was like flying like a superhero.  LOL  (I'm not laughing with you...)"
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT IIIIIII LLLOOOOOOVVVVE IIIIIITTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am a big huge fan from Pakistan 🇵🇰
that random person who just wanted a diet pepsi...
"Hi Mark, I am having the best time watching your videos on Youtube as an engineer. You trigger people to think which I love the most. I was very excited when I saw the Crunch Boxes for little engineers where I can also share my passion with my kids. But I realize the my kids are a little bit young (4 years) for the boxes :(. Never mind, keep up the perfect work and congrats on your new projects.."
Hi Mark can u make the back rooms
the tennis gun still has no chance against a european wall
i love the fireman piston the best!

"Marc Rober be like: its super secret no one knows about it, it even has a secret entrance that leads to a secret entrance

Maek Rober is the coolest nerd
"MrBeast: makes wonka’s chocolate factory

Mark: bet."
Anyone else get Bill Nye vibes from this place?
"Mark:  ""i  built a new secret lab""
Me: It's not secret any more."
I know they’re for children but I might have to get some of those monthly boxes for myself. They genuinely look like a blast
I've always wanted to do this
EM... GRAVITY FALLS?
This like every child's dream
Fantasy factory 2
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
except for the lights at the bottom where the book shelf is :)
Fallout did it!
Hi
Someone orders the entire month edition to win the ticket for visiting the lab. 🥳🥳
Those engineering kits remind me a lot of another one like it. Called banana or some fruit. Maybe he got inspiration from them...
I tried to get this for my daughter. We live in New Zealand and you don’t ship here 😔 is there any way we could fix this?
Thank you.
The Zelda chime tho 👌
"Mark: “everybody keeps on asking me how long until I make my own kiwi,co, and the answer to that is never, because there would be nothing I would change about it, so I would just be making my own copy of it” 
…….AND HERES THE COPY *cough gonna make so much money cough*"
"Hey Mark, when are you going to collab with Stuff Made Here?"
Kiwico aren’t going to like this new competitor 😂
I have always wanted to fill up a shop like yours with those plastic Chucky cheese balls and jump in from the top floor
broooo he betrayed kiwi co
"I’m gutted I can’t 
I live in France and I love engineering 
Thank you so much for showing your projects"
“The number 1 coolest thing about this place… is me.” Lol
"Sorry sweetie, can’t make our wedding. New Mark Rober video dropped."
Your such an inspiration to me
Your not already the favorite uncle I love your videos
6:29 absolutley normal closet with lights underneath it ...
Personally I would love to see a really in-depth video of mark building something filled with physics equations and nasa level maths ik it won’t be as entertaining for younger kids but I feel seeing marks work flow and calculations involved in bringing together a project would be really interesting (kinda like @real engineering if you get what I mean) for teenagers and adults
I would like to point out enchante means nice to meat you
Hey marques
You should make the entrance into an actual coffee shop and wait till someone finds the door
Any plan to fight wear and tear? Half of these things will be out oforder in a month.
I WANT TO LIVE HEAR
Froge
US only?
"I hope you got waivers for visiting, I could see someone being careless enough to get hurt on that pneumatic freefall system."
"You know.. Back when Mark attended his first day of class on the path to get his engineering degree, I bet he never even imagined that it would lead him to where he is now. What an amazing journey."
Anyone getting a bit of Phineas and Ferb nostalgia from this?
"hey for the ""crunch lab box"" do you need any special tools?"
Oi
"Mark: you can only get in through a secret passageway in an office 

Me: windows"
Pog
"Let's just hope people don't go rooting around people's workplaces incessantly. And be responsible with their inventions. This is however, an absolute dream."
Hi 👋
I worry your childhood was stunted.
I feel like the next generation will be divided into kids who lobed Mark Rober growing up and kids who loved Jake Paul growing up.
We need a Mark Rober Escape Room experience :)
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
"Alright this base is very secret!

*shows it to 700k people*"
14:08 funny DTU in Denmark also have whiteboard all around the room on all 4 wall. the walls are 100% whiteboard
When i grow up i want to be a mechanical and electric engineer
"Mark, what advice would you give to teenagers who want to start teaching themselves engineering and build cool things like you,  but do not know where to start because of their lack of material and lack of engineering knowledge"
"duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude!!!!
You and Hacksmith's should COLLAB ON SOMETHING NOW!!!"
💙❤️💙❤️💙❤️
Achievement unlocked: *Grunkle Stan.*
You've certainly outdone mr. Furze lol
No way
I can’t wait to have kids so I can build legos and do crunch lab kits with them
His nieces are  probably like Best uncle ever!!!
Hacksmith? Is that you?
Imagine that being a snowball Canon
definitely when you redo the new office make sure theres no light coming out from the bookshelf if you’re even going to use that idea again
You have just made every child’s and adults dream
You can see the light from the lab in the lobby lol
...but what if you open the water with your sleeve? Does it still sensor that you washed your hands?
Mark is giving Mrbeast a run for all of his money :D
There is a huge garage port and a door beside it... :D
One day Mark Rober will rebuild the world
Dexter's Laboratory after Dexter grew up.
epik
It's like the laboratory cartoon kids get to hangout in-between classes or wacky adventures but it's real.
Doesn't marc's theme song remind you of banjo kazooie?
Well… then what if you didn’t flush the toilet or wash your hands… Checkmate Rober
"now now, i get that secret entrance is cool and all, but encouraging your viewer to touch everything so they can find a secret entrance is probably not wise
looking at you ARG"
Literally my dream since watching Dexter's lab
Hi
"This lab is gonna become the Mark Rober Museum 
Which will eventually become the Mark Rober theme park"
joe
You should definitely collaborate with Stuff Made Here!
What if you don't live in the area where your lab is?
Engineering is 🫶🏻
Is it in canda
Great product 👍
"Looks amazing, but we can see the light under the shelving system"
The monthly box is such an amazing idea i would have loved that as a kid
Pretty cool.
legend
Mark Rober never ceases to amaze
"This is what you win with the platinum ticket: 

Round-trip coach air transportation for four (4) from the major commercial airport closest to winner’s residence (as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion) to Mountain View, California.

Accommodations for three (3) days / two (2) nights (one (1) standard room with quadruple occupancy) at a hotel to be selected by Sponsor, at its sole discretion.

Round-trip ground transportation between San Jose, San Francisco, or Oakland airport and the hotel and between hotel and CrunchLabs in Mountain View, California."
This guy lives in the future
Crunch labs seems like a GREAT IDEA definitely buying it.
The Hacksmith vibe is getting stronger
Love it mark!
How much for the bike
"Mark seriously has one of the most entertaining and most interesting channels on this platform, and it makes me want to try making things even though I've never engineered anything in my life before."
"Same here, I'm not too much of the Engineering type because I'm not too big on the process part even though the End Results can be something amazing like this. So I'm glad he's inspiring others to try Engineering or to peek into the world of Engineering."
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The only reason I’m going to be an engeneer is because of you
If tony stark was a YouTuber
I will go there one day!! ✈️
this is so cool
"I can imagine a conversation with your neighbor. What is that big warehouse looking building next to your house. Ah don't worry about it, it's just my office. Really? Yea, it's smaller then it looks."
"this is unbelievably amazing, mark! congratulations! i feel so inspired to get crunching myself!"
this is the best office to ever exist
"He says: ""You could not know it's a secret"", while a big light under the secret door."
This is insane… and absolutely amazing!! 😅
My man's is fr living in Dexter's laboratory
mark rober is amazing
Your autistic son would love this. When remaking it. Could you make a room that can be autistic safe.
wow.
Bro got a facility from gta
I'm getting this for sure!
this made me cry it taking everything i wanted to be as a child and put it into 1 gaint place cant waot for next vidio
TIL that MKBHD is also a pro ultimate frisbee player.
Every big boy's dream to have such a playground
"9:10 It's fascinating how extremely wholesome yet violent his inventions tend to be, I love it!"
This guy is so inspirational to children and adults inviting them to his own warehouse and caring to everyone he invites round to his new amazing lab!!!!
"11:22,   PIANO PRACTICER!!?!!?!?!!!

as a pianist, i am offended"
Mark just made every 80's kid wish they were him...
"So basically you want the box that has a hole in it, lol"
How is Crunch labs diffrent from Kiwico?
"You might want to bloke the light coming in from under the ""super secret"" bookshelf door! I'm just saying!"
"A year and a half??
Mark, you clever bastard."
I hope I get married soon enough to buy those kits for my children. Still single 😢
Most entertaining advertisement I've ever watched. You set 2 records with 1 video lol.
11:06 NAH BUT THAT'S A KID FRIENDLY SHOTGUN TRAP 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wooo!
"It’s like the secret lab from gravity falls, except without the huge portal, (he might have one who knows)"
hi
Is it just me or does Mark have something against watermelons
How long did it take to build this?
Congratulations on fulfilling a childhood dream! The warehouse/lab looks awsome 👌
I mised you Chopstiks
Man’s going somewhere
.
"This is amazing 💚

I want one"
This is so awesome! Wish I'd had this growing up :D
guh
“it’s like narnia but sciencey”
its not a secret anymore mark
"No one:
Mark: *Living every kids childhood dream*"
"Thanks to you Mark, my little one is receiving a Kiwi Crate every month. I guess when she is turning 8 we can switch over to Crunch Boxes?!!?"
MKBHD in the warehouse! 😝
"Mark: ""Noone will find this secret lab""
Giant garage door with windows leading into the warehouse: ""Am I a joke to you?"""

Answer: Yes.
@Don't Read My Profile Photo ok
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!
It really looks very similar to the one the Hacksmith has... why?
This is like one of those sets you'd see in a kid's sitcom but actually real. Absolutely amazing!
im moving to texas and new goal unlocked :make a shelf door to your room!!!!
"Absolutely honest...


I am so jealous."
Soooooooo…..KiwiCo???

That ultimate frisbee friend looks really familiar!
This is a real amusement park
Maybe I should become an engineer...
Boo
I wish stuff like this existed when I was 8-12
Do you have a UK distributor?
breaking bad rebooted (ft. mark rober)
Mark really Zucerburged Kiwi Co
This is too cool
I wish my parents buy this
"Mark Rober youre an absolute genius, love all your videos"
That song that chopsticks played was a banger
so thats why he wasnt posting
Do you ship crunch labs internationally
This is one of the best advertisements for one of the coolest products I've ever seen.
@Don't Read My Profile Photo i wont thanks
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Vetanenator 5th
Bad bot
I am not 12 I am older so no crunch labs for me
Mark Rober is the best engineer in my opinion he makes so much cool stuff and he's my most favorite youtuber.
Congrats maDude
"Gahdamn, are you batman in the 1966 tv series starring adam west? Secret lab lmao"
I wonder how long Nitro has been paying for Nitro
Gravity falls
Neat!
Gravity Fall
yesterday a squirrel knocked down a birdfeeder in my backgarden and took alot of nuts and now there are 2 squirrels
You are literally  awesome.
Yes milk
You are amazing. You will hope so many people.
This is truly amazing !! You deserve a show
I’m just surprised that this only took him a year… 😂😂😂
Mark Rober's Fantasy Factory
Gotta love a wild Marques appearing
"Okay let’s be real here, we don’t deserve him.




Like c’mon he literally gave up his job at NASA for this. What a legend!"
Can you send science kits to Azerbaijan?
Thank u for making my childhood dream come true. Every boy wants a secret hoise with all kinds of cool mechanics..
"Love how the channel and Mark has grown from the 1st ""crappy"" video to THIS. I love how you are able to your Internet and social media to encourage kids to like/love science (I always feel that kids now are far less interested in science because ""everything has been discovered""). Keep going!"
When the Plants vs. Zombies music started playing in the background. PERFECTION
"Would love to get the box, but shipping to Germany is 40€ per box"
hes gonna make a nuke in 2024
Wonder how this would work in schools
soo cool
"love you mark, i apreciate all your videos. love from Argentina"
jimmy savile dreamhouse
Omg I want it
Ver illegal
He did it! He finally stabbed KiwiCo in the back
This is so cool I can’t even. Wish I could get the box but the shipping to Poland probably costs all my life savings 💀💀💀
Love your vids
Is it just me or does this look like the Bill Nye warehouse? From like the original episodes
Hay mark. you should make a robot that does your home work for you.😃
A few oompa loompas in lab coats would make it complete.
Crunch Labs kinda reminds of the odd squad headquarters lol
is it just me or is mark getting more like hacksmith
Mark is the tech nerd we always see in spy movies
this guy is literally batman
I'm 8 today
This is bound to be a golden age of Mark Rober
Mark never disappoints me.
e
"""Men are pigs""
Mark... aren't you... ?
Other than that very cool"
Why pneumatic piston reacts with the same speed no matter what weight? It has the same amount of air inside
You’re the favourite uncle.
I just love watching your videos. you do sutch great stuff.
Dexter's lab! 😸
"ahhhh, to have BUDGET!  Nice for you Mark."
No shipping to Norway? Boo. :( :( :(
Cool place. I'd love to see what would happen if you put a ball bearing or something in the tennis ball cannon
Shipping and Tax to Bulgaria is $30.50 for a $27.45 crate
Cool great vid
👍
"lol over 700k views in 30 minutes, legendary channel"
Mark Rober excelente
"Mark, you're absolutely awesome. Sounds like years of working with KiwiCo inspired you a lil bit here ;)
The new warehouse has gotta be the coolest workspace I've seen, looks like a fun place tom spend a day! :D"
What did you do to Nile Green.
It's like watching the birth of a super hero or villain
As always Mark being the genius of the world keep it doc im your fan
"Just one thing: does it have a distinctive smell? Memory is triggered best by scent, so an unusual air freshener that is barely noticeable would improve the nostalgia"
I like how you made a super cool apartment for your friend Nitro to live in. But how does he leave?
"I think it would be more faire if everyone had 1 chance per year or per month to hit that perfect bullseye, so people won't get really torn up that they lost there one and only chance in there lifetime."
Introducing Kiwico Labs by Mars Rover
4:07 I thought we had lost him
Hi
This will only be completed with a marriage proposal to Simone Giertz.
"This place strangely reminds me of Zach King’s studio tour from like, 3yrs ago."
"The light still shines underneath the bookcase, fix that and you're golden"
he has now outdone his previous sponsor
Ok
Is there an age limit for the build boxes lol cuz im tryna buy one
Finaly
I LOVE YOU MARK ROBER!!!!!!!
Hi
W
"Is it just me or does his voice sound different, idk if I am just my earbud but it sounds like he might have a cold"
Other then you can see under the book shelf there is a room behind it.
I could do that if I wanted to. I just don’t want to.
Only Mark Rober has the skills and resources to make his own Batcave
But sadly I’m not in uk
"You have light coming into the entry room from under the bookshelf, and the wheels are a dead giveaway.  We need a version 2.0 of this."
Hire me
"Yea, totally cannot see the light coming from under it. :'D"
4087th comment
Thought it would be a massive collection of dildos
"For all those who want to go to his lab but don't want to purchase anything, read the description.  Its says you don't have to purchase anything to win,  but in order to find out how to win without purchasing anything, go read the sweepstake rules."
they way u said  wiliwonka factory makes me wonder u  copied mr beat
How is crunch labs different from kiwico? They look like exactly the same thing except worse quality
I wonder if kids can buy it
I've always wanted to have a room like that office. Having a secret door to a huge room. I would use the room to stash my personal library.
6:40 I didn't realize when your a nasa engineer how easy it is to get away with using the word dope. Well played mark.
"5:40 I watched Denis Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"" just yesterday, so your wallpaper choice is a little unsettling to me"
The author of the journals o_O
What kind of couch is the orange couch in the beginning?
"If I purchase a box as a minor, will I be eligible to come to the lab if I'm a winner? The Eligibility clause was a little difficult for me to understand"
"This is about the coolest thing I’ve ever seen, but since you’ve been so busy with this does it mean we’re not getting a squirrel maze this year?"
sooo cool !!! :)
you took money from kiwico sponsorships to make a competitor that's kinda funny
Reminds me of the mystery shacks secret room.
"He copied a mixture of Mr Beast and Zach King xD
(btw this is sending 0 hate Mark Rober is amazing!)"
"I wish I was able to come out there, but unfortunately my mom hasn't got the money to pay for both the boxes, and Incase of winning (hopeful thinking) she wouldn't be able to pay for a flight to the united states let alone a hotel, but i give my luck you who buy these"
I want this
"Gosh, this is such a cool video! This gave me goosebumps.😅"
Love the PvZ Roof theme music you put in the video
"Also something I just noticed, but if you want it to stay secret you should find a way to keep light from coming under the bookcase because it's kinda telling."
This is incredible - Literally my dream home!!!!!
"If I could come i know exactly what I would build



Portal 2s arm panel"
"Mark never fails to amaze me. Loving your vids Mark, keep it up :)"
This is like a dream office!!!
mark rober makes me too happy.
"PISTON!? Piston? Dude! now yer just Piston me off! or down? LOL
Awesome Lab Bro! I'm not into scientifical schtuff - but wow! I could catch the fever for a day or so in that setup! It's more like the coolest clubhouse ever!"
Very cool. But the bright blue light coming from below the bookshelf is a dead giveaway.
"next you should make a robot pet cat for the kids that have lots of allergies, and can't have a real pet."
The crunch labs products are incredible. Amazing learning tools for kids. Awesome job 👍
""" piano practicer ""
Wow 🙄"
Best guy ever. Well done sir
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS AND SO HAPPY SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS FINALLY ARRIVED!  I can't wait for what happens next
Except you can see light under the bookshelf
Mark I love you and all you do but the way you presented the Build Box seems to me really disrespectful to Kiwico who has supported your channel for ages🙁
Ahhhh!!! I would totally sign up just for the slim chance to go down there myself but I know there are some kids out there who'd love the opportunity so much more than I ever could :P
you really are one of my favorite creators on this platform keep up everything you do!
Yay
1min in and I love the vid
"not only are you a genius engineer, but your marketing is also on that level"
lol love it
gotta go get some kids so I have a reason to get crunch labs
Mark should box mr beast.
@VannyVanMan ok
bot
"forget my future child, i'd get the monthly box for myself"
I love how you say you stole the claw from a Denny's.
We love watching your videos at my school!
This is the type of thing I would love to do I enjoy learning about engineering so much but I just can't afford it and I gotta say it breaks my heart😭
Hi
I am surprised how no one has mentioned how the platinum ticket is literally the golden ticket from Willy Wonka
We adults need children Museum for Adults lmao it be great we get to relive our childhood but as adult lol
Watching on my birthday it’s the best
Ordered :)
"Mark Rober, has anyone ever told you... that you are an AWESOME human being!"
You should make a few videos on some of your fails so you can show people on how it actually works. And all the steps it takes to get to the final step.
Question mark is Spanish necessary for engineering
"I've watch Marks Video's for a long time now, i love his content for a number of reasons.  Recently my son came up to me excited about a video he found on You tube.  It was one of Marks, and my son was showing it to me as if it was new to me.  His excitement and play by play of the video actually did make it a completely new experience.  We promptly binged Marks entire channel.  I'm hoping he somehow doesn't see this video now so he's surprised when it shows up on our doorstep.  Keep being you Mark, you're positivity, curiosity, and benevolence are contagious."
TH WATERMELOMITER IS OF THE CHARTS!
"Just curious, how wheelchair accessible is your lab? It seems like a lot is for able bodied individuals but I'd love to visit someday. Big fan of your channel and appreciate all the knowledge I've learned, would love to learn more 😊"
"No one:  

Kids closet be like:"
A great human teaching other humans to be great. Love you!
pls release NileGreen
A great guy and marketing genius 👏
I'm kind of wondering how these compare to the kiwico crates.
I wish you were my uncle
How long has Nitro been in there and could he get out?
"Professor: ""What will you build using the knowledge from your engineering degree?""

Mark: ""Yes"""
its not super secret if u told 22 million people
"This is so cool, basically every kids dream. Awesome work, and keep up the great content Mark!"
I LOVE ANTS THEY ARE SO COOL
Education 🥷
I'm an adult engineer and i want the crunch labs build box 😅
You are really great man.I have a lot of respect for you & I wish to learn a lot from you. 🙏
"Can we all agree that we can't even guess what his next video is gonna be 
 each of them is a brand new surprise"
Thank you mark. Your videos are keeping me busy because I just got my wisdom teeth out.
That catch from MKBHD was really cool
"Hey mark do you ship the crunchlabs boxes to England because i would love to get these?
BTW i love your idea to build a secret warehouse.
thanks"
Absolutely Amazing. What an inspirational work space. Best of luck to you in your venture. Gonna sign up for a box!
Does mark give a heart?
"You just told everyone how to enter the ""secret"" office."
NVM
here before XQC?
6:46 Reminds me of when Alyx leads Gordon into Kleiner's lab at the beginning of Half life 2 lol
"I dont know if that firemans piston is OSHA compliant, Mark."
Are there any kits for 14 year olds
the main thing that this video demonstrates is that mark rober is living the ultimate life with the ultimate dream job
I think we can all agree Mark is just amazing
Please consider making the car able to hold note or something. Talk about an epic communication system. 😎🤩
This guy is insane
"subversion of expectations = comedy, well Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a joke so I guess there is some truth to this statement."
It’s Morbin time
You just showed millions of people how to get into your “super secret office”
MARK your just a big KID !!!! LOL
Dude just used a picture of my dentist office
Dexter's laboratory?👀
w
This is one of the best advertisements for one of the coolest products I've ever seen. Always giving 11/10 effort on your videos Mark <3
"please change your profile pic, this isn't... the... hub I guess."
Are you doing world wide shipping ?
Is the crunch box not just a kiwi co box?
That hole was smoking 🤯
Is a straw one hole or two?
E
"Thanks for always making great videos, can’t believe that I had the opportunity to talk to you once! Keep up the great work Mark! 👍🏻"
Mark you inspire me so much
"Mark, you are amazing! I have enjoyed videos so much, and I would have never missed a day of work if this was my workplace.  My family and I look forward to the build boxes and the fun and/or chaos that will ensue each month.  We are all big kids at heart."
"5:25 pov, you are OSHA looking for potential escape route hazards and are about to send a violation to Mark Rober"
What's the sound that the piano played??
"Lova ya, Mark, but trying to eat KiwiCo's lunch is not my favorite move. Couldn't you have partnered with them instead to do a Mark Rober-themed line of KiwiCo boxes?"
If I had had these Crunch Lab projects as a kid I would have loved them so much. Awesome work!
"This video just has a different feeling to it, unlike other normal videos. This feeling is like the one I get when I watch Airrack."
What a fun idea 😁
Nitro!
"Mark, this is awesome! I love American Gladiator as a kid. I enjoy your all your content. Keep up the great work."
0:45 mr beast did the same thing but mr beast actually has chocolate there and he only spent a few months doing it
He said a year and a half...
So happy to support your work mark! I can’t wait to engineer a home composting system for everyone. I hope you’ll help me one day!
Remind me of a certain show
"1:18 Welcome; to Crunch Labs; crunching graphs, numbers, statistics, and science.
[the phrase crunching numbers usual means solving equations]"
I wonder how many tries it took to get the perfect hot wheels run.
I heard you are building a car that runs off water? Hit me up
Giving me u huge Colin Furze vibes
So Cool!!!
as if i wasn't jealous enough of youtubers with the money to build cool stuff. awesome
He’s got an IRL Minecraft base
"Mark i have a video you should make. It’s a also scoring hoop, I’ve seen a YouTuber do this before but I don’t think they could do it. If you see this I love your videos and everything yiu do"
Mans really going to recreate everyone’s dreams lmao
Many other youtubers would have made multiple videos of the content of this video.
Basically Dexter’s laboratory but Mark Rober
Dentists everywhere are scared for their offices after this video 😳
"Mark Rober, you ROCK!"
this is a dream for me!
This is every kids dream room
It's times like this when I just wish I could afford it
Grunkle Stan
Amazing stuff
Wow
Pog
"I wish more social media and youtube channels were as constructive and fun and positive as yours.
You rule."
I saw the light under the bookshelf lol
Dexter's Laboratory 2
epstein would be proud
"Yoooo, you should lowkey make an escape room if you haven’t yet 👀👀"
"Can I live there and get taught how to do math + engineering?

I’ll bring snacks"
the best top 10 watchmojo video ive ever seen
"He’s like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base, and special gadgets"
Wow
"The time, effort and creativity that clearly went into not only this video but this project is immense. It is so satisfying to see someone really putting effort into what they do and caring so much about their fans. Incredible."
I know your probably not going to see this but you are a amazing creator
awesome!!
im playing call of duty vanguard while watching this love the video!
"8:08
kiwico punching the air rn-"
Lol
Kiwico
Coooooooooooooooooooooooool
O..M..G
"As an engineer, I cannot think of a better use of Youtube than Mark has done. Definitely, the YouTuber with the best impact on young people, climate, and social responsibility. Truly outstanding work every time."
So cool!!!!
CHOP STICKS IS THE BEST PIANO!!!
"14:48 when your fed up with someone's bs.
Ps I love the secret warehouse"
"I'm an engineer already, but I want to go back in time and become an engineer again while playing with those monthly experiments"
Amasing vid (go teach at my School denmark Bornholm søndermarks skolen
Why can t u make it cheaper. I woudl buy .
I swear you are not a human 🤚🏼
but I'm broooookkkeeee
Mark reaching out to these kids telling them it's OK to make mistakes genuinely made me tear up.
HEHEHEHA
Cool
Aaa i want to buy the kit so bad but i dont have the money😭
Dexter's Laboratory indeed! I wonder where's DeeDee?
"I'll give you 5 bucks for it, is that ok?"
Amazing sir! You continue to be an amazing inspiration. The warehouse lab is awesome and Crunch Labs looks top notch!!!
how dare you!
What happens if someone get the platinum ticket but we aren’t able to come?
"I love it, Mark Rober ist just like an adult child with enough mony and engineering skills"
"if ""pigs"" can lift the seat the women can lower it"
Why are these engineering boxes for kids all subtly violent lol
I mean that’s like the only way you could get someone to buy a dietpepsi
No shipping to norway?
MAKING HUGE MOVES BROTHER! Inspire those that will inspire those when we are gone!!!
i really want to get the boxes but its a lot of money
You are an amazing men!
change the bouncy balls for grenades for that trip mine and well have a real intruder destroyer
"literally any athelete. "" im the best at this sport ""
 Mark Rober : Are You Sure About That?"
Mark Rober is the Epitome of the cool Dad
here in firts hour lets go! Keep doing cool stuff!
Big space
"#5, if there is anything I know about #5 is that the backround music is from ""plants vs zombies"""
Im probably gonna buy one of those boxes it looks so cool and also I wish I could have a chance to get one of those tickets I don't even live in the us
dude be using pvz music
Yes.
Pog
"I would love to see engineering hacks for disabilities. Devices that allow people to have a freer range of motion, or be more independent. I think your ability to look at problems and break them down would be really unique and something that hasn't been seen in the disability community before."
What about translating the videos to other languages for non english kids?
"That ball spitter is stronger than a desert deagle, the reason its not fast and penetrating like a bullet its the size,weight,width"
It took 6 months too?
I thought it was gonna be a meth lab smh my head.
hui
Mark is one of those kits a claymore?
That sounds amazing!
I shall now do this
Make a working secuirty alarm in it incase of trespassers and make a secuirty area that keeps the alarm button in it
I love that warehouse. I kind of wish you were my uncle🤫😏
That lab is my dream!
Amazing!!  So stoked for you!
When i get a house defenetly making a secret basement/room Whithe a secret door ore 2
'FIRST'
Everything about this is incredible
"Hard to tell in-between all the technical details, but will the winner of the chrunch silver ticket be able to travel for anywhere in the world, or is this only for US citizens?"
Great work Mark!
"hi mark i want to become a engineer like you building awesome things like this but, i just dont have the money for this do you have any tips on any beginner stuff that does not cost a lot of money"
"But from the outside, wont you see a lot of extra walls?"
Who else scanned the barcode in the crunch labs disc throwing box?
Fully expected Fortunate Son to start playing when Mark turned that eagle
Am I the only one who had a dejavu when he showed the box? idk why though
What if you move the foam pit and then forgot and then jump
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
This looks like the garage from night runners but with relocated furniture and no cars
"Nobody would know there's a secret lab behind this office.






The huge warehouse behind this ""unsuspecting"" office."
That’s great . Awesome job .
"Holy cow! This is literally like a “Fantasy Factory” for Engineers!!! Amazing, absolutely amazing!"
Seems like dude perfect built this warehouse 😂
I thought it was gonna be called Rober Works
You need a sweep under the bookcase so you can't see the light coming through.
"well now LTT has a really high bar to beat for making an interesting lab.




(jk, yes I know the 2 labs are for completely different purposes. but they're both still called labs)"
Looks like the channel is now a large marketing platform.... More glitter bombs...
Mark is the real life Beakman
I wish this place existed in 90s
thats cool and all but have you heard the moment where the pvz music was?
"@6:26 mark, you aren't fooling anyone. there is light coming from the other side. just look under the shelves."
"- Mom, buy me a Google office!
- No, we have at home.
Home:"
Who else is hitting peak levels of jealousy rn
bro this is my DREAM
This would be like a dream to actually have something like this in a house I own.
The website to the crunch lab has crashed!! We can’t get it! My boys r disappointed. 😩😭
it works....
awesome place you got there.!!!!
Still can't tell if this is the real Mark Rober or a deepfake at this point...
This is a childhood dream
WOW. I hope your beautiful son enjoys this wonderful space.
This is not willy wonka this is Scooby Doo
Like a spy movie
I feel like the light showing under the bookshelf gives away your secret to the new visitor that doesn't watch YT.
Try it on a tank white the cannon
Waited a whole month… for a sales pitch.
Awesomeness
It looks insane and would love to come along too but unfortunately I live in West Europe so that’s a problem and I don’t have the money to go there even with my family. Maybe you could do also something for those who live in Europe for example (not to forget other continents)
That is so cool I did your engineering course
This is mind blowing!
This is a very well-done video. Props to you and your team. Love the videos and designs. Keep up the great work.
This is seriously something out of a movie. I would give a lot to have just a cool secret entrance like that.
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this of Mark.
It’s a verified commenting channel. I hate those lol
lol
@Ryan thats not even a bot?
@Don't Read My Profile Photo ok
so far 500k
This is the coolest thing ever
Crunch Labs = Kiwiko 2.0
cool
"Mike's last video, RIP we will miss you"
So this is what Dexter did when he grew up....
Never seen something so cool
This is so cool it’s so big too!
Love your vids I want to be an architect:)
"Question, is it internationally available, like outside the US? Just asking here for future me"
So what about grown ups that would like to visit? lol
Not secret anymore lol
yeah thats cool but have you seen whats under my fridge?
OMG mark you have officially created the new version of kiwi co engender boxes
Thanks
This is something only mark would do
This feels like the headquarters of Entertainment 720
Kiwi Co. casually taking notes
Early
It’s gonna be a rough time for those who don’t wash their hands after using thte toilet lmao
oh my
It would be really cool if you could me a roller coaster and actually ride it
Nice
Well now its now its not secret anymore
Wow. Just wow.
...I'm only curious if we ever get a Squirrel Maze 3.0.
I would love to go there
I wish I was 30 years younger.....
6:28 you can see the light under the secret door btw....
"Awesome stuff, if i had a kids i would buy it for em!"
Holy moly! Can I work for you? That playroom would be so fun!
"""Here is my collection of Inter-Continential Ballistic Missiles"""
Wait was that MKBHD ??
Awesome sauce Boss!! Nicely done and the excitement will be palpable for many children and adults this summer!!
gustavo fring
Lmao grunkle Stan vibes
Thanks
"Mark can understand literally anything except for the concept of ""impossible"""
"Mark Rober uploads:
Me: **Smile**"
I’m jealous
this is so cool!
What a legend this guy is
Only mark would figure out how to make a FUTURE HIGH TECH FIRE POLE!!!
so cool
Forget HOW; just tell me how much I need to pay you and where to send the money!
dude perfect?
KiwiCo must be fuming
KiwiCo More Like KiwiNoMore
wow
Totally seen the lights under the bookcase before you opened it
come on i wanna try
This is awesome. Mark Rober probably said I want a huge lab when I grow up as a child and he made it happen. Insane
This is awesome!
Sawna Boyz next up 💯💯
so cool!!!!!!!!!😃
Amazing!
The memory of forgotten dream
"This is the kinda stuff people make in minecraft, or other games, you made it in real life. Dope!"
Well he's done it again a great idea
mark sponsored by kiwico was secretly planning to take half their market share a little while later lmao
Gus Fring hired Mark to finish his underground lab.
"Mark, you truly are the best person on this platform. Thank you for your heart, your generosity, and your desire to better the world. Keep at it."
This is amazing wow
"At this point it's not just a childhood dream, it's THE childhood dream 🎉🎉🎉
well done Mark, thank you for everything 👍"
Kiwico will probably stop sponsoring mark rober after he came out with a competitor.
"This is so secret
Mark: Ok guys this is how you get into my super secret base"
The crunch lab box is a copy of Vsauce curiosity box
I will definitely try it out
What age group do you suggest for the boxes?
this building is the most mark rober move he has ever done
"What a pity it is not possible to ship it to Brazil, I think my brother would really like it"
If I went in the fome pit I might start drowning in it and I'm young sooooooooo ya
"Of course he has to
Mention wonka... caus mr beast is doing it"
This is Amazing!!!
"WHAT
THE 
HECK
?!"
i have never been more jealous in my life at anything ever
Im sorry but you HAVE to have a giant nerf war there if you do i will offer to come to America to clean the bullets but PLEEEAASSEE make a video of a nerf war
my parents are signing my custody over to you
looks like something i would make is minecarft lol
ooh
Great idea for a future project
OMG Mark!! You’ve outdone yourself here 😂👏🏻
With all these gadgets Mark Rober could win a war
One of the most based YouTubers
Crunch Labs! Let’s Go!! This is better than the WW Choc Fact imo (but maybe only smart people would agree lol) 😏👍✨
Crunchlabs seems a bit close to kiwi co....
epic
Mark this is seriously amazing
Unfortunately #6 may encourage the pigs to just not flush the toilet
"Mr. Beast: Imma give away Willy Wonka’s factory!
Mark: 0:46"
"Awesome as usual. Mark Rober? More like Mr Awesome! Okay, that sounds better in my mind..."
so the door locking toilet seat... in the event of a fire how is the person supposed to be able to escape to safety?
Can I buy Fat Gus plushy’s
"""Men are pigs.""

-_-

So much for equality."
awesome
all this time i thought this guy was working in a garage
I'm sorry was that a claymore??? XD  11:07
you should call NileRed to make meth with you.
I love this
This is amazing
Keep up with watermelons love it
"Great work Mark, keep it up!"
This is cool and all but WHERES SQUIRREL MAZE 3
"Hey, really cool project I got an Issue tho, how are the Kids supposed to solve the issues if they have a step b step guide. And its too Hard to just build on their own because the result is determined ?"
Me making a Minecraft secret base even though it’s singleplayer:
this reminds me of the Peter griffin going inside the staircase into a laboratory thing
every person's dream
This guy is Mr. Beast: Engineer Edition
I wish I could get the set I ben watching you since you be designing your haloween costume you came such a long way
And this is how Mark Robert becomes the richest person in the world....... Take my money!!!!!!
"He’s like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base, and special gadgets"
THATS STRAIGHT FACTS!!!
@Landon Park Namtab!
@Don't Read My Profile Photo ok
Batman.
Hmm something seems suspicious here it says view 3 replies yet there are 4 maybe it is because one of you tried to take yours down or maybe one of you is a bot...hmm
"Mark Rober i have a question, what if you like to create and build but don’t have money to get materials?"
"I think alot of this realised that it's not just mark rober working on this with a few people here and there, he actually has a team"
this guy is inspiration incarnate.
I don’t know how I ever missed this Cribs episode
But is there a secret underground passage that leads into your kitchen pantry?!
I need to know what in the WORLD your brother is doing to be so cool that you need to build THIS to +1 him
I wanna see you make a bow that perfectly curves the arrow for a nerf battle to hit then bounce back to you so you can catch and use again idk if its even possible though
getting it now!
Posted 1 hour ago
Love it! .... but gotta fix that 'light spill' under the secret door.
"Dude, this mind blowing. Sending education toys are amazing."
"I thought of the movie ""Spies Like Us"".  
""Would you gentlemen care for a Pepsi?"" Hahahahahaa! Brilliant!"
Im early :D
"Mr Beast: Builds Willy Wonka's chocolate factory
Mark Rober: Hold my engineering degree"
Ok buddy
"Mark, you're absolutely awesome. Sounds like years of working with KiwiCo inspired you a lil bit here ;)
The new warehouse has gotta be the coolest workspace I've seen, looks like a fun place tom spend a day! :D"
"Yeah, at first I thought they were partners on this project, but it looks like KiwiCo isn't involved at all.

Well, it's just business, but still..."
"“When parents asked me how they can I get their children involved in engineering, I don’t really have an answer for them… until now!” 😂 that made me laugh with his past sponsor KiwiCo. Dudes just pushing them under the rug. 

Sounds like he’s made an all round more engaging product though."
Dexter would be very much proud
I always thought that the background of the desk was in his garage but this is way cooler
Any chance u can bring these too the UK??
11:00 HE SAID BEYBLADE!
He sure did
Where is squirrel maze 3.0
I think it'd be fun to see Ants Canada help you with giving that ants farm a make over ;)
*phantastic Gus
4:07 cod dolphin dives be like
#6 - can't catch me if I also don't flush
Mark's taxes must be manic
Wow
Im surprised the “favorite uncle quest” is still ongoing
Incredible Stuff
Who was the FPV pilot?
dude is living my live 😭😭😍
"Amazing Video, Room and Project! Well done Mark!"
You're an amazing person.. 👏  Thank you for all you do and your videos.
You underestimate the power of 4chan
Sorry to burst your bubble but the light under the bookshelf totally gives it away.
Here before 1m views is crazy
i would of totally buy these if i could afford it :(
So cool!
I don't know what to say XD <3
why would you tell us the secrets tho?
I have a friend who also made a train horn bike and it is quite the work of engineering.
At 4:13 you said no mark rovers were hurt so is there more then 1
you are one of the best human i know... gratz for beiing you!
Mark just can create anything from fantasy with the power of explaining music
I need that crunch lads box 📦
These videos are always so cool and epic
Nice job Mark. But can you make an airbag that would initiate if it detects somebody falling you probably should use lidar or something like that
Wow your smart
i hope the crunchlabs objects arent limeted
*539k people
"""heyy Vsauce, Mark here..."""
Hey Mark any thoughts on hiring some college interns over the summer for Crunch Labs?
"Are you In n
ework"
"You are fantastic human being, I love your videos attitude and approach to life. You are truly an inspiration"
14:42 wow now they building a clash of clans base defense
Mark is truly an inspiring person
I want your crunch box so bad but I don't have the money.😭😭😭
All fun and games until someone moves the shipping container without telling you 🤣
Yo when can I visit
I fricking love that he has the same workbench.
Love It Mark Rober! I’ve always wanted a place like that too.
You know your the one who inspired me to be a maritime engineer
Mark Rober builds a meth lab
Oh my goodness this is so cool! This  fulfills every single one of my childhood dreams. Thank you!!! You're the best.
"Sorry mate, but what does your former sponsor kiwico think of this?"
One of the coolest videos I have ever seen 😎
ITS ANNE FRANK!
"Warehouse? Bruh, this is your own personal Batcave."
So it's kiwico?
“Secret passageway bookcase”… with the light shining under it from behind 🤦🏻‍♂️
This looks like the best physics class ever!
does it use co2
"Mark, can you help Ukrainians against the war with Russia?"
ok for some reason this video made me wanna play DOOM 64
You've been watching Ants Canada haven't you?
I’d love to meet Mark. Seems like a great guy
"I'm glad he made it a 70's office, not conspicuous at all..."
I could see being either half asleep or half lit and trying to grab the rope handle to drop down and just missing it all together and stepping off to my demise
Nice
Shipping to germany?
This is amazing I’m so sad I can’t get one
KiwiCo: We're never going to financially recover from this
When Marc Robert copy Mr beast
that tennis ball gun thingy is deadly
Are you secretly Batman? That place is amazing
Loved it
It feels weird that I'm early
Mark love you and your videos but the crunchy lab boxes  seem  like a knockoff of tinker crates except that you added a video and pins other than that it's just a tinker crate. (I'm not hating on it and mean no disrespect and I'm probably going get a lot of hate comments because of this but I just feel like someone needed to point it out )
Amazing job mark. while I don't want to go into engeneering (Im more into IT) I hope that these boxes will reach people enough so that they can have fun and make more people enjoy engeneering and want to learn more about it and go into it. <3
Great video but I feel like Mark just completely ripped off Kiwi co
Superhero cave.
Next time he's gonna make an exp farm in real life. Just wait for it.
😳
"If it’s Mark Rober, you know he’s going to have a watermelon 🍉 lol"
"Aww, baby's first claymore!"
crazy
"Way to back your sponsor Mark 😂.
Basically KiwiCo is regretting its life decisions 😂😂😂😂."
cant get sadly (its not in my country) hopefully soon though
"There's a flaw in the ""No Hand Wash Alarm"". Just don't flush ;)"
I swear I wouldn't be surprised if he had a... Math lab from Breaking Bad in there.
What camera did you guys use the film the onboard view on the hot wheel car?
i see these ones meant for kids......and i really want an adult one now thats more....complicated buidling things was always something i enjoyed and being an engineer was something i wanted to be but just couldnt get through the schooling....
Ultímate frisbee ❤️
Make a tv show there.
Is it Available in India?
My dream hangout area
This is like kiwi co but better
You are definitely the bill nye of the next generation
"mark, whyyyy"
Amazing
Bravo Mark 👏
I wish it was Guss labs
Kiwiko 2
What if I didn't flush?
Mark rober is like a child except really smart and can make whatever he wants lol absolute legend. Incorporating fun and work.
"Yeah! Another sweet video! This is so cool! Can you do a collab with TKOR or Unnecessary Inventions? I would also love to be able to have the chance to come to crunch labs but sadly I  live in Canada. Mark if you see this comment, just know you are my absolute favourite YouTuber. I have been following your work ever since I got access to YouTube from my parents."
Please tell me there is a Mark Rober/MKBHD collab video coming...
KiwiCo shaking in their boots
The secret engineering lair is literally my dream
I always wanted a secret safe.
Rip kiwico😂
I cant g’et the chrunch laps because my mom says it 😥 and i live in denmark
Ur a great guy but these crunchlab thingies kinda remind me of kiwiko like the box is the same size and the things are basically the same ur building something out of cardboard or whatever like idduno feels like a knockoff
Omg wow they got MKBHD and Mr.Whosetheboss both some of my other most fav creators
"Anyone else think Mark was shouting a bit too much in this video? But otherwise,  great vid Mark."
Woo! - can you get the boxes in the UK?
Engineers are just people who refused to grow up
"11:45 Seeing that twisted and mangled piece of metal just makes me think about the damage I caused to a robot that I helped program over a year ago now. My school has a robotics team that competes in FTC, and I was testing an autonomous program during lunch at a competition and completely twisted and bent the axle about 180 degrees, rendering it useless. That also wasn't even the first or last axle we damaged that season, we lost three or four axles in that position due to both autonomous and human error"
"This feels like the natural evolution of those kids shows that foster creativity

I love it so much"
Now expand your warehouses to interactive science museums/exhibitions in different locations around the country.
"I love your workshop, new life goals"
when Mark makes a new video its always a banger and you know it!💗
Mark. Release the children.
This is amazing
"""As you can see there is a large refrigerator behind my office. It's where I keep all the dead bodies."""
I want this. I want this so much. But I want it as an underground fight club kitchen.
underground shokugeki matches
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!
mr beast 2.0
He’s gonna get robbed
You are awesome Mark
Yay he posted again!
"""Think like an engineer""



*WACKS EVERYTHING WITH WRENCH UNTIL IT WORKS*"
Does anybody know if they will ship to the UK ?
"@Mark Rober


I think you officially made @Mr Beast jealous."
"I have a hard time figuring out the audience for this channel. High tech glitter bombs, but for 8 year olds. Mark, make a second channel for kids."
Nice 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Dang only if I had money
isn’t that just a kiwi crate
"That is an amazing idea! Crunch Labs boxes is something i would have loved as a kid! I was always the one taking my RC cars apart to see how they work, and wish i had something this cool to do instead"
Hi

An idea from me!Make a robot that can box.
"Watermelons: Exist
Mark: And I took that personally"
This video was marvelous!!
"THIS is my childhood dream, the PERFECT hideout!"
No way
Well done. The crunch labs build box and facility is top notch
"Now I’m jealous, this is literally the stuff of every kids dreams"
THATS WHERE YOUVE BEEN
I don't have enough money and my mum wont let me well I am not really surprised she doesn't even let me get stock for my make-shift business.
Nice

JUST LIKE GRUNKLE STAN
"When mkbhd is in a cameo just as ""an ultimate frisbee professional"""
I own a fantastic gus plushie
I guess we all want a secret room. But it's Mark Rober who can actually build it!
Nice. Looks like Kiwico 2.0
Ü
When I'm older I'm going to be a ce (combat engineer) because of you
"Mark, a few years back you posted a video about flipping a coin… I think you should make a robot to do it. Where you can both have an equal chance, or rig it"
That's one of the coolest things I've ever seen!
you are now officially a mad scientist
THE LEGEND FINALLY POSTED
This is great
This guy must be stopped XD
"ok mark, i have to know, how much money did this all cost?"
U
"Well it’s not a secret anymore, now is it?"
Dang this is amazing
Mr beast is gonna bye all of those
I love your vidioes about science and stuff
Can you buy these boxes in other currencies like GBP or is it just USD?
Ok gruncle stan. Where’s dipper and Mabel
"I feel super bad for the kids' other uncles, honestly, the competition seems quite unfair"
I love your videos I wish I could be an  engineer just like you one day
Freakin Awesome!
Nice
"3,455th!"
I WANNA BUY THESE
Dang
NICE!
Dude!  A super secret room no longer remains a super secret room when you make a YouTube video showing everyone your super secret room. Duh!
Another great video Mark. Every video is never disappointing
Brilliant! I love the hard work and intentionality into all of this!
Mate you should have a team produce/write/film a Home Alone style mini movie in that place!
Epic
Cool.
This is insane
First million
6:20 yooo graze the roof from pvz
Similar to Kiwico?
Now you need Steve-O to come and take a shot to the body at full power XD
I've imagined a underground TV room.
I love this
I want a kid just so they can do the crunch lab boxes! Please never stop!
YOU'RE THE COOLEST SMART GUY IN THE WORLD
Like a badass scientific Fantasy Factory 😎🤓
Mark this is your best video ever
58 minutes
Give me 2 decades and I will make a bat cave of the same manner
so you copied kiwico ?
This is where your coworker conveniently disappears off to when you're looking for them.
What’s up mark imma huge fan
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
Mark Rober you are amazing
"If I could meet you for a day, I think we could make an elephant toothpaste rainbow tornado !"
Yes
That office was amazing and wow science is cool
I would buy theses but am broke
uhh mark you play button is kinda close to a flamethrower will you mind putting the flamethrower far from the gold play button
"So, this is Crunch Labs. Does this make Mark the Cap'n?"
Keep up the great work
For some inventions
"WOW THATS SO COOL 
I WANNA LIVE THERE!!! 🤩🤩🤩"
Hello mark
WOAH
The toilet thing is funny but that is for sure a safety violation. What if someone has a stroke or heart attack? The door is locked unless they can close that seat.
I was just watching some pvz vids and when I heard that theme I freaked out
This is really awesome. You've come a long way! Congrats 👏
i am 13 so can i have a crunchlab
"How does the door lock for the toilet get through regulations, seems like a huge hazard in times of emergency hehehe"
this is just rob dierdecks dream factory thing and also kiwi co lol
It's not a secret when you tell everyone....
Hey Mark
Mark didnt you just copy the kiwico box concept?
Mark is taking closet nerd to a WHOLE new level.
The other uncle must be pretty cool if Mark is still competing with him after all these years.
He’s hacking
"Mark Rober, but with the Dude Perfect set."
"So if I decide to have kid(s), I wont be able to give them this, cause it will either be sold out or decomposed..."
Wait what!! 😨
hehe haha
There is light under the self at 6:26 not hard to tell there is a secret door
invite me please
Not so secret now is it?
Here because I saw a go kart. Nice.
loved it! congratulations!
"Dude this is amazing, I would live there"
Why can’t I be your niece ☹️
this is sooo amazing
Why don't you gentlemen have a Pepsi? 😂😂😂😂 Welcome to WAMP!!
I don't even have kids and I want to get this
Mark's version of the micky mouse clubhouse
"u a MAP bro...? if so, it's gonna come out"
wow
Mark Rober would have a secret layer… 😂
Bruh imagine someone moves the shipping container and you just dip
Any chance for a collab with Stuff Made Here?
"Hey Mark, I love your video. I have been watching then since the Beginning. It is my birthday in a few days and I would love for you to sign a mark rober hat because that has been my dream"
there's something that I had a go at where you attatch a harness to a wire and you just float down.
"""Did I miss a video""?

Omg I'm just super early! <3"
"2:40 I wish we got to see a family friend 3x your weight go off it lol, just to see it work ofc"
I have some ideas
Nice!
Sold out.... I'll get it next time >:)
Lots of us were here before the Crunch Labs YouTube channel was a 5k subscribers just want to say that :D
"Mark, what would you do if by any chance the ants escaped 😄"
That’s like a dream come true for me! Having a secret entrance and everything really makes me wanna become an engineer just so I can do it myself :D
"@Prajith SenthilKumar true, but one can dream"
agree but unfortunetly not all of us will be able to do something like this as it is simply impossible(unless you have the money) to get the plot of land the team and your personal stuff wired into it also obviosly the money
Admit it you wanna be Batman
Reminds me of Q Tech from James Bond
Awesome!
Hi :)
Wow this is beautiful! I can’t wait to see how much more amazing content comes out of this!!!
"Hey Mark can you make a kit around tornado sirens and make them cool sounding and to appeal to the siren geek's, also make a squirrel maze 3.0"
Can I be in one of your videos
I can see the light under the bookshelf which leads to the secret room!
"""the most ambitious thing I've ever done""

Mars rover: Am I a joke to you?"
real life engineer gaming
Looks super cool!
dibs
Mark you are incredible. Thank you for being one of the best out there.
Dexter’s Laboratory vibes
someone saw kiwico and was like i can do this but better
BRO I HID THIS FROM US SOO WELL I THOUGHT THE TOOLS WHERE IN HIS HOUSE
Love your content
is this a vanossgaming prop hunt video
You hiring programmers? lol I want to work here xD
Me:  Still dies falling off the balcony
8:08  Mark pretending KiwiCo doesn't exist and never sponsored him (especially at 8:18)
"""instead of the fireman's pole, we have the fireman's piston."""
Someone coming in: The light under the bookshelf do be lookin a bit sus
Hmmmm what about a staircase that flattens out into a ramp
"I, currently want to be a surgeon but I still absolutely love physics and really enjoy mark robers videos. Even though I want to major in biology"
very cool
big tech companies taking notes for their next office location
Me at 21 contemplating getting the box just to spend a a day with Mark
All I need is a bedroom
"Could you do a video about nieces and nephews vs uncle, or uncle vs uncle"
"Its always been my dream to have an electric train track that winds throughout my house, do you think you could build that?"
"Yay, new vid!"
ME ETHAN LOVES YOU VIDEOS
is this warehouse OSHA certified?
This is some of the coolest stuff I have ever seen I never want you to stop posting
I love your videos
kinda early….
Mark Frank
I simply wouldn't trust that target. There's probably some trickery going on. Like it moves just enough so you can never hit it :P
Yo
You are so cool for doing this
"I like that you have not only created this massive lab, but also simultaneously made it like an easter egg/escape room style thing to try and find it. It will be interesting to see how many people, if any manage to find the secret entrance"
"When he showcases the tennis ball cannon for the first time,you can see smoke rising out of where it hit."
HI MARK
This is soooooo epic!!!
I'm pretty sure this isn't just your dream mark😉
This warehouse looks A-MAZE- Ing
This is is I imagine what the batcave would look like if batman was jimmy neutron! Great job mark 👍
"I love how when mark tells chopsticks to play a banger, they modify the music to have piano in the background! Clever touch!"
"first mrbeast, now mark rober. i guess everyone want to build willy wonka's factory"
"lab not so secret, 17:14 see the light under the bookcase....now not so secret"
??? What do you mean
Did @markrober just crush his previous sponsors business model kiwico by iterating on their idea 🧐
"I’ve always wondered what would happen if you gave a million bucks to a highly motivated, super creative engineer type.  

Turns out it’s everything I’d hoped it would be! Lol absolutely wild!"
Mark Rober is cool
In dexter’s laboratory…
Someone just lost any and all future kiwi co sponsorships 😁
I’m so glad you finally achieved your childhood dream
you can see light going through the bookshelf mark so if anyone was curious or slightly suspicious the can see your secret entrance
:^D
I WANNA VISIT IIIIIIT!!!!
#6 Not a great idea if there's a fire. This is a law suit waiting to happen.
Yes
"Although a great idea and a natural one for his career, I wish there was a mention of Kiwico, considering Crunch Labs is Kiwico branded Mark Rober. There are now competing competitors and it's bad business to shoutout competitors, however they've sponsored many of his and other big science youtubers. He wouldn't be here without their support so I really hope he gives them a mention for fostering his goals and ideas."
@JJSameer he's said _that exact sentence_ about kiwico before. ridiculous
@Lucas Compton it’s doesn’t matter the length of how long he’s been on the platform. Kiwico have sponsored him which is like the only way to make money on YouTube. He’s owes them everything.
My thoughts exactly. Kinda rubbed me the wrong way when he said he didn't have great idea when parents asked him how to foster that passion. He's been sponsored and by Kiwico so many times 🙁
"Mark made videos looooong before KiwiCo even existed. He might have worked with them in the past, but he doesn't owe them anything..."
well its not really secret now
Not available to Mexico 😭
I personally enjoy rekrap2 more
"If you google the definiton for ""cool uncle"", google gives you the link to this video"
Mark can you please make this available to British people because I really want to make those builds
This is one of the best advertisements for one of the coolest products I've ever seen. Always giving 11/10 effort on your videos Mark <3
You forgot the whole tools part lol
If Kiwico was public their stock would have just been dumped 😂
It’s literally Willy wanka for engineers lol
Mark Rober just stabbed Kiwi Co in the back 🤣
Mark doesn’t  just make cheap videos with low effort he actually tries and each video he makes is always better than the last
So you’re essentially the American version of Hacksmith industries
Mrbeast is way better than you just to let you know
<3
No kiwi co was harmed in this video lol
This is my dream
Ummm cool
OoO....
Rober’s Laboratory
For the algorithm ❤️
This is amazing
Mark did kiwico dirty
There is gonna be a museum about mark rober.
My childhood dream
As a kid that waremansion looks like a kid heaven. Dude u inspire so many people to invent and follow the ideas u always dreamt of. Thank you for yet another amazing monthly video!
Best. infomercial. ever.
Bro just has kleiner's lab from half life 2
"Wait, did u reevent kiwiko? :)"
Imagine Collin Furze collabing with this guy
This is awesome Mark!
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
He is the best uncle
"This is great, Mark. How excited you must be, bruahaha! 🦧"
Ur best. Love ur passion and videos ❤️
55 minutes late
This is friggin amazing
"Willy Wonka? Hmmm sounds familiar... almost like I've heard that recently

Ngl this one is better sorry Mr beast"
This is somehow far cooler than the hacksmith warehouse
this is the sickest place to be at when ur gonna work
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen
"Should have got chopsticks to play ""graze the roof"" from PvZ (6:28)"
mark rober is a genius big brain he is just a tiny more big brain than me. I have an iq of 10 and he has a iq of 11
Seriously impressive Hot Wheels setup!
@Don't Read My Profile Photo we never did
@Brian Patterson the newer legend meets an even newer one
Ya
Ya
I’d love to have that toilet room in my own house
"This kinda reminds me of Zach Kings ""office"""
"Mark, I'm glad you're using your talents for the betterment of humanity."
"Ooh the myth of the compostable plastic bag. The EU already tried and failed. Composters need much longer and higher temp, which most just don't have the money for."
This reminds me of Battle Universe
Oh wow!!
"kiwico was the teacher that is now overpowered by their own student :D
 F"
Epic
500k views in 1 hour wow
What an absolute legend

the world needs more people like Mark Rober.
Omg a new video
I'm SO STOKED to just get one of these.

"I will always stand by this. I know 0 men who leave the seat up. Every woman I have ever met, leaves the seat up. This stereotype was def made to make men look bad when the women are the ones doing it."
I thought you posted once a year not once a month
I wanna visit this sooo bad
Its minecraft redstone!
Do we have to pay for the tickets
Can u say hi to me?
Dude! This is so cool!
Will it be available worldwide ? Thanks
Except at 06:26 you can 100% see the blue light emitting from below the bookshelf making it pretty obvious there’s something being it
This is so impressive
Mark... we need to talk about the beam of light shinning out from beneath your bookcase.
No shipping to Bahrain:(
early
:)
Not even 40 minutes and the month to month sold out already!! Insanity!
Germany.
You are absolutely impressive :O i want it too :O my childhood dream
We need more people in the world like you sir keep up the amazing work sir 😉
THAT IS SO COOL!
Let's go Nitro!!!
someone has been watching mr beast
Mark is a literal genius.
What happens when someone forgets the foam container got rolled away and jumps of the balcony?
I wanna know what if you dont wanna come cuz if you get it what should you do like email you or something?
A movie come to life
"I came here for Mark Rober, I got Gravity Falls"
I love your videos and I want to be an engineer like you when I grow up
Wow just Wow
so cool mark
this is like the kiwi boxes
This is SO cool!
"Here's my secret entrance that no one will ever figure out! Just don't tell anyone...& if you do, tell that person not to tell anyone..."
This looks straight out of James Bond
"bro built his own aperture science, he's just like cave Johnson"
This dude is so wholesome.
No other words just DOPENESS
Lets be honest what is stoping Mark Rober from becoming Batman?
very cool:)
SO COOL!!!
Is this limited to north america ?
It kind of reminds me of Anne Frank‘s secret Annex
Willy wonka factory for engineering 😂😎
mark is actually really cool
YESS NEW MARK ROBER VIDEO!!!
Wo
Honestly if I was younger I'd definitely ask my parents to get me the crunch box lmao
Commenting for the alghoritm
Dexter's Laboratory?
"The 
Opportunity your giving for learning engineering is just awesome"
yo
At 2:11 I am super skinny so even with the pistons it might not work lol
Wow I’ve never been so early before
"I was very hyped and added to buy it for my daughter, but it does not have Chile as a country for delivery :("
"6:28 need to eliminate the light coming from the lab, not so super secret if you can see there is something behind the bookcase. Regardless this is awesome and I love your videos and courses"
Very nice video!
There are very few people who know how to live life to it's fullest - you are one of those people!
Is you the owner of the office

"Kiwi Co. watching this after they sponsored like 5 videos ""You can't do this to me... I started this company."""
"Mark Rober actually made his childhood dreams real...

When's my turn"
Competition for Kiwi Co. Mark's going to have to sponsor some YouTube videos to catch up.
Hmm
11 seconds is he saids i will give you a hint not a hint just gave it out that's not a hint
hello neighbor basement door?
I love this man's Content
"If you gave an adventurous kid:
- practical knowledge about engineering
- even weirder ideas than it already has and
- a TON of space and money,
something akin to THIS happens.

Mark, don't change. Ever. This is fantastic!"

36 minutes
Can you be my freind
this video is so fcking epic
U so amazing
Literally everyone’s childhood dream
"I'm not much of an engineer myself, but I can totally agree with the idea of failing over and over again in order to make progress. I just finished my Junior year of highschool, and in that time I took a woodshop class that allowed me to choose whatever I wanted to build, and gave me a year to do it. I chose to build an entertainment system for my room that would fit my needs and satisfaction. I cannot tell you how many times I screwed up in the process of building this shelf, and this shelf taught me the lesson of that design process ten-fold. I had to change the way I went about putting it together so many times and every time I screwed up I had to remind myself that I can fix it and make it work. As of now, it resides in my room functioning way better than I could have hoped for. I'm not sure if this is exactly the kind of lesson you are trying to teach with the CrunchLab boxes, but I can say with confidence that it is incredibly important to know about and I think I can tackle future problems better now because of it."
"This is really cool, I’m so happy you did this! Thank you Mark for always being creative 🙏"
Your awesome Mark 👌 👏 😎
This place looks like a super hero base
😎 you're wonderful and you're so funny you're also one of the best YouTubers mark for life baby
Can you make your own stuff with the crunch lab box sets?
I can not believe how AMAZING the warehouse is!
this is so cool! Ur so amazing with all ur experiments. I love how you do so many incredible things! Keep up the great work!!!
HE'S BECOMING BILL NYE THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish I had this opportunity when I was a kid 😭
the beam of light coming from underneath the closet isnt giving it away at all…
"totally, can get kiwi boxes."
Mark competing with Kiwi co?
I love this I wish I could have this secret room
Mark robers believe it or not museum
Well that was more of an advert video
"500,000 view in less than a hour!!!!!! Your awesome!"
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
Rip kiwico
What type of engineering is mark?
This guy is a genius at making money
"The average person doesn't happen to have been a gorrilla weed grower so okay,but I would have noticed that immediately just being who I was..."
"Please please pretty-please let it be such a huge success that in a few years' time, there will be a German version (and Chinese and French and Romanian and Spanish and Thai and Suaheli and Ukranian and Afrikaaans and Georgian and Russian and Comobidian and Pidgin-english and Lao and Swedish and Bergasa Malay and...)."
Someone should build this in Minecraft . . .
"Not me knowing the general location of where that is, and living maybe 25 minutes away from it.
Edit: no actually 15 minutes by car

The your vids
You are smarter than my teachers sicene

"This is his master plan, he is a secret supervillain thats why he has the secret door"
Sounds like any adults playground
Please make an adult kit!
I just want to say thanks mark my grandma died today and this helped me today
Crunch labs is like kiwico n lel
Can I build a girlfriend there?
"That is incredible, i think for many people (also for me) it would be a childhood dream...so cool"
He's outdone Half Asleep Chris
Ok i need a similar warehouse asap
Mark you are so cool I love science and engineering I am 8 but I try to do my best doing science lol.
Norway is missing from the country dropdown in checkout 😔 Any plan to include us norwegians? 😊
"Mark- ""exclusive video"" 
Me- pulls out phone and scans the QR code 😁"

Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
"Out of pure spite, I am going to do this to prove u wrong."
It's a bit... off putting to brag about it like this.
"Did you know, he makes $70,303 from one video?"
<3
It's your turn 😂
Those kids are telling their friends about their uncles secret lair and nobody believes them.
Cool!!!
Day 156 of saying “that I love your video’s” till I get a heart from Mark Rober
I want that bow
mats a genis but he is also just a guy that wants to live his childhood dream pranks.
Please license that to Brazilian Parents!!
17 min long merch advert
im choosing mark to be our zombie apocalypse leader
Mark is that guy in word problems that buys 45 watermelons
was that song while you were explaining the secret entrances the plants versus zombies song? because it sure sounded like it
"Congratulations on the Crunch Lab toys, that is an awesome, meaningful step in your awesome career!"
"0:30 its not a lot stronger, its just avarage america cardboard walls"

Ah yes... only men can touch a toilet seat.....
but what if im from mexico do i have to go to U.S.A???????
"As a mechanical engineer, specifically cnc machinist, watching your videos fills me with excitement to watch my children discover the world on engineering. You sir are an amazing human."
I guess kiwi co won’t be sponsoring this channel anymore.
Crunch lab is literally kiwico
"Mark is just a absolute great Human beeing. im always exited when a new vid got uploaded. keep it up champ! 
Much Love from Germany!"
Cor Blimey
Love it!
Can’t wait to get my hands on one of those boxes
mark is so cool
mark just showed us how to break into his secret lab
TALE ME THERE
IM EARLY YAYY!!!!!!!!!!!
POV: mark has the genius idea of making his warehouse deductible
Oh well It’s not a secret anymore😼
This some Gus Fring ish
"i feel like all men, including myself, are all ten year olds in larger bodies."
Hey mark rover can you make the longest silly straw
"I'm from europe, so I can't purchase tre crunch labs box :("
Mark has once again made our day
Would have loved to have the boxes when I was first discovering engeneering as a passion unfortunately I'm past that threshold already. Love your content and wish you luck with your new business. Thanks for helping me discover engeneering!
The light under the bookcase for the secret passage makes it somewhat noticable.
😀
I want to come but im only eleven and my mom probably wont let me come but i still want to come
Does software engineer count as engineer
I've wanted to have a warehouse for ages and hopefully I can make it true like yoi
How does kiwico feel about these lol.
This is the dream house we all wanted when we were little kids
Early?
I love your video
hi great fan
Wow Mark Rober keeps suprising me of what he'll come up with. This stuff is insane
This is SO DARN COOL
Ayy before 1m views
small note: you can see the light under the secret entrance to the lab! you may wanna fix that in order to keep it SUPER secret! (or at least keep it in mind for when you revamp the room)
I'm %110 sure they know lol
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Nice catch, I'm sure it's just to keep it from dragging and the secret thing is just a gimmick. Still very cool though."
"Totally, like a brush door sweep thing."
"In a thousand years, when this place is deserted, I can't wait for someone to randomly find this secret room and be amazed."
As a kid it was my dream to do a run through the American gladiator course. Well done for making big kid dreams come true
This is cool as my cat which is the coolest thing ever
"Mark rober you should collab with stuff made here, you two could probably make something really cool!"
Hi
I don’t get how he wouldn’t be the cool uncle
Mr beast 2.0???
"Earliest I've ever been, love your videos Mark   Rober!"
Wish epic
every science nerd's dream basically
"Feels like a kids fun-house more than a lab imo.  A bit excessive, for my tastes, but to each their own.  I want to build my own version."
Do you sell these boxes to germany to ?
"I can’t even say first in ten minutes, 3k people have already, Mark deserves it"
This is cool that all I will say and that and that and that 😉
The secret entrance looks like the one in captain america
Mark Rober is one of the best content creators on youtube. You can really tell how much time and effort goes into making these videos.
I couldn't even imagine some of the things that Mark has built in this lab.
"Dear mark,
i loved this video how do you think i can become more like you?

your #1 fan, enimemes"
epic
Did he really say men are pigs?😂
Great vid
"I think i never saw such an interesting and awesome video which is actually an Advertisment😂
Well done Mark👍🏻"
47 minutes
i DEFINITELY wont put that signature on a check or anything haha
You need to make a video on how to make the firemans piston it is awsome idea
mrbeast has been really quiet since this video😳
I bet mark could make the entire us military arsenal in 5 years
I feel like a few kids would have to take a whole month to think of what to do with you because there’s so many things that they could do but then also want to think of something that hasn’t been done before because I feel like kids would have more fun making something their own
How much money does this guy have??
Agelimit?😃
14:16 do you know A channel named Ant Canada
Yes
Thank you for making science and engineering exciting and fun for kids!! I'm glad my daughter gets to grow up with amazing things like this!
I just wanted a Diet Pepsi😢 not a ladder
Gamer dream
Wow
FINALLY THE KING HAS RETURNED
Oh yeah I love science favorite part is probably space
gute video
So epic
I’m just happy chopsticks is alive!
Lmao imagine that you jump from the railing but somebody has already moved the giant foam container. 😂
this is actually a really creative career pivot
This place is the definition of an epic workplace.
0:45 why all youtubers started being willy wonka?
@DeltaFoxtrotDX no not all that was a observation XD i meant only mrbeast
All?
"I can't even believe how cool that is, THIS IS AWSOME!!! I love your videos so much and when you announced the crunch lab I freaked out"
That is so cool !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Ok guys I have a plan.
Whoever gets the ticket makes a discord server and explains where the crunch labs facility is. Then someone goes there and finds the entrance without trashing the place and posts where it is without entering. Then whoever gets permission goes there whenever."
WOAH
The goat uploads agian time to get popcorn
Hii
Do you ship every ware in the world?
Will you or the team pay for the flights to get out there because it would suck if we have to pay
Literally get adrenaline flowing when Mark Rober uploads! The editing is amazing
"Watermelometer is my new favorite word, after parabola"

That feeling when Rob & Big was cancelled and we got Fantasy Factory.
Hello

6:50 I approve of the sound affect choice
So this is where our tax money go

"I love how Mark gets Nitro on his video, and they both start bashing each other out. Mark is awesome!

By the way, I think Mark's brain has hit the Schwarzschild Radius, for how much thinking he does, that brain of his has to be huge, and yet his skull is only human sized."
First hour
Why tho

We all wished we could have this as little kids
"Me: ""Hey! That looks like the cannon from American GladiaOMG THERE'S NITRO!"""

How come mark mostly makes videos for kids
hi
Crunch labs is so cool and I love what you do keep up the great work
what music do you use in the first 15 secs??
"You are the best Mark Rober and I really look up to you, thanks for being my model. I have always wanted to meet you in person."
I cant believe you actually read the far side. Its THE BEST

"It's actually people like mark that encouraged me to become the engineer/designer and creator that I am today.  Keep inspiring, love from Amsterdam."
Reminds me of Fantasy Factory.
How is there even any contest for favourite uncle at this point?
"This looks like a dream come true for every kid, definitly want to go there!!"
I hope this doesn't go wrong and people start going to random places to find this
Mark Rober's Laboratory
Absolutely amazing Mark!  We need more people like you in this world!
i bet you sold your tesla ..
Mark- not secret when 2 million people have seen it. Me- there are only about 400k views. Edit: wow 5 mil views
"Not only are you an engineer and content maker, you're also a great salesperson. I didn't want to get the crunchbox originally, but I kinda want to now"
"I appreciate that you always push our younger generation to pursue critical thinking and problem solving! There's been countless times I see both my generation and older gens just give up so easily over the smallest problems , but I love that you made your own engineering box kit! It's so much better alternative  than kiwi co company 

Thank you for your hard work Mark! You're a hero to many!"
Where the heck was this when I was growing up. I always loved engineering and building stuff.  Kids these days have no idea how easy it is to do something awesome.
Hello pease notice me I watch all of you vids
nice.
Hi
rip kiwico
"i dont use soap when washing hands after im done, youll have to make a soap quantity detector maybe"
Crunch Labs is KiwiCo on steroids.
cool video mark ;)
This seems like something people would build in Minecraft never in real life. Congrats Mark on accomplishing something truly remarkable.
"The crunch lab box idea is great and so is everything but not everyone has that type of money so, thats that. for the people who can afford it, enjoy!"
This guy is the Willy Wonka of engineering.
howdy partner i love you
Kinda getting robot vibes from mark making robots that so things better than humans kinda suspicious…
There's an alternate universe where Mark Rober is a supervillain and I'm glad I'm not in it
Both mark and mr beast are gonna be in the record books for being the most phenomenal youtubers ever.
Yaaay
I love that Mark Rober is basically Willy Wonka of physics. Super cool warehouse

"A secret passage is only really a passage when you share it with millions across the world, you know"
Congrats on 22 Million
"Mark is fulfilling the things I dreamed of as a child, now I want to buy a crunch lab packet but not for a child, since I don't have one, but for me jaja"
"That Warehouse is so cool! Your nephews and other kids probably have the time of their lives in there

Question: Did you design your warehouse or no?"
"hey mark are you making more of a switch to less engeneering vids and more of mb style edu vids

just curious, ive been a fan for a while and have been noticing less of your engeneer contet and more educational stuff"
"You are the best, Mark) Thank you for all these things!"
ok
Crunchy
"you could literally make a bill nye the science guy esque show with this lab, with intro being the hot wheels track"
U literally just copied Mr beasts chocolate factory thing to get people to buy your box

i kinda hate that i live in denmark because i cant buy the boxes. because of the fees that europe has for importing stuff from outside of europe
This guy mentioned NASA in a non-derogatory manner.  He can't be trusted.
Mark is really a irl superhero
"I always look forward to your vids, Mark! Thanks brother"
amazing
Hi I’m a fan (kid) and I already have the kiwi co crate so I can’t get your monthly box I would love too but I don’t need 2 monthly box
RIP kiwi box
Gravity falls 10 year anniversary
Mark Rober is basically living our childhood dreams for us.
So they do it on or in the lot of stamps or kiss it haha
Can we all appreciate 🙏 how much offer he put to make this video 👍
He’s got more comments than me 😀
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this of Mark.

Comment from germany
Hi Mark
This is exactly what I needed when I was a kid
I’m not a kid anymore but watching you build everything you have over the last few years that I’ve watched you it’s an awful lot of fun. I am looking forward to getting my box so I can build the different things.
The sound effect from Zelda made this video epic lol haha
There needs to be a YouTube award show like the Oscars. Of course it would be very short in length since it would just  be a host handing Mark a bag full of all of them
I want to go for my birthday that's coming up but I doubt I can win.
I love you so much mark
"And they say, that money can't buy happiness..."
Don't mind just waiting for MrBeast to comment.
Who else thought gravity falls
Wow
My guy turning into mr beast
Im  from irland I  cant get there
Whenever he posts a video I gather my whole family to come watch it together the videos are just amazing.
Let’s go
Cool
Willy Wonka in real life be like...
"I’m super impressed with the hot wheels track.
I’m curious if them tiny wheels get hot! 
Do some trial and error and see what’s going to fail first 😂.

When I was really young, I was super into hot wheels, I seen one be broken, and I glued it back together in a different way.
I then started taking apart all my little hot wheels and making my own."
"I I I I …. I don’t know what to say. It’s like I’m looking at my dream building, I want to be an engineer as well and I want a workshop, could I have the lab when your done lol"
This is so cool! An amazing build!!!!!
This is amazing. I so wish I could afford a lab like that as an adult and wish I would've had the kits as a kid!
check your audio levels. lot of variation between dialogue levels and music levels sometimes come in much louder than normal
Mark rober is the guy she tells you not to worry about
"As usual, you need money to win money. Imagine that!"
Bro living in minecraft
Hi

"So if bases off wwilly wonka factory how many children have ummmm ""Vanished"" off screen and how many little orange slaves u got?"
Hey skedadudler
"The video is screaming ""I have a lot of money, and I want more"". And that's very sad."
its all fun and games until someone moves the big shipping container and you jump off to your doom
I shudder to think of the budget of this place. Wow.
Amazing room
I'm confused. Do people outside of the US get to come?
I love this
Im here 44 minutes in.
Shout out to the Bodega in Boston for the 'inspiration'
"As someone who lived with an engineer for 3 years, this was epic."
Amazing warehouse. Who needs Stark industries when you have Rober lab.
"Mr Beast: Builds Willy Wonka's chocolate factory
Mark Rober: Hold my engineering degree"
Mark Rober NEEDS TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE< NOT GLORIFY SHOOTING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AT KIDS FROM ABOVE.
YOU MADE RUSH E
@alphakennybody Sleyking123 was also joking
It's more like the Batcave than chocolate factory
Best Value! 85% of the customers pick this.🤔 Did the sales start before the video was uploaded?
wow mark that is insane I'm so happy that u where able to do this
"Now 22 million people know about your secret office

*Edit lol I just finished the video and now see it's not a problem"

Bro Sometimes I wish I was in this dudes family
"You are making a positive impact and changing the world inspiring so many of the future generation. That is a WIN in LIFE. Kudos, Mark ! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💯💯💯💯 I wish i could gift this to my son but im not sure if you ship to the Philippines..would've been awesome.☺️"
The fact that it's a secret lab and hes telling you it's secret but you see light from under the bookcase 😆

This is awesome
"I was wondering, when he had the warehouse with the logo in the floor for the ""Dom"" Video"
"I'm coming over to your office. With a sledgehammer to get inside your lab. After all...science 101...if the weighted end of my sledge hammer assisted by a vicious fulcrum action is employed, whatever material in front of my sledgehammer is GOING to break as long as the force and weight (and some other small things) of the sledge is greater than the strength of whatever the crap I'm hitting.

See you soon, Mark Rober. See you soon, my friend."
"I sent a roomba to Mars, buy my products."
Science!

"Also after the scammer payback video, i have an awesome idea for a vid!"
"Mark rober, you should make watermelomitor merch!"
"As someone who also hides secrets behind my fridge, this was epic."
He became a dad and now he's the biggest dad troll ever
Watermelometer is my new favourite word
Marks Videos just keep getting better and better
That moment when Anne frank
I didn’t expect Mark to invite Mr. Brown to the ultimate frisbee challenge. This is getting crazy
Super secret work space with light shining out from under the door/bookcase lol.

"As someone who works in an office, this was epic."
"Hey there I know Mr.Mark Rober probably isn’t going to see this but I was wondering if you could make a line of maybe more advanced cruch lab kits? I’m turning 16 in July and love putting stuff together for instance I have this BMX bike that has a “bed” on the back for fishing and I made a trailer for my kayak that attaches to it. The only problem with this is that I’m getting a bit big for it and i will have my drivers license soon, therefore there will be no point in having it. I would still love to sit down (or kneel down) and put stuff together. I was just wondering you don’t have to (obviously). Thanks"
"Of course, nailed it, totally out of the park there, Mark!! Love it!"
Egg

"Brilliant. I know what I will get my neice when she gets older, and my own kids, whenever that happens."
I am so jealous
"I REALLY want some Crunch Labs kits because I may be 14, but I have always loved physics and engineering. Thinking of getting a kit specifically for that (and from you!) is just so cool."
"As someone who specializes in fridge marketing, this was epic."
4:06 when ur parents dont buy u robux
RIP
Mark doesn’t  just make cheap videos with low effort he actually tries and each video he makes is always better than the last
"i think i know what you are referring to but, his videos are not cheap, but in fact are more planning that spending compared to other channels"
True!!!

"Hmm what video should I do next?
AHA a secret room!"
The secret place is just like in the movies.
"Hi Mark. Kiwico  was one of your  sponsors at some point, now are they a partner in this new venture?"

I have a question. How do people get the packages if they don’t live in the US?
"ah, I am a piano ""practiser"" and an engineer. Guess I never thought that they were so similar in terms of thinking :D"

"He needs some help on decorating walls, a little too much greens and blues"
"7:40, Foreshadowing? Or a red herring?"
Don't mind the huge bay doors to the outside. Better paint the outside garage doors to look like a wall. I'm just jelly.
How much is 1 crunch lab kit in riyals?

Does this office also have a mister Beast?
who else wishes they could do as much as Mark Rober?!
"Mark please hire me. I have a bachelors of science in EE and lots of expierence with rapid protyping equipment (3D printing, CNC, Laser etc) This would be such a cool job."
it's not very secret any more
Really throwing Kiwi co under like that huh.
Early
There was a building in my town called “strategic wealth management” and there was nobody in there ever🤔
one thing: you might want to think of a way to keep the light out from coming from under the bookshelf
I first thinked it was sponsored by Crunchyroll
"""My new Willy Wonka factory"" wait, you stole this from Jimmy😂"
"This is really cool, althought it's not much of a secret anymore lol"
Why is this like gravity falls
Is it just me or does Mark’s voice sound different?
Mkbhd and Mr Who's the Boss? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🤩
reminds me of kiwico
Why is this video making me tear up?
yay now i can beg my mother to buy that product :D
Where do I order it?
"I live in Switzerland 😢 so i didn’t can buy it, but the room is so cool 👌"
Plus 1 point to being best uncle
Isn't this just kiwi co
Did he rip off kiwiCo boxes
That is amazing
40min late
"What's the Cut at 13:28 for? If the button turns on the lights, there shouldn't be a cut in the video...
unless it doesn't turn on the lights."
I don’t think it’s cut. It looks like the lights just go on suddenly.
One of unnecessary cut
5:22 bruh im not
That’s what they all say
crazy how many views this has gotten and will get
You should try to do a flite test collab. All they do is engineer RC airplanes. They have designed multiple UAD that better the environment. It would be so great if you could do something because that has huge potential
you have my dream
"I discovered your channel in my first semester of mechanical engineering. I am in my fifth semester now, an I have to say, after difficult college times, your videos make me remember what engineering is all about."
I want crunch labs but have no money. and there's no way my parents will do it for me. a literal snowball forming in the center of the sun.
Congrats mark
"Oh cool, it's the ""look how i have way too much money"" video."
mark uploading and providing us with peek content again. What a legend
40 mins ago?
Mark every time you post a video I love it and watch all the way through they always make my day 👍
naming it crunchlabs does make me a little worried about worker conditions ...
Wow
"mark has the best videos on youtube
aways so creative"
Comment for the algorithm.
NO NORWAY?????????? 😭😭😭😭😭
Best video I have ever watched wish I could afford it😢
"This is legit, hands down, the most AMAZING thing I have ever seen. I mean, this is what I call every kid's dream. Mark Rober, you should invite Dude Perfect over there! You guys could make a trick shot video or something!"
Sheeeeesh
3000
What if you set up ANOTHER secret exit where you have to get a high score on the arcade or put in the Konami code or something
nice ripping off kiwi co mark
"Is the latest fad in the STEM YouTube space a whole lab. First LTT announces his lab, then you beat LTT to opening your lab. 

Props, sir. Your lab looks awesome."
I thoguth I was the only one that got their hand burn when using it
Cool
This is seriously something out of a movie. I would give a lot to have just a cool secret entrance like that.
Hi I’m mark rober and I made a secret meth lab from the dea
Wow! Coolio!
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
"Translations / subtitles would be beneficial to non-native speakers not only in order to build the project and learn the science/engineering behind it, but also as a way to study/practice the English language while having a lot of fun."
Definitively agree! I'm italian and there's no actual Italian youtube channel that does the same as mark's one! I would so much like to follow it myself (even though I'm well passed childhood 😅)
Servus
This would be so cool
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can anyone tell me the song that the chopsticks play
Mark Rober can you do a video where you make the best Beyblade that would be really cool
Mark this is incredible.
I'd love to have you as my uncle. The stuff you make is on another level
In under 30 minutes!!!!!!
You should post more I love your videos
Yo
this is so frickin cool
"But the office is so cool 😎

Fun fact:Antarctica is the largest unclaimed territory on Earth.

"You are like the human version of ""Dexter"" from Dexter's laboratory. 😄 Awesome Lab!!!"

Cool.
Mark Please write a book 📖 how to Think like Mark Rober ❤
WTG Mark
I have been watching since the first video 10 years ago and I was wondering Mark Rober can come to my house like would be crazy just imagine it.
"Thought his idea for the brainstorm room was much more common, the engineering lab at my university has the same whiteboard walls and it's where I do all my hw 👌"
and wheres the watermelon storage room
i wish i lived in the U.S. so that i could get the crunchlabs thing
I feel bad for the other uncles
You and Elon Musk are the coolest people to live
this is awesome I feel like im apart of the Lab already
^OwOv
"THAT IS SO COOL DUDE


hope you teach that in your science class 👍"
The world needs more Mark Robers and now you are helping to make them ! I had the odd teacher along the way similar to the way are but none as amazing as you! This is amazing and you are an amazing Human being.
Mark Rober Makes boring things so much more interesting. Mark Rober would have made 7th grade science soo much more fun
I'm a young kid and I love ur videos my dad is an engineer and he said he can relate to this kind of videos :)
hey mark? how much did all of this cost?
bruh.  dextor lab vibes. 😂😂4
(7:10)How is he still not the favorite Uncle ?!😂
"""The parents would ask me and I wouldn't know how to answer..."" except that's the same pitch you made when you were sponsored by kiwico..."

"Looks fantastic!! Call me boring, and I am genuinely interested, but how does your new space deal with dust - especially with all the construction that goes on? I can imagine the Hot Wheels tracks being quite susceptible. Industrial sized extractor fans?"
Hi
kiwico watching this like 0-0
Well here he is the Geinies
its not so secret if you show us XD
honest question: how is this crunch labs box different than the kiwico boxes?
"That is so cool, I will definitely be asking my mom"
That’s the coolest lab in the world
I’m pretty sure Mark has secured his place as the coolest uncle in history by now
I wish this was a thing when I was getting into engineering as a kid! I will still be an adult buying this tho
This guy would be the coolest uncle
this is something we all wished to have as a child
6:26 You forgot something. And that the light that explores under the bookshelf
Wait a second you just reinvented the fireman's Pole
This guy would be the coolest uncle
So cool!
whoa
Yayyy new upload !
Mark always makes my day
Ok
This is rad..
Huge blue light under the closet.
i like to think it's called crunch labs because of the sound fat Gus makes when he crunches into the walnuts
"Not so secret now, is it?
Edit : Sorry , did not watch the video all the way to the end."
"1:18 I know that sound, I saw it in fl studio"

the more i think about Mark Rober might be the brightest bulb in his generation
i will definitely buy a crunch lab product once it comes out
Lol
Nice to see Marquez there.
NEW POST!
How did you get the money for the crunch lab
"14:20 the two ant colonies may be at peace with the combined graveyard but just you wait mark
They could start rebelling agents each other (the Great Ant war will happen)"
"@lentokone toveriturbiini well we will see if the colonies start fighting each other, Mark better update up on the ants"
When he said he had two colonies I was instally like: Well that will not end well... Hope you are interested in seeing an ant war
Sir Mark Rober arise........
Mawk wober yeay!

Mark is living everyone’s childhood dreams
Children’s dream in a big room
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👈
Mother side uncle for me

If l touch anything in my dad's office he will tell me to STOP 🛑
Love what you are doing Mark.  Keep it up. :)
You have become a capitalist 🐷
I don’t know if this is intentional but number 9 is the nerf factory and in french 9 is neuf which is pronounced nerf I think
Reminds me of Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory
Can we get localized crunchlabs boxes pretty please? Specifically for kids non-mothertongue is quite a barrier!
You're the reason I am going to college for engineering. Seeing this whole crunchlabs concept makes me so happy.
me too.😀😀
5:30 Fire Hazard.
Mark is literally playing minecraft irl
charlie and the chocolate factory irl
Mark Rober is too smart for me
The Crunch Crates sound like Kiwico Crates.
It's not a work place it's kids dream
imagine missing the jump for the foam container
Ok so Mark Rober is the real world Dexter. Now where is DeeDee?
Very cool idea. You definitely help leave the earth a better place than it was when you found it.
You and Corridor Digital should have a Nerf Battle methinx :)
This is probably the coolest thing I have ever seen in my life
"Hope the redesign of the lobby deals with the light leakage under the bookcase, Mark ;)"
Woah this is amazing
Epic
Imagine having Mark Rober as uncle☺️
I'm finally early!
I am here
Guys I'm 2400
"16:27
Why you do that thanos!?"
"Being honest, You are so creative with everything you do.
We also need another squirrel obstacle course."
Congrats Mark! Your success is well earned!
"Rober is the definition of making the world a better place through passion and education. I love it. And him. I wish I could have been a kid when this stuff was around, or that I had a kid I could share these crafts with lol"
This is the best video ive ever watched

I have a computer.
"Is Kiwico just cool with this crunch box product? I don’t know that they have any IP on tinkerer kits, but just wondering how this is playing out from a business viewpoint."
LOve your stuff Mark

Mark notice me ❤😊

"Where’s 4.0, MARK"
Les goooo
Ayo I didn't noticed that I was kinda early 😂
First to like the vid
Hi Mark!
"me being 21 years barely passing my engineering course, im not gonna get the chance to visit the crunch lab. well guess i stick to watching than"
Mark Rober living his best life
You forgot lab in the Title @Mark Rober
Amazing keep it up🙂
I like how this is just literally like Tony Stark's Workship
With the piston pole thing make one but it makes you go up instead of down
"I see the ant farm, but where is the squirrel farm? *kidding*"
"Mark is there internation shipping 
ps: im from egypt and i really want to try crunch labs"
Wish I could be there.
This is a 8 year olds dream it blows my mind on how lit this is
"I have a question, isn’t the crunch box very similar to what kiwico does"
YOOOOO NEW VID
the first time i see a video form u that wasnt posted like 2 years ago lol
mr whoes the boss is there omg
You're amazing. ❤️😂
300 thousand views in 35 minutes. only mark rober

"Mark I hope you see this. But does Crunchlabs go overseas to New Zealend or not? love the content, all the best, stay safe"
Your green best keep it up
My son and I would have so much fun there! Wish I could build something like this!
Yay mars rover back at err again

this is what my dream was to
2:06 me when i sit on a light chair
Thi is amazing and I really want to come to that where house plus build those packs but sadly I’m going to camp this summer.
"Single-handedly making science COOL again, and for a whole new generation of nerds! If I was not an atheist, I'd say that you're dong the Lord's work."
You are amazing!
not very secret anymore.
"""Platinum ticket""? Bit of on-the-nose Dahlian egotism happening with this guy . . ."
never been this early!!!
mark makes me suspicious of everything :(
Mark rober is carrying the crunch labs yt channel its gaining 10 subscribers every second lol
I’m early?
i did a science and engineering project i grew halophile bacteria and its still going today
Insane!
3:21 i genuinely thought i was about to get rickrolled there XDD
you never fail to impress
"Wait, foam pit, tennis ball launcher, breaking world records and a factory that is out of a ""fantasy"".. hmm feel like I've seen this before."
This vid was awesome the fact that he can build a new thing every month is awesome
Absolutely beautiful.
"If Mark isn't the favorite uncle, then I'll be a monkey's uncle."
Pls do squirrel obstacle course 3
Ordered! Awesome!
Mark always coming in with the engineering heat. Love this guy's passion and ambition!
Anybody else notice that you can still see the lights under the bookshelf even when it is closed?
coooooooooooooooooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I WANT A SECRET PASSAGEWAY!!! My grandparents house has one in the attic. I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!! I needed a laugh!!!✌
wow!
It's like the Fantasy Factory in present day!
Who else wishes they're science teacher was MARK ROBER
Nice but is it not just kiwi Co With Mark rober
oh wow
Mark Rober doesn’t post often but when he does he post the best videos you can find
Can you make a rail gun?
wow!!
16:05 I think I can just look for the dart hole in the box.
You don't pick the box yourself bum they ship it out randomly
I'm positive they cover the hole or something but yeah that's what I was thinking
Yeah nobody saw that light under bookshelf …
LESS GOOO
What type of engineer are you as i am struggling what to do for my alevels starting in September
"How much electric engineering is in science, especially yours being very interested in becoming a electric engineer I would love to be able to help one day"
That's a big secret
3:51 WHY DO THE PLUSHIES MOVE AT  3:51
"Ok, it's Amazing."
This is just wow 👍
Mark was feeling nostalgic lol🤣
Dude seriously ? You gonna copy Kiwi co?
Mark! That looks so freaking amazing!! You are the best! Much love bro! Watching from the great state of Alaska on the beautiful Kenai Peninsula!
That's so awesome and beautiful.  Sharing so much with a community of people.  AMAZING!  Thank you for your hard work.
Was the mouse hole for the hot wheels from the tennis ball gun
Sadly I’m not a kid anymore so I cannot buy those boxes and find the ticket 😢
I am watching your videos for about 3 years now and you never disappointed me . I am only having 1 word to say hats off to your work
Mark just betrayed kiwiko lol
"I know I have been clickbaited but I don't care. I am going to enjoy this, I hope. Thank you <3"
Well its not a secret anymore...
Dude I have nothing but admiration for you. Congrats on filling your life with things so cool every single day
"Hi Mark,

Loved the video, but you might want to make sure that kids don’t try to hit flames on candles on their own. Who knows what might happen if they hit the candle causing it to fall over😅"
on time and I know nobody asked
When u have a ton of money laying arround u can do a lot of things
Does anybody have a link to the couch featured at 3:33 ?
This is absolutely amazing!
this is my childhood dream in video form
They need to make more of the guy!
this is increadible
"Wait, that one box ist just a claymore. I think kids are going to love this"
"This secret room does look like something Mr Beast would make. ‘10,000 dollars if u hit the target’"
"i haven't even gotten 2 minutes into the video, but when mark rober says ""most ambitious thing ive ever done"" im INSTANTLY interested."
I Just Opened A Door To The Backrooms!
Best Video to have on my birthday
🫡
lesss go
8 MINUTES AGO?!
Make a pole that slides you. Pole moves up.
"Bro, you're literally the new Bill Nye the Science Guy. You're living the dream and making the world a better place. Keep up the great work."
This comment couldn't be more true
That pulls the heartstrings a bit
"@markrober literally stole his Own sponsor's idea, kiwico  🚨"
Real life doraemon.. Haha 😂
Who?
I loved seeing my favorite tech channels briefly show up in Mark Robert vid. Can LTT take a tour? I'd love to watch that!
Much love for having us come by to film some rad drone shots! Had a great time at the new HQ 😊🙏
I WANT U AS AN UNNNCCCLLLEEEEEEEEEE
"Oh hi Mark, nice work station"
"The ant farm is such a cool addition! But then again so are all the of other features. Seems to me like an ADHD workplace haven, and I wish I could be there!"
"That Warehouse is so cool! Your nephews and other kids probably have the time of their lives in there

Question: Did you design your warehouse or no?"
I am sure his son loves it !! Blessings from California. 🚀
"Im glad you got your dream warehouse Mark 

And i love your videos, i have been watching them for about a year ❤"
@Mark Rober I want to make a house like your warehouse. Full of secret ways and passages
"@Mark Rober because you're super talented that you can build a robot that can do all the work for you, even my hamster thinks your cool."
What part of our history together makes you think I didn't design this?!?  Of course I didn't pound every nail in but this is like a dream come true for me would never outsource the design!!!
I'm looking at buying this duplex. I was thinking of a pneumatic platform and outer pole to glide you down. It was also softly reset.
Nice Warehouse
This guy is frickin' awesome!
Professor Oak disapproves you were riding Your bike indoors
only downside is you can see light coming through bottom of secret entrance
Schw
This is SO COOL!
"Hey Mark, I forgot to tell you. Did phabulous Gus make a boy or girl?"
Bro put his life on the line to be shot by his childhood hero XD
Crunch lab Supreme
So sad crunch labs realized just when i was past the target range
"I'm curious, what does your son think about this? I'm wondering how autistic children would like this. Is it meant to be done by a child independently? I know my brother might get frustrated when he can't do something easily, but hopefully one of us will be able to help him."
You just inspired millions of children....and adults
"I'm so happy for what you have accomplished. I've been following you since 2016, and I've became one of the biggest fans!"
"Half an hour, 300,000 views."
This is so awesome Mark!!! I love all the little details you put in and how it's all so Mark Rober-y! It's clearly an engineer's hideaway if there ever was one! I've been wondering what the space you did your domino video in was and now we know! Nice work!!
He really does amazing work
Yup!
this is super creative
CrunchLabs sounds like it needs a Dude Perfect collab
THIS is why i wait 1 month to watch mark's videos
so amazing
KiwiCo be like :o
This is seriously something out of a movie. I would give a lot to have just a cool secret entrance like that.
My little girl is gonna have a blast watching me have fun with the Crunch Lab boxes.
Platinum ticket !?  Mark is the new Willy Wonka except for cool toys instead of chocolate.
True
I am so happy that Youtube clicks can make dreams come true for you.
"Mark Rober, AKA Batman."
This is not nice bro im broke so I cant visit lol
Real life Dexter laboratory
International shipping?
You are an absolute gem of a person this is fantastic. The enthusiasm and happiness for this place in your voice is infectious. I will definitely be getting some for my son/myself. I have loved your videos for a long time. Can wait to see more and see the boxes.
i loved this idea
i been waiting and i am super excited for the vid
"We now know mark, can someone send me his location ☺️"
"I love this! I have always wondered what it is like being around you, but the video shows most of it :)"
"Hey Mark, the lab is amazing! Sounds like your piano might need tuning, though... Nudge-nudge wink-wink. 😉"
This is a kids dream I would live her and not go anywhere else
Dude this secret lair looks awesome and litttt😎🤘🔥 keep up the amazing work mark and hope you're having a safe and blessed day as always stay lit
True
Always love initiatives to help kids. Keep it up.
"16:20  Mark:  ""I'm no statistician...""               Mark is to Statistician as NASCAR is to Pinewood Derby."
This feels like a Rick and Morty episode

"I love mark’s idea about the crunch labs! I wish I had that opportunity when I was younger. However, I would love to see something similar for high schoolers as well. I think it would be a great addition and would awaken the excitement for science, math, and engineering that has been vacuumed away by boring and unenthusiastic teachers."
Yes
"woah, thats so cool"
Dude that awesome
DUDE!
i need this
I thought this was a NileGreen video
Hacksmith may be the real life Tony Stark but you are the real life batman.

Yay! Another Mark Rober video!
Thank you so much Mark Rober these boxes will help me pursue my hope of being an engineer one day

MARK YOUR BACK ITS BEEN A WHILE
Did Mark just rip off Kiwi Co.?.
He didn’t
No.

Cool.
Yessir
I had to double check if this was actually mark rober because Nile green trained my brain.
9:22 that's actually kinda cool
Literally my childhood dream.
11:27 references The Mario Effect.
Wait no you want it to be up
"Mr Beast, Mark, and Zach King need to have a lair duel"
"Mark,

I Have Watch Your Vids for 2 years And I love Every Single one You Have been My Hero. If You Have read this Plz respond I Would Love If I Could See You in Real Life Plz Consider😊😁"
P.S That Base Is Sooooooo cool😉
You can get there from the huge garage door in the middle of the secret warehouse 🤣
All hail fat gus
Holy crap these are actually like affordable it looks like too. You continue to be awesome
dam
I had to double check if this was actually mark rober because Nile green trained my brain.
Money definitely buys happiness.
I'm sure every business owner everywhere loves that you've told people to move and play with everything in every office they ever visit.
4:16 don’t jump when she shipping container has moved. Then you can use it to ship you to the hospital
"Have to ask, is this the room where all the dominoes were layed?"
This is so cool
It really is!
I'm totally going to sign up for that
im a big fan
I’m also a big fan
"I got an underground lab too ! 
I make dmt tho"
This is amazing!
Yup! It really is
OSHA has entered the chat
I wish my grandsons were just a bit older (5 & 2) I would send for this in a heartbeat!
This is so COOL!
Finally a new video!
"Claim your here within an hour here!

o hi mark
Gravity Falls
John-Caleb Bradberton!
The only issue is there is light showing under the secret door. ;(
grunkle stan irl
Why not just have the seat automatically go down
The secret that a couple million people know about
Still not as cool as Zach King's warehouse 😜
Epic
Well....Kiwi co are gonna be out of business within the month lol
Dude this video is literally the most epic thing I ever seen
"This is absolutely awesome-- I love the pneumatic pulley system. I'm a bit older now but I know that if I were in a younger age group that you're targeting, I would have absolutely LOVED doing projects like this, and I also really appreciate the pretty affordable pricing so that a lot of kids can get their hands on it. Really awesome stuff, Mark! :)"
More kids will learn more science on this channel than in public schools - what does this say America?
The ball going through the wall is like that one episode of Malcolm in the Middle where Hal makes a baseball launcher that busts a hole through his garage.
Wow. Hey siri define mark rober. This is exactly what I think would pop-up. LOVE U MARK KEEP IT UP DOG
I think I can speak for everyone when I say we are all so lucky to have mark  🙃
Mark Robert I have a video for you on my channel for team sea my channel is acebadger vk
u have to pay to get to the balcony faster. *enginir*
This is so cool Mark! I wish I could come here!
I fell like colinfurze would love this place
"""Every time someone learns critical thinking a conspiracy theory dies!"" Thank you!"
But a lot of conspiracy theorys are real
honestly the title read like a nile green video
"So, you're saying you have made a claymore for children and instruct them how to build it? Hilarious"
Cool
Cool
that is super cool dude!!
"Weird question, but don't secret passages run into issues with fire safety standards?"
I'm 26 and just finished my first year of my mechanical engineering degree. You were a big reason that I chose mechanical engineering and I still wish to be like you one day.
Mark really just built himself a super villain lair.
Hi
Wish i had crunch labs when i was a kid
I love everything you are doing in this video and how you are representing the engineering community
best video
The secret room behind the bookshelf is the cherry on top.
I just found this video
Ah. Kiwicrate.
thats insane
you are a watermelon war criminal
10:27 30 views in 4 hours??  No way is that Mark Rober.
@redu  I wonder that too
yes i wonder why this video on a channel that nobody knew about only has 30 views
Will you please tune the player piano?
This is absolutely insane
Mark never disappoints
"Thank you for making smart cool, I feel like you should be the channel of choice for all parents that raise kids with an ipad"
Glad to see MKBHD in this video
That is AMAZING. How did you think of that?
how do you always come up with your ideas? My problem is that i dont know how what would be cool to do?!
wow that's awesome
Nice
OMG
"I'm so glad that STEAM kits are a thing now. Growing up, kits sucked (look at any of nerdecrafter videos for the endless examples). Too bad even my friends don't want kids XD"
So awesome! Can I come visit?
who else thinks the mouse hole came from that canon
I can’t believe the Crunch Labs channel was made on October 27 and now he reveals it. I wonder if anyone discovered it before this video.
Did anyone else click the video without even reading the title?
I love it mark but what about something for high schoolers
"Love these vids, keep it up"
Science class would be 10000x better if Mark was the science teacher
It reminds me of Batman’s layer. It’s now my dream to go there!
Says ages 8-12+....does that include 30 year olds? :D
So bro made the Kingsman Lair IRL ??
Will there be multilingual versions of the instruction videos? I'm from germany and I want to give it to my brother who does not have English capabilities at a sufficient level yet.
Amazing
"Yep, this is more important than my exams."
Is it only in America if it is it now s ok love you videos
ok
It’s all fun and games until a kid pulls the fire alarm thinking it’s the entrance to a secret laboratory
Great video keep it up
Are you hiring 😂🥸
"The mirrors don't become invisible, the lights just turn on in the other room."
Can I pls be in a vid with you???
i wish i had this
Hm
Thats sooo COOL! Lets just think of all the effort you put in your vids! <3
Just Amazing
"Best rhyme ever:
Team trees team seas and my buddy mr beast"
Wow
Just gotta comment on this: Mark called this a “Willy Wonks Factory of Engineering”…and MrBeast just did the whole actual Willy Wonka Factory
I was really excited about the crunch labs thing and i literally asked my mum to buy it for me and then i found out that they dont do it for uk :( 😭😭
You should make a trick shot video with dude perfect based on the disc launcher.
Adres?
I’m getting a feeling that the tooth decay poster joke wasn’t a joke…
Yea. Big secret when millions of people can see that. My closet is more secret than this.
This is super cool! Honestly I have no words that can describe how amazing all of your videos are
"244,000 views in 30 minutes! wow..."
No way you got Nitro. Sooooo cool
E
Lol
pVz music gives me nostalgia
"Let me in
LET ME IN
I NEED THIS"
Mark and MrBeast are doing more for the world than ALL the cowntry leaders.
tiny desk engineer. you need a tiny desk engineer. look it up.
GO MARK GOOOOOO
You'd see a huge brightly lit space below a bookshelf...
"Hi Mark, love your project's! Keep up the great work! 😀"
amazing
I take a bite out of these videos and gain information though the taste and satisfaction of these videos. None of your videos leave any taste sour but sweet in a strawberry pie type of way.  you must be on a time crunch to get these out when you were doing your warehouse.
Very cool
Can you please make it possible to deliver here in Switzerland that would be awesome !! 🙏 I want my 10 y-o sister to do more intelligents stuffs than playing video games 😅
Nice
Every popular YouTuber has a nerf armory
this is a straight science fiction fantasy to me
IN CO GEE DOH 😅
"6:52, mark goes into the backrooms"
"Forget the builds and invention, I'm in love with his secret base!"
So Mark rober is starting a meth lab?
Let it to Mark to come through in a crunch. Thank you for the tour and educational kits.
W
Idk if I would notice the big light gap under that bookshelf
the secret is that theres a underground obstacle course for all the bosnian children he has kidnapped
Hello
Just wow
hi
You have out done yourself Mark once again!
It looks normal
you are amazing!!
Hi
"To bad I live in Europe and never gonna the light of this warehouse any time soon

And I am *very* into engineering"
why arent u my uncle
Venting
"I'm new to this channel, and this guy amazes me. He's a real life Willy Wonka for sure!"
It's happening y'all this guy's actually turning into a superhero
"""Keep the lab location super secret.""
*Camera pans over to bookcase with light from the secret passage shining out from underneath.*"
Mark never fails to disappoint us.
"Wow i mean, WOW, not only a phenomenal engineer but compassionate, empathetic and an all round morally decent human being and those crunch labs kits are an awesome idea, especially the Willy Wonka style ticket to come play in your engineering dream factory very VERY well done Mr Rober"
What a great guy
w o w
"Sure wish I could actually buy this, me being 15 my dad expects a lot more from me and It's pretty overwhelming, I never got a chance to learn the basics from anyone in my life, but Mark completely changed engineering for me, thank you so much Mark! I'm hoping I could learn mechanical engineering myself by actually building things :)"
W
I was here
This cool but y  Denny's  of all places 😂
This is the dream i couldnt get as a child
Yes quite the secret... we are all now aware of. Oops
I would do anything to get in there Mark! That’s now one of my bucket list things is to be there with you! Your one of idols
"Also, I love science and have always looked up to you! I completely love the idea of this and secret rooms are my passion"
You’re*
2:23 thats how s&s space shot towers work
Mark
Wow this is amazing mark and your the best engineer on YouTube
KIWI CO ?😐
"When he had ""225"" as being to heavy, I felt that."
I love the idea of all these cool projects I personally thing I want to be an engineer and the fact the I have the chance to do this is just amazing
"Don’t think this is a lab, more like a playground, but close enough"
Love the new vid ever times they come out i am happy to see them
"every video he makes has the words ""the passed year and a half ive been secretly building/working on this"""
30 min ago wow
I wonder where this guy would have ended up if he chose marketing instead of engineering
lol
Mark would really be the coolest uncle. He is playful like a child yet incredibly smart and wish to teach the younger generations. Amazing youtuber
"Great video Mark I hope to visit Crunch Labs one day, just meed to fly from Melbourne, Australia to California!"
dang engineer jest want all humans to be a engineer sonds like some thing i herd of naw...
"Imagine a collab between Mark Robert, Colin Furze, Stuff Made Here and The Hacksmith!!!"
Imagine being there...I would live there..
Actually cool :0
This is amazing
AMAZING WORK MARK!!
"""We stole this from a dennys"""
He went from Mark Rober to Mark Robber
Wow
Shipping costs more than the box ):
"Mark I love your videos, but you really need to use some new background songs in these videos. Just mix it up a bit!"
"Love your videos, keep it up"
"11:09 that month's cog wheel will have the word ""Ottawa treaty"" on? ;)"
4:37 am I the only one who noticed that really looks like mkbhd?
Not all heroes wear capes but some build ninja warrior courses for squirrels
"This is an absolute dream. You have been my inspiration for as long as I can remember. I am 14 and my goal is to become a mechanical engineer, you have been my inspiration to succeed, thank you! Easily won the cool uncle award in my opinion!"
"""I built a massive secret lab""

*This is where he is building the mini-nuke for glitterbomb 6.0*"
Hello
"Mark is just casually turning into batman, he's already got a bat cave"
"you made yourself a ""Dexter's Lab""
Living the dream"
Warehouse sponsored by Dennys Coca Cola and Nerf.
YO IM EARLY YAY
"this dude is dope, he just made my dream secret hangout"
The perfect combination of being fun as a kid and being nerdy as a scientist. What a banger of an Office Mark!
mark thinks he's grunkle stan lol
I want one 😍
"I'd have loved this when I was a kid, though I learnt about flywheels by combat bots and Hypnodisc."
Thanks for the smile I have.
This is so COOl
Only problem with the super secret bookcase entrance is the light being very visible under the bookshelf.
Rob Dyrdek looks different than I remember.
That is so cool
Wow
I want my parents to get this box for my brother! I might if they don't. We're all engineers (or getting there) but he's not at college yet. It's time to really show him our passion! I'm tempted to get one for myself. Or try to make my own with the equipment I have. This would be so exciting for me to get especially as a kid. Thank you so much!
"I have a question, how long will Mark be making crunchlabs?"
this is the first time in my life i wish i were in the usa
28 minute mark! Yay
That is so lit
Glad you’re helping kids that want to be engineers. I remember when I wanted to do the same as a kid that found your channel
Noice
Me being a kid “ MOM I LNOW WHAT I WNST FOR MY BIRTHDAY ‼️CRUNCH LABS!”
Nice
How much did this cost XD
"This is giving me DUED PERFECT warehouse vibes but in a Science way, I LOVE IT!!!! great warehouse🙌🏽"
WHendwadsdwa dwasd is a and then thats why Mark Rober is and has it with a lot of and a ton of funny
I challenge you to make liberty prime from fallout 3 and 4
These machines are getting more and more crazier! 🔥
I love the now discontinued nerf automatic peruses!!!!! ♥️
I am so jealous

"Hold up, is it 49.50 per MONTH for international shipping to Canada?"
Wow i'm so early great vid (:
"Mark, do you have any plans on doing Crunch Lab boxes for adults?? Bc I’d be so down"
Straight out of a movie
wow this is amazing
YO
Love to content!
"7:55 ""Three of my favorite things are teaching, coming up with new ideas, and getting people stoked about science and engineering.""

We need teachers like you Mark!"
"Please Mr Rober, we’re begging you, post a video on how to make the glitter bombs so we can get back the porch pirates in our neighborhood PLEASE!!!"
Claim “here before 1 million views” here
this is so cool! keep creating mark!
I really want to be a Veruca Salt and ask for that stadium. NAH IM JOKING. You deserve it Mark. Hard work sure does pay off
Video #3 of commenting about Graze the Roof being in Mark's video playlist
21 minutes late
Hi I love your vids
omg
"Bro.. WOW! I mean, WOW! This is incredible."
ayo why he got elon musk flamethrower

yes
“Always check the bookshelf in an inventors office”
"I love how Mark refused to make the entrance to his secret base a book, instead making it a knickknack.

No cliches on his watch.

Except, I guess, for a bookshelf secret entrance..."
Ello
Only Mark Rober and Mr. Beast would say they built a giant secret lab behing a bookshelf
Did you copy kiwico?
I want a carrier like this where I enjoy what I do or make😂🇰🇪
yooo
Trailmakers ez
Make a serial code on each ticket so nobody makes their own
First thousand.
The crunch labs project is not available in my country(uae)
"Soooo, where can I get one?"
This is amazing Mark! I can't believe the progress you've made on educating the world over the years. Its absolutely mind-blowing and honorable. Congrats on your biggest project yet. <3
Would love to see Colin Furze and Mark Rober collaborate on a crazy engineering project.
3:18
Hi
I have never been more jealous of someone in my life. This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen
Marques Brownlee the professional frisbee player 👀
Mark's got his own DPHQ2 now.
This is AWESOME !
wut
I want to be your niece and nephew.
walter white irl
i want this for my gaming room
Yesss
you revolutionized a work area that is fun for your employees and doesnt make them bored ever
"Imagine owning that...
Nevermind I can't ."
Rob Dyrdek has inspired so many people with these warehouse's and it's awesome. So many people get these big spaces and do their own Fantasy Factories. Dope 👍
I’m pretty sure you secure your spot as the favorite uncle in every video
what about that massiv gab under the bookshelf where the light shines?
Before this I was like “What is taking him so long to make a video?” Now… I feel like waiting all that was worth it
This is a dreamhouse necessity for sure.
"Welp, it seems like KiwiCo is gonna have some competition"
I’m really hoping to see future updates
"I Was Here! 199,233 views"
I wonder where he gets these out ideas
I would just turn on the sink and turn it off then I can still get high fives
me when dronks
"Looking forward to the future Mark. CrunchLabs looks exciting!!

Love the cameos."
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Btw love the retro 70's design of the office
Fir- wait no 199733rd!
This guy never gives up
"Mark please view this!! Ever since I saw your videos when I was 6, I was inspired by you, I tried to send you a letter but I lost it. You are the whole reason that I want to be an engineer when I grow up. My youtube channel is too, even though I do coding. You are my #1 idol by a gazillion."
ur mom
drop me a like to prove u read your comments and also thanks for the new vid been waiting alot :)
Fully was expecting Marques to say : *...So I've touring this space for two weeks and I must say it's pretty dope*
The one problem with the bookcase design is that you can see light from the lab beneath the bookcase so maybe if you have some type of curtain maybe on the other side of the bookcase to stop that light then it can be even less detectable but idk I’m not that creative so you can probably come up with something better than that
"Great stuff Mark, Bravo Zulu Amigo."
"This is really a great thing you’re doing. I had some learning toys as a kid I used to build things with. I used those skills to do other things in life. The secret lab is the highlight though. I wanted to do that, too, but probably not as well as you’ve done."
Time to buy the entire stock
"the only sad part about the platinum ticket is if u dont live in the us, but oh well, its impossible to have it perfect :p
but ik my lil bro is gonna love the box, thx for making it"
woohoo
Yay!
"Mark's quest to be the best uncle:
Mission accomplished 
Respect+"
FIRST
There’s already 1.3K comments though….?
U are?
bro wanted an escape room work area lol
Crunch labs
13:27 liquid crystal with a voltage through it so that the crystals align to be see through
So instead of getting sposored by kiwico you just became them
"mark you don't know what have you done
you just made every engineers dream real."
"As i comment, it's about 3am..."
""" this is my secret lab"" proceeds to tell how to get in and where it is kept"
E
Farside comic makes me so happy
I love the new vid
Bro one day he is going to take over the earth with his inventions 😂
I know that Stan Pines is trying to sue him for this…..
He uploaded
mark can you help me do scince please
"I literally cried with this video. You are such amazing people, with an incredibly huge heart"

"Loves the vids and inspiration Mark, keep it up! Waiting for my son to turn 3 and I'm definitely signing him up for this. 👍"
Willy wonka vibes
Thank you for your channel...from his keep the cats  out of my garage video...
Im broke and i live in the phillipines soo i cant get the box and im sad mark can you make it buyable in my country please i really want this box and have a chance to go to your secret warehouse but i cant because i live in the phillipines so im sad😥😥😥
Cool Video but isn't your bulding box just a copy of KiwiCo's concept?
This is literally everyone's dream
Bro how🫠
CRUNCH LABS vs. KiwiCo.  Let the battle begin.... :D
I'm surprised you don't want to keep this secret to yourself.  If I made one I might.
Can an inexperienced person build with you?
GOOFY AHH ADVERTISEMENT
you can see the hallway under the bookcase!!
me scanning the qr code and realizing its not anything special :(
nice kiwico knockoff
This is so cool great job
R.i.p mark rober
Hi
Hi
Let's goo a new upload!!
Mark has soo many pro friends like bro sharing is caring
MKBHD and MRWHOSETHEBOSS HELLO?!?!
these things were my childhood dream too lol
Yup
"Wow, it's been a while since I last heard the word beyblade"
Same yeah
I found a ticket in one Whipple-Scrumptious Fudge-Mallow Delight Wonka Bar.
MKBHD cameo! 😯

"Okay, my kids are in college. I’m gonna buy one of these for me!"
E
"OMG MARK IM SO CLOSE TO BEING 1 HOW IVE POSTed this comment when this was 24 mins but its got 177,888 veivws HOW HOW"
This is like every kid’s dream! What a fantastic place to work!
The light from the hallway bleeds through the bottom of the bookcase pretty badly
If a parent asks you how to get their kid a head start in engineering and your first answer isn't FIRST robotics you should rethink your answer.
Love ur vids please give me a shout out
177166th
Bruh u finally post
Poggerz
mark rober has just lost his kiwi co sponsership
nice
"Dind´t u just completly stole kiwi cos idea? I get that u still put a lot of work in it, but its basically the same thing that they do and u even head a sponsorship from them a lot of times."
I just watched a 17 minute advert and  ... I loved it : ))
Do the naughty kids get a round with nitro?
e
Dr.Beast
wat
Ah yes the platinum ticket
Its a kiwi co by mark rober what else could i want
That seems very similar to kiwi co
Who? I don’t think so
"He's like the Hollywood version of Colin Furze. Better looking, more money, less talented."
this Platinum Ticket is beyond words level of genius...wow
Hmm mm coca cola.... Mmmmmm
Hi
I'm the average person and I found it...
"MrBeast, Mrwhosetheboss, MKBHD, Mark Rober

BEST COLLAB EVER POSSIBLE"
Mark I have always loved your channel but for some reason I fell like you are now more focused on money than the channel
This is how Batman really started. With Glitter Bombs and Nerf guns in a secret room behind a shelf.
"I may live in a whole other continent,
But i still love your video.
If i lived in America i would buy your package.
Hope you post soon. Bye"
$$$
Mark! I'm starting engineering school as a mature student come September. It's your incredible enthusiasm and outreach in videos like these that inspired me to take this leap. I want to be just like you when I grow up! ;)
Kiwi co. is gonna be mad
W video
hello
Kids dreams be like:
If you are reading this you are minutes early
WHAT
6:26 light leaks under your book case.
"And here I thought Colin Furze had the craziest engineering ideas on Youtube. Also, really happy for Mark that he can live out his dreams. Well deserved!"
Will videos be available in Spanish? Very intrigued for my little brother. Feel like he may have potential he's just currently in México. Awesome video regardless.
Why does it feel like the whole lab was designed to cater for children?
"Looks like 9yo me having fun with marker and paper.
I WANT IT."
Why are you copying Mr. Beast
Now Mark shows that he actually never grew older than the age group he wants to work with the most... Just that he's a child with a huge sum of money now.
Suiii
"Reminds me of the fantasy factory, but for engineering. Dope."
HELO THIS IS LIKE AMAZIN PLS REPLY MARK
Nice
that pvz music hit different...
the light under the bookshelf gives the position of the lab away.
AHAHAHA!!! (that horn on the bike!!😆)
That cool
The Zelda audio clip reminds me of the day I received my gold cartridge copy of the legend of Zelda for my birthday and Christmas by the way Yes what year was that 87
love you
Just. Just wow! 🤩
What if im not from us how do i get a box?
The amount of progress u have made over the past few years has been astonishing.
Mark really out here living all of our childhood  (and adult)  dreams
yes
it’s no longer a secret lol
kiwico watching this video: -_-
This was really cool
My Minecraft base in a nutshell
Hi
i don't know why but my main takeaway from this video is that i have decided to dedicate my life to beating the hot wheel track record
Could my parents buy a crunch lab box/creation in germany ?
I watched like all your vids
"nobody will ever know!----162,404 people as of 6/15/2022: interesting"
"11:24, ah yes, pi = e = 3 and sin(x) = x"
U should make a soccer goalie
It reminds me of Gravity Falls lab.
You never fail too amaze me
Lol if someone breaks in mark will just blast them with his tennis ball launcher
"""Deversion of expectations = comedy"" 
Now that's a golden quote if I've ever heard one"
"about to finish secondary sch planning to study engineering in the future u make it look fun, hopefully it is"
Genuine question.  Why is he always yelling?
I mean it kinda looks like a knockoff fantasy factory
That is one long advertisement. And I don't mind.
Mark you e inspired me to become an engineer I'm my future and I have an idea I would love to see you make... I had the idea of a taser that uses static electricity
Mark Rober and MrBeast are slowly becoming each other.
"he is finally upgrading from the workbench my a ""subtle"" margin"
Willy Wonka was a visionary
4:38 is this Marques Brownlee? Form MKBHD
@*visible confusion* no... he still does... He talked about it in his podcast. It's kind of the NFL of ultimate frisbee and he's real into it
Marques used to play in a Frisbee league  before doing youtube full-time
@Tony Thompson oh it is
Yes
I love this
I love ya mark
Thanks
if there is a small hole in your box you basically won
This is so cool
mark rober is like the willie wonka of  chocolate  science
Wonder what sheldon has to say about all the engineers there🤣
OMG I want the boxes
"I’m definitely getting the crunch labs boxes for my little brother, we have been fans for years now and you haven’t disappointed us once! Love the vids and impatient to see more of your secret lab!"
Mark Rober Does not upload often but when he does im here lol
"Will the month to month be available for the first drop? I would love to try this, but I just don't have the money for 12 months."
perfect if the cops raid your office
I am cat
"Am not sure about the whole toilet seat thing, but im gonna trust you that i wont break and get stuck lol"
All of his fans breaking in
Net video building a mars base.
"Gravity falls reference, in the gravity falls anniversary?"
I saw a rubiks cbe are you a cuber?
I love Mark Rober and all he does
"Glad it's not called ""Crouch Crabs"""
gamer
"DEXTERS SECRET, DEXTERS SECRET"
How do you get all the nerf ammo back 🤔
"Ok everyone..I'll tell you a story..my youngest  son  love his LEGOS...then he got started with K'nex...this is roller-coaster  inside his room across half the house..now he in the Navy get this building  Navy  Aircraft  Carriers..so all started from Legos...I'm so proud 👏 🥲 

."
Grunkle stan?
I can tell someone will be making a whole video about trying to find the lab
is it me or does his voice sound different
There was so many things I legit forgot about the tennis ball launcher lmao
Oi
"""I'm gonna give you guys a hint"" proceeds to show the exact method of getting in"
"MARK ROBER
MARS ROVER"
Sounds like kiwico
Love it great work I wish I could do stuff like this in boring iowa
"note to self, if ever get the chance to meet mark and visit his lab, remember to close the toilet bowl"
"additional note, wash hand, never use the air fresher and look at light just in case"
Mark Rober is going to be a billionaire.
Great  job I like this I have  learned alot!
Certified Greg moment.
The bright light coming from under the bookcase isn’t a dead give away or anything 😜
i love this youtube channel mark
Mark mind if I work here
Man’s built the setting of a Disney channel sitcom
So we’re not gonna talk about the mkbhd visit
"Honestly, I'd rather pay the same to have a shop filled with some Haas and Doosan mills."
"Can't wait for some kid to get a box with a ticket in it for their birthday, and never open it"
You can easily spot the secret entrance by the glow under the shelf 6:26
So that is where he has been keeping NileGreen.
Amazing! Did anyone else clock the light under the bookshelf?
The light under the Bookshelf is a little obvious.
Congrats mark 🎉
so cool
"As a future mechanical engineer, this leaves me in awe. I love this love. I think I might have a crush on Mark now. LOL"
Mark you are a legend
The light coming from under the secret door gives away the secret door.
this guy is like a better vesion of Elon Musk! also how do you cleean out the ant farm?
I got in trouble for touching everything at my dentists. No secrets found
"""secret entrance"" *has a massive glowing light coming under the crack under the bookcase *
also you're gonna lose so many nerf balls and darts in that foam container"
I love all you're vids
i was tne 869th subscriber of crunch labs
dam i get it
This is awesome
What does kiwi co think of this?
Its like Kiwico But on Steroids
Best video so far...
this is just a mr beast video with different editing
"I bet everyone has thought at least once ""Wouldn't it be cool to have a secret room behind a bookshelf""

Mark just went ahead and did it 😂"
"@PMLGMR What are you talking about, John Green is doing great."
"He wasnt the first one though, but it didnt really end well with them..."
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing amazing amazing. You are doing more for our kid's future than many school systems these days. Kudos Mark. Ingenious ideas.
It's no longer a secret
"Mark Rober, you are the best, can you make a video on computer programming
I am a big fan of that and you"
Bro that ball hole was smoking 💀
This video made me smile and shed a tear. You have truly stepped up to this new upcoming generation for the STEM fields.
Nice work Nurk FPV!
YAY HE POSTED

I have…


You can see a mysterious definitely not suspicious blue glow under the bookshelf at 6:26."
"Absolut GOAT , Mark completly nailed it"

Dude perfect x mark rober"
CHRUNCHYLABS IS ALREADY VERIFIED
That is the best place ever
This was awsome omg lol
His videos get better and better every time 🔥😎😎
Mark just made his own kiwi co lol
There's a lot of problems with your ant colonies
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
This is crazy amazing 🤩
That place was my DREAM as a kid
You are an Icon Mark
W
"i alway wanted to be like him and i see him as a role model (i mean look at his hat, he wears it backwards, thats how you know hes really cool.)"
"Watching this on my tv cause I’m tired, it’s like Christmas when u upload"
You have my dream bunker and all I can say is I'm jealous
I love it
cool
8l ... wow
i love all your vid keep going mark (:
"Amazing work Mark.... 
What I think you should do is to get Colin Furze over and make a mega project... or even do it both ways, Colin comes over to you and make something then you come over to his an make something."
WHAAAT
Give me the room
lets take a moment to appreciate how much time he puts into making this stuff for us! Keep it up mark!
fard 💀
Marks in direct competition with kiwico ?!
love the theme song
Haha downvotingg for the feministBS about toilet lid open. Saying men are pigsis funny but I bet you wouldn't make fun of women the same way would you Mark? Freedom of choice means you get to keep the lid closed and I get to keep it open and both of us aren't infringing on each other's freedom
A
I DIDN’T EXPECT TO BE THIS EARLY 21mins
"I still don’t get how he makes this, amazing."
"Great build!
But one suggestion:
There was a bit of light coming out from under the bookshelf, should be easy to change with the makeover"
Imagine going that would be insane
Amazing mark hats off
You don't ship to Montenegro 😭
Is it just me or does anyone think that this is where Mark tested Dom?
The cool of all dusty offices
Alas he showed us where his magical gifts of imagination become reality
Hi
"Next thing you know, mark'll make the *backrooms*"
Who cleans this place?  😊
Mark you're a genius but how dont you realize you hold the pole without your hands wrap your feet around it wrap your arms around it and squeeze as you slide
I'm gonna ask my mom or dad if I can get it

You could help schools with the crunch labs boxes.
Where's #1 it ends on 2
Sorry on is not a permanent thing it's an idea never mind
My kid is only four so I hope the CrunchBox is still going strong when he's 6 or so!

This is how we continue on the path to innovation.
nerds rule!
"The warehouse is really cool, such a room has always been a dream of mine
 
only one problem is that the light source from under the bookshelf gives away its location"

Yeah
"Ya noticed?
Noice"
I wish I were Mark Rober smart.
I need to know where I can get one of those toilet seat door lock things for my house lol
Wooow... Epic video Mark as always
Mans Crazy
Mark you are definitely one of the best youtubers.
Mark you are definitely one of the best youtubers.

So cool 🔥

INSANE WORTH THE WAIT !
This just got a ton better
Mark even refilmed the hot weels end so the camera wouldn’t be in the shot
new vid=awesome
Hey mark I just wanted to see if you noticed but there is a light gleaming under the bookshelf and I think that makes it obvious there is a room behind there (only if they're observant can people see it)
I really really wish I had stuff like this around when I was growing up. But I'm content with learning by proxy these days.
Your a genius x
I'm a kid and I love to build
Ummm grunkle stan??? Lol that is so gravity falls
Mark is the Engineer version of Batman
Your very own Batcave 👌
Crunch should never be celebrated. It's inhuman.
Won't You Gentlemen Have a (diet) Pepsi?

CRUNCHLABS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The light shining through under the bookshelf door is....sad.
My dream would be to go there! It looks so cool!
People from the outside who sees a massive building 👁👄👁
Didn't kiwico sponsor your videos? There was a solution to sparking engineering for kids. Marketing at its best. This is an alternative solution mark. Congrats.
This is crazy amazing! Crazy what engineering can do!
Let's do calibration at lodza later
This is now my favorite video on the internet.
Epic
The office looks like a attorney's office or like the one from The Office LOL
This is literally every child's dream
Can I have one?
He made the literal Rover Cave
Mark rober  invites you  to a office. You think it’s boring. Walks into a secret lab. Wow
"Wait, wasn’t the warehouse used for the domino robot the same one as this one???"
Sweet
Thank you so much for finally uploading!
"Mark, you are every kind of smart."
8k views and it was posted 3 minutes ago
"""Because men are pigs""...? Wow nice blanket statement there buddy. Funny how you probably felt perfectly comfortable saying that about men, but wouldn't dare say something similar about another group of people."
me ?? :(
Mark you are one of the most inspirational STEM based YouTubers there is. Starting that box to help foster kids imaginations and a true love of learning and discovery is something I wish I had growing up. Never stop my friend
True!!!!
Did he just cut fire?...
this is how I imagine my future house
"Ferb, I know what we're going to do today!"
how did he know my dream-
Mark robers next video: I built a secret tunnel to mars
"Hey You send it to Poland 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱 ??? 
I would like to buy something for my child 
Maybe someone now??"
I’m really curious how you are not the favorite uncle yet. What are their other uncles doing and their channels must be awesome too.
Can we all agree that Mythbuster was one of the many inspirations for a lot of us on the 2000 springing a lot of engineers in this time
Looking forward to an eventual collaboration between Mark and Stuff Made Here.
"Going big or going home - Mark's choice is never in question! Go, go, go!"
I wanna see Mark collab with Backyard Scientist again!
"But before we see if I actually live.

Me: What the frick did he just say"
i love this 👏👏👏
Gravity falls vibes
Why must I live in Europe 😭😭😭
I thought it funny how you could see light behind the bookshelf when passage way is supposed to be secret.
This guy is the Bill Nye of this generation
Hi!
Sheeeeeeee
U hiring? X-D
the pvz music is the best 6:19
@Gamey_UwU agreed
cohad
Graze the roof is a vibe
Literally that is the best office I’ve ever seen
1st
@willrzx  ♪ i was saying you aren’t first
@ApplesAreNice what
definitely not first lmao. you are the first comment on newest first rn
My dog 🐕 would love a 🎾 launcher cannon.  Lmao 🤣
"But....there's light coming out from underneath the bookshelf....kind of a dead giveaway something isn't normal:P
6:24 you can see it's quite bright."
Mark must secretly have grown up with a meddling sister called DeeDee.
I can not imagine how much money this costed
Wow
Stellar!
"Here, 5000 miles away, 4.A.M, Your Amazing works makes my heart beat. Thanks MARK Your video always inspire me."
Congrats on achieving what you always wanted!
Wow
umm just btw.........you can see light coming out from under the book case :)
Hi
Are the upward-to-downward inflections in Mark’s voice a regional thing?
awesome office
Hi I'm a big fan and I would like to know when and how do i do your next class
100k IN 17 MINUTES
Would it be a possibility that having your crunchlabs videos in other languages?
Amazing
"how to get to mark rober's cool lab:
1. track down the ticket winner
2. go all Mr. Slugworth and offer them money to tell us where the lab is
3. go to the lab
4. get arrested for tresspassing"
I have zero money so I would like to buy it but I can’t :(
"Love it, excited to see what will come out of Crunch Labs!"
Second attempt at trying to suggest you doing a video about FRC since its amazing and meaningful and awesome also when parents ask you what 8-12 to twelve year olds can do to start om their way to becoming an engineer FLL is the perfect answer in my opinion
I thought this video was gonna be how he made a secret entrance
"after Mr. beast's Chocolate factory video and yours this (Special Mention: MKBHD's Studio tour video), I literally inspired a lot and set my goals for the future. Thanks for being here all of you guys... lots of love from India"
Wow
How do you sign up for crunch labs?
@Prof. Parabola thank you so much
Link in description
"Not to be that guy, but is it still considered a secret passage if you tell your 22 million subscribers about it?"
Okay yes i did now hear that he mentioned it
this was just mark flexing and im ok with that.

In my opinion this is probably one of your best videos yet!
Je moet eens professioneel aardappelkanon schieten proberen!😄
Crunch Labs needs to sponsor local FRC teams.
Your like the next Bill Nye. My son loves your show. I'll check out those boxs6
kinda like kiwico
"You can see the light under the bookshelf door, and the wheels. It needs to be sat in a recess or have a custom skirting board around it."
One of the best humans in this world.
"4:03

❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lord bless the greatest engineer in all of YouTube
"awesome, you are one of the reasons I decided on engineering as my major"
Ok Walter White
"""I built a massive secret lab!"" Do you work with someone named Gustavo Fring by any chance?"
Wow I love it my dream was like yours!!!
Has to be one of my fav mark Robert vids
You and @mrbeast always have so much money in your pocket to build stuff like this 😂

"Yeah, it does…"
Cat
"I absolutely LOVE ❤️ your videos and channel 🎖
I watch your videos again and again 👌🤗😎
May you and your family be blessed with lots of health, happiness and love 🙏👌🤗🥇🇿🇦"

"You're gonna single-handedly create many, many engineers that will be the ones to take humanity into the future. You're a legend."
"Great video always has great content
Gladiators"

Mark is the smartest YouTuber
Just a reminder that mark would be a cool uncle
"Ok, what is this music from 0:12 on. I need that."
1417th!
Money laundering?
"I like it, but what’s the point of a _secret entrance_ if it’s going on YouTube? Still cool nonetheless"
don’t gotta call men pigs
Therew light coming through under the book shelf...... something is a lil fishy here 😄
Yeah
22 million people Mark
Bro WHO is this other uncle? Willy Winks himself?
Wonka * mb
"I am your long lost child 
Come claim me dad"
A Rober video!?   *drops everything*
Mark! You should still make the alarm go off if the sink has been on for less than 20 seconds
"wow that was crazy
i didn't know marques brownlee was a pro frisbee player
the warehouse was also kinda cool"
Would be hilarious if a package thief finds one out and wins the ticket
... Wow
Me in my minecraft solo world
Xqc
I really hope it doesn't come out one day that you're a chomo building all of this to attract kids. I don't get that vibe just sayin I hope that doesn't happen.
"i’m a legal adult and i’m still tempted to buy the crunch labs build box thing

edit:i’m totally getting it"
I’m a illegal one
Mark robers engineering skills are so impressive
This is a lab and u built it all around nerf battles
I thought for a while that this was realesed 6 months ago but no. Love the idea
"102,511th"
"""Instead of a firemans pole, we have a firemans piston"" oh me oh my!"

Mark do you ship crunchlab stuff to ukraine
An exclusive video you give us the QR code to
I well do it
I love what you do and i am dreaming of having a same wearhouse
"I cannot imagine how cool it would be meet Mark rober, and then just build whatever you want with him."
"Mark: nobody would find my secret lab.
Also Mark: the only way in is through this dusty office.
Mark again: shows how to get in."
"Not to mention the giant 2"" gap beneath the secret door letting light in from nowhere."
This is such a wholesome YouTuber
k bro
I'll buy This place for $5Mill. Hmu.
For some reason I feel that moving the foam container around the place could have some consequences
Need to prevent the light from shining underneath the bookcase
WOW! This is so Cool !
finally a new vid
"Instead of putting all his money in the future, Mark also focuses on the now while his body is still healthy. I wish to do the same with my future. (And I don’t mean build a giant warehouse)"
Why not? Building a Giant warehouse  seems like every child's dream!

YOOOO
I guess kiwico won’t be a sponsor anytime soon anymore ^^
oh so this is what happens when you let the engineer play with their tools.
That’s so awesome that he got his piano to play the Mark Rober background music lmao
What happens if the toilets switch breaks or the doors?
"Mark Rober, you're not a quirky education scientist. Steve Spangler is."
"Mark, if you see this just know you’re engineering skills are amazing."
You could watch Paint dry and I could be entertained
Hey mark can you make a video on fly wheels?
Nitro was my favorite Gladiator too!  😎
AWSOME VID
Actually the light from the other side of the secret door through the bottom of the show case  reveals that there might be a room behind it..

"1:40 that's why you control your slide mostly with your legs rather than your hands... but props for inventing a better mouse trap anyways, lol!"
just when i started thinking my room is cool :(
"It is my life’s dream to have this, but as a LIBRARY"
5:26 it's all fun and games until it malfunctions
Oof
YOOOOOO! When I was younger I always wanted a wall of my room to be a nerf armory!!
This looks awesome!
you can see light from the secret lab leaking into the boring office at the base of the bookshelf. just sayin.
Cool
Your videos really make My day 😇
Dropping a comment at only 27k views be like 😏
I am half way in the video and I am in tears! Mark Rober is the best human being of his generation!

”won’t you gentlemen have a pepsi”
It looks like an escape room
I would like to redesign the logo of crunch labs for you
Holy shoosh
if he was my uncle I’d visit him Every day

I would definitely attend a theme park run by this guy.
Great post. Love the Zelda secret door sound
"Attorney Tom: ""Somewhere an OSHA manual just exploded"""
Nice
epik
when mark uploads i wanna scream
How about we collab and I translate these videos into German? I’m always a bit sad that things like kiwico are English only …
that foam pit does not look up to code. put a safety railing on there or something.
11:08 Mark  Makes  a Claymore mine lol
If I at least have this
if you dont have it make it.
It's really really special how you're able to build all your fantasies into reality! Great video!
"3:43

YESS

[EDIT] You play as Ken? Unsubscribed."

"extremely epic

First
I never knew Marques was a frisbee player
Super cool lab! And the MKBHD cameo was 🔥
I NEED THIS
too much fun is never a bad thing
Did anyone notice how deep that foam pit is… now we know where to find mark…🤔
"Mark's content always gets better with each video. His engineering skills are truly phenomenal. Great job, Mark!"
11:25 It looks like he's looking at his dismembered leg
Dam
Mark is what makes most science classes better and this video is here to prove it
Pog
Throwing kiwico under the bus there mark
'Secret entrance' where even Helen Keller could see the light coming from underneath the bookshelf
Dentists everywhere are going to hate you Mark Rober LOL!

"What a legendary room to chill out in, would be insane to have something like this!"
Real uncle Stan!!
Yo! I know I'm late to comment but it looks like an amazing vid even tho I'm only 20 seconds into it!
cool
you're too amazing to be real
"8:17 you sure you didnt had an answer? Because i think you would have told them to buy Kiwico. But i guess you wouldnt be making any money with that recommendation, and thats why you made your own box: The Crunch Labs Box!"
Yeah that seems a little odd..

Going more like dp style?

Dude what are you

My oldest boy would love this place! He loves your videos and tells us he wants to be a scientist when he grows up.  Too bad it's a bit too far away from Idaho for us.

"""Think like an engineer""
Ok
e = 3 = π"
Mark Rober x DudePerfect = Office Wars. Nerf Duell
This is amazing
I think the fact that Mark has dedicated a whole piston to being an action movie protagonist is a sign that the environment might be **a little** hostile.
Much better than mr beasts factory ngl

Crud I love it
THE SECRET ANEX
I watched this when it was uploaded 54 seconds ago.

"The ant farm is such a cool addition! But then again so are all the of other features. Seems to me like an ADHD workplace haven, and I wish I could be there!"
@TheRmbomo my thoughts exactly!
Definitely like the ant farm
"@Georges Khater When you're in idea and brainstorming mode, probably better that way. But once you find an idea that you really like, ADHD will send you hyperfocusing into it no matter how many distractions are around."
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!
"Lol I thought the exact opposite, unlimited distractions. I would never get any work done"
thats so cool

"First mr beast with the chocolate factory, now mark Rober with Santa's workshop, what's next? Technoblade builds an orphanage?"
"almost 60k views in 9 minutes, woooohoooo"
"I'm seeing marks greatest creation moments after it's been posted...

Thx Mark for making me happy again today I'm still upset about having to put my cat down today tho
mark... please... the squirrels mark
Not so secret now innit 😂
It's always interesting to see what a person does with their cash when they make mega-bank off of YouTube videos.
Amongus is not dead
"Continue the joke
mY dOg StEpPeD oN a BeE"
I need to know. Did Phat Gus ever have babies?
I love his Science videos they’re really fun and awesome
Mark is back in business
"Wow, just, wow. If I would have that place, I wouldn't need any more things in life!"
"I love how Mark refused to make the entrance to his secret base a book, instead making it a knickknack.

No cliches on his watch.

Except, I guess, for a bookshelf secret entrance..."
Seemed like a cliche to meh
wym? my office looks just the same.
@Don't Read My Profile Photo ok
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!
Childhood me would’ve freaked out if he saw this
That’s awesome.
Hi
Never thought a lab like this would exist in real life. I wish I could see it!
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!
This has to be every kids dream.
Does 1:20 look like a green screen or is that just me?
Ok

This is like every 8 year olds dream lol
"Ok,"
"10-1  are my favorite ones
(That is all of them)"
how about an entry like agent P ?
I feel like Mark is an adult on the outside but on the inside but a middle schooler on the inside.
This is SO cool! This makes me wanna make a secret room for myself 😂
Lol
Mark rober is turning into a breaking bad character with this lab
Mark has done it. He's created a lair.
"the piano saying ""you got it mark"" made my brain explode in so many different ways"

4:07 mark noclips into the backrooms
nice quick collab with MKBHD
"That office is amazing, as a science nerd it's like a children's museum for adults and I love it 😅"
Mark Rober NEEDS TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE< NOT GLORIFY SHOOTING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AT KIDS FROM ABOVE.
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this of Mark.
I think it’s a museum for everyone because science is for everyone and fun is not just for children
Yeah it’s super noise
@Don't Read My Profile Photo bro
"Wow, I at first thought it was just a hallway, but a whole engineering lab? These videos keep getting crazier and crazier every time they get released."
amazing.
Nice
"Mark's content always gets better with each video. His engineering skills are truly phenomenal. Great job, Mark!"
Ok
Yeah
I love all the thing mark Robert does if he reads this I am a massive fan!!!
"They really are. His creativity seems to also increase, like each project gets more and more creative."

First people
You’re one of the most creative YouTube channels on the platform no 🧢
Quite early
I watch all your videos and I love science
"I'm not sure why Gustavo Fring needed to hire Mike and all those Germans to build the underground lab, I feel like Mark would have been a much better asset, not to mention he would have probably provided the meth-making equipment."
Yay
This guy is literally batman
6 minutes baby
Always a great video!
Awesome
Woah
This is literally my dream life.
It gives gravity falls vibes
Yes
I'm pretty sure Mark has a couple of other secrets he keeps behind doors...
