I feel like this is a culmination of all my life experiences to this point and I'm SO STOKED to finally share it with all you.  Now go get your dang Build Box and let's make some cool stuff together.   https://crunchlabs.com/MarkRober
"Talking about dreams, will the Michale Reves colab ever come out?"
Marks the absolute best I have subbed to him for soooo long and every video he's made is GOLD
Sure
"Whyyyy do you tempt so, Mark! Missing some european countries, so not being able to order feels like that great childhood gift just out of reach."
can you make a bear and  squrril proof bird feeder? i have desighned one for my dads friends but never was able to build it
Congratulations Mark you‚Äôre gonna drive me and others to be very paranoid about every room we enter.
Holy cow mark that‚Äôs so coooooooooooool
Mark I have something to tell you something important
New hacksmith warehouse looking absolutely astounding
Five Nights at Freddy's!
"Mark , since u have chopstix maybe u should play rush e 2"
5:15 so much but still couldn't get a basic bidet ü§°
How do you have the budget to get something as crazy as this? Because this must cost a lot of money.
Im a huge fan
Please consider making factory of creativitys in the East Coast or touring exhibitions.
Amazing work mate always surprising us
"I'm so exited
you are my favorite youtuber"
I have a question for yoh and can you please help me answer the questions. Why does gravity make water go down like normal but there is no gravity in water????!
Hey Mark I bought a NASA school like a bundle
What's the first step in like I want to know how to create my own engineering belt
you should make a video on stopwach. beacause people dont stop it  automaticly
I'd love to see Mark Build a BATTLE BOT  !
"Had an idea for you, make the world's largest bubble from soap and water. Try to figure out the best water to soap ratio and the perfect air intensity to create it. Of course the contraption to make that happen as well."
I am very inspired by your vids I have been subbed probably for about half my life and my dream job is to be an astronomer
Saw this too late as I would love to get the box for my daughter as she'd have a blast with it but they are sold out
ƒ∞ feel like hes brothers with the uncle in genius in love
Colin furze where you at
"Mark do you have a queen in your ant farm? If not, I can help you get a nice colony going!"
Hey make a video of web shooter.2 to be exact
Can you show us how you hid the red stone
Before my teacher introduced my to you I hated science but then my science teacher told me to watch the squirrel maze video and now I‚Äôm addicted to engineering and stuff
what if I were to grab a mizzen at a hair solon and it opens up to the warehouse? Could I just walk in?
1:50
"Congrats you have a secret base that 14M people know about,not very secret now Is it?"

"POV:you have infinite money

"he figured out how to stabilize a blackhole and even horizon for worm holes, wait.. not yet okay"
Rush E 2 just dropped
It's OK I know how you do it and another reason I don't want anything to do with you.
his warehouse reminds me of a tv show set
Looks fantastic. You probably should mention to kids that your life isn‚Äôt real life and that not everyone has an endless pit of money. Keep their expectations of life real üëç
Why did you leave nasa?
"0:40 Mark, you said before you see if i live then you didnt show us ;/"
Kind of sad that only people from the us can visit this place
I want your life.
this is an interesting concept but is presented in a crap way- being forced to listen to rober's crap dialog
Hey mark I have a challenge for you you should try and make the world‚Äôs largest bow
I feel like you made this video after talking to mrbeast
the cool thing is that I actually have a couch that divides into six pieces
"hey mark, i bet the robot piano doing the rush e was too easy. try new rush e 2"
AA
WOW Mark!!!
"@markrober, is your crunch labs thing we‚Äôre we can meet up still going?"

i made my own light on a bow made with sticks
but seriously tho if i was in that office i would flip
"now if you'll excuse me, i will go and become a mechanical and electrical engineer."
"idk if i can watch mark Rober anymore. he's waaaay too cool. i mean look at what he did! very, very inspirational. i can't wait to get his crunch labs kit."
Hotones brought me here. Mr Rober smart asf I‚Äôd like to collab with him one day.
"just love it, would love to visit this lab üòç"
Im really thinking about getting some of these crunch lab things! I love building things and the other day I managed to light a lightbulb with two potatoes and i was so happy
Please help! I am trying to trap a really wiley stray dog and i need to figure out today how to create a remote button trigger that will close the door
When are you going to make another video

Imagine having him as your science/engineering teacher that would be the best year ever
Mark you should make a paper airplane launcher that would be cool
I haven't commented in a long time but I'm ur 10.k'th subscriber!
üòç
Dang it I‚Äôm a month late :(
"Imging me going to the dentist or somthin  turns everything.  The doctor excuse me ma,am what are you doing? Checking for a secret room. The doctor *calls the cops*"

You kinda look like the frustrated gamer
Nicely done Mark
literally he is the best so many teenagers and kids are intrested  to be an engineer after watching his awesome inventions i wish i had an uncle like that
"5:24 So much advanced tech in here, but not even a bidet? üòÜ"
Can we bring a friend?
Imagine when he throws the darts that he doesn‚Äôt hit any of them or it hits 4 3 or 2 at the same time

Bro has 5 nerf flytes I wish I could be him
Yo super wired question and I'm sure you probably won't read this but is it possible I saw you on 7/22 at the Hilton hotel that is near levi stadium? Friend doesn't believe it was you ü§£
And I shot my brother like five billion times
I just finished the disc launcher
Hey mark I have a really cool idea that I‚Äôm not sure would work in real life it would be pretty cool if you could make a dice that rolls what ever choice you chose every time you roll it would be very cool please consider this idea as a build you could possibly make in the future. I really hope you read this
just turn the sink non and off without washing your hands.
"MARK!!!!
rush E 2 just premiered
I hope chopstix is ready"
My new favorite word is the watermalometer

"Mark I'm extremely confused can you explain something. I water my plant and recycle the water that from water catch at bottom back to pot. The water I used started at 85+ f and  now the water is about 50-80f it's noticably colder. I'd love to understand why is happening. Couldn't I theoretically use let's say a larger  tank filled with sand  and get same effect? Creating a wireless water cooler..... üòÇ LoL

PS I'm in the he desert and so any input on no energy solution that's better than my idea could potentially help people besides myself."
11:11 ahh yes teaching kids to build a safe claymore
Mark rober my birthday is in 4 days and hoping you can visit in canada
This guy is pretty smart. He should work for nasa

"he worked for this company for 9 years, and designed the rover."
This is why he is not uploading a lot
So are you watching your videos for quite a while I want to go see your Warehouse looks awesome and I'm actually a scientist I in to physics and I just made something called the triple rc car has a camera motor to cut things and lights and I'm going to need the wheels from this RC car to go to this RC car on top of that one that's a lot of work and hopefully my talk to text works so I'm sorry for any mistakes
"Mark, when you joined Nasa what type of engineer were you?"

What do you do when you find it ?
Not sure if it‚Äôs just me busy the music in the middle sounds like it‚Äôs from plants versus zombies

We have autobelay devices in rock-climbing. This device has safeties incase of failure also.
It came late and the box was damaged but everything else was amazing and the disc launcher is cool and work surprisingly well. I noticed that just leaving the disc launcher would touch the wire to the table or whatever it it placed on so could you make or at least show how to make a holder? I understand that it takes a lot of time to get everything working but I am just giving an idea

What a cool guy with some super cool ideas. Well done Mark
When will we get Squirrel Maze 3.0?
I‚Äôm just about to turn 18 and I‚Äôm going to college and will be majoring in physics/engineering. I absolutely love your videos and everything that you engineer is so fascinating to me. I‚Äôve been watching your videos for a while now and I think that you are one of the reasons that I want to be an engineer. I just thought that I would let you know that even if you never see this comment.
This is just Rob Dyrdeks Fantasy Factory.
I also know someone who is a ultimate frisbee player

It‚Äôs been a while sense he has uploaded but that means he is probably going to have a bigger video!
Your a genuis
R.I.P technoblade
"hey, mark! it's time to post agian! :D"
Your the New Mrbaest
Can kids go there
yes you have to buy a boz
Excellent content
Please please please get more stock on your boxes
I love the pvz music in the backround
@Monti no problem
"The song is named ,,graze the roof,,"
Is this guy literally making willy wonka a reality?
How did you make number 10
"I would have loved something like that, its by far one of the best toys for kids"
He's been on tv
Where are the Oompa Loompas tho?!
When are you gonna do the squirrel parkour thing again?
well
The watermelon is always the victim
"All I can say is this: if guys need to leave the seat down, girls need to leave the seat up. Sorry not sorry. I only just realized this road has two ways"
Love it! Possible to ship the box to China?
I used to Love American Gladiators!  I used to like American Ninja before they made it so difficult that it takes professional level athletes and stunt people to get through the course.  They should make an American Ninja Level 1 show for entry level people to advance to the professional athletic level.
maves ur bog
What
do you ship out of the us??
Wow üëçüèª
Can you make a piston polling you up
Gotta love the little PvZ soundtrack playing in the background
I don't know why I waited so long to watch this. It's like every dream fort I ever sketched as a kid.
Does it cost money
I'm a teacher. All my students adore you. You're part of my science class all the time. This box needs to be written into the regular curriculum
That would require providing actual education. Can't have that here in the USA. Only the current agenda.
Do you want to do a YouTube video together
"Me: leaves the seat up
My girlfriend: why do you always leave the seat up just put the seat down.
Me: why don‚Äôt you ever leave the seat up for me if I always gotta put it down for you. Then you gotta put it up for me. üòâ"

Mark is there a way to turn friction into electricity because I have an idea how to make it but I don't know how to turn it into usable power
"If a toilet locked me in and nobody told me it was because the seat lid was up I'd just kick the door in, I wouldn't assume there was some trick switch I had to activate...."
Can you  help me get a  seecret bass
Hi Mark my gramma almost got puppy scammed can you make it please
Please üôè help me make my idea a reality
"Hello Mark can you help me out with an idea üí° invention my ww2 uncle mentioned to me years ago, it's been in my head for ions"
"I'm guessing Willie Wonka might have been a favourite growing up Mark. This is a wonderful undertaking, but the most significant point you make in the video is that your fantastic work drives the development of critical thinking in young minds. While you couch the value of that mental training in terms kids will get, better sports performance, math comprehension, etc, I think the real value comes when they emerge as intellectually empowered adults  in a world where a general inability to parse logical flaws in political rhetoric, or rebut irrational responses to global crises is crippling human capacity to flourish and live sustainably. If Crunch Labs builds one thing worthwhile and enduring it won't be a clever educational toy, it will be a generation of clear-minded, compassionate and humane global citizens able to winnow the profound from the common, history from myth and truth from fallacy. Well done."

I have a question do you have any suggestions about inventions that I can build this summer
"When Mark said ""its important to fail a bunch"" I teared up because it's so important for kids to learn that it's ok to mess up. Super inspiring!"
you should make a robot backrooms entity
More doors or more wheels
New vid soon ?
Me waiting for squirrel 3.0 lol
Mark Rober what if I get the ticket and I‚Äôm in china? Is it useless now?
I think you should sell mini frisbee golf nets as an extra on the website so people can make like a mini frisbee golf course that would be cool
I guess I'm not an average person. I'm always aware of my surroundings.

üìåüìç pined by Xander
What kind of engineering did you do? I‚Äôm going to college for engineering and I‚Äôm curious what kind of engineering you took.
This really is like the Willy Wonka factory so maybe there will be that one person wanting to buy like 100 boxes to get that platinum ticket lol
Surprising I just found this channel today
I always dreamed of having a ‚Äú clubhouse ‚Äú like this
When I watched this I was thinking how Mark would‚Äôve been really excited about some of the laid back tech companies‚Äô offices but would‚Äôve felt restricted by their work. üòÇ That‚Äôs cool‚Ä¶but I‚Äôd rather make random things at work.
"Been watching your videos for years, my son who is 11 now is interested in building these type of items, however I live outside the states and I pay by the Pound ...thanks.."
"Me and my dad ordered the first box, (the disc launcher), and it was so much fun! We built it together and set up targets for the discs in the backyard. It was so interesting to see how it works and to have fun using it. It launches like a real frisbee!! And I just wanted to say thank you SO much for this amazing opportunity. :)"
this
"Coming from a massive fan, its amazing to see how far you have come. Thanks for the amazing content over the years!!!"
News: YouTuber's friend calls the fire department after getting stuck in the toilet.
Cool
"Love this and your creativity so much!  I keep saying with all the kids today needing to be entertained (tablets, TV,  phones, etc.) I worry about them not fully developing the skills like imagination, thinking outside the box, creativity, ingenuity, etc.  If we have a generation who have lost these skills we are doomed.  All the great inventions, cures and treatments for diseases and such, and engineering developments were discovered and developed by those who definitely possessed the skills, were encouraged to use them, and were brave!  We need out of the box thinkers if we are to survive!  You make this ""learning"" look so fun they would never realize they are being taught (which is the key to teaching anyone).  I appreciate all you are doing for our world.....oh yeah and how you are not afraid to act like a giant goofball of an adult.  I am jealous...I wanna come play there! 
People......please hear me and share this thought .....we HAVE to be sure and encourage our children to be creative, to explore, and use their imaginations....if you don't you are doing your child and the future of our world a great disservice!"
"I'm an engineer. But always respected these types of engineers. New subbie here. Love this geeky stuff.

Dude is the willy Wonka of engineering. I'm grown but I want the experience too!!! 

Engineering is so cool."
this is making me want to become an engineer
You should start a new project called team breeze which finds a way to reduce carbon emissions

Ever since I started watching you when I was five now I‚Äôm 11 I‚Äôve always been inspired by you because I‚Äôve always wanted to be an engineer because I‚Äôve always thought it was all so cool and interesting to see what happens and make a hypothesis

"According to the footage at 15 : 59 we can see that there are 20 boxes of the kit on the table, Mark said it was fair. But however as you can see mark is throwing darts at it at a chosen place leading the upper boxes to get hit more often, when mark actually packs these the boxes on the upper layer would go to the bottom. and when the kits are arrived at the country the person ordered it, the upper layer ( in that case was the lower layer on the beginning ) gets loaded first, making the kit on the bottom layer including the ticket, average shipping boxes are 18 "" x 16 "" x 18 "" fitting about 30 boxes on average, therefore IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING THE TICKET, YOU NEED TO BUY A KIT  AT AN AVERAGE PACE OF 25 TO 30"

I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.

I hope everything goes well and it becomes a future staple of childhood for generations."

who said you couldn't?
"I mean once you really understand what you've learned with the creations, you can take them apart and combine your knowledge and the pieces to create that one big contraption using everything."
So it would be better if you somehow fix that.
"Mark, can you do a bloopers video? plz"
"Giant foam pit??? Obviously now you have to build a ramp (ramps??) and throw bikes off them. And boards. And go karts. And little pedal-cars. But mainly bikes, because bikes are awesome."
Mark Rober is Jimmy Neutron in disguise prove me wrong.
What if your in a other country
"Just asking, will you do more stuff with Anthony?"
Mark rober can someone live if of solar panels for electricity
Looks awesome üëå
Aahhh so cool! This looks more my... i mean my 6yo son's speed. I promised him a summer class but with my own university studies and both our ADHD neuro-divergent brains i just couldn't commit. Yay for bite sized projects to hyperfocus on. Ty.
awesome!! Wish you would be a little closer to us :)

I want to ride that car thingy and I like the fact that he went like RRRREEEEEEEAAAAATTTRRREATTT
12 days too late. All boxes gone
hello everyone help:3^
"I used to love kits like those as a kid. But when I told people I wanted to be an inventor or builder people always told me that wasn't something a person can just be. At this point in my life it is too late to start now, but at least you are developing kits to inspire kids to achieve what I couldn't. I hope everything goes well and it becomes a future staple of childhood for generations."
"Guys like Mark are why I wish YouTube was around when I was a kid. I may not have ended up as an engineer, but he‚Äôs a brilliant role model. His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn‚Äôt mean you have to quit. Being able to work through the failure and push towards success and find solutions is a lesson that can be used in any part of life. Hats off to this guy, no YouTuber deserves more success than him."
The fact that mark is trying to help kids so they don't have to think of a new thing to do like its insane what 1 person can do to change peoples lives and I think its so cool he does this
I wish that my family had more money so I could do those boxes. And actually have a chance to meet Mark Rober and fulfill my dream of being an engineer.
"This is what you get with a very genius engineer, with lots of time on his hands, lots of money in his bank, and who is still a kid at heart.

Well done, Mark."
"Hi mark, always LOVED your videos. In this video I wanted to point out one SMALL ERROR. That is the person can see the LIGHT COMING FROM UNDER THE SECRET DOOR. So it would be better if you somehow fix that."

It's really cool to see a YouTuber making a product to help people not just to make money
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. ü•¥
"Loving my little 1 second cameo üòÇ Thanks for taking us around (Cannot BELIEVE you kept this quiet for so long, I struggle keeping a secret for a week)!"
Mark is the ultimate cool teacher that doesn‚Äôt give homework and actually inspires you to learn
"Mark i can do this you son of a
B*****"
The fact that mark is trying to help kids so they don't have to think of a new thing to do like its insane what 1 person can do to change peoples lives and I think its so cool he does this
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.

Agreed
Love you
Where was Mark Rober 45 years ago when I was a kid? I would have LOVED the Crunch Labs. Still would at 58 LOL

Why does it take random chance to get to go to your lab? I personally think it should just ship out to random subscribers.
"Or while I‚Äôm at that, let you know somebody wants to come, and they get to spend the day!"
So easy to find because of the light under

"@YouTube, you have cash, make it happen."
That opening is just like the one in Gravity Falls. Grunkle Stan vibes.

This not science this is big brain mark
i though it would be the glitterbomb 10 except there is no glitter
okay and also colin is the amazing inventor else well at 5 top inventors

Your yell is perfect.
"I love the idea of the crunch box! When I was little I used to do the build kits from the home depot. I love the lab and love your videos. I have watched them for years, and they have inspired me to be an engineer, well you and the hacksmith. Recently I got into an amazing engineering school, and am halfway through the degree! Because of what you do, I've had some amazing internship opportunities ! Thank you for teaching people what its all about!"
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL

It has Become my Life Goal to get into Crunch labs as a Child.
"6:00 ok but I always use paper towels to touch the sink because germs, and I don't think the capacitive touch will work through a paper towel"
ive wached all of your videos
"I cannot say say thank you enough, not only to you Mark but to the hundreds of others that continue to show how amazingly beautiful science is. I've always wanted to be an engineer, but you and people like you helped me relize what that almost instinct to make was. I'm almost a senior in high school and have been doing my own projects and love every second of it. And now I'm using all these tools that where just being developed when I was young, from CAD to ardunio, to 3D printers that continously become easier to use, learn, and get. I see all these tools that kids much younger than me will have access to. STEM for youth has never been more engaging or had access to so many tools and resources, that 20 years ago where hardly available in universities. I'm excited I get to use these tools now, while kids 5-6 years younger than me are aswell. And im exited for them (And slightly jealous). And it's people like you Mark that inspire kids to use these tools and learn about this stuff. And that is something that's extremely important."
"Loving my little 1 second cameo Thanks for taking us around (Cannot BELIEVE you kept this quiet for so long, I struggle keeping a secret for a week)!"

"yes its all fun in games until you realize if you looked at the building from the front of it, the office thingy dosent matter because it has an entire warehouse behind it."
There light coming under the secret entrance...
"Aaja, lmao even I can make it it's so easy.


Wait! What do you mean this ain't minecraft?"
i dont know why this video makes me emotional
i like the lab
I love your message that it is important to fail.  Myself I say you only fail when you fail to learn.
"Can you make school maze 3.0
Please"
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and inter sting to watch."
Hey will you still be posting videos here?
Cool‚Ä¶ (too bad I can‚Äôt afford it) :(
i get hype whenever I hear the music in your videos prolly cuz I associate it with content like this.. the riffs are pretty dank too though lol
"""no way to guess there is a secret lab in this boring office"" : maybe the bright blue light coming from under the shelf at 6:26 is a hint ? ;)"
Nice really you are supporting kid‚Äôs to be creative
Please make a squirrel maze 3
What type of engineer is mark?

"Sold out... Congrats on a successful launch, Mr. Rober! Looking forward to Crunch Labs making more kits!"
"While watching these videos, the idea of a robot made for spinning Beyblades  occurred to me. Imagine how crazy that would be"
Love your work!

Cough cough this is the where house where we did the robot domino vid
My first thought: Dead bodies?
Mark remember me at escape room palms springs we took a photo
Every day I'm dreaming about meeting mark but ill maybe get to finally meet him in 10 years
@ 6:27 everyone would see the light under the bookshelve
"You are such a fantastic human being.

"Hey, I'm a great fan and also I have a challenge. I want to you do make a guinness world record, For the world biggest Gaming Setup."
"I have very mild but noticeable hearing loss, being 14 (Guns, many fire drills, etc.), and that train horn, with Mark covering his ears, must be very  loud."
"Well, the light under the bookcase is pretty obvious"
amazing.
Bill Nye for the next generation.
"So, um, how much do people pay you to be able to work for you?"
"I used to love kits like those as a kid. But when I told people I wanted to be an inventor or builder people always told me that wasn't something a person can just be. At this point in my life it is too late to start now, but at least you are developing kits to inspire kids to achieve what I couldn't. I hope everything goes well and it becomes a future staple of childhood for generations."
"don't give up on your dreams, it's never too late to do anything"
"@Will Peeler totally agree with you 
Its never too late to do what u want to"
It‚Äôs never too late. I started taking YouTube classes a few weeks ago in blender and learning how to weld

"If any of you are adult engineers that want an experience like what Mark is doing:  Teaching engineering to kids, doing cool things, solving unique challenges, building crazy cool thing...  Become a FIRST Robotics Mentor.  At every level, It's the hardest fun you'll ever have.  If Mark ever wants to do an episode on FRC Team 4160 ""The Robucs"" would love to host :)"
this is so wholesome
Your lab is bigger than our company xD
Dexter‚Äôs Lab!!!
"looks like tony starks lab from ironman !
too cool !"
Hey Mark! I wanted to tell you that your videos have helped inspire me to dream of one day working at NASA and so this fall I will be attending Embry-Riddle in daytona with a duel major in aerospace and mechanical engineering!
11:49 what about bridge engineers
i.m 7
he is a great youtube
"Those boxes are great, I think a more advanced version for older people would sell well."
I wanna have that at my house
"‚ÄúYou might wanna get up and just start moving everything on display‚Äù

"Guys like Mark are why I wish YouTube was around when I was a kid. I may not have ended up as an engineer, but he‚Äôs a brilliant role model. His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn‚Äôt mean you have to quit. Being able to work through the failure and push towards success and find solutions is a lesson that can be used in any part of life. Hats off to this guy, no YouTuber deserves more success than him."

Do you have any mechanical car boxes???
Mark is doing stuff that everyone wished they'll be doing after completing engineering.

"I wish i could go there but considering there's 10+ million people who also wants to go there, i think i don't have any chance at all üòÇ"
"If I ever go here I have three Ideas 

1 (the bad one) a pair of shoes that have some sort of pressurized system allowing them to make you jump higher or help launch you at an angle that can help you front or back flip. 

2 (the one to mess with people) I am a fairly tall kid so pistons in shoes controlled by an app to give you a little extra hight. 

3 (my favorite) a pair of - you guessed it SHOES!- that have little treads that fold into or sink into the sole of the shoe (with added material ofc) so at the touch of a button you have a slightly cooler far more aggravating pair of heelies."
Any other silly or fun ideas that you might wanna try there?

Is it me or it gives me neverland vibes ü§®?
Where is Dom the domino robot?!
fantastic now is no longer a secret door
@Flirdy The Birdy my bad
You didn‚Äôt watch it until the end then lol
"eh, one big advertisement."
"Even though I‚Äôm just 21 and still a student to become an engineer. You make me look sooo much forward to having children with which I can build these projects with.
Absolutely admire your work Mark!"
It always impresses me that Mark seems like such a nice and fun dude passionate about his work and tries to inspire everyone else in the world too. What a legend.
"Hey Mark, thanks for being one of my inspirations to become an engineer. Love your videos, never stop."
"Dude, you are amazing what you‚Äôre doing, sharing and inspiring"
We need a Nilered and Mark collab!
Love this and you
I couldn‚Äôt find this im I‚Äôve run englandfams
This guy plans to build an interdimentional gateway to save his long brother through which a dream demon would come into this world.
mark roger is like the new bill nye
*US residents only. Saddest thing I've noticed. I'm from Canadaü•∫
Mark is changing the world one video at a time ü§ß love to see you‚Äôve come so far
us! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mark tries so hard to make all of our dreams of being an engineer come true. RESPECT 100.1%.Love your videos!
"@Andy-GTI Hi , if so then he absolutely deserves it : )"
@Andy-GTI probably way more than that lmao. That doesnt mean he doesnt have the best intentions.
@ChxrryPlayz i am broke
"@Andy-GTI no I didn‚Äôt 
But I do know that you are a jealous broke guy"
@Andy-GTI why do u feel the need to comment this on everything
does the ticket pay travel fees
IS it shipped to all countries?
"No one is Gonna known the secret passage, meanwhile the 11m people who watched this video"
"Watermelometers now coming to stores near you üòÜ jk, great vid Mark!"
This warehouse has all my childhood dreams and more. A real super lair for a super engineer!
this is like disneyland for adults
This is quiet a well known secret
"üíÄ
most children around the world won't be able to afford the crunch lab box or get to meet just bc they don't live in the US
that's understandable."
i instantly knew the show when i saw the tennis ball cannon
when did mark rober turn into mr beast
"Best YouTuber out there
fantastic contentüëä‚ù§Ô∏èüî•"
"Amazing dude. You manage to make the coolest videos, every time without fail. Crunch Labs is a killer concept. Thanks for always making science and engineering super RAD. you inspire us all. Much love brother!!!"
thanks Mark
You know I would just like to tour the place.
The warehouse is giving me Meow Wolf vibes with the secret passageways and maybe a touch of Dyrdeks  fantasy factory. V cool!

His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn‚Äôt mean you have to quit.

Hats off to this guy, no YouTuber deserves more success than him."

Can you make a more advanced option for teens it looks cool but I am older and want something more complicated?
you can tell its there from the scraches mark
You forgot about number 5!
Can you help me convert a big shopping cart into a dog carrier on the bottom and a golf cart on the side walk or road? Also can you give it a pop up shelter for varying weather? An a c. And heater on the inside would be great too. I know a shopping cart can be a vast resource and I figured that you gave the imagination and skills to do it.
Is nobody gonna talk about the PvZ music at 6:30
Oh he uploaded again
gravity falls
"would love to see you and ""stuff made here"" channel do a coop project"
PLEASE LET ME COME PLEASE
Big video!
I think every kid can agree when I say every kid has dreamed about something like this at least 8 times
"Wow Mark! This place is so so so (x100,000,000) cool!! I think you should make a invention where you make someone trip with a rope, but before they hit the ground you make something extend out that could snatch them up or break their fall."
You know how you said you like to take things that humans do and make it better what about lawn mowers is will be fun and easy to mow
I Love this channel!
Not me sitting doing my engineering work thinking how fun being an engineer looks :p thanks for inspiring the next generation!
thats crazyu
The Legends of Zelda Shrine Puzzle Music Was Perfect 6:51
What is that music called. I‚Äôve been trying to figure it out

Id love to see a mario kart hot wheel on that track
Do you have to be a kid to qualify as a winner? Or would my kid-like imagination be acceptable? Haha I‚Äôm in love with the warehouse and the crazy ideas. I want to visit.
"If I can practice as many times as I want, can I run a bunch of tests, physics the crap out of it, and then try?"
can someone give me the link for the mini rivals? can't find it on amazon
My kids and I really enjoy this channel thank you for all the cool stuff you do!
This. Is. Dope.
"I can't wait to have kids and share this kind of critical thinking activity box with them. We are definitely a household that will be fostering the cr*p out of STEM principles/activities for our kids! Also as someone with a strong interest in science, this feels like a much safer and less chaotic method to promote science learning than my dad's idea of ""objects in motion"" principles taught by slamming the breaks on the car....which in hindsight was probably just him covering his really bad/aggressive driving habits up with ""science lessons."""
"Not only a really nice guy, but super intelligent and a big kid at heart. Having fun whilst learning, teaching and sharing his knowledge. Need more Mark Robers in the world!"
RIP KIWIKO. Love the video tho :-D

A group of people would probably just get together and go to a bunch of places to just find and storm the crunch lab.
I think women should lift the seat when they are finished
Dude you out did yourself......too fn funny
9:39 did you just leak the QR code for one of the videos :O
Does that mean Canadians are not eligible to win the trip?
Amazing - yet again you win Cool Uncle Award!  Does your son visit the lab with you?  I'm sure you find wonderful things for him because I am sure you are also a Very Cool & Kind Dad!
Supercool! Just fyi you can see the lights under the book case by the way.
So if i come are you gonna pay for the plane ticket
What's wrong with keeping the toilet seat up

why do you start your videos yelling so loud
thats a super cool secret room i wish i had one just like this
11:08 Can't wait to get my gear badge for claymores
Mark is the ultimate cool teacher that doesn‚Äôt give homework and actually inspires you to learn
"I had one like this. Mr. Martin taught biology. He was animated, had a passion for his subject, plus... He let us take our final home the Friday before our test date, then he covered all the windows with brown paper and let us watch Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoons while he graded our tests and did the math for our final grades. If we were low, he allowed us to write a short paper on a subject of his choosing to have turned in by the end of the day. If you turned it in, whatever you wrote, he upped your final grade by one letter grade. I already had an A in the class, but a few of my friends took advantage to get a B from a C. His class was fun and informative and I learned more than I thought I did. It was great!"
"He probably would give homework, but it would be way too fun to be classified as homework"
I wish my parents fostered the curiosity I had for science when I was a child. I'm sure my life would be completely different if it were so. Love what you're doing.
How do you redeem the platinum ticket???
Please make fat gus merch
yooo
hello
It‚Äôs literally a real version of Dexter‚Äôs Laboratory üòÄ
"mark, is Fletcher still alive?"
all i gotta do is now find that place
this is literally kids dream
Sing pure imagination
HI Mark. You can't do that. That's not how you become an engineer. Haven't you been on LinkedIn or Xing lately? You become an engineer by complaining until you get a quota that makes you one.
What's Xing?
Was it just me who heard the og PvZ music?
POG WAREHOUSE
well i see light down the book shelf
I have a problem : I live in France :(
Giving back to the community and help share your knowledge with kids and others is admirable. You‚Äôre an inspiration my dude!
dope lab.
"Mark Rober, you are an absolute dream come true for those who love to explore, build, and most importantly, ask ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù.
You‚Äôre an inspiration beyond value. Stay young at heart and keep creating these amazing ideas."
"Mark Rober: ‚ÄúI made a new lab!‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúI NEED IT!!!!‚Äù
Plus the problem with the new product is it costs $180 and I don‚Äôt think anyone will be willing to pay that much."
i want this now
It‚Äôs funny tho because they just finished this office and mark video came out this same time
Thanks Mark.
Mark is basically a real life version of my favorite movie character. that probably sounds weird but it's funny to me
Mark is the only person who would build a super secret lab and testing facillity only to make half of things for nerf wars. my dream come true
Cooooooll
Mark! You actually inspired me to want to be a rocket engineer for Nasa and I‚Äôm so excited to get your crunch lab build box! I really hope I can be a engineer like you‚ù§Ô∏è
how much you want for the bike?
i try to invent
awesome big zDdy

"I wish Mark Rober was around when I was a kid, I would have loved to become a engineer as a kid watching your videos, it‚Äôs so nice you‚Äôre doing this for the youth!!"
It‚Äôs so cool
Love the Crunch Lab my guy!!!
I think Colin furze and mark should do a partnership again
5:39 THE BEST EXAMPLE OF EASIER SAID THEN DONE!!!!!!
THIS IS CRAZY
not such a super secret lab any more is it ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
MKBHD catching frisbees? That‚Äôs the best ‚Äúwork area‚Äù I have ever seen!
Fast question. ¬øTo witch countries is aviable the crunchlabs boxes?
"‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a huge secret-‚Äú
Proceeds to tell pretty much every single person with access to the internet"
Ya make like a nailed it sort of thing where you get your engineer friends and make the best functional build
Always been so impressed by your stuff how do you do it I‚Äôve always loved engineering!!!!!!
Just a quick question if I were to find your building would you be angry if I were to go inside and try to get in?
Never mind

"And after all that, the engineer still manages to teach kids how to make a weapon. It‚Äôs the Manhattan project all over again."
This is my dream of having one if these no far mom said it's my tern with the secret lab
WOAH!! SO BIG AND CREATIVEE!!
ITS THE BEST ONE I EVER SEEN!
Seen the light underneath the book shelf
So once we receive a box with a hole in it we¬¥re in!
"That 10k target is dirty. I have a feeling you can get it in, but im more concerned the force would make it bounce back out."
The Crunch Labs build boxes are an amazing idea. Keep it up
Can I have that I'm 8
You can't hate this guy urban legend
this guy built his minecraft secret base irl
Soooo you‚Äôre basically Willy Wonka. Dope.
I really want the boxes but my parents said I have to pay for them myself and I don't have the money. :(
15:56 SUS
When are we going to see the return of phat gust
"ok ok i get the point mark
but can i receate this with my own twists and turns"
surely mr beast helped with all this
I want it but i live in pakistan so what i can do
How do you shut the door back?
"I find it ironic that Mark Rober makes a science version of willy wonka and the chocolate factory, the same time that Mrbeast makes a real one.ü§£"
The only downside to the secret doorway is the light under the bookshelf gives it away
can we bay 1 box?
I feel like I could jump from the height the pneumatic is set at.
"When this guy's kids go to school, all their classmates are going to hate their own parents."
I can say I‚Äôm 11 and want to be an engineer because of mark.
Sameee
There is a video in these sponsors.
I got so much I idea and it's possible to build
best youtuber
He should collaborate with Hacksmith. That would be awesome
6:48 GENIUS!!! NO ONE EVER GETS DIET PEPSI
bro it is 299.40$ that is so expencive
6:19 *plants vs zombies music plays*
what if u live in a different country like NZ is there still a way to Win or is it just the US
Mark Robert quick question do you pay for the expenses of us coming down there for the day Because my mother is in financial issues but she still has some money to spare to buy some stuff
is it me or do you sound diferent
I thought it was a methlab
‚ÄúAnd behind this wall I have built an entire Nuclear Reactor Core!‚Äù
Of cource you did
It was so. SO COOL
Do you guys ship all across the world or only in america?
you're such an amazing creator of unimaginable things!!
The office that you have built looked like the dude perfect one and I thought it was the dude perfect warehouse
I want to visit somewhat badly
This reminds me of Mr. Beast‚Äôs new video with the Willy Wonka factory but cooler and more scientific
Would it actually be possible to find crunch labs just from looking around offices/dentists offices?
What kind of engineer are you ?ü§îü§®
"Can you make a video about Japan‚Äôs futuristic technology, because I live in Japan üáØüáµ"

Mark is just getting started
I love your vids!
"when i went to the website it didn't work, nor did the link you put"
"""Now is my second favorite way to get to a secret room"" JUMPS OF A BUILDING """
He‚Äôs the best !!!!!!!!
In 8:07 you can see the aluminium thing that the backyard scientist made
I just imagine people walking into buildings and tearing walls down to see if it‚Äôs the lab
üòÇ congratulations mark! I have watched you for many years and grew up watching you. It‚Äôs nice to see how you have grown and taught all of us more. You have inspired many of us! ‚ù§Ô∏è
You should make a giant swing that swings across the entire warehouse
I wish I could do this :(
I am 9 and I WANT TO MEET YOU SO BAD but I kind of far away
"Others: psi
Mark: WATERMELOMETER"
That is super amazing!
I love the massive amount of consideration toward Nerf battles.
tbh at some parts of the video you look unhappy
im gonna guess the beds have holes in them for reasons
dude i with i were u sometimes. you are so cool.
"your crunch lab, is it available overseas?"
secret passage ways aint so secret anymore

"um

I've wanted to be an engineer for so long and this is just-
amazing"
I love that at 6:30 you have a Plants vs Zombies remix song XD
That's super awesome. I'm pretty jealous.

"We all NEED some Phat Gus plushies. Are they going on release or did I miss it. Either way, Mark Rober always makes the best stuff and he puts so much work into it. Keep it up"
you are the most creative youtuber I've watched and you're videos are not only fun and entertaining but also educative. You are awesome!!!
dude you are living my dream
Goat
I‚Äôm planning on making a secret door in my house as well.
I wish my life choices had led me to become an engineer.....smh
Imagine one day you forget where the foam container and u still jump ü§£üòÖ
"No way mark Rober put pvz music in his video, he would never"
srry i ment today  anyway its a wallet that senses if its touched then a light and a buzzing sound will go off so that nobody can pick-pocket you anymore!
"Mark, THE WORLD REALLY NEEDS MORE YOUS!"
"I wish I could use the like button multiple times, amazing video Mark!"
Minecraft in real life
No one gonna talk about how he just stole from a Denny's üò≠üíÄü§¶üíØ
Are you the favorite uncle yet?
Greenhouse in your glass walls
BRO I REALLY WANT TO DO THISSSSS but me and my mom don‚Äôt got money so I won‚Äôt be able to but I‚Äôll be a scientist one day
mark your slowly  becoming the real robbie rotten
Imagine being at a barber shop Hmmm this child doesnt look real lets twist him around until something happens
"I‚Äôm only smart enough to do animation. This is amazing fr, I wish I could do all of this, but I‚Äôm really glad he‚Äôs accomplishing his dreams!"
Only a big brain guy can do this
Says secret room 6:26 can see light under bookshelfüòÇ
"Next step i need you to roll put these crunch labs to major cities or maybe have a mini crunch labs in local children's museum...who know maybe one day your own STEM theme park


Honestly so proud and excited for you"
"that is awesome, this is my new dream, to have something like this."
This is cool...
Yo Is that JiDion? at minute 4:40?
Hi I love your videos!!
It's kinda obvious with the light coming in from under the shelf üòÇ
i could watch him explain his entire office/warehouse for hours and still not get bored.
thats the same warehouse from the dominos video.
Wdym thx for all the support over the years? I swear it feels like you just started on YouTube. Time flies
For a second I thought Mark got busted for human trafficking
‡§ï‡•Ä
"Well, it's not a secret anymore."
what happens when someone jumps off the ledge without knowing the container was moved
@Mark Rober Watch Nile Green‚Äôs video to get ideas for the next glitterbomb!
I use to love you now you are no better that those scamers. you sent the bait packages to.
ive been watching mark for a couple years on and off and now i should be getting my mechanics qualification at 18
This is truly awesome! One great solution to help people be curious and learn! Really awesome!
"There is only one flaw about the secret entrance from the boring office room. You can see the light coming through from the bottom of the bookshelf that blocks the entrance. :)

P.S: This is not to insult anyone, this info is only for entertainment. ( Please don't yell at me. )"
"REALLY, WHOS THE OTHER UNCLE?"
nothing's more iconic than that workbench you always stand in front of in every videos
Mark you are THE GOAT and don't you ever forget that!
"Seems to me your going to need to make a nerf picking up Roomba kinda thing, that also sorts them and puts them in a ammo supply box. :P"
Mines cooler
Is this in Florida cuz I want this
"At 6:42 your ""secret"" passage is easily detectable by the glowing lights underneath the bookcases.  The scratches under the bust are also a dead giveaway.  The gap between the floor and the bookcase slider is another dead giveaway."
"Literally, Stanley Pines."
Can you be my uncle please
"A buddy for throwing Frisbees AKA MKBHD...

Check, this guy is badass."
Kinda reminds me of Odd Squad HQ ngl lol
Can we just talk about that box trust that has no base plates or support to it
mark rober is now my favorite youtuber
I GOT CRUNCH LABS
he noclipped into the backrooms üíÄ
maybe a water sensor in the sink to catch those who just touch the handle instead of actually washing their hands?
"Yes, but why?"
"It would be way cooler if the toy car reaches the end of the hot wheels track would do something. Like when reaching the end it will hit a button or something to turn off the lights, it would open some secret door of some sort and will be back at its place again."
I'm not sure what is better...Mark's inventions...his lab...or the editing on this video! Bravo all around!
Question:I live in Texas if I were to get the platinum ticket how would I get there?
I think every kid dreams about having this kind of warehouse. Including me
its so big
this is literally my dream when i was younger i did the same stuff but in minecraft tho üòÖ
I'm getting major Fantasy Factory vibes here
It would funny if he made the new base in Ashland Missouri where I‚Äôm guessing no one lives beside me
"time to get a super widescreen camera on that hotwheel car, and make it so you can ride it in VR with head movement tracking :P"
Bro where in the world is this
do you have a crunch labs but for teens 15-18?
"whats the ratio of the platinum tickets
out of the boxes"
Can you do a squirrel maze 3.0? Please
Gotta close the gap under the bookshelf so that light won't shine trough.
Where can I buy that chair !!?!?
Just shows not all hero's ware cape's
I think your already the best uncle xD
"Mark Rober made his lab the modern version of willy wonka and the chocolate factory! With platinum ticket, that is somethingüòâ"
this is so freaking cool!! my favorite part has to be the floor to ceiling whiteboards though üòç
After This video I will twist every eagle I see on a bookshelf
14:45 Scott would be proud
Love the video and I got the crunch 12 month packageüòé
I was so hoping for a willhelm scream when he dove off the balcony!
7:20 *10M people
I like how he mostly uses the nerf rival perses one of the best nerf brand blasters
DID U JUST SAY YOU STOLE SOME THING
"homeboy built a secret lair, started a movement, and broke a world record in a 17 min video"
6:03 we love logic gates
I love your vids
You should use airguns not nerf
"This is awesome, congrats"
"Ok, beware of nintendo's demands, you have created mark labo"
oompa loompa didly doo i smell chemicals cooking i do
"Hi mark
If someone got a box but lived abroad from you. How would they get to you if the received the ticket. Would expenses be covered or is it only Americans that have a shot at getting the ticket :("
"I thought the whole ‚Äúcrunch labs,‚Äù and ‚Äúcrunch box‚Äù would be like the biggest sponsorship to crunchyroll."
"It doesn't seem to ship to Switzerland, sadly..."
yeah but what if I don't flush
A very most excelent Creatatorium. Well done :)
Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory but better
No
No
Mark River is doing more for the next generation than our public school ever did
Bro do a battlebot
Did he just create the nerd's version of Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory?? I am in awe.
a real bummer that you have to be 18 by the rules :(

My friend just has a zipline from his bedroom into his swimming pool
It's always nice to watch these videos and feed off the positive happy go lucky energy that is always too lacking in this day and age
Ok grunkle stan
The question is‚Ä¶ do any computers in and around Crunch Labs run CrunchBang Linux?  Theme-based tools!
I applaud this video.  I also dreamed of an engineering lab when I was a small child.
You should partner with How Ridiculous and smash a bunch of things with the tennis ball cannon
Who all came here after watching project nightfall üòÇüòÇ
one minute in and im felling so jealous!!!!
the frisbee guy took you can't be a dog too seriously
"Gordon Freeman, is that you?"
This reminds me of grunkle stan's secret base!
"Only problem is that there is scratches near the eagle, signaling it's turned quite a bit which I'd suspicious, and also there is a blue light under the bookshelf which is a major giveaway... the way I'd fix this is to put LED lights under the bookshelf and desk and anywhere it fits into an aesthetic.. and then for the eagle u could put foam or smthn soft under the eagle to prevent scratching"
This guy has been planning everything something he started today is gonna come a year later
Might be the best video on the internet. ever.

Mark needs to make a skateboard that uses magnetic force to keep you on the board so you don‚Äôt fall

This video just made my day! What an amazing place you have created.
Only problem is fire hazard what if someone was smoking while pooping and they had to run they would burn alive
Do you ship to the UK
I'm in the weird part of YouTube again.
You can only get in through this secret entrance or the giant garage door.
What if you want Diet Pepsi
Next video: I‚Äôll be making a nuclear power plant
9:39 I scanned the QR code pettily and got rickrolled üíÄ
So basically you are the Willi Wonka of engineering
"Ngl, Mark just working together with Elon Musk would be cool."
Wow
Make a version of these boxes for folks with a Grey hair or two and im on the list ASAP Mark!
well if that aint the best goddamn sales pitch ive ever heard
yes but what about team breeze for clean air?
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Goodguy mark rober at it once again.

"#5 let‚Äôs just ignore the blue light coming out of the bottom of the bookcase.
There is nothing behind there. No secret lab or anything."
"Nobody:
Me: *iTs MrWhOsEtHeBoSs*"
Wait wait wait. Did he just say Phat gus?! and not fantastic gus? How is that possible! 3:47
Are these things in Canada or not
I really hate the fact that most American YouTubers such as Mark or Mr beast aren't able to ship over any of their products in the UK and if they even do that you still have to pay in dollars mark if you read this you will change the country of Britain thank you
"nobody:
my birthday coming soon: (:<"
"Mark, I wish I was a kid again. Thank you for thinking of the kids."
The shelves in the entry office leak way too much light and it gives the entrance away. Very cool area in any case.
I WANT THAT BOX !!!!!!!! even though I am 21
"5 MINUTES IN AND THIS IS ALREADY SO AWESOME.
Is no one going to talk about MKBHD cameo with his frisbee?"
Dang it... I live in the Philippines and I really want one soo bad but we ain't got money for it its like 1500Php per month but I can't do anything about it so im just gonna watch You (Mark Rober) so I can learn something new!. [ I know that you may or may not see this comment but its ok :) ]
"way to go Mark, swell pad! congrats!!
I even enjoyed the commercial. to package up all that engineering knowledge for kids to play with is pretty amazing. you're making the world a better place üçª
might have to get the disc launcher, for me!
there was a disc launcher gun in the '70s that was a favorite toy. I can already see that your design launches discs way better üòÄ"
This gives me Odd Squad vibes lol
4:39 as if that is NOT Marquess Brownlee lol
After 30 seconds I stopped caring.
"Just amazing, i love this idea so much. Ur the best Mark !!"
"Lol, where is MTV cribs at?"
This is the coolest thing ever!
there's no way that mark isn't the favorite uncle
That advert was really long
"Crunch lab, ah yes the founding father of making individual creativity come to life"
Stuff made here and mark rober SHOULD DO A COLLAB
Science and engineering are both just a fad. Nobody needs engineers. I've seen Idiocracy.
i cant buy the package because my parents dont let me thats sad because i want to meet mark
W O W
The PUL sun hoodie!!
anyone know the song played on 3:24 ???
I swear Mark has become this generations Billy Nye.
"Only thing I noticed, I see light under the book shelf. So I would def mess with things trying to open it"
Nothing secret about the entrance to the lab/warehouse when the bookcase has far too much light leaking out from underneath it.
Makes secret compartment-shares where it is with everyone
You‚Äôre going to have more ants than just the ones in that ant farm after all of those exploded watermelons üòÇüòÇüêúüêú
Another amazing video
Sharktank next?
awesome
"If I would have been Mark here, I would have built the whole thing underground and build another legit business over top so that when you enter the lab, you have absolutely ZERO idea that there's something underground. That would make it 100 times cooler. Totally something out of an espionage movie."
6:27 you can clearly see the light under the book shelf
"How did you make this, Mark Rober?"
How did you make this mark rober?
"hi Mark Rober, dude it is easy to find your secret door because there is light under the secret entrance so fix it pls"
"Recently, my car got robbed, and I lost thousands of dollars worth of technology. So I was wondering if you could‚Ä¶..

Invent a car window that, upon being smashed in by a burglar, immediately deploys something that releases from the top and bottom of the window, and clamp shut; detaining the burglar in some way."
‚Äú‚ÄòAin‚Äôt so secret now pard‚Äôner‚Äù
"Remember when Mark just filled pools with orbeez, I do."
"Your frisbee friend disrespected you with that professional athlete worth of extension on his catch, lol."
You're like a modern day willywonka mixed with Nikola Tesla. Love all of this.
"He's now become Willy Wonka, there's no stopping now"
That giant tooth has teeth. Do the tooth's teeth have teeth?
Is crunch labs availible in europe?
Is there an age limit on this? Because this looks really cool!
Whats more sad than a profesional frisbee thrower?

It's not very secret anymore now is it
"invite a delivery guy and tell him to help you to put the item you ordered  and open the secret lab hes gonna be thinking you're some CIA agent, that would be huge!"
Mark They can Still Find The Door Bcuz theres Light Under The Book Shelf
"11:09
Is that a freaking Claymore?"
Me watching this so I can rob his secret room
You should make a large jar or garden full of the compost of the watermelons you demolish in the future
6:55 is the joke that nobody drinks Diet Pepsi
CALL MR BBEAST

You can see the lab lights under the cupboard. That's a dead giveaway.
I would love to see Mark rover vs Penn and teller they set a magic trick and mark has to recreate it with out any plans or knowledge of how it's done and then they see if he made a new technique or has figured it out
Mark *explaining something important*                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Me *Vibing to the plants vs zombies 1 music*

Is the earth flat
What‚Äôs the website called to get the disc thrower
"So COOL! I love all that you do, keep being awesome!"
"My heart just broke with two little words at the bottom of the screen : ""US only"""
Where ?
When are we getting Mark Rober University?
It really that much of a 'secret' lab anymore
I watched this a few days ago and can‚Äôt help and comment that it looks so inaccessible for the disabled community. What if a child with mobility aids gets a ticket?
"Mark, you're truly incredible."
Is it US only?
"Wow, this is fantastic! Mark, your truly amazing"
–Ø —Ä—É—Å—Å—Å
"What if you jumped of the balcony, but the shipping container wasn't there"

this is awesome
You are great.
mark rober i can bet thet with your help I can fulfill my dream to become a engineer
Can we just appreciate the time and effort he puts in these videos? Respect! üíØ
I really wish CrunchLabs ships to Malaysia :(
"*Mark see a Watermelon* 
Mark: Finally! A Worthy opponent! Our battle will be legendary!

Watermelon: aaahh s***, here we go again."
Ohhhh. Can I come run some experiments???
Entertaining Video! Keep up the great work!
Lucky this guy didn‚Äôt stay at nasa
So there just a light below the cabinet  well mark
Gravity Falls?
"‚ÄúBumps into these stationary air molecules‚Äù isn‚Äôt generally how lift works. It‚Äôs the low pressure zone above the object that pulls it upward. Wings on a plane don‚Äôt push air down, they pull the plane up."
"Nope, that isn't the full reason. Yes that's partially true, but the main way it works is through the coanda effect. The wing curves the streamlines down, and thanks to conservation of momentum, the wings are forced upward"
"im assuming that explaining low pressure zones to children is still a tad complex. but in either case you are still in fact bumping into ""stationary"" air molecules."
This is every kids dream.
6:18 OOOOOOOOO THE MOOSIC
14:50 I disagree even if you weigh less I believe you can still go down with momentum.
You must have seen allot of Dexter's Lab when you were young.
"Hi Mark, you have a delivery destination to my neighbor Singapore but not Malaysia. Hope you plan to open up to Malaysia as well soon."
Light is escaping from the bottom of the bookshelf.
"Ever since I was five , Mark Rober changed my life I love science sense he posted his first video , now I‚Äôm 14 in science is really easy for me because things like this make me happy ! Seeing this happen for the other kids makes me happy!"
I would love to see you make a bike that never falls (I know this already exists but I want to see you do this your own way)
"I wish YouTube (and your channel) had existed when I was 12. I might have actually learned a few things. In reality, YT didn't exist until a few years after I graduated from high school."
hi
Any books on how to think like an engineer?
Can I come over
I'm 38 and I legitimately had a t-shirt with that Far Side comic on it.

Hey Mark you may never see this but thank you for your videos. I want to become an engineer. I love math and science so much. I just don‚Äôt know what I should do to actually become one. I guess that‚Äôs where I have to live my life.
Me getting my brothers phone and going to the part with the QR code to scan it with my phone
Mark would be an amazing science teacher
Cool
Invite the Furze over to collab!!
Rush E 2 is coming out soon‚Ä¶ just sayin üëÄ

Very epic design.  I'm surprised mark didnt used this as a Squirrel Maze 3.0  Speaking of that anyone still looking forward for another exciting Squirrel Adventure?
Can u make something out of solar power
THE FAR SIDE ONE GAVE ME FLASHBACKS DUDE!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!
LOVE IT
You can see the warehouse under the bookcase just so you know
"It always impresses me that Mark seems like such a nice and fun dude passionate about his work and tries to inspire everyone else in the world too.

What a legend."
"üëÜüëÜ

:( i can't afford it :( it 300$ in total and i have 150$ :(
This is awesome! any chance you'll be shipping to argentina any time soon??
"can you show us how you did it? I really wanted to see how you got the bookshelf to slide, or you can show us your progress i might wanna do this some day. Thanks!!!"
First mistake was using Willy Wonka as a reference. This is Dexters Laboratory you uncultured swine lol
Really sweet...I love your designs and pranks...

That train horn bike is cool! I have something similar what I did is I went to a junkyard and took a horn out of an F-150 and then used a drill battery and put it on my bike. üòÉ
Mark Rober you are doing such a great job at making videos! I love your content thank you so much! And also a little heads up you can see the light from the WareHouse under the bookshelf.
Can I help
Bros in minecraft
Completely opposed to the toilet sensor. It's not my job to put the seat up when it's equally on them for not checking
i‚Äôm still confused on how big this place is
big Fantasy Factory vibes
Mark Rober would be an amazing weapons developer if he out his mind to it.
Hey mark I‚Äôm a physicists I would love to get together and work on a project
"What about us outside of the US, Mark? I feel like most of these giveaways on youtube now a days are US only. It would be nice to be able to even participate."
"I wish there was a ""love"" button cause like just doesn't cut it. This is so cool Mark! You're the real life nerdy Willy Wonka."
Yo mark Rober I am a huge fan
A new dude perfect is born.....you should gather up your powers for a MEGA VIDEO

Mark is like the real life tony stark
You guys should sell those boxes at Walmart. They'd be so cool
Mans just like those ppl on the when we were growing up with a secret lab
The amount of adults (including me) who's a child at heart that's gonna order that box lol
Watching this 2 days before my final FEM exam makes me cry for all the little kids thinking its all about building stuffü•≤
"I want to buy the monthly box for my adult son who Ives in  a different state than I do, I am not sure of the best way to get I, I was a little confused by the suggestions and process, it talks about a virtual card thing, please assist with this matter."
i live in the trenches??
is the videos only for the people who buy it
This is literally my dream. Congrats
"Hey @Mark Rober I do rock climbing and there is something called an autobellay which is a device that lowers everyone at a reasonably equal at different weights, I think it uses magnetic or something but I‚Äôm not sure. How do these work?"
"Im so happy for you and your family and your Team Mark, Ive been along for the ride almost since the start and to see the channel grow this much and to see you smile and achieve your dreams is sooo amazing. Stay dope and keep that amazing content coming :)"
Grunkle stan????
mark is one of the coolest humans on earth
"I want to see Mark fight not a nerf battle here, I wanna see a nerf war fought here"

whats the background music playing at 7:00?
You can see the light from under the bookshelf.
cops get called cuz people are staking out buildings and touching everything
Giant warehouse lab <<<<<< adult playground
You are so awesome MARK
My dream job is it engineer this will help me become it
"This is the guy You Tube was made for.

Best of luck with the business venture with Crunch Labs

Back in the 70's Radio Shack had the 300 in 1 electronics lab where you applied patch wires between batteries and electronic components to make several different things. Back then there was a Radio Shack in every town and eventually you went in there and as a kid those labs were cool. I got one when I was 9. And it launched my love for computers and electronics.

I hope your Build Boxes do the same. Critical Thinking is in short supply. Kids today are told what to think but now how to think.

Dude built a Club House we all dreamt of when we were kids. Jealous."
Mark for president when?
I might have been watching too much breaking bad but this would be a great‚Ä¶
"This. looks. so. cool!! Such a cool idea to try get more and more kids into STEM and eng. Out of curiosity, would u consider opening up the competition to people outside of the states?"
admire your work Mark!
bro wat will hapen if mayby i winn  the silber tiket and im from germany how du i get wif my family thu your lab will you buy us a pane ticket or wat will hapen plead help me aut
"I mean, the lab is cool. But I really like the oldschool office :D"
At 3:27 there is music playing . What is it called
What does the lab look like from the outside? Is it just a tiny office with an giant warehouse connected to it?
that ping-pong ball claymore thing looks so cool
ü•≥
whats the background music playing at 7:00?
Plants vs. Zombies music roof something...
why can you be my physics teacher
"Dude Mark, I don't even know what to say, that vid was just like the coolest thing ever! I'll get myself one of the ""dang Build Boxes"" as soon as I can. Keep up the great work, love your videos, everything you do has just made me want to think in some smarter way. Things that I had never before questioned I now think about all the time."
you could legit become batman but better
I wish I had a phat Gus plush

This will be a museum in 40 years time.
This just makes me want to be Mark's nephew even more...
You‚Äôre probably never ever going to see this comment but if I find out where that is can I come in ü§£ü§£ if you say yes well then that‚Äôs my purpose in life now ü§£
What hurts more 105 mph baseball or this tennis ball
"No one has 22mln subscribers not being owned by the elite, with zero interesting to say of course."
the light beneath the bookshelf kinda gave the lab away
This is a masterclass in marketing - well done
This is so freaking cool
"This feels like a Mark Rober style, over the top extension of the pandemic science lessons from two years ago. You stopped them, saying you wanted to work on something big. Is this the big thing?  Do the kits have to be for kids?"
Jesse! I found a new place for us to cook!!
"Nerf guns are fun, but can you create a system that would recollect the bullets please? :)"
I  bet that platinum ticket has a phone number on the back that goes to a phone that mark will answer. ü§îI want it so much üò≠
What if the lab was a red herring and there was a bigger lab behind it.
"Mark,  Congratulations on this new achievement.  You are an amazing human being.  Jeff"
Best. Warehouse. Ever
Can the crunch labs come to England I mean the bowes with the stuff inside
I wanna make a place like this but for my restaurant when I become older. (I wanna become a chef). But I‚Äôm now thinking that some sort of cool function in the barn house restaurant could be cool. Thanks for lighting my creativity.
how much for each package?
dude whaht. where is this. i couldnt fly anywhere to try and find this.
üòÇüòÇ ÿ™ÿßÿßÿßÿßŸÅŸá
For the world record hot wheels track did you use the half a mile hot wheel tracks from the domino video?

Can you do us a favor and make a remaster of Moonbase Alpha
"Also, I want to become an engineer just so I can say ""Im an engieneer, I solve  practical problems"" while playing a guitar."
So now you go tell the parents to spend 200$

bro legit made a batcave
Mark is the reason robots are gonna overtake the world
He built dexter‚Äôs lab!!!
I know I will never find it . I live in ak
dude you have the best video's ever!
He built he's own batcave
That epic warehouse is soooo cool!
"Mark! Please consider changing the title of this video.. it's terribly understated in my opinion, and doesn't do justice to the mammoth accomplishments within it."
9:40 what if the link is a rickroll
you posted this on my birthday
This Guy Out Here Doing God's Work
It looks like your version of the freedom factory! I‚Äôd have a blast (pun intended) hanging out for a day!

Will you make any videos with the platinum ticket winners if they agree?
"4:15 what happens if you miss the ""giant pit?"""

I want to be an engineer because I watched this
how much did this cost
Should have named it S.T.A.R. labs
"I was wondering if there are people who actually watch these videos, these types of videos are trending in the most watched ones Nobody can interfere in anyone's life"
???
They should make a electronic toy box for like making rc cars or something cool.
he's probably making like 90 secret projects at a time
Imagine forgeting moving that big container and jumpin on the floor
I wonder if I‚Äôm gonna get the platinum ticket
Your awesome!
I can not stop watching this video it is amazing
willy wonka would be proud
Mark if you need an extra hand I will be able to help in about five years from now
Mark I did a project on you
You colud se the light under the book shelfüßê
"bro I‚Äôve been watching mark since he appeared in tv with the pranks n stuff watching him grow like that is truly amazing. Mark u insane my dude 







THERES A FOAM PIT TOOO"
i want those but i live in pakistan and i dont think those are avilable
I thought nitro was Arnold Schwarzenegger
I can‚Äôt get it for the uk do you know how it is it not available
We don't deserve Mark Rober
"13:29 Now, why would you go and do something like that? Didn't you see the sign that said, ""DO NOT PUSH THIS BUTTON!""? How will we finish testing with the self-destruct mechanism active?"
I came back from longer weekend and first thing I see is this vid
make the office in the starting office.
But...where are the lava lamps?
i wanna be an engineer/architect and i cant decide

"@mark Rober
THIS EVERY KID‚ÄôS DREAM AND WHAT IVE ALWAYS WANTED TO BUILD MYSELF AND HAVE.
You just built MY DREAM ROOM! With secret passages, awesome Bond gadgets and just the coolest gear!
Congrats on your dream coming true and best wishes for the future adventures that WILL COME!
Cheers to you and everyone involved üëçüèª‚úåüèª"
all that you're doing is incredible.
I really wish i could buy the box but $300 is too much for my family
This is the first step of the robot revolution
My son always watches you we are in on crunch labsüòé
You should use actual guns with live ammo
yert
my guy even got youtube's atention
W O W
That's just awesome.
"13:22 You can make that continuous, if you want."
This is my childhood dream. 30 years later
2:28 but wouldn't the piston have some restriction if the weight is too much or too low because the piston would require a certain level before you can use the rope to go down
it can be delivered to India sir
This is AMAZING!!
Those boxes are awesome! I wish i had something like this when i was a kid
I'm sorry not onion Junior I mean engineer
I didn't have enough space to finish the other 1 you make such cool videos I wish I was a big onion Junior like you
SPEECHLESS
"Super bright light under book shelf showing secret passage. ""Nailed it"""

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you gentlemen have a Pepsi?‚Äù

even if i got the silver ticket I cant come because I live in saudi Arabia
"Guys like Mark are why I wish YouTube was around when I was a kid. I may not have ended up as an engineer, but he‚Äôs a brilliant role model. His best lesson has always been that just because you fail doesn‚Äôt mean you have to quit. Being able to work through the failure and push towards success and find solutions is a lesson that can be used in any part of life. Hats off to this guy, no YouTuber deserves more success than him."
"@Andy-GTI but he does spend a lot in one video too, so technically he needs it after buying a whole wear house."
Agree!
True
@Andy-GTI how does that have anything to do with the dude's comment?
"@Andy-GTI well you could also imagine that to pay to make a lot of his projects, his team, living expanses, business expanses, etc. Would cost significantly more than $70k. He is similar to Mr.Beast where he puts his revenue back into his ideas and projects and thats what makes him and people alike stand out. It's also interesting to note (as evidence to my statement) that over the last years, his growth has obviously brought him a bigger financial success which in return also made his projects bigger in size and quality"
Bro why did you make the entrance so complicated? You could've just put 2 signs and a painting in a hole in the wall
bypass the hand washing alarm: don't flush >:)
MKBHD!!!!
Some times i wish i live in the us
team trees team seas and my buddy mrbeast huh
can you react to the glitterbomb deepfakes
I would love to live there
Does the kit ship to Asia?
"Mark. I keep trying to reach out to your team. I'm just wondering when the Color the Spectrum T-shirts will be available?

I have been waiting for my chance to wear one since the event. Hope you're doing well!"
It‚Äôs secret until 9.9 million people see it on YouTube
I have to take my hat off to Mark Rober who is the complete master of all production content and who has totally unlocked the secret YouTube algorithm. I was having so much fun watching this video that it wasn‚Äôt until the 17 minute mark that I realised I‚Äôd been watching an advertisement. Now that‚Äôs total genius work. Thanks Mark and I hope your project spawns a whole new generation of engineers. Cheers! :-)
Bro is living my dream I whant this
"hey Mark I had a cool idea for one of your next video's, I thought of a base ball that always throws strikes"
I'm 28. Is it strange that I want to get the Build Box?
I want to meet you without the ticketü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
should I really be under 12 to get one ?
Is that Marques from MKBHD throwing the frisbee?
"Only Mark Rober can just casually be like ‚Äúoh yeah my friend the pro ultimate frisbee player‚Äù like it‚Äôs already no biggie, and then it‚Äôs MARQUES BROWNLEE"
and i m nl
"i have an idea for 3 tings a top hat, a rainbow bow and a costume that can light up and has mic and bluetooth for a boy so if u can make it it wil be awesome"
everything about this is genius. ofc it is... youre a genius.
Did i hear pvz music or is that just me
22M WOOOO
"This reminds me of Entertainment 720 from ""Parks and Recreation"" but better"
That wall of guns really rubs me the wrong way. Appreciate your way of bringing knowledge to the YouTube crowd.
"This is what you get with a very genius engineer, with lots of time on his hands, lots of money in his bank, and who is still a kid at heart.
Well done, Mark."
"Did you know, he makes $70,303 from one video?"

will the build boxes only sell this summer?
this looks like the sort of wacky house that you would see in a disney channel show
hi im from malaysia and i would like to buy the crunch lab so bad üò¢
You can see the light
How much it all costed to build? Wow Is YouTube money paying for all this ?
"Random person: are ypu afraid to get robbed?

I'm British so the crunch labs kits look amazing but I don't know if they can ship to England?
Awesome lab but dude. You just took kiwicos idea and passed it off as your own. They've supported loads of your videos in the past
Nah not couch plus. MEGA COUCH!!!
This guy made a weapon more powerful that a rifle only it uses small balls instead of 12mm armor piercing bullets
Great stuff Mark.
He's a marketing genius
Is it worldwide shipping?
Lol you might want to fix the bright strip of light beneath the bookshelf. It kind of gives it away. XD
"Don't get me wrong but this feels more like a museum and not an engineering lab. Did you just not show the Maschinerie (laith, mill etc)

some areas like the big sports room are amazing for testing tho"
"Someone probably already said it, but the light under the bookcase is a really big clue. Besides that, that is awesome. Very awesome I want one."
how can it be secret if u tell it millions of people ?
"nerf gun wall, secret passageways, giant foam pit... this lab is E P I C. well done!"
Does your worker's health insurance cover nerf gun injuries?
Hey Mark would love you to do an interview and secret colab. with Naomi Wu!  That would be fun...
"If he becomes a supervillain, we're all fucked."
"whats the first music chopsticks called the usual one that mark uses for his intro?
the one that says echante in french"
Why does he sound like jojo siwa
bro when war breaks out you're set
You ship the boxes to Denmark and sweden but not Norway?
nice
"Everyone dream uncleü§©
Btw AMAZING secret room"
"Those boxes are great, I think a more advanced version for older people would sell well."
@Andy-GTI he deserves that and more!
I'm 29 and I think I'm gonna buy some! Gotta start somewhere :^)
"I dont have money for it, but I would absolutely love it. Maybe even have boxes where you make things that are not only fun but also useful"
"I would definitely buy it! I'm retired military I need something to fill up my days with other than landscaping and crocheting...oh and drinking beer, lol"
@Andy-GTI doesn't surprise me. He is very smart about when he uploads his videos and what he makes them about.
Omg this is so cool place
"if I were to ask mark to build something, I would ask him to make a robot that sponsors my channel."
This is literally my dream. I wish I could live there. Great work!
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
The kit is not able to ship to India :(
Mark seems to amaze me everytime
"so very impressive, great ideas and that warehouse, wow. loved every minute"
:0000 the PvZ rooftop music is awesomee
"The thief trying to break in to crunch labs after watching Mark Rober's video:

Mark rober is coollllllll

do the build boxes ship internationally or are they only available in the US?
You don't realise somebody moved foam pit -üíÄ
AMAZING!!!!!!!
Gives me Dexter's laboratory vibes...
This is why we love Mark
Mark has an Xbox Series X on display. Mark is the goat.
"Too bad you're MRNA vaccinated,, you were smart and had a lot of potential."
Thats nice but i think i heard PvZ music
My crowbar I been doing Mark Rover I‚Äôve been doing ultimate frisbee for
Future Sheldon Cooper type engineers will watch Mr. Rober
"Hey Mark, for your Make-Over I would make sure there is no light coming out through a gap under the secret entrance."
Need to cover the light coming from under the secret lab door:)
Cool.
I am so afraid of fome cube pits because I got stuck in one when I was little.
Hey Mark. Can we PLEASE be friends?! :-O
"Really not fan of the idea of crunch since I worked in video games, but amazing workshop! Love the secret passages and the box might get a lot of children in engineering, I wish I had that!"
You need a lot of work on your superhero landing.
I have never watched a 17 minutes commercial before. Cool stuff!
Crunch labs
This dude is like 4 videos away from becoming ironman
this reminds me of Dexters secret laboratory
Might be worth adding a roll of cloth or a brush underneath that bookcase to stop light from leaking under it.
Stop because I hope I dream of being in your secret office!!
What I would do to be Mark Rober‚Äôs nephew
THIS LITTERALLY EVERYTHING A CHILD WOULD WANT
"Okay Mr. Davenport, nice lab"
No 2 on trending sheeeeeeeesh

Me to I really want to make a lab
what is 1
So... Freaking.... COOL!!!!
I also really like your crunch lab‚Äôs  boxes
give mrbeast 100m subscribers
I really want to be a engineer like you and hope to build amazing things like you
I am disappointed there isn‚Äôt a single breaking bad reference in an underground lab
Thats a nice hint
And I want to craft stuff
I will be 12 in 10 days
That lad is so cool
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüî•üî•üî•
So fantasy factory‚Ä¶
you should give us an update about miss fat Guss
That lab is so cool!! Your creations and designs take engineering to another level!!
Mark's raising the bar for himself wth every video! In a few years we might see a rocket that goes to the moon or something!!
have you heard of mesa (math enginering science art)
This I‚Äôve been waiting for my son is very bright he‚Äôs 6 but I struggle to challenge him thanks for making a Box we can trust!
Hey I am an engineer well... Not classified but I do make a lot of paper/cardboard crafts to help me for example 'my helpful finger' which is some origami folds and I put it between my fingers then when my fingers go close to each other the origami clips and it can pick up 1.5kg

How do you sign up for crunch lab
Where did you get the horn for your bike? George

I'm just interested in the accessibility like having a lift that goes up to the higher level etc.
This. is. so. cool. Mark Rober is amazing!!!
Bros doing red stone irl
Zach King has competition
Do you ship to India üáÆüá≥
Bro how much did that cost
"i've seen other things in the past where they send out a box with build activities in them but you just know, without a doubt that this new CrunchLabs thing done by Mr Rober himself is going to be setting the new gold standard. How many of those other things are run by former NASA engineers? I hope CrunchLabs is as successfull as i think it is going to be"
"People with asian parents... yeah, we don't get da boxes :')"
failing is not bad failing is you finding a way that does not work

Please be our leaderüçÄ
U are amazing I love your videos
POV: you want to be a engineer but you have strict parents or you don't have anything that you can use to start engineering and can't get anything like that yet.
Spreading the love for science is an important career that I respect.
Just like the entrances to the Bat Cave!
This is cool
Hum I don't know how to say this.  You know id like to really meet you.  Not because I am a famous scientist or a chemical engineer üòâ.   But cause I'm Autistic.   Im high functioning and I have a bachelor in Programming and a masters in Databases and networking.  I have achieved a lot being on the spectrum.  I would love to meet you. Would also give you hope with your son who is Autistic.  Let's say a glimpse into the future.    That is something that would make me happy if I could get that chance I know not many people get to meet you.
Newest vid running out of stuff to watch love the vids
keep up the amazing work mark
What casters are on that shipping container?
I‚Äôd love to have the mind of Mark Rober.
I think that place is where dom set the dominos
This is my life long dream. So epic
Be careful with that container. There should be some big foamy side guards to keep people from accidentally landing on the edge or falling off.
I got it hope it‚Äôs worth it!
Mark Rober is the new Bill Nye. You two should do a collab
"Admit it, you just scanned the video qr code and found the crunch labs youtube channel. Admit it."
"So, does the box with a dart hole hold the platinum ticket? ü§´"
"6:26 you can see the light coming from underneath the bookshelf, i think anyone who notices is gunna get suspicious lmao"
You built Dude Perfect Headquarters 2.0
Reminds me of Fring‚Äôs meth lab from Breaking Bad!
"OMG, we are sooooo excited about this! I am one of those parents who asked you to do something for kids. Thank you Mark!"
"6:26

mark: this is how we keep it super secret

YES
do you like rubix cubes
I‚Äôm a genius I just screenshoted the QR code and got the video

You deserve the world my friend

you probably could legit tighten up that fireman piston design and sell it to fire departments
are u there
mark?
hi mark
"This is awesome =) and just so you lol. =) Thank you for inspiring so many to want to ""be like you"" its a fantastic thing! Loved the lab favorite part was your 15:49 retreat lmao Nitro was one of my favorites too!"

Bro I wish I could come to the where house
Mark Rober is the embodiment of the principle that growing up is optional.  I love it!
I‚Äôm a huge fan and I would LOVE to see your Willy Wonka Factory but I live in Australia :(
You should give Mr. Beast a call so that he could do something like this
@6:19 Or Look down at the floor and see lights coming from the wall unit. You can found it.
Hey mark I know you probably won‚Äôt see this but is there any way you can make a kids helicopter that only flys a little above ground I would tell my mom to buy me that like for all ages cause I‚Äôm sure a lot of people from any age would want to try
How do we tell you we found the ticket??

Does anyone else realize we already saw this in the dominoes video
I won the science fair contest because of your videos :)
I wished I grew up with mark rober videos
"I saw the garage door in one of the shots; you have another way in, you cad! ;P

Also, if Psychonauts 2 taught me anything, it's that the giant tooth decay poster is to be burned to reveal the secret passage behind it."

im a bit sad because i dont have a card or anyone to buy it for me and my birthday is in a few months and you probably wouldnt be giving out signatures. I can just hope you answer my question on if you will still be giving out signatures after idk when it ends or something.

I relied on youtube videos a lot, plus I did not realize how much money I would spend on supplies plus the class itself. (I did finish my build and it was awesome, a Oreo crossbow. I like how crunch comes with the materials to help build the invention while mark rover describes the science behind it, helping us learn how to become better engineers. Its also a lot cheaper. That was a great idea mark"

I feel like Mark is like one of those characters in a movie or story no one hates cuz he always does such wholesome things!
Awesome job Mark!  You deserve this.  Kudos.

You should build your own hot wheel as an added bonus for your track. (If you want it as a challenge, try making it so that it maintains its speed for a longer time than the best hot wheels car out there.)

"That's so amazing. Wish you the best with these boxes. Now I just want you to make a box for grown ups that's a bit more difficult. Like building a robot vacuum, a GPS, a pair of bluetooth headphones, a doorcam or a drone or something like that."
"i just wanted to say that these build boxes are seriously really cool. i‚Äôm not part of the target demographic anymore, but when i was young, having an ongoing source of easy, manageable engineering projects like those would‚Äôve very probably sparked a real passion in me. the child in me got super excited hearing about it all."
Wow ü§©

"I really love this, a playground for those who have always stayed a child deep inside xD As programmer I know how awesome it feels to finally make something work, especially if its many little pieces fitting perfectly together in the end to become something big and awesome! I bet with that creativity and passion for what you are doing and teaching you will inspire a whole generation =) 
Stay awesome, and never grow up! xD"

I love your lifting rope ; jump off rope
MARQUES!!! My absolute favorite cameo :)) best part for me

Absolutely incredible
"It's hard to be jealous of a guy that just seems so genuine and wears his love of his career on his sleeve, he's clearly put his all into being as successful as he is. And the fact that he really tries to inspire kids to get into engineering and not see failure as a negative is just the cherry on top."
Soooooo many bots
‚Äú motivate ‚Äú anyone who isn‚Äôt working hard
"I need to know... Please tell me if I can get it in europe, if not please make it available."
That foam pit's all fun and games until someone doesn't realize it's moved
You can make a centrifugal break for the fireman rope. It can be made pocket size
After 20 years the world is full of great engineers groomed by Mark Rober. This will help kids at the early age to become creative and innovative. You and MrBeast are setting high standards for an influencer. Great job!
"DUDE...obviously this is all fun and cool but......NITRO FROM AMERICAN GLADIATORS?! Im guessing you and are very much the same age or extremely close in age (40) and American Gladiators was such a huge deal to me that I would end up trading an absurd amount of chore work for a little kid in exchange for being able to stay up and watch.

American Gladiators and Nitro are effing LEGEND"
NASA trying to cancel this because they getting job applications from 9yr olds.
Do you also have a camera in your washroom?ü§∑
If I was to get a platenium ticket would it say when to come?
But i live in croatia
Mark Rober is a genius who uses his great mind for nice safe things. Image what would happen he started making weapons. That would be scary.
bro he said he let 20 million people see the secret entrance but there are only 8 million views :/
You gave firefighters a great idea to get rid of the pole.
i just realised you can 3d print 90% of the things that you would pay 30$ for but it only costs 3 in resin.
Critical thinking makes you a better human.
I want one lol
"Whenever you gi to the lab on video you better say ""to the crunch lab""in a voice reminiscent of batman"
What engineer are you?
I as the caption and immediately thought Gravity Falls
I‚Äôm jealous now
I know Mark has never used that work bench because it has a 10mm

"oh no mark just did a thing , now everyone is checking things regardles where . we gonna see some people pressing buttons in hospitals XD"
Signing up to do with my nephews. Happy to support you. I wish we had products like this when we were young. We had discovery toys and little electronic kits down at radio shack and that was really it. Excited to do them with them though!
I NEED to see the camera on the green hot wheel
Amazing
Where is squirrel maze 3.0?
Why are you so awesome? What‚Äôs the matter with you? You remind me of a ‚ÄúLaw Abiding Citizen‚Äù.
A genius at both engineering and marketing! Love it!
Can you buy that in Italy?
Engineering is for kids that are autistic or kids that loveeee learning the process üëç
I feel like engineers are just socially awkward kids ü§£
"Mark: has a secret doorway from the movies

Reminds me of a Minecraft house
Mark Rober truly helping make the world a better place
Do a cohete
i sooooo baaadddly want that bike haha
"You inspire me so much!! You‚Äôll probably never see this comment but thank you for being you.  you know, for being freakin awesome"
i love your videos i want to be an engineer when i grow up and change the world i have an idea for a robot that cleans table because i hate having to clean it so my idea is to have like window wiper the ones on cars but spinning in a circle suctioned on the table and bags on the outside to catch the food
GTA online really be like
I want one
"mark- i don‚Äôt know if you will ever read this comment, or ever know who i am, but at one of the million people who have watched you, i just want to say thank you for everything and i‚Äôm proud of you. you‚Äôve made it and only trying to bring joy to others. that‚Äôs real. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Amazing!!
somehow this is my first time really seeing one of your videos just started as an engineer recently after finishing school would definitely love a warehouse like this one day
Mark is really the Bill Nye of this generation
legit
"Apart from the glaring light coming from under the cabinet it would be secret. heh, amature. Mark Rober 0:1 Dede"

hey Mark I was wondering if I should go into engineering for college
It's bigger than my whole house
I dare you to play scrap mechanic
I wish you had another channel that really shows you designing and constructing and all the mathematics. I‚Äôm in college for engineering and I would be so fascinated to see another engineer I look up to do what I am learning in class
Almost like a advanced master class for college kids
On the sides of the entrance you should have put a fish tank
"MARK If i ever had a child someday, I would definitely get this... for myself and ofcourse for my son/daughter HAHAHAHA"
I love how he talks about things i have no CLUE ABOUT
The fireman did what in what??!
you have inspired me to want to be a engineer
What is this gravity falls.
evrybody. needs. to. be. like. you.
Throwback to when Mark was at 3 mill
Nice video
oof i can see a light down the library . revealing the entrence ... but still i would have loved to been there lol
is it just me or the light on the bottom of the bookshelf gives it away
Omg Who else is excited for Nitro üòÄ
Dangggg tony stark irl
Nitro !

Or both
d8d you copy  mr beast and his winly wonka stuff aka you jump on the band wagon
This dude is YELLING
Bro people like mark rober and mr beast are proof that not everyone is here just for the money and that there are still people who care for this planet and everything on it. And it makes me so happy to see them create cool things and start charities to help people and bring entertainment at the same time.
its just so cool to think marks literally changing peoples future with stuff like this. it might not be a lot of people but im sure there will be kids that get so inspired from doing these that theyll end up doing something big with it.
Mark rober I really seem interested but I live across the country all way in Delaware and I want to be part of it so what am I supposed to do?
I'm 37 and I want to go to the crunch lab. Great job recreating the best parts of childhood under one roof!
I admire you with everything in me I love engineering!
People who actually wanted diet pepsi üòê6:48

Genius‚Ä¶ level 2.
Wait-  does that mean we won‚Äôt have any more secret labs for another 1 1/2 years?
This is so cool
But some of these boxes for adults aka still children would be dope üëÄ
Bro got dexters lab
"You are a madman, and this is one of the best and most original channels on YT. Keep up the fantastic content."
"If I came off the street or delivered a package, I'd see the bookshelf is so obviously a door. There's light shining from underneath it and there's wheels on the bottom."
Ok
Uh‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúFirefighter‚Äù - it‚Äôs 2022 you know.
First watch on 7/17/2022
umm you can see the light from behind the bookshelf-door from the oface side
"Crunchlabs is awesome,"
I‚Äôm a kid and I have autism and it‚Äôs so cool that he his making these boxes to build
Now this is just another jackass movie
This is simply amazing
For us it‚Äôs a new video but for the watermelons it‚Äôs an apocalypse
THAT... wow
Let's go fantasy factory v2 üòéüëä
Breaking bad type build
Follow on Youtube
Bro livin gta securo serve
Mark Rober is the YouTuber where I watch the sponsors and promotions instead of skipping them
you should build a quarterpipe at the end of the foam pit
Congrats on #1 trending mark rober!
For Australians he just made questacon
Seriously the Bill Nye of my kids generation. MKB as well! Are you kidding me? Just give the guy the Nobel!
I gotta be honest mark...I have neices and nephews but I kinda wanna order the toys for myself!! Ur channel is awesome sir hoping to share it with said kids

2:44 she is actually my bestie irl so that‚Äôs pretty cool XD
BRO CAN I DO PARKOUR THERE PLS?
6:43 That secret enterance is quite suspecious if you can see light seeping under the shelf lmao
I‚Äôm going to need to see a collaboration with you and Stuff Made Here
Awesome
What are he and mr beast up to with the similar wonka themes?
Mark you gotta make adult beginners level boxes and so on. For the adults that have that kid in them still
When your in science classes it helps you
I‚Äôm sad that I didn‚Äôt watch this video sooner.
"Fix the light underneath the bookshelf, but really cool place and vid"
I wonder if there is wheelchair access to the cool balcony. The fireman's piston would be awesome fun for that.
6:36 for reveal
"why does this remind me of bill nye
(but much much cooler ofc)"
Do you deliver to Europe ?
This is such a great way to get kids interested in engineering!
I have this project I won't to do but my parents don't believe I can make something that can work
Mark Rober is todays Bill Nye. What an amazing individual
I want one too
I was so excited when you said we got your signature that is on my bucket list
My opinion the #1 coolest thing there is you Mark your amazing and I love that your passion is to inspire the younger generation and give us all these amazing videos. Thank you Mark we love you üíï
But before you can see if I actually live
"I really wish I were a kid again so I could go down this path. When I was younger, I loved the Tinkerbell movies because she was basically an engineer and I thought she was sooooo cool, but to physically have something to help me channel that passion would have definitely set me on a different path (I‚Äôve already graduated college with a fine arts degree). I‚Äôm so excited for all the future engineers that come out of this!"
great vid<3
"5:21
Speak for yourself."
We can make anything? ü§î
I am sad I cannot get this beacuse i am from the Philippines
"You sound like a very likeable guy, love your work! Guy from Norway with autism."
This is amazing bro ‚ô•
"Can anyone see the big problem of having a secret room Then show 8,000,000 people where it is"
Pov Me after I finished the Nuka world code quest
me just noticing u can see light from under the secret door
"I‚Äôm from Canada, can I buy it?"
how much you want for it
An engineer can take with patience and passion can literally take over the world üî•
Other than the light under the bookshelf.
it's where he hides the bodies
"Wow, just wow, this video is a 10/10, keep doing a great job Mark"
If we had more college professors that loved teaching like Mark the world would be a better place.
Were is the location
Love your work Mark. Inspiring US youth to embrace and celebrate a projectile based society.
It would be useful if he Invented a way to get Joe Biden out of office so we don‚Äôt have $10 gas this summer
6:26 you can see the light under the place with books
"Thanks for all of the inspiration, I‚Äôm happy for you."

from now on i‚Äôm going to check every bookshelf and painting on the wall
"It is still rare to see someone so passionate about what they do, and to get so much joy from it that they can't help but share it.  
Well done Mark.  The Crunch Lab boxes seem like great kits. I wish you continued success."
it looks like an green screen
That launcher can really place intruders in a hospital. If they can find the lab first.
Elephant toothpaste. Not devils tooth paste‚Ä¶. Elephant.

"Hard question time

im most stoked about your safer packaging. great thinking here wish more youtubers were more responsible
Hey this is awesome however you might want to fix the fact at the secret door isn‚Äôt so secret since you can see it‚Äôs off the ground and on top of that you can see a light underneath which both of those are a dead give away
"Just bought the build box, so hyped!!!"
amazing warehouse !
A very cool lab but the shelf has lights shining under the shelf
The toys sound like a really great idea. I don‚Äôt have kids but I might buy in
Mark ur a ba
dudes living in the future
Your such a legend Mark
I‚Äôm going to use crunch box now! I‚Äôm so excited!
Mark you are awesome and so inspiring I love your channel it is so cool how you can help young kids or just people in general.
You need to put some opaque material under the sliding bookshelves because there's light leaking and it gives it away
Your the real willy wonka instead of candy it's cool toys and robots
You‚Äôre the best mark thanks for the awesome videos

Wish this shipped to the Philippines! Looks so cool. I'd love for my daughter to try her hand at engineering. :)
"I‚ÄîI can‚Äôt even. Just when you think Mark Rober can‚Äôt get any more legendary, he legit sets up, not just a kit parents can buy to make more little Robers, an actual workshop that people who buy these kits can visit. Wow. However, Mark, if you do manage to see this comment, I have just one question for you; If you could go back all these years, and choose to stay with NASA instead of going full time with YouTube, would you have stayed?"
Wow that is cool
reminds me of arrow
"i just wanted to say that these build boxes are seriously really cool. i‚Äôm not part of the target demographic anymore, but when i was young, having an ongoing source of easy, manageable engineering projects like those would‚Äôve very probably sparked a real passion in me. the child in me got super excited hearing about it all."

This guy is living his best live .
I‚Äôm speechless.
5:27 That's an amazing fire hazard you invented.
the warehouse is where he did the dominoes
"You can see the light coming from under the bookcase though, so we know there's something behind it"
"if only 1% of people who've watched this video, go on to buy his box... they've got a 1 in 80,000 chance of getting that platinum ticket.
That's better odds than winning the lotto, but still really bad odds lol"
Never tell me money doesn't buy happiness again
American Gladiators was a fun show. The tennis ball gun and the one where contestants shot back were my favorite things on TV back then.
"Question, will the trip cost be covered like gas food etc. or will we have to cover that, for the platinum ticket of course."
Hey mark your a hero!
Hey mark your a hero!
5:20 fire hazard

To be honest I wouldn‚Äôt think he would let you in.
He made himself the Willy Wonka of engineering. I love it.
This is every guys dream
"Hi Mark! Thanks for all the incredible work you put into the engineering world and for helping kids get interested in science! I‚Äôm an elementary teacher who‚Äôs teaching 2nd grade in the fall. Would these boxes be appropriate for a lower elementary extra curricular club or integration into a related science unit? Or do you think these should be reserved for home as more of a self-paced activity? If anybody has tried the Crunch Labs box and can offer some insight, please let me know!"
"Just so you know, ur son has the best dad ever"
I can't help thinking if someone jumped that fence thinking the foam pit was there but it wasn't. My mind sometimes. üòÉüòÉ

Day 1 of asking mark rober to make a giant growing crystal rock like thoes toys in target
Can you please create a toy box for adults? Like ages 18+? It could include soldering or actual computer components maybe.
you can see the light under the door ... but you probably already know that :)
Can you make an adult version? With more complex designs??
Awesome!
That invention that shows if you washed your hands is just amazing
How does the outside look tho???
why aren't you putting a motor  and controller for the foam filled shipping container
Amazing congrats Mark!
I would but my mom said no
rip
questoin if i find crunch lab behind the oversided tooth decay poster is it legal to get in
Signing up just to build the claymore lol
this is the type of thing you would make in minecraft but nah mark rober made it in real life
"My son‚Äôs going to be so happy when he gets the first box. 
I think he‚Äôll pass out if there‚Äôs a platinum ticket inside. 
Thanks so much Mark, this is exactly what your audience wanted and you freaking delivered!!"
Got our first box and it was AWESOME! The disc launcher works extremely well!
Yeah its actually a pretty affordable box

skrum
*Mark you outdone yourself!!| this video definitely has Mr Beast vibes* üòÇ
XD memw
Marky invite me to crunch labs it‚Äôs my birthday (:
schools need a field trip here
Next invention: portal gun
This is friggin amazing. You can still see light under the bookshelf. Your content and abilities are amazing
Bro made the batcave
modern day bill nye
Congratulations on your lab. Just amazing. A child‚Äôs dream!!!!! I shoulda been an engineer. Dang. But I‚Äôm bad at math!
Thats insane
wooo this is epic
"He's the Don Herbert (Mr. Wizard) of 2022. AS a kid, I wished I lived in New York state so I could be one of his science kids."
I will NEVER get into a prank war with this dude. Lol.
"Impressive job in all regards! Video, forward thinking and great for aspiring engineers!"
What a nice idea for zombie apocalypse
"This looks like a way lower budget version of ""Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory"" from MTV back in the day!"
3:20 anybody know what this song is called?
So if someone is lucky enough to find the lab do they have permission to just freely explore it? lol
Such a cool idea
"This would be cool just dump the nasa shirt on the other vids, thanks"
D e s e r v e d :)
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
So many of todays youth are going to cite YouTubers  like mark or destin as the inspiration behind their choice to pursue the careers they did. You are shaping the futures of so many of the younger generation. You are awesome mark rober.
Nice
Great video. I want more of these!
Can‚Äôt believe Mark Roger team up with nestl√©
"For the last few months I don't really know why I'm waiting for videos anymore.. sorry, but it's not worth the wait anymore.."
"The fact that I‚Äôve been watching this guy since the beginning when he made the Halloween costume, and now to this. It‚Äôs honestly amazing how far a person can grow when they have supporting people around them. Marks going places‚Ä¶"
"@ExOtic_Us3r1 I had a different account, then got a new computer and didn‚Äôt remember the password for the other account. So I made a new one. My bad for the confusion"
"@ExOtic_Us3r1 tehy could just be on a different account, ik i‚Äôve switched mine like 5 times"
"Your channel was made in 2021, ‚ÄúSince the beginning when he made the Halloween costume‚Äù üòÇ"
He already is places!
keep doing incredicle things for science and engineering! there are going to be some really happy kids here!
"your dream‚Äôs coming true, mark!! great job"
Anyone else think Mark's voice sounds different?
This is brilliant!
Gravity falls?
"Great Lab, you did some really cool things. The only problem is that the door isn't very secret since you can see light under the bookshelf. It would be a dead give away for someone to know they need to investigate the bookshelf some more."
I think the moving foam pit is an accident waiting to happen!  Imagine when Mark dives over the railing thinking he will land in the foam but he forgets that he put the pit away the night before so there is just concrete!
"It's weird, I can't understand what the piano is saying if I'm looking at it, because my mind sees a piano."
I cant get into your website

Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay.
This is a childhood dream continued as an adult if I had the money
ok but is no one gonna comment on the fact the professional frisbee player is MKBHD
"Mark, you just make me happy seeing you having passion and love for what you do, I hope I get to be happy like you one day."
awesome!
maybe i will
Can't wait to be in the dentist and see kids just ripping posters off the wall looking for a secret entrance
"Wow, to imagine that you can do that while I can only make food disappear"
"It‚Äôs awesome what you are doing for kids, It would be fun If I were 60 years younger I would participate in a heartbeat. Keep up your awesome work. 
Ron"
You missed The light underneath the secret door ü§´
"I've been there! Well, before it was finished. Fun to see it an actuality Mark!"
This like like the dude perfect headquarters but for Mark!!!
ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòçüòçüòç
He should have a room called the Rober Room
Vipü•∞ü•∞üòçüòçüòçüòçü§©
The bookshelf needs weather stripping under it to cover the daylight
GRAVITY FALLS
No its worse
WOW that‚Äôs all i should say
What an absolute legend.
Where was this stuff when I was a kid????
100000 points for the effort. Living the dream Mark!
I‚Äôve always thought of you as the new Bill Nye and this cements that opinion.
"3:23, you can here someone clicking a mouse button lmao"
I hope this helps go to NASA some day
great video keep it up
"Imagine me if I got a ticket in the box. Will mark pay for my ER bills?



*If you didn't get it I fainted*"
üî•üî•üî•
Oh my gosh if I got replied to I would be so happy
He's like the Willy Wonka of engineering!
What am I doing with my life lol
Fantasy Factory vibes with emphasis on engineering. I support this
Your website is unavailable.
You're incredible. You do wonderful things for kids and you're so fun!
"Are the little kits limited edition, or can you get them at any time?"
Don‚Äôt flush the toilet üòè
Nice box but... have you heard of kiwiko? Because (of what I know of both without owning any of them) the general idea is exactly the same with just slightly different products in them
I love how you casually flavor all ur videos with the original pvz music
He is a mix of bill nye and Willy wonka but like engineering versions of them
The person who wants a Diet Pepsiüò®
Top 3 places I want to work: 1: Marks lab
How we keep the lab super secret (can see the light coming from under the bookshelf)
I absolutely love it Mark! Do you ship to Canada?
That was... unexpected? :D :D :D
Mark rober? more like mars rover
Mark is becoming more and more of the main character in life
I don't think I'm a pig...
"please, please, please ship to India"
This announcement was the first time I've regretted not procreating in weeks.  Maybe months.
Mark Rober...YOU ARE SO AWESOME!!!
"It's hard to be jealous of a guy that just seems so genuine and wears his love of his career on his sleeve, he's clearly put his all into being as successful as he is. And the fact that he really tries to inspire kids to get into engineering and not see failure as a negative is just the cherry on top."
@Gunnar Thiessen oh i guess we found the jealous person
He doesn‚Äôt seem genuine. I‚Äôd keep my kids far away.
I heard she always have a way of linking someone investment into something new and profitable?
A news host spoke so highly ofüíï Priscilla Dearmin-Turner and her loss prevention strategies been trying to get to her ever since
"@David HudsonThank you, Going through her profile in her webpage, she smashed all her state certificate and accreditationüôè"
the best toy marketing video i've ever seen and will ever see!!!!
Holy crap this is so cool!! Literally childhood dreams crunched into one place ;)
I have a younger sister who aspires to be an engineer and I know she will LOVE crunch labs! thank you mark!
"Mark Rober is a big child.
And I love it"
Mark Rober I have a question. Can you make build box‚Äôs or people 14+ (I want this but I feel like the models on display in your video are geared towards kids under the age of ten) and if I can help I use the email linked to this account.
I bet this is going to show up on a MrBeast Reacts video
HAHA
I‚Äôm happy mark is helping these kids find their passion
"Make sure it detects the lid, not just the seat, because laziness is gender neutral. Most only care about the seat down, not the lid as well, and apparently enjoy spraying toilet water all over."
Did he call Marcus brownlee a professional frisbee player?
I love your videos but try asking one of your nephews for an idea
what a flex
this guy is scaring me he is literally giving me dr doofenshmirtz vibes and I love it
Sign me up!
Nice layout Mark!!
"nerf gun wall, secret passageways, giant foam pit... this lab is E P I C. well done!"
What's up YouTube
"Hello all powerfull sir YouTube,how was your day?"
Hi YouTube!
YouTube needs to make 50 and 100mil play buttons again
Hello YouTube
Huge Props to Mark for letting people engineer with him!
Not so secret anymore..
I wish that was available in french for my nephews! Any plan on developing that?
Legend says that this dude made the bat cave
"i loved this vid, plus i wana say thanks for filling my summers with fun, and because i binged your vids for weeks at a time, i got the highest grade in my robotics class"
Wow <3
The things I would do to go there
"From a fellow engineer, what you are doing is awesome"
Outa a Hollywood movie
6:50 HEY LISTEN
I saw a video of an emergency escape system that uses pistons to lower a person one floor at a time.
Can you please build a working rollacoaster
"You are AWESOME. Like srsly.When I grow up, I want to be an engineer just like you. Thank you Mark for inspiring me to be a engineer when I‚Äôm an adult."
Can you build a working rollercoaster with a chan lift
"If everyone in the world was like Mark, We would literally have world peace. And not only that, But we would have a bunch of cool gadgets doing things to make all our lives easier."
Under the secret entrance there‚Äôs a big gap and you can clearly see there‚Äôs something behind the book caseü§´
EVERYONE PLEASE HELP MARK SEE THIS COMMENT WE NEED TEAM BEES
"I have no kids, and I have ADULT money and the inner child in me is screaming üò≠  I've gotta do it"
MARK I KNOW YOU PROBABLY CANT SEE THIS BUT WE NEED TEAM BEES
*This be everyones dream*
Mark as a child my dream is to do the same thing
street fighter is awesome!!! i love that wharehouse!!
"Looked everywhere for that orange couch, anybody know where to get one?"
YYYYEESSERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This is what happens when the smart kid becomes the adult who gets a little money and some time to play. The rest of us just get to nerd out through these videos.  
I really wish your boxes/lab had been available 15 or so years ago for my kids. (My son was the kid who disassembled and re-engineered most of his toys so they‚Äôd ‚Äúwork better‚Äù. He‚Äôd have loved this stuff.)
:)"
"Basically, you're *Forge* from the X-Men who built his own *Danger Room.*"
What if we are in a different country?
After 2 weeks of @RyanTrahan crossing America on $0.01 ‚Ä¶. this feels like too much
This is so great! Thank you for getting kids into science!
This secret room is so dang cool!!
‚ÄúBut before we actually find out if i live‚Äù üíÄüíÄü§£ü§£
So this is basically Dexters Lab !!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
ÏûòÎ≥¥Í≥† Í∞ëÎãàÎã§ ^^
The cog board is so cute
Why am I not surprised you and MKB are friends
Sidebar did you engineer a Nerf claymore!?!???
Love you mark so much ur literally my fav guy and we love ur energy throughout the years of watching ur vids
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. ü•¥
"Since you make science, by any chance would you promote ‚ÄúNintendo Labo‚Äù just like Bill Nye?"
I won a golden ticket daddy
Think critically. Ironic.
I want to be like you
"Mark. You‚Äôre not my uncle, but you‚Äôre my favorite uncle."
"And I‚Äôm 42, and I want to be you when I grow up. And the Crunch Labs projects look amazing!!"
STAN PINES
mark rober is about to replace elon musk lol
Who cool vid
"Showing this to 20million people....okay....only realesed 2 days ago....""7,759,476 views"" :O Great job as always!"
9:39 i was fully expecting a rickroll
"Can I be you, please? I've got like $4.29 in nickels, dimes, and pennies. Maybe we can trade?"
mark buddy pal champ friend. did you make a bloody wooden claymore?
"if you actually cared, you'd install a urinal. Urinals should be commonplace; toilets aren't properly designed for standing urination."
"Mark, please consider making the instructions available online in other languages (perhaps with priority given to developing countries). I'd like to share these engineering kits with some kids in other countries to give them an opportunity to open their mind beyond the minimal education they receive. This all without being gated by having to know English."
This is very sunniest to
so you guys dont get to drink diet pepsi?

Aaaaannnndd... there's the highly anticipated mid-life crisis of Mark Rober
That‚Äôs awesome
so the ball launcher is like an ligit wepon
"Mark: I built a secret room that no one will find
Also him: *proceeds to show the whole world *"
"Only flaw: the light shows under the bookcase secret entrance, rendering it not so secret."
RIP KiwiCo
Your approach is genius but it still lacks fat.
Can I visit your lab please
"You are like Bill Nye, Rob Dyrdek and Mr. Beast wrapped up into one"
Great advertisement.  No real value here unless you wanna buy something.
"Hey Mark, I'm sure you know this, but there's light showing under the bookcase (Shown on #5 discussion).  This kinda gives away what's behind it."
"""because men are pigs"" causal sexism and self hate ü§¶"
I want to go to your warehouse
mark help me be favorite uncle
I just realized I know @Mark Rober 's Secret XD
what if you get a platinum ticket butt you live in a different country? Fore a example i live in Sweden.
"Wow this looks amazing, and really fun to explore"
when you id a close upp to the wall with the hole in the beggining there was smoke comming out of it
Mark rober is like the dr wu of this world
Do CrunchLabs sell internationally?
0:49 it looks like the lab from breaking bad
"Builds ""secret room, nobody can find""...

Then puts it online and shows everyone how to find it.

FAIL."
"KiwiCo with Mark? Kinda sad your long time sponsor is out of the picture, sure they aren't to content either. Unless this is kinda like a Collab."
"Whoever‚Äôs reading this, I Pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day!Amenüôè"

Nice video but sad how you just act like kiwiko never existed....
I‚Äôm impressed
Yo u got a whole warehouse
Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment‚ÄùüèÜ
I will definitely use crunch labs for my future children
This guy has room for my dream job
Now is no secretüëåüôÉ
mark rober: and we stole dis claw machin from dennies and then bla bla bla me: um say what now?
Bunker
kiwiko must be happy...
this is so cool
I want that many nerf guns
"""but before we see if I actually live""
I died"
4:53 MKBHD's catch was too clean.
Overall  still pretty cool nonetheless
Should have some Frank plushies. Frank is the brains.
What song is at 9:10 ?
wow this is like the fantasy factory from MTV but actually way cooler.
When I grow up I wanna be just like Mark
"I don't even have kids yet, but when I do..... lol"
"Thanks, now I've destroyed every wall in my office and I'm screwed"

It‚Äôs all fun and games until you need to clean that watermelon from every wall
Rob Dyrdek Fantasy factory vibes üòç !! But cooler !!! And that is freakin awesome!!
Can you make a tutorial on the pneumatic elevator

The world needs more Mark Robers.
"the true fantasy factory, absolutely amazing!"
This would make my late Physics teacher and my retired Geometry teacher smile. Application is always better.

There is light under the bookcase.
I bought crunch labs and I'm so excited  to get it you are my favorite YouTuber and I want to be just like you some day but I have a long journey to college
Gravity falls?????? lol ty for making this!
e
Is it available for the UK or is it USA only?
For the algorithm. ‚úä
Great place! When will you let HHS ACT visit? üòÅüëçüèº
"Hey Mark, can you give us all a general idea of where the Crunch Lab is located? Like, tell us commenters the state it‚Äôs in, please. I‚Äôm not asking for specifics (like cities or anything else more precise than just a state), just what state it‚Äôs in, so that I know if I can feasibly look for it at all. Thank you in advance!"
He is literally my idol
Hey did anyone notice there was a spaceage light plate near the fire alarm pull station at 7:44?
A Wild MKBHD appears!
Mark Rober is like a Minecraft redstone engineer but in real life
"You should invite Mr.Beast there
It would be great for your success (I know it's sounds bad but trust me u may get huge amount of subscribers)"
Hey mark I‚Äôm your best fan and I really wana get stuff that you belt but I‚Äôm in iraq and i can get anything so do you have a solution for that?
Marketing genius
This is sooo cool
Every Childs dream place:
Wow. Nice

üí°Light under the bookshelf kinda gives away the secret.  üí°
"Thanks Kiwi Crates for the past sponsorships, but I don't need you anymore, becuase I have my own (Crunch Labs)"

you are great bro
Can i get a visit in church lab if I live in mauritius ?

Everything having a nerf secondary use is making me suspicious this is Nerf Labs ü§î
Dude!  This is AWESOME!  You make me wish I was a kid again just to get the crunch boxes and hopefully a platinum ticket!!!
Please please PLEASE make a Poppy Playtime GrabPack!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love you
It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.
YES!!! The builds could be more complex and you would get to do more math and make it so it's actually more engineering and less attaching rubber bands. The builds would be different too that would be so fire.
Dexter's lab ... for real!
"EPIC WORK!! OMG im so sad im from europe, this is exactly what i would buy for my nephews.. Your are The G Marc."
You are seriously an amazing person
Do a new squirrel maze this year pleease?ü•∫
do squirl 3 or ima raid your office like area 51
"also, what is the  age range for the crunch boxes. i am 16, but verry interested in them, but it only looks like they are for young kids"
"That suitcase is made of glass, yes? And that tennis gun can blast holes through the walls, yes? And... You get unlimited practice shots, yes..?"
If you need some one to patch those holes. Gimme a shout I'm in ontario
you need a air hockey table
The lab is a dream
Was ganna buy it but holy s$&t it costs a lot
Why can't people like Mark be the president
The REAL question about the innovations of Crunch Labs is: will there be delicious chocolate and puffed rice inside?
The light coming out from under the bookcase is a dead giving away.
The hand washing alarm should be sold to fast food restaurant's to make sure staff wash hands.
Who else scanned the article code in the box for crunch lab
I want to go
"One small issue: If you use the toilet, and DON'T flush, the alarm doesn't go off"
"Mark... we love your new digs! I've been a fan of your projects and educational style for sometime now, and super happy to see your new content with my young daughters regularly. They love your channel too.  The one thing that would make my kids love you more, is if you teamed up with Physics Girl -Dianna Cowern, their personal hero. All the best!"
"You know it's ""A lot stronger"" when the impact hole is smoking 0:41"
there is a light that shines under the book case. you might want to take care of that
"""if you were to walk in off the street"" part shows light leaks out under the secret door >.< Maybe a bristle skirt would help"
"NEW YORK EMPIRE!!!! MKBHD LET""S GO"
NOW THATS IMPRESSIVE got me thinkin dexters laboratory rn
"Sooo, did Kiwi co drop you as as sponsor?!"
I wish I could be a part of this but I'm just incapable of partisapateing. But I believe I can come to make it happen myself. You will always be my motivation
I would totally get the boxes but I don‚Äôt have enough money and there‚Äôs no way my parent would cough up enough for me to get it.
NICE!!üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ

I love how Mark just casually breaks world records
"I don't trust you, and I can tell why. Your son suffers because of your actions"
Cool secret entrance.
"Hi Mark.

Congratulations to you and everyone involved in getting this done. It is forward thinking and a great achievment. 

After the recent tweet from, Xyla Foxlin, about people in the industry assuming she is the asisstant or PR,  anything other than an engineer because of her gender. I am interested how you plan to raise awareness in children about equality in engineering, via your hub, so they don't become the ignorants of the future in positions of influence.

Kind regards,

Colin Gerard
London. UK."
Nice
Gravity falls is real
"Okay, this is actually very epic!"
06:23 yes very secret with all the light under the closet. :D
Cool
6:20 why plants vs zombies music
I love the pvz music in the background
If people could have levels of creativity I would be lvl 1 and mark Rober  would be lvl 100
Wish to be like Mark and create amazing projects using Arduino.

this is mark rober
I was waiting for it to connect to the Colin Furze tunnel. üòÅ
I can see so many potential fun video ideas with this!
why does he yell constantly?
To grab attention
We all know he did this because he can
My kids got the KiwiCo Tinker Crates for years when they were younger.  We would totally have got yours if you had started earlier since they love your videos.
what is the song chopsticks is playing
"How you gonna find the nerf bullets, must be a pain"
"this is the best video ever, in terms of engaging with your audience, and marketing a product."
"This guy is national treasure, i just hope there are many kids who would rather play with these little engineering toys than on their phones."
"Hey Mark, flaw in your secret door behind the bookcase.  You can see the light shining through at 6:26.  BTW, loved the Zelda music when the secret pop door opened."
What if someone who delivers you a package watches your vids
This would for sure be my dream job
Need to fix the light leakage from under the book case :)
This is not that ‚Äúsecret‚Äù anymore.
You should make a super accurate golf club!! ‚õ≥Ô∏è

Take my money now!!!
You‚Äôre an living example on why no one should give up on their dreams no matter what
Mark really learned redstone IRL
"dear mark Rober,
I am sincerely disappointed with this video it wasn't as creative as the past videos you have created, it has really let me down since I have waited 2 whole months for the video of a a secret room behind some wood? please take this in and rethink your videos"
Maybe let him do what he wants?
"i just wanted to say that these build boxes are seriously really cool. i‚Äôm not part of the target demographic anymore, but when i was young, having an ongoing source of easy, manageable engineering projects like those would‚Äôve very probably sparked a real passion in me. the child in me got super excited hearing about it all."
It‚Äôs all ages don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm considering buying one and I‚Äôm 22 0_0
I wish we had stuff like this when we were younger üòî. But you only live once! Live it to the fullest!!
these boxes really could be used as teens who are trying to find what they want to do as well
@N A Agreed! I'd be all over adult-level build boxes
69th like
yes mr peast
Fantastic video üëç
Crunch boxes are cool but I can't help but feel like it's the same as kiwiko and the thing is that they sponsored mark many times so it's kinda weird to become their competitor but otherwise crunch labs is a great idea!
My toilet flips upside down and tosses me into your ball pit.  My mad skillz amaze even myself somedays.

I always thought I recognized one of the songs in Mark's videos. Finally realized it was from Plant's vs Zombies lol.
When I‚Äôm older I really want to make a YouTube channel about engineering like you. If I could meet you one day that would be life changing
Its cool but u can see light from under the cabnet/closet
My students and I love your videos and learn so much from them! I would love to do the Crunch boxes with them. Are there any package or classroom deals offered? My classes are usually small ‚Äî under 15 students. It would be so cool to be able to do one monthly with them!
I love your channel and i realy want to buy a box
I want fat gus
"What an amazing space.  Since you like Nerf, you need to have epic battles in there complete with scoreboard and a way to keep track of hits automatically."

For whoever see this comment the crunch lab build box‚Äôs don‚Äôt give you a chance to win the ticket if you live anywhere other than the states and only if your older than 18. It kinda feels like false advertising or at least it should have been clarified

This is so freaking cool.
Bruh my dude has a talking piano in his hangout room. he is liveing the dream

It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.
Imagine if someone walked in the office and thought the eagle looked cool so they just turned it and the bookshelf just shifts..
I want to be like you Mark. Very inspiring and entertaining

Stay awesome, and never grow up! xD"

I saw a kid at the dentist office waiting ans moving everything until he started punching a poster
"How can he be still ""on an ongoing quest to become the kids# favourite uncle""??? Since both kids shown here didn't appear to be ultra-spoiled brats, i can only theorize that in the Rober family there are so many potential candidates, each a master in their specific craft, vying for the kids' favour, constantly outdoing each other on a daily basis.

I bet elon musk Gonna hit up Mark asking for a Secret Base
I'm 39 and am kinda interested in the box lol
Kinda diggin your fantasy factory...and by fantasy factory I mean the most entertaining doomsday bunker ever
üò±
Im cant buy it and im cant come im your werehause
Wow this is the coolest workplace I have ever seen!! Are you hiring artists/designers by any chance? üòÇ
"So you basically copied KiwiCO? But also you can see a light under the shelf, so it's not exactly a secret theres no room behind there?"
can you also get these boxes in Germany
Really cool! I think my dad is in there
"Cloning Kiwi Co are we?
Typical American, can't invent.. copy.."
"I want this warehouse so bad! It's so cool! Also, I used to cut those foam pieces for foam pits.  12x12x12 pieces.  I cut like half a million of them in 1 shift once. It was crazy"
Dude literally built the closest thing so far to a Batcave.
Who else used the QR code at 9:36 to see the Disc video?
WHERE IS THE GODDAMN SQUIRREL COURSE PART 3
Space age
Nerf flex
i love you mark
si mark tahmik langg
The Crunch Labs stuff looks awesome. Next gen build crates. Fantastic job.
This is one of the most dopest work spaces ever!!! You‚Äôre definitely YouTube‚Äôs coolest uncle!
He always thinks outside the box
We gonna talk about the bright lights underneath the bookcase that clearly indicates that there's something behind it?
The world is a better place with Mark Rober in it. üòÅ
"Mark be careful Mr. Beast could sue you jeez

Jk imagine though lol"
Totally can't see the light on the floor leading to the secret lab lol
This place has Mr Beast written all over it.
"""nasa engineer"" sticks a arduino in a drawer and calls it a day."
So COOL
Does this mean Kiwiko will no longer be a sponsor as the concept is pretty similar?
Mark I wonder how your long time sponsor Kiwi Co feels about this? lol Did you get their blessing or was this a surprise to them? Just curious...lol
Mark took over Dude perfect HQ??
number six is easily sidestepped as those who don't wanna wash their hands already run the sink in order to smokescreen out the sound of running water to passers-by.
I love all the things you do and make.
i bought a couple for my siblings. thank you for your work Mark
Oh look. My next investment
"Tbh I really would love to see full Hot Wheel POV video, love Hot Wheel tracks and think it was cool to see that"
im sad because it does not send to indonesia
showing how to enter your secret entrence and your secret pasage ways you show on youtube Defeats the it By saying it is a secret.
when you want to buy something for your kids but you don't have enough money-
"You're really special Mark, not enough people in this world like you"
The secret lair of every kid's dreams turned up to 11. You have outdone yourself on this marvel!
6:27 lol we see light  :}
Can i work here.
ratio
NICE
Bruh i wish my uncale is like you
He just made me love engineering .BTW LOVE YOUR VIDS
For crunch lab you could maybe have 4 different components where the builder has to choose what works best
0:43 wow nilegreen really did him.
Are u shipping to Austria?
the irony is if this video is sponsored by kiwico
Welcome to my profile id You tube id
Lol i wish i had a money to buy an ticket for a plane and also the crunch lab so i can see u lol
Probably my opinion doesn't matter a lot cause of the millions of views but my exactment went to the floor after you start advertising your business.
Anyone else order before the video even ended?!
"Any international variant expected soon ? 
I'm French and I would love to share such cool toys with my little brother that is not fluent enough in english :/"
KiwiCo be like - am I a joke to you?
"Mark, I love your passion and dedication to spread knowledge. Would love to be a kid again just to do this. Great work!"
"I have to say Mark, you have encouraged my passion about engineering. I have a big goal set (mechanical engineer at Nasa), and your mechanisms and creativity really inspired me to use my skills to better the future world. I have graduated a year early, and I am about to start my engineering career in College (UAH), and I hope that you continue to post these awesome contraptions to further motivate me during those years.

(I could use a letter of recommendation from you in around 5 years lol)"
Great vid! Also the marketing team behind this is next level
You should try the launcher on a coconut and see the cause and effect of the damage on the coconut
Epic simply EPIC!
This is soooo great!
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING
Is it possible to produce your videos subbed or dubbed in other languages for the kits? English isn‚Äôt my native language but I would love to give these to my kid as well üòÅ
Madlad made a claymore for kids. Nice.
wow such an awesome idea! so glad that we have you lending a leading hand to todays generation
"Would you rather (in an apocalypse):
Go with Mark Rober's Workshop (100% Deadly Tennis Ball Cannon)
or
Go with The Hacksmith's Warehouse (Tons Of Heavy And Cool Weapons)"
Wait wait wait. Dont you have to leave the toilet seat up all the time???
The surviving kid will inherit the factory.
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
22M actually LOL
"Reminds me of ""Dexter Laboratory"""
make new squirrel video its been a year
What's the point of a secret room if u just post it on the Internet for the whole world to seeüíÄüíÄ
content ;-;
how much for the place?
"Hey Mark,

Is the gap of light underneath your secret pathway visible anytime?

When yes, then I think anyone who waited in there for more than 5minutes would notice that there's something strange with the cabinet"
I am 13 and I want to do this
""" "" One of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something he always respect us , the audience and his team , and his is polite in all videos We Congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come ,"

My childhood dream that I will never achieve. Congrats
despite being around 15 I would still do these to do them and get the chance to meet you and ask questions as well as do the projects along the way. Pretty soon I am visiting a university with my brother to see about mechanical engineering courses and it would be great to meet somebody as energetic and creative as you.
The lab is awesome!
The Disk launcher is based off of stuff made here 100% I bet

"Firefighters ‚Äì ‚Äì not ""firemen"" ‚Äì ‚Äì don't use their hands on the pole. They hook their elbows around it while wearing a long sleeve shirt. That is why they can get down very fast. It also helps the firefighters poles are made of brass and kept polished so there is much less resistance than some painted green pole on the playground."
"Yup in case anyone's wondering, that's MKBHD"
It just needs a robot that cleans the place or collects the nerf ammo

The bright light under the bookshelf kind of gives it away lol. I want secret tunnels in my home one day.
"I love this! I use to have science lab-in my backyard every other Sat. I had a great microscope and all the kids in the neighborhood would come and put things under the microscope, they were so psyched about how it looked. I hope I turned out a few scientists"
but what happens if someone actually wants diet pepsi?
"Should use an automatic faucet and a sensor to detect when it activates. 
This would require the user to put their hand under the tap instead of just touching the handle and walking out."
This is my childhood dream
For anyone who sees this I am sad to say that the single month box it is already sold out
"I don't even have kids, but that box is a great idea."
Mark is one of our few heroes to help shape up the next generation.
You should put a frame around the tennis ball hole
i love this guy
There's team seas and team trees but what about team skys where every dollar repairs a bit of the ozone layer
When I see US residents only üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Your the best
Woow Mark has just achieved our dreams from our childhood....
Kiwico
MKBHD lets go! haha
"It was pretty smart of Mark to make the secret entrance button diet Pepsi, because he knew that nobody would ever choose diet Pepsi."
Now I know your secret mark
I love your videos
I really want to build something like this when I grow up
This would be a nice destination for an educational field trip
Mumbo Jumbo but in real life.
I bet you could be a billionaire if you wanted to
My jaw dropped for the entirety of this video üò≤
You make the best videos
Congrats on #1 on trending
I feel like the no wash hands siren should play a rickroll
‚Ä¶not yet OSHA rated
"You're so amazing Mark, I've been watching these amazing vids since 2018"
How to defeat the bathrooms engineering. Don‚Äôt close the door all the way
LOOKS FUN
LOOKS FUN
Mark I am lost for words. You are an inspiration to so many and I want you to know how much I value your content. Thank you <3
those crunch lab kits are epic!!! thanks bro‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
Nice
"The second I saw the cannon, I thought ""hey! that's just like the one from Americ-"" then Nitro was there, and my life is now complete."
The ant farm is my favorite
NITRO!!!!!!!
my boss should try this
MKBHD cameo
Mark Rober is so cool
Wait üò® now I don't have to go to Harvard to use one if those chairs üòÖ
Wonderful video.
There was steam coming out of that hole
The light under the bookshelf: I'm about to ruin this man's whole career.
Dude built the science version of the fantasy factory
"Have you been to any of the Meow Wolf installments? If not, you must. Your lab has a definite Meow Wolf feel. It's amazing."
KiwiCo did not like this video
I wonder how he hid the outside of the warehouse so people don't know how big the building is
Mark robers fantasy factory
"Holy crap, Mark.  That crunch box system is going to make you so freaking wealthy, you are going to freak."
Mark is turning childhood dreams into reality. Like who didn‚Äôt imagine having a secret entrance to your favorite room?
@Puffin cope harder
@Jojough I just stated a fact... I do have better vids...
"@Puffin According to 'your' channel, you aren't even the content creator. I'm not sure what your goal is, but the best way to respect someone's memory isn't to use their Youtube channel to make comments on random videos claiming his were better. The channel isn't going to grow if there aren't any new videos posted, so I think it would be better to leave it alone, at least preserve what made the channel his. I'm not sure how you relate to him, seeing how you have access to the channel and account, but I'm sorry for your loss."
@Puffin I have a better ratio then you
I have better videos then mark rover...
Except you can see the light coming from underneath the bookcase.
"I don't agree with the toilet cover though. Why should men put it down? Women, If it's up put it down and use it, and men, if it's down put it up and use it!
I don't understand what's the big deal about it?"
I LOVE SECRET STUFF LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!
Mark Rober is the next Bill Nye.
I love you put the plants vs zombies roof music in the backround
4:43 Go doggy!
Did he practically buy out Rob Dyrdek‚Äôs Fantasy Factory? üòÅ
Mark is slowly becoming batman
Someone who is new to Mark Rober: Huh? how tf did he do th- Me: Shut up I'm watching Mark explain a half mile hot wheels track.
I'm gonna try to build that disc launcher thing with stuff around my house. Muahah.
I'm gonna try to build that disc launcher thing with stuff around my house. Muahah.
I have so much of a love and hate with all of these videos I love to see everything they can do but I don't think I'll ever be able to do anything with my life now.
I couldn't finish the video. Enjoy
I love the enthusiasm and easy-going nature of these videos! Definitely will be ordering the Crunch Labs kits for my daughter. There's nothing like building your own toys and having fun with them to foster the creativity and curiosity that I think is so important for kids (and adults) to grow.
Want thatüòî
:O
You should engineer spy gear for kids. I remember loving my spy gear suit case that shot rubber projectiles in the early 2000‚Äôs
I wish Mark Rober was my uncle lol
I love every time you make one of your videos there so cool and inspiring
This is a true adult fun house
No thank you for making something worth watching and to strive towards. I hope I win one day.
"Okay, because he mention team trees and team seas, what if there was a team breeze that like helped decrease air pollution. The 3 atmospheres have their team for cleaning"
"Did...  You use the Plants vs. Zombies soundtrack?

YOU DID!"
Just so cool!
Tony Stark vibes?
OMG that's so cool! This is why I love all of your videos and you now have your own warehouse like other youtubers but you're 1 of my favorite youtubers in the world because of science which I love a lot so thank you for everything and for teaching us a lot for you So I hope you have a fun experience making this video and everything so thank you very much!üòçüòòüòäüòäüòäüòäüòÅüíïüíï
Yo this is #1 on trending.
YES!!!!  He FINALLY did it!!!!
Also got any tips to make my own laboratory
AHHH ANOTHER MARK ROBER VIDEO
lol crunchyroll rip off
"You do realize that by divulging the secret it is by definition no longer a secret, correct?"
FAT GUS PLUSHY!!!
mi preganz
What if somebody moves the foam bit before the jump üò≥
"some buggy flgs on the builder container so not to miss it, i know i would miss hahaha"
Congrats on 1 st on trending
I wish it was offered in different languages. Like french.
The whole time I was watching this I wanted to tour the factory and I hope I can get lucky with the ticket
Crunch box should be in school!
"The amount of time you put into each video is incredible, and I'm all for it"
@mark rober fix that. glaring light coming from behind your secret lobby entrance for the make over.
16:10 GIVE.ME.THAT.UBER.
Wait you know mkbhd and mrwhosetheboss wth...üòÇüòÇ

Gravity Falls (2012)
I want to live there
Well what can I say ‚Äúsmart YouTube?‚Äù
"If aliens ever come to earth, I want this guy to be our species champion as he exemplifies all the qualities that make us uniqe from any other species on this planet."
Im now going to RT. a middle school for engineering.
Loved the video and ordered a box for my dad. Hope it goes well
"Me, a teenager: imma need that crunchbox"
Coolest living person on earth!! Mark Rober
You must collab with hack Smith and create some stuff
I've seen you make glitter bombs to catch porch pirates but what about some way to catch poeple that drop things in others drinks like a roofy catcher
instead of a work bench you should have it showcase a giant statue so it looks cooler and makes it more of a secret superhero room
"Hey Mark I was wonder if we could soon get something for older kids, I personally wanna be an engineer and I am 16 and it would be great if I could do some of these things but just wish for them to be a little more complex and really get me thinking"
cool
Mark copy kiwico with the crunch box
"LOL. Mark, you're silly. 

That's not a criticism."
I thought you had a meth lab in there
"You make science, learning, and engineering so darn cool, and fun for every age. What an inspiration for the generations to come, and such entertainment for the ones before."
You are wearing the catcher gear that I have
"Very cool, get these new gens creating great things...love the channel"
great
What's the relationship between KiwiCo and Crunch Labs? Seems like you copied one of your longtime sponsors...
"Honestly, people like this give me far more faith for humanity."
yo i saw this in my dreams
mark really does wonders for all of us... I'd love to be in that epic hangout!!
You can‚Äôt convince me this isn‚Äôt an upgraded Rob Dyrdek‚Äôs Fantasy Factory.
Mark Rober‚Äôs Fantasy Factory
"Mark, please don't just pretend that KiwiCo doesn't exist... explain why yours is different, why it's better, etc.  But don't just turn a cold shoulder, particularity since you've worked with them in the past."
I agree. This was very disappointing
"Mark engineer percsise says 20 million 
My brain:but you have 22 million"
So I‚Äôm guessing the boxes aren‚Äôt available for Europe?
"I love the video, but I‚Äôve always wondered what classes you took in high school and college? What did you master in college as a student and how hard did you have to work? Keep working hard, love the effort you put in the videos!"
"Also hope they'll properly look after those ant bois, not an easy creature to raise and care for."
Mark engineer and is percise
Love it
what an amazing guy
ima actually check out that like lol (i posted this when I finished the vid and the other one when I say 11:16
Heck I‚Äôm a granddad and I want to think like an engineer too. Sooo‚Ä¶
"Hackers, please set off sirens across Russia at 3 AM each morning so parents can empathize with Ukranian parents."
Willy Wonka
I‚Äôd love to have a legacy like you
"So the blue light shining under the book case isn't a dead  giveaway, lol."
"So YouTuber run kiwi co, sounds okay"
Hi
You're amazing mark üòÉ
If a museum ever lets Mark redesign their science exhibits for kids.... HOLY HERA.
What his lab is in like California and someone lives in north Caroline
Hi Mark Rober I really love watching your videos
You're gonna be the new Bill Nye the Science Guy.
What happens if you are in Canada??
Hey mark does it have portuguese translation? I want to buy it to my sis but brazil you know.
I love Mark Rober's Willy Wonka arc.
"You rule. Love seeing people use their engineering skills to think outside the box. SO rewarding to see someone taking it to not just the next level, but a whole other level!!!!!"
Kiwi co: -.-
"I can guarantee marks son loves that place sooo much, I also have a son the same age with asd and I know he would have the time of his life in a spot where there‚Äôs so many fun things to do üòä"
Number 9 would be my brother's dream.
You better offer a family value pack for up to six members Cause I have three other siblings
This reminds me of google‚Äôs workplace
The entire point of this 20 minute video was really just to advertise his new STEM box
Imagine jumping but you realize the container is not there.
You should give the cannon to Johnny Knoxville lol
"Congrats Mark, this is the coolest thing I've seen since fantasy factory."
mark is what a hairlip dog says
I feel like the moment Mark releases a video YouTube just immediately gives the video the #1 On Trending thing because it always happens anyway.
"Wish there was away to give this video, idea and program ... two thumbs up!!!!! Thanks"
"KiwiCo, but mark rober style"
"I love this concept, and I understand high production costs for a first run of something like this, but its not very accessible. $25 a month/$300 annually just isn't something that most parents I know can afford. It would be cool to see a scholarship program or something to at least acknowledge the gate keeping aspect of that when you say your goal is to share engineering and inspire kids."
"I've been watching your videos for 6 years, your videos truly inspire me. Now I'm a Civil engineer. Thank you."
Great. Now I want you to be my uncle
This is crazy
You always are #1 on trending
"wow dude. making child hood dreams come true.

plus tools. stay awesome"
Im an adult  and im definitely spending my pay check on crunch labs boxes i dont have any kids
When Mark said solving problems to overcome and become better soccer player or piano player I paused the video and said who needs to become a better piano player when you have chopsticks

Hey mark you always make my day when you post I always am so happy to even rewatch your videos and I love your content keep on doing what you‚Äôre doing. you just make it so much better I really wish to see you out there if I get the platinum ticket hope you respond. Also I also dream to be a NASA a worker and be like you after
This totally makes me wish I was a kid today seeing this.  The inspiration abounds.  Alas I saw nothing as inspiring as a Mark Rober video when I was a kid.
pl i love to be like you mark you make me me
thank you for sharing
Mark is creating all of our childhood desires every video
Mad props on the train horn!

MKBHD's entrance was equally surprising
"That Is Awesome, keep up the great work. Love the vids"
Mark this is amazing! I‚Äôm so excited for the generation under me to experience this
Light shows under bookshelf.
The next generation will be watching Mark Rober videos instead of Bill nye
My lottery indulgence is to build a network of secret doors and rooms and passageways.
"I feel like if I was in this place I'd anticipate the foam pit being somewhere where it isn't and break my neck, pretty cool place though."
"This ladies & gents, Boys & Girls is how you talk the talk, walk the walk, and achieve excellence by example. Great Job Mr Rober !!!"
cool
so ur saying the only thing thats preventing me from opening the door is closing the toilet all the way? well dam. i guess the door is getting kicked down.
3:24 what's the music called ?
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Dude your currently number 1 on trending
You should see about schools using your crunch labs to teach engineering to kids.
How does one get a job at crunch labs?
Now we just need older ages for the boxes like 16
Bruhhh I wish Mark's youtube channel existed when I was a kid and had a lot of time to make these cool stuff.
this is so cool but im broke and cant afford the box i have to save my money now i wish i win the ticket
This is beyond my imagination
"This is awesome. The next accomplishment, founding a low-cost engineering college."
I saw that watching gravity falls can't fool me
Make it less money for that box it is to much money
That is awesome bro!
"Mark ""Willy Wonka"" and the Crunch Labs Factory. One of you will win the ""golden"" platinum ticket and tour his wonkey factory, I love it!"
"theres team trees and team seas, where the *non kid friendly word insert* is team bees?!"
So you basically made your own Fantasy Factory lol.
Always top notch content... helping yah with the algorithm ...keep up the great work....
This is going to sell out and go for crazy money

This is literally everyones dream as a kid
Mark there's no point in making a secret lab and then publicizing it on YouTube all the burgalers are watching this vid.
When you forget the foam pit is moved
Cool lab
"""my brother built this and this, oh we stole this from denny's."""

And why is that?
Get the Jackass guys to go against that tennis ball cannon.
Is mark going to bring back his twin brother who he's been pretending to be back from an alternate dimension or something now
Can we just get an engineering box like this for adults? :( but congrats on the new lab and the new kid friendly boxes!
If mr magorium wonder emporium was a real thing
You didn't say why it was called the crunch labs
"mark rober, you are the only person I would trust to make a batcave."
RIP diet Pepsi enjoyers
... wow
Bro is literally giving super weapons to kids (I saw the red ball claymore trap in the video)
Wish I had a place like this ü§ß FYI you need something on the bottom of that shelf because you can clearly see there is something behind it lol.

"What an awesome video! Cant wait to sit the wife and kiddos down and watch this together later. Also Mark, i may not be a guest at the warehouse, but i have a project id love to bring to light. I want to design a system that makes motorcycles safer, wether it be from and accident, or preventing an accident."

I wish I was young enough to do this! That's super cool!
What an amazing engineer. He is my inspiration and he encouraged me to be an engineer and he is my number one favorite YouTuber
This is one of the coolest videos I‚Äôve ever seen.
The answer is give Mark money lolol how convenient for him.

U just told the world where it is and how to get in
HEEE LIVVEESS!
"Sir please I have a problem with energy but to give a brief idea,

Also how can the density of heavy object be reduced to nothing. Like how can volume be made nothing

For the toilet Barney from How I Met your Mother had the best invention where the toilet won't go down.
Has anyone checked on kiwico to see if they're ok?
only mark would make a 17 min video flexing his new warehouse
the thing that gives away the lab is the bright light under the bookshelf
I just watched an 17 min advertisement
Have your version of the fireman's pole generate some electricity to store for other projects or something. lol
"""hey kid y-you wanna twist this?'"""
My geography teacher made us watch your sand hot tub video and i was suprised No one knew who yoh were

"Feels weird to say since I don't know you personally, but I'm absolutely thrilled for you realizing your childhood dream :)"
I‚Äôm 10 and I love your videos
One of the bast  videos ever im so proud on how much work and effort he puts into these projects and bulids to entertain us and even makes it possible for us to exspirence it with us. I just wanted to give you a big Thank you.
Mark went and betrayed kiwi Co XD
This is so freaking cool. Huge respect to you for being so passionate about teaching others and getting them excited about science.
This place is giving me mystery shack vibes with the secret passage and the showcasing of stuff he has
What a great way to grow people's desire to science and engineering.
*Gravity falls*
Dope on so many levels you should get Elon out there!
You're number one on trending.
It would be cool if they had a version of this for older teens and young adults. Like imagine a course for 16 to 24 year olds.
thats just called study engineering at uni or college ahahaha
Me who is 15 hehehe i am still child
@CLove511 That‚Äôs why I went to school to design bridges
"@John Beauvais Yeah, but after 5 years of hard work, it pays off when you get to spend 80 hours a week designing toilet hinges that people all over the world will never see and pay your boss tons of money for"
That would be amazing
Great room look fun for my 7 boys.   I like the hot wheels track and the watermelon gun.
But does it ship worldwide?
I cant this is literary every childs dream how is this real
It's not a secret anymore now is it xD
"Mark, you‚Äôre such a boss"
"I think I speak for many. We need a ""How to"" on the fireman's piston!!
Such a cool design!"
mark recreates our child imaginations
I like how you try to teach kids respect bro
mark recreates our childhood dreams.
"I just love all the stuff that you do and I really apreciate your aproach to kids into engineering... Will you be shipping to M√©xico..?  the ""other company"" that has the same concept won¬¥t..."
This place looks amazing. Did you happen to publish a how to on the fireman‚Äôs piston? That would be amazing.
Is crunch labs by Mark Rober available in the UK?
After saying you wanted to work for TinkerCrate and doing the domino robot with them in a previous episode you have set up a competing company
This guy really is living out or dreams ain't he
Lets go I see 9 ender 3 v2

This is like Apature science in real life
You're the new generation of Bill Nye the science guy. Thank you.üòä

This is awesome!  Mark is a true inspiration to all of us!
"tbh regarding the fireman pole,.... you should visit a station that has them at let them show you how it's really done

you don't hold it with your hand, but your arm bend"
Mark is like a superhero who has all his trophies in his secret chambers warehouse haha
"Wow , beautiful 3D printer farm in the corner bro"
"Mark, you are such an inspiration !!"
Something tells me he won't get sponsorships from Kiwico anymore... He basically copied their entire business idea lol
Are you carbon offsetting this lab?
I think you already solidified yourself as ‚Äúthe favorite uncle‚Äù to not only your niece/nephew but most the people who stumble onto your videos.
no longer a secret
For the last 3 weeks I've been working on a woodworking shop and now I just feel discouraged because this is so much better than what I've been doing Like this is dame cool but like ya know
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
And this is where i build my nukes
He seems so happy we love that.
The toilet seat is my favorite part
R.I.P. KiwiCo ;D
"Babe wake up, mark rober posted"
I feel like he's gotten in love with money
And when everyone is super no one is
I guess it‚Äôs not so secret now
Longest commercial I've ever watched
I don‚Äôt like that you‚Äôre starting to resort to clickbate :/
this is my dream warehouse for my idea company Entrepreneur Media
"oh no, Mark Rober is teaching kids how to make claymores..."

You should grow watermelons
"This is rad. Love the new space. I'm a sucker for secret entrances. Mostly though, love that you're engaging kids in engineering."
Invite me over
i wish i work here
I want a Ner Farmory
You should have a fireman‚Äôs piston that brings people up
√àeeewaar
cool
Nice Plants VS Zombies music!
This is like if M5 was cool
I just found my inspiration:)
Pretty much Minecraft irl
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and inter sting to watch."
your voice was so loud in the start
"In number 7,I don't know how to explain this but when mark runs his hat is straight and when he falls it's backwards Soooooooooooo yeah"
my jaw droped wile watching this video
Can we all appreciate üôè how much offer he put to make this video üëç
"Mark its honestly what you've built.
But I gotta say. As an electrician, it hurts me to see didn't have decora switches put in. 
I'm mean come... on toggle switches!!! üòÑ"

I‚Äôm totally doing this when I move out
This video made me realise that Mark Rober's target demographic is children... :/
Can I get my kids that box ? I live in Sweden
Dope....
build a 3d moving dart board like stuff made here's moving basketball hoop v4
"When the word ""IMPRESSIVE"" in capital letters is not even close to be enough..."
this looks like a fantasy factory for engineers
cool :)
"I love the word ""Watermelometer"""
"Yeah, sounds more and more like a place I'd never want to go to."
Great video!
sceince is so boring but you make it cool and fun! love youre vids! (id love u to be my teacher!)
I saw Mark at SFO Airport wearing the same Hat and NASA shirt going through TSA precheck!
This is great! 12:00

"New ""fire poles"" on playgrounds are designed to destroy your hands with the cross hatching and coatings. The ones we had were steel and slick as glass just like out slides. Sure they got hot, but you were never on them long enough to notice."

"Watching Mark makes me want to be a mechanical engineer, even though I am already a chemical engineer üòÇ"
"Big W, keep up the passion"
You are awesome! Crunch Boxes sound amazing!
Mark Rober is legit trying to put KiwiCo out of business.
If you are still on the quest to be the favorite uncle then I‚Äôll never be loved
Would you ever consider making crunch labs for older people?
Why in the world would you put Pepsi buttons on a Coca-Cola box??????
Quiero ser tu sobrina
And that‚Äôs why I liiike nestle crunch
Dude you are like a Dexter from Dexter's lab.
"Could you make some kits targeted towards adults? I know its not a small feal but i would LOVE to have a monthly challenge that i could actually learn something from

Love from norway"
I wish he had the squirrel par core there as decorations
"I have to say Mark, you have encouraged my passion about engineering. I have a big goal set (mechanical engineer at Nasa), and your mechanisms and creativity really inspired me to use my skills to better the future world. I have graduated a year early, and I am about to start my engineering career in College (UAH), and I hope that you continue to post these awesome contraptions to further motivate me during those years.

(I could use a letter of recommendation from you in around 5 years lol)"
"Wish I had had your motivation when i was your age. Hopefully I can inspire my daughter to take her life in her own hands and follow her dreams, even if they are hard or scary."
GREAT COMMENTS üëç
"I support you! One advice tho, think out of the routine like box!"
"My Aunt has been an engineer for Nasa in Houston, for about 30 years now.  
You got this!!"
"Work hard and do great things. I am a physician. I was an aerospace engineering major in college before I switched over to pre-med. Was always my dream to be an astronaut. Remember, perseverance, hard work, and the ability to self-learn overcomes and outperforms natural intellect 100% of the time if you want it badly enough. Work ethic is everything. Stay strong, and don't get discouraged. Remember your goals and don't forget them when it seems like they get lost in the pre-requisite curriculum during your first two years. You won't excel in everything. That's normal, and don't let it discourage you. That's not what matters. Never give up on yourself. Goals and work ethic are what matters. If you want it badly enough, you will have it."
Hey batman think Mark has got u beat
If I win a platinum ticket do I have to pay the plane ticket to California? üòÖ
"What I wonder, is how long it will take for the squirrels to get in?"
"Pepsi & Coca Cola = tooth decay
Ha i got it."
Your bookcase door is super obvious. It has bright light coming out from under it.
"How much is it to be apart of the crunch labs? And does it reach to Canada. Cuz I'm interested into asking my mom.

And also I used you for a project for school of one person we would like to meet cuz I think you are cool!"
This was cool and all but how does the secret door work!!?? This isn‚Äôt what I signed up for!! Cool lab but I wanna know!!
The bath room one made my brain steam up
"Just like kiwico, you don't deliver t√¥ Brazil. Sad!"
What if I sit down peeing and don't watch my hands afterwards?
"I just made this SECRET lab, here is where it is and how to get in"
a mini claymore
Disappointed that the entrance wasn't a bust like the Adam West Batman ;-;
"Start of the video do be looking like breaking bad 
Jesse i build the Secret lab we are going to Cook meth"
Make a crank tv
Nitro!!!! I LOVED American Gladiators!
"You like Kiwico so much that you stole their idea, nice"
you should really play poly bridge 2
i'd spend an eth to go live in this thing for a month
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
Does anyone know what the watermelon death toll of mark robers videos is at? Id guess we're getting close to both world wars

Dude Perfect and Mark Rober are going to be in a relentless battle between who has the best warehouse soon.
Me and my dad love watching Mark Rober and seeing this filled me with such joy that I felt like a kid again and I didn‚Äôt even experience it in person! You‚Äôre an amazing person Mark keep doing what you do!
Can we all appreciate üôè how much offer he put to make this video üëç
I wish I can get one of the boxes and get the ticket but I'm probably not going to
Can you order these boxes to the UK?
ZELDA SOUND EFFECTS ü•µü•µüòçüòç

What if you live in a another country
Except... we can see glowing light under the bookshelf.  Dead giveaway!
slight issue you can see the light of the secret passage below the book shelf
Absolutely awesome!
how can I get a crunch lab thing
These videos never cease to make me feel like a kid again. Keep up the great work and content!
"This is soooo cool!
It has always been my dream to have a giant secret warehouse."
You are such a huge inspiration to both the younger and older generations! I genuinely feel inspired and motivated to push on and get my own engineering degree. I'm sure I'm not the only one! You are AMAZING!
"I wish you all the best! You're an incredible person. You're smart, creative and funny! It is so important to motivate kids to learn science. My children love your videos, we all learn and have lots of fun!"
"Soon you'll have to do an advanced box with soldering, bread boards etc....even how to make an fpv drone!! That's one of my favorite things to do!!"
"I watched half of this vid, then went and made a airborne gun, from a car air horn and a broken impact took 7 hrs to do bc it wasn't working at first"
Why couldn‚Äôt I get my mechanical engineering internship this summer with mark! It would be awesome to work with someone so insightful and brilliant.
Why not connect the ends of the Hot Wheels¬Æ track together in an endless loop?
"Hi Mark
I'm an inventor with an inventor's mind. 
You may be an INFJ, that's an inventor personality type.  
I'd love to work with you. 
Hey, beyond that I thought it would be funny to make a remote control Slinky. 
I could NEVER get a Slinky to go down stairs, maybe just 3 steps,  but in the commercial it goes down a flight of stairs. 
There's my idea for you. I'd love to personally experience that and also the success of it working could help ease the pain of millions of Slinky owners around the world who could not get their stinken slinky to go down stairs. 
Thanks for understanding.  
Keep in touch if you want me to visit for a video."
You should get all the squirrels and adopt them and put them here
Am I the only one who thinks Mark kinda behaves like Jake Peralta from Brooklyn Nine-Nine?
Congrats on #1 on trending! :)

Only mark would make the world longest hot wheel track because he is the goat and I love his vids he inspires me know I'm going to beg my parents for the crunchlabs product  mark is the smartest person In the world
How much did that cost!!!
I clearly made a career fail by not being an engineer
"Hey Mark!!!!!!, you wanna be my uncle!??, awesome project!, would love to work there every single day!!"
It's stuff like this that really makes me wish I was born in this most recent generation. Being a kid just seems so much more fun now than when I experienced it. I go to Walmart and see the toy aisle and I see all these things that I would have gone insane for as a kid.
Okay but the ant graveyard is so cute and sad/funny. üòÇ Ants are awesome

The red chairs at 3:17 are also at my church; we have the same ones!!
"Train horns on a bicycle?!

My Dad an engineer also put a train horn on his 1965 Buick Wildcat. It was LOUD!
He also designed Space Deployable Radiator Panels for the Space Station. He also had many other inventions. He had the potential to be a great Dad. But his inventions were more important to him than his family. So I grew up mostly without a Dad eventhough he was home a lot. He was always out in the garage or at his desk working on his latest invention.  Never having tome for me. He never read to me or threw a ball with me. I would have loved it if he had.

Mark, don't be that Dad."
Every Mark Rober video restores my passion to keep pursuing my studies as an engineering student.
@Loui Handwerker Nice! I‚Äôm in civil engineering
@v101Titusville Thanks so much! I sure will

"Mark is really an amazing guy. Though really still a child at heart, he managed to persevere through his challenges in life and make something that has always been his dream since young, which I find is a very impressive feat. And of course, he never fails to entertain us with his interesting projects and storytelling:)"
why this #1 lol
"This is the coolest thing EVER! OMG! I wish I were ten again but even though I'm decades older, I still want to get a box and get started with engineering.
 
Folks like Mark, his team, colleagues and kindred spirits are quite possibly our only hope to save the (very broken, inequitable) educational system in the US by inspiring creativity, passion, and fun for STEM curricula, to help develop critical thinking skills and confidence to approach tough problems, to encourage others to balance their brain by developing the interpersonal skills needed to succeed and to make the planet a better place. 

Bravo to Mark and all his supporters!"
make something that hangs ur clothes up for you PLEASEEEE i‚Äôll sell my soul

I get chills watching you present the Crunch Labs box, seeing how much pain and frustration I could have avoided when playing around with engineering myself ü§£
I'm very happy and excited to see the next generation of engineers!"

"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and inter sting to watch."
Now we need a team edge and mark rober collaboration with the foam pit

So last year I finally after achieving some huge financial goals finally started on that journey. I found you through the glitter bombs videos and ever since have been hooked. You have a heart of gold to get young people interested and evolved into this world and I wish that I had an influence like you when I was young. Keep going and keep doing what your doing!"
Very nice! Roblox videos are also cool
Yeah
Very well said!!
YOOOOOO NITRO .. he was my favorite too!!!
ONE OF THE BEST THING ABOUT DUDE IS THE HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT FOR HIMSELF WHEN HE ACHIEVE SOMETHING . HE ALWAYS RESPECT US THE AUDIENCE AND HIS TEAM AND HE IS ON THE ACHIEVEMENT . MORE TO COME

mans really built a whole stark's garage in his house
this feels like those edited episodes...
My only regret is not making kids sooner. I'd love for my kids to get into this but alas they oldest is 2
Does crunch labs ship to UK?
Anyone gonna talk about the awesome retro office he built as an entrance?
That catch by marques was insane
This my house inja let me comeee
talk about marketing
"Mark, what of you got the platinum ticket but you lived in a different country to America?(I‚Äôm assuming that it‚Äôs in America)"
"The toilet sounds like a death trap tbh, what if the magnet fails and you get locked in?"
Your just amazing mark rober ;)
I loved American Gladiators
"Sometimes it means everything to hear a hero say it's okay to fail. As someone who clicked this video feeling like a failure working on my current project, hearing Mark say its not only okay but important to fail a bunch gave me the strength to keep going.  It's time to learn fast and keep moving forward."
Tbh I‚Äôd rather make a yt video
"Hi Mark, congratulations on this new and amazing project! I'd love to gift the kids in my family with these kits, so I can claim the spot of favorite 'uncle' as well! Is there any plans to expand the shipping availability to southern countries, especially Brazil?"
Light leaking below the secret door is not what you want see for others. :) They will know there is something behind.
how do I double like this?

What an incredible idea for a product! You‚Äôre a national treasure Mark. I hope my daughter will end up enjoying these toys
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeesr!!!
Mark your the prime example of ppl who don't drop out of schools and who study's hard and gets more than one degree at college. your one of the only ppl who can help gen z thx for keeping this generation smarter than it already was :).also that's not a bat cave its a mar-kave
That was more than a hint
"He Mark, You have inspired me so much. I have always had a passion for engineering and inventing but ever since I started watching you it has been a while other level. I truly wish to meet you someday. Thanks for this insane video"
06:26 you can see the light from under it
Wake up baby mark posted a new video
This video is the embodiment of all that I love about Mark Rober.
"W! O! W! Nice place, Mark! Congrats, brother!"
Thank you bringing down the tyrant scum.
This is awesome
I can't wait to get the Crunchlabs box! My little sister has loved all her Kiwico boxes and I know that she'll love this one too!
"Mark rober never fails to entertain. 
                UuuuuuSsssssss!!!!"
This is by far the coolest thing I've seen on youtube
I'm sure Kiwico will be so excited to see such an innovative new company!
Are you going to make squirrel obstacle course 3?
If you didn't think minecraft when he showed that secret door to the warehouse then ur well just how
You can be a professional Frisbee player? Really üòÇ
coolioooo
"It is heartbreaking to watch Mark's monthly contributions and wonder how we would thrive if we as a society had more in common with him.  ""We can't all be NASA engineers"" is not what I'm referring to.  Why does the desire to drag successful people down seem almost instinctive to so many?  We don't need more people with Mark's skills nearly as much as we would benefit from simply having more with his heart, and you don't need a degree for that."
This is literally my dream.

You need another door at the other end of the secret entrance because light gets through
"He really made it like a Willy Wonka's engineer factory.  Especially when he put a silver ticket to go to the factory, exactly like in the movies."

Hoi Mark I live in the Netherlands so if I find the ticket what then; can I come to you lab?
awesome ideas dude.
When are you going to make a video about how to fix grocery cart wheels?
The boxes where like peace out I'm leaving
"When Mark Rober or MrBeast upload a video, you know it's going to be a banger!"
Mark the light is illuminating the floor from the secret passage at 6:27 lol

"He‚Äôs like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base and special gadgets"
Like a kid friendly Batman.
"Marks content only gets better with every video. His engineering skills are truly phenomenal. Great job, Mark"
Editing skills and showmanship are on point too.
"And why don‚Äôt you redesign things like a door or a bed to help us or make new helpful things like light weight, re arrangeable shelves."

really want to try these out but not sure my 5 yo is ready for that much thinking lol
Love this and while I support this 1000% I can't since both my kids are too young (6 & 2) and I literally don't have the funds to buy this for myself.
But there are lights under th3 bookshelf so you do know where the new lab is ü§î
"I would've loved these so much as a kid, I used to get these electronics kits from Hobby Lobby when I was a kid with brushless motors and switches and stuff to mess with, this would've blown my mind, I still want one lol"
Uhm you see the light from u Der the shelf so you can find it from the room haha
You can really see the light under the door
Is the guy in the fome pit from MKBHD???
THIS IS THE COOLEST THING IVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I LOVE CRUNCH LABS!!!
Gravity Falls reference lol

Amazing I wish I had this as a kid
Next thing we know he's gonna end up creating the backrooms in real life!
"If Mark Rober became a world leader I would not be stressed out... Honestly, I would be happy knowing he would make the world a better place."

so when will you release the golden tickets
I'd swear Mark Rober is Batman!!!
wait what if u moved the big foam pit and someone in the crew decides to jump in the other place and doesnt look before he jumps...
I would love to see Mark do a colab with Stuff Made Here
I like your style.
our boy using redstone.
just take a look at Elon Musk and SpaceX.....great example of failing to success with the rocket launches
The world needs more Mark Robers. This is the start of something huge. Probably much larger than anyone could imagine. Congratulations to all involved.
@Reese Collins 1000%
@unlokia what?
"yup, you can apply this brilliant method on every subject. kids don't get an education in public schools anymore, people like mark really help."
No we do not. One is far too much ego for a lifetime! ü§£

Though really still a child at heart, he managed to persevere through his challenges in life and make something that has always been his dream since young, which I find is a very impressive feat. And of course, he never fails to entertain us with his interesting projects and storytelling:)"
Wow so cool
this is the best vid u have made
@Mark Rober you should try and do a video with @colinfurze i think that you two coyld came up with the cooleat anything that could be made
Mark I love what you‚Äôre doing but you need to have your crunch lab for babies (younger kids) AND then another option for grown men such as myself
reminds me of gta 5 online
It‚Äôs so cool seeing mark build and engineer so many cool things because it‚Äôs always been kind of my dream to beginner cool things like that. You keep being you mark
Ah so that's where all of his YouTube money is going
"I love how Mark realized that if KiwiCrate is making enough to sponsor youtube videos, then there is enough market there for him to make his own build crate box :). Taking existing ideas and changing them to be exactly what you want is what it is all about!"

"So your answer to the question ""How do I foster my child's interest in engineering?"" is... ""Let me make money out of it!"" But nice lab, though."
Do you have to be American to go to crunch lab or can you wait until you can fly to america
"Awesome Mark. I've been following you for quite some time now, and I really think you make all the process a very interesting and fun adventure.

Hacksmith X Mark Rober collab when?
this is my dream
"Mark, you're amazing!! I wish there was someone like you when I was a kid, to spark my imagination and help me figure out things I dont understand.
I get chills watching you present the Crunch Labs box, seeing how much pain and frustration I could have avoided when playing around with engineering myself ü§£
I'm very happy and excited to see the next generation of engineers!"
i think i speak for us all when i say im living my life through. this was something that reminds me of everything in my childhood
What about Crunch Boxes for older teens who are interested in STEM?
I kinda wish I was 25 years younger.   Despite the fact that would mean going through Junior High again.

"Ok, so you've built the batcave. When are you going to become Batman?"
Whoa
This is the smart man's version of the Fantasy Factory.
That office gave me Dark Knight rises vibes.
Pretending KiwiCo doesn‚Äôt exist and that you invented the idea was a sad move. Especially considering they sponsored you previously. Give credit to others.
But like kiwi co has the same things
"""When you have a friend who plays ultimate frisbee...""

*Casual Marques Brownlee appearance*"
Melted Aluminum ground wasp nest/fire ant colony on that shelf of toys. Very interesting.
I keep trying to show my brothers and sister this video but they won't watch it
"And Ladies and Gents, this is how Tomorrowland becomes reality! An another reality! :)"
7.51 so from now on no sponsors from kiwi ko i guess
Imagine what my house would look like if I asked Mark to build it...
Oh my 7 yo daughter would have loved the crunch box.... sad that it cant be delivered to Pakistan.... hope you expand your target market in the next run... although i just loved to see the cool toys that you showed... truth be told... i would have enjoyed working on these toys just as much... but i guess i'll suffice with watching the videos on your other channel... u are an inspiration to my engineering genes mark...(my dad is a navy engineer)... thanks for the videos...
Hire me as your secret agent

Cool
"This feels like Charlie and the chocolate factory.
But engineering style~"
Mark is starting to transform into Mr Beast.
"Okay, here me out. U give me ur secret warehouse, and I give you 50 cents. Deal?"
"Mark, as a  ""make it work"" person, I've built, modified and designed many projects based on a need.  I still do a lot of custom work, mainly firearm related, but will teach any of my friends, family, or any person in need.  I've enjoyed working with engineers and other people to carry on the help anybody attitude my father-in-law had.
He had a full electronic, chemical, and photo labs, plus the machinery and woodworking equipment to build anything he wanted when he passed away from an accident woodworking.  I wish I would have had the space you now have as I would have moved everything into it to continue using everything to advance the ""I can do it"" education to everyone.
No, I never did an engineering degree, just hands on learning from many mentors as early as 10.    One was an engineer, one was a watch repairman, and the final owned a garage that did most car repairs.  I did my first tune up on a 1957 Chevy Belair on my 10th birthday.
Keep the education of the STEM subjects as there are many young children still interested."
I wish I had a kid so I could order them a crunch labs box!
Why does your workshop look like a Disney show laboratory?
Cool
never have i wanted to work somewhere more

"Mark: This is so secret

Also mark: Sharing the exact location to anyone who finds his house."
You‚Äôre a marketing genius.
Why does this give me huge dude perfect vibes

Cool now make a spaceship
"As a child I always wanted a secret passage after reading the three Musketeers. Wanting a castle was probably too big so I figured that was decent enough. I'm totally jelly.

Those things during my life incorporated into a warehouse would be a dream. Kinda wish we all had that chance to achieve this in any scale. 

I'm sure Mark is in heaven, especially when he can share it with his local community of YTers, his family members and friends. 

Now I'm regretting not living close to Mark's home. Awesome Inc!"

The watermilanumurer
He just revealed a ‚Äúsecret base‚Äù to over 5 million people

Mark Rober gives me hope for the future.

DID THIS GET 5 MILLION VIEWS IN LESS THAN A DAY?!
i like how graze the roof is playing in the backround  6:19

"Why does this bring back memories of when the YouTuber Unspeakable sold his house and bought the island house,"
"I am a YouTube

Can you build a flying Harry Potter broom?
You are living in every kids dream
"I'd love to see the outside with the small building attached to a large warhouse in the back that is totally not suspicious giving away the entire ""secret"" warehouse."

Mark so umm I been willing to ask this can you help our team in Vex competition? Please
There will be a day that the foam pit is not on the desired place.....

He's the Willy Wonka of engineering.
This is like how the hacksmith made an entire factory
thats really cool mark but i guess 5mil ppl know about your secret lab
How mad would you be if I (hypothetically) forded a perfect replica of the platinum ticket and tried to use it to get a tour of the new workshop?
"Just, very cool."
Cant wait to see somone use his kits to make something Crazy Mark would be so proud
kiwi co be like: bruhh
Noice!

I did want to become an engineer when I was younger but then I found out just how much math and other problem solving skills I needed. If I was young again and saw these videos I probably would‚Äôve stayed that path
this is the warehouse of virginity AND I LOVE IT!
"Giant warehouse, childhood hero, huge lounge. Definitely Entertainment 720."
So hopefully when you redesigned you took care of the light beneath the secret door....
"I was already amazed by the warehouse in the beginning and then I heard the Zelda theme‚Ä¶

ok
So uncle mark created his own Squirrel cave. nice :)
Bro jus ripped off kiwico
Sorry can‚Äôt afford it
oh the misery
"I hope this product blows up, the amount of effort and passion you put into this for such a noble cause, people asking how to be an engineer like you. Couldn't be happier for you very well deserved üëè"
this is beyond cool
great
"Mark, did you buy this from rob dyrdek"
Wish you were MY boss!!!!
Kiwico is screwed
How do I get one lol
Kiwi and co‚Ä¶
Would have been better if they were modified NERF. NERF is a little underpowered. Also better if you had a solution to pickup up all the bullets. A modified Roomba for bullet retrieval.
i thoght it was like crunch and get dowwn and wwork hard but its wway cooler than that .
Gonna Point out that there is light coming out under the bookshelf. So maybe you can change the lights in the first secret hallway to match those in the office?
No more kiwico
"I think Mark is trying to solidify his ""superhuman"" status.  Current members of the famous superhuman club: Gandhi, Mr. Rogers, Steve Irwin, Tom Hanks.  Way to go, Mark.  Way to go!"
Would have been better if the firepole was 2-way - UP AND DOWN
This just proves that Mark Rober is one of the most genuine people in the world and I believe he inspires so many people to this point to continue their childhood even if there a full grown adult. Thank you Mark Rober
Team bees
5:58 what if the toilet wasn‚Äôt flushed‚Ä¶
I was wondering can you get it in different countries.
This reminds me of a cooler version of the Fantasy Factory!
Please colab With Stuff Made Here!!!!

"I would've loved these so much as a kid, I used to get these electronics kits from Hobby Lobby when I was a kid with brushless motors and switches and stuff to mess with, this would've blown my mind, I still want one lol"
@Byron Day yeah I probably will tbh
Then why not get some? I know I will?
"Now that you have a giant warehouse, you should make a competition like masterchef, where engineers compete to make cool stuff. It would be pretty fun and interesting to watch."
Agreed
Oh yeah! üòé sooooooo coooool!
I have the same thought too
You can‚Äôt say it takes a long time. Because look at forged in fire @Unvaders
"Not limited to engineering but there was a show similar to that principle: ""Baking Impossible"", where engineers and bakers had to build things together"
Modern day much cooler bill nye
The bat cave
Just imagine if Mark and Hacksmith collabed to make something like the millenium falcon.
You and the guy from Stuff Made Here should collaborate!
"Mark, you live a well deserved, very charmed life.  Very cool!"
Why not available in 4k?
Cave Johnson in Aperture Science!
that ant farm. i neeeeed. but seriously could we get a vid on it alone at some point? like how are you hydrating it? how do you feed? and cleaning it when it inevitably gets nasty. also non-american so what species is that they look quite pretty. (and maybe also how to build our own mega ant colony)
This is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Thank you Mark.
OMG I want these boxes translated to German for my nieces!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Well and maybe I'll have the English ones for myself :D )
excuse to finally touch stranger's things
Mark should make an escape room! The Eagle idea would be really dope for something like that! :D
Anne frank belike
Putting the secret door behind Diet Pepsi is genius! Who would think to pay actual money for a Diet Pepsi?
Anyone else thinking of a Mark Rober and Hacksmith Industries collab?
"Well done, Mark!"
just need to explain why your house is 50% of the size when inside hahaha
I hope after the remodeling there won't be light visable from behind the secret lab. Like it is now beneed the bookcase.
that is amazing
Slight problem the light under the secret entrance gave away the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù part
"HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE?!

(Edit)
This is really cool by the way. It's always cool seeing these projects."
"@Amanda Mccaw Weeeeeell, not quite what I meant. See, I'm a mangaka, I just write things, and draw for myself, (and others, cuz commissions are fun), and even I don't have the kind of time to set up all of that. Must be pretty cool though, having access to those kinds of resources, and seemingly so easily too..."
"Dude, it‚Äôs his job and he literally relies on this and he doesn‚Äôt need to that much, all he does is, design, shop, have fun and edit and don,t forget eating sleeping and drinking with going toilet so yeah, not much."
Its his job bro...
"Thanks for all that you do, Mark, and I hope for continued success in your future, and the future of so many others thanks to you. üòä"
THIS is one of the next steps to our Star Trek future. Great job Mark. I'm lovin' it.
Yeah mark made a new video
I just have a question about the kits and i was wondering if they are only avalible in america as i live in england and would love to buy them.
1:01 why does it have the red tint that level run for your life has
mark‚Äôs secret labs is secretly the backrooms
Amazing
"u r an inspiration for young people everywhere!!
Also that nerf collection was soo cool!"
You need to open your own school
"Mark went competing HACKSMITH INDUSTRY and KIWICO at the same time! 

Now gimme some like if you thought the same.. ‚ò†Ô∏è"
There are engineers...and then there is Mark Rober
i feel like mark rober would make the world a better place to be honest.
5:21 Thanks Mark
"wow i wish he were my uncle, Those kids are so lucky!"
Next we are going to have team breeze üí®
"To the person reading this comment, maybe it will be a romantic love story if you write me today"
Love this!!
"There's a design flaw, you can see the blue light under the bookcase."
you can see light coming from under the bookshelf
My inner child is so jealous and Me as an adult too lol.
I‚Äôd like to see Mark Rober bust out Ray Finkle and test the limits of deformation of a football just to see how far it can be kicked before it deforestation or breaks.
Dude are mark rober and mrbeast related? LIKE THEY BOTH MADE A WAREHOUSE WILLY WONKA STYLE
The warehouse area seems similar to where you did the domino bot thing
It is really cool
It is WAY to clean to actually be productive.....
My grampa went to school for chemistry but ended up getting a Dr in microbiology. I went to school for biology but love martial arts and now compete. Weird turnaround. But I love engineering and need to go deeper in bioengineering. I should be able to look after myself for my fight and have a better understanding of the other human against me aswell as I tactical especially engineering gamelan each time I compete. üòù
k just dont flush then
"Tips for getting the Platinum ticket, check for a dart hole in the box"
Do you ship to Australia??
The only problem is that people could see the light coming trough from under the sliding bookshelf in the office.

I knew this was going to be awesome from the beginning
"Well cool thing about it, it's not secret anymore üòÅ"
"Awesome, now I need an adult version of the crunch box as well. That way my kids can build theirs and I can build mine..."
was this warehouse where you filmed the domino video???
Soooo cooool CONGRATS ON 22MILLION
Could you please make a Star Wars lightsaber please? That would be epic!
"Honestly, Mark is an amazing role model!"
imagine jumping down expecting the container but someone drove it away
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because men are pigs‚Äù - can you imagine if he said that about women? I‚Äôm over this double standard
Where can I get my own Mark Rober?
Now this is just flexing
"Can you PLEASE make the Crunch Labs boxes available as a standalone purchase?
I think some of these would be exceptional to use with my preschool kids (I work in a kindergarten), but many will most likely not be that fitting
And if there is one thing I absolutely hate, it‚Äôs subscriptions‚Ä¶."
"Holy smokes
This is insane :D"
He built his own facility from gta

now its not secret lol
Mark‚Äôs becoming a super villain and his base is ready
Im your biggest fan
Is there an age limit on participation?  It looks very fun.
MARK I thought you were gonna take the easy way out dont do that to me
You can coil the full hotweels wall and drop a magnetic ball then use that to power a light bulb or something
Mark rober in the future be like: today i have the ability to control the sun
"if you throw a dart, does that mean there will be a hole in the box?"
You should turn the office into something cool too
7:38 o lorde
Mark this is not that secret now
Crunch like the sound my back makes
That was pretty cool secret lab üòé üòä
You‚Äôre an amazing person
Hacksmith industries got some competition for better warehouse üòÇ
"The box is impressive. The warehouse is epic. The pitch, though, that is, what can I say....pitch perfect."
15:53 I can ‚Ä¶ what
"Ah yes, one of the best days out of the year when Mark Rober uploads \m/."
"Just a little question, how long does it take for the hotwheels car to do the full loop?"
"Didn't know MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) was a pro ulti player!"
I love mark bc he is a N.A.S.A engineer and now makes so many fun shts and giggles for kids.
"The light under the bookshelf is a pretty obvious give-away that there's a doorway behind it, and seems like an easy problem to fix"
How do I get the box tell me please

Brilliant
About to go mission impossible in his lab
Should totally build the worlds best escape room engineer style
I just finished watching a 17 minutes advertisement. Well done! Mark!
You got that from dying light2
"This is awesome!!! I will totally get ur monthly thing!!!! I really hope that I can get a platinum ticket because I had an idea of a wind turbine with solar panels on each  blade. So hopefully I could come and we could design that. I'll be honest u r a literal genius!!! I've always wanted to visit!!! Just wanted to say, I really love ur videos. I love how u always explain the science and the videos are always so cool and informative!!! Thank you for making such great videos!!!"
Wonder what would happen if you put Shane from Stuff Made Here and Mark Rober in the same room

I wonder how many childless adults are gonna snap up these subscriptions...? (No aspersion to childless adults but I'm not sure how you PREVENT childless adults from buying up all the stock -- but perhaps that's its own engineering problem to solve.)
I WANT TO GO TO THERE
I love marques brownlee
Plants vs zombies music lez gooooo!!!!
"if mark rober was my uncle, im pretty sure he‚Äôd be my favorite even if he did throw me in a foam pit. because he threw me in a foam pit in a giant warehouse of modern engineering mixed with gaming, adrenaline rushes, and toys."
Hi Mark
This is probably the coolest thing a youtuber has ever done super cool
I need a home like that

To be honest even though I won't be able to get the crates I will still watch the crunch labs videos just to learn about all the cool physics and stuff.
Me: see‚Äôs I‚Äôm not subbed. üòÖ I‚Äôm sorry! Subbing now I‚Äôve watched ur vids for years!
"Really really cool, i hope the lab has some more accessibility options if some of the public are able to visit eventually. Love the box concepts."
"so this is a sponsor video for his own product, which he ripped off kiwico?"
I always feel better after watching this guy.
"This guy needs to run the country. He literally makes all of the dads wish we could be as impactful as him. 

Go mark. If you need a dad who loves to ‚Äútest‚Äù stuff. I‚Äôm in. Lol"
Love your channel Mark but I love even more how passionate you are about getting kids excited about learning. Keep up the awesome work.
that is literally my dream of a mancave

Really nice! Please don't stop."

What happens if you miss the foam pit when you jump off
"I have an idea to make an anger glove.
When you're angry you can put it on and there are strings from your fingers to the back of your hand that prevent you from closing your hand into a fist and there is a way to make it harder or make it easier depending on how difficult you want it to be.
I don't have the things to build this idea, I thought you can do it or just think about it because it's something I really think can help people like me that have anger issues
I have been a big fan of yours for the longest time now and I tried to see if I have the way to create it in my home but it isn't in my ability."

This video is godly
He is fricking Tony starks in real Life
"Can you order in a different country and change it to the country's currency

And yet another reason why your one of my absolute favorite YouTubers
"Hey Mark, I am 22 and over the past couple of years you have inspired me to become an engineer (on the day I can afford to go to school.) I work in additive manufacturing and am a firm believer that if I had been exposed to the engineering world at a younger age that my life would be completely different. I love the idea of inspiring young minds and introducing them to the world that is engineering. I‚Äôd love to help out the less fortunate kids of the globe whose parents don‚Äôt have any way to expose mechanical and other types of engineering to their children. 
Thank you for your videos and exposure of the joy of engineering."

Totally a grown up and totally buying this box lol
Everybody loves secret bases

Hi does it ship to anywhere?
This is the coolest place ever I wish I had a place like this
Where do you cook the meth?
This is So cool broooo üòé
Tony Stark?
I wish I could meet Mark but I live in Australia
What species are the ants?
4M ppl r watching so its not a secret anymore
Imagine mark on Minecraft
I am an engineer..... and i just love your videos ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Mark Rober is one of those cool uncle's everyone wants to have.
Wish i could buy it :(
"I may have just signed up for the boxes ""for my nephew"" but let's be real, it's totally for me."
Imagine having Willy Wonka/Peter Griffin nonsense money
Just validates that Mark is an IRL Dexter
so cool
"Im just shocked, i love it <3"
"kinda just feels like its bragging about realestate and showing off his cool mansion and i dont like it, but i dont dare comment something negative on marks channel because hes the kind of guy to actually tack you down and do something to you over petty internet comments"
"Great Stuff all around there Mark! I love the amount of positive energy and passion you put into your projects and also deliver to us in your videos! Thank you so much for that.
  
One more thing: I was wondering...does the solenoid at 5:26 disengage automatically in case of emergency like..lets say a fire alarm?
One might be in a hurry to leave then :D"
Probably
Yeah - I was worried about the fire safety of that door lock too! Hopefully he's considered that..
"Crunch Labs. Awesome idea. I truly wish my kids will have the opportunity to visit this one day, or something similar near their home. You are an amazing human being and I'm loving showing your ideas to my kids (who are loving your videos). Thankyou for being such an amazing role model to not only my kids, but many others as well. Please let me.know how i can supprot crunch labs in any way...."
Brooo...i have an idea...what if you make a tv show on the crunch lab
What a fantastic human being!!!
I wonder what your kid self would think if he saw your lab
This is the real life dexters laboratory every kid dreams about lol
No way!
Fantasy factory vibes
Not so secret now
said this before i watched the full video (spoke too soon)
"I would loveee to make something like this but I probably have to learn more by myself. I kinda have always been liking science so much, I normally pay extra attention to science because I really think I can do something cool with the knowledge that I get from science."
Amazing like always
Me in Europe ‡≤†_‡≤†
Is that Marques Brownlee throwing the frisbee to you?
Dexter would be proud of you lol
"Honestly, only you would have the idea of making a warehouse for engineering, creating and fun lab. Really great place!"
This is the coolest invention on your channel this is great!!
People like mark change the world.
"2:48 Nerf armory, I thought he said nerf artery üòÇüòÇüòÇ (it's funny cause fartery LUL)"
Nice nice but now in like a week everyone finna hop of the server
its made for 10 year olds
Still one of the coolest humans alive üòÇüî•
Yeah no one will notice that a giant warehouse building that only shows a tiny office front space has something in the back :)
I really want a deep inside on fireman's piston
Kiwico is felling a great disturbance in their their pockets
Mark is the best kind of egg.
Willy Wonka: Bro did you just copy my idea? Doesn't matter that you changed the gold ticket to platinum and think that no one noticed! üòÇ
Absolutely and  TOTALLY awesome!
Mark your just absolutely amazing changing young kinds all over this is just ugh so awesome üëè you‚Äôve done it again mark üëè I am gonna sign up my son thankyou so much !
I'm getting Dexter's Laboratory vibes from this and I love it
Is it US dollers
You are INSPIRING.
I build a mass secret lab that nobody knows about. Proceeds to show on YouTube
"So fun. Like Elon Musk, but kind, thoughtful and fun"
Only 1 problem. I AM EUROPEAN
Two minutes in and you‚Äôve already reinvented the fireman‚Äôs pole. Why would you use anything less?
Babe wake up mark Robert posted a new video
Mark rober would be the best human trafficker
I'm not sure Mark knows how wide his age demographic is. I'm 22 and am totally buying this.
Real life Phil Dunphy
i want to be a kid again
Claim your ticket for Mark's number 1 trending!
O.o pepsi is the trigger o.O dammit im locked out XD
Rob I can see it glow under the shelf their are weals under it and it looks like a set. It‚Äôs pretty obvious on a second look
"The REALLY impressive bit is from the OUTSIDE, the whole building looks like a 9'x12' dilapidated Fotomat kiosk, complete with boarded-up windows and a ""Closed, Will Return At 3:30"" sign on the door. After all: who's going to suspect a warehouse lab when the chintzy office is already 2.5x too big for the structure that houses it?"
"I want to come but i am a little short on money lol and i also am in France so even if i were to come it would be hard, rip lovin it keep up the amazing work my guy"
"you deserve everything you have mark 
your videos are not only intertaining but bring atention to something or teach 
my mum and i love your videos and i think something like the crunch labs is a amazing idea"
Now we need a collaboration with Hacksmith Industries and Crunch Labs to make the best engineering warehouse
Why does he keep calling it willy Wonka? Anything to do with Mr beast?
Do you ship internationaly?
"That‚Äôs not a lab, it‚Äôs a Minecraft underground base"
Mark!! It doesn't want to allow shipping to NZ. Please can you change it. I'm a mom and a Science teacher and I would love to use this crate in both scenarios in my life!
"Was that Marques Brownlee, MKBHD throwing the Frisbees?"
It's like a Jimmy Jabs but more scientific
It‚Äôs a fantasy factory.
omg i got the platimum ticket!!!!!!
Please tell me crunchlab box is available in India
He‚Äôs living the dream.
SECRET TUUUUUNLLE
Zach king ? Jk
"i wish i could go to your lab, but im in australia :("
"thank you for recreating my minecraft base in real life, where can i download the map?"
"Beekman is dead, all hail Mark!"
Only thing is the bright light emitting beneath the sliding secret door haha gotta fix that
Ships outside us?
This is why Mark Rober is my favorite YouTuber.
If only Australians could winüòîüôè
I swear the robot footballer looked at his leg flying away lol! 11:25
F-N AWESOME!
I still know when he was with kiwico now he made hes own brand called crunch lab now im confuse should i buy kiwico or crunch lab or both i guess in the future
Congrats!
3:48 Mark Rober is becoming the way MrGreen makes him act in his parodies
HOW MUCH IS THIS WARHOUSE MARK? I WILL PAY U LIKE010 MILLION FOR THIS AUSOME THING DUDE!
No meth lab 3/10 jk it is very cool
"Me and the other 5 million current viewers of this video agree that this is indeed, secret af."
"4,666,895 views in 16 hours!"
New video and its amazing
Funfunfun
Bro thats the best commercial for your product ever
"this guy never misses, absolutely love each vid you postüëèü§ù"
"Dear Mark,

I. Hate. You.

But, could you also invite me over??? ü•∫üëâüëà"
Danggg its like a spy kids headquartes üòçüòçüòç
"Get Mark and Elon Musk to collaborate, what could POSSIBLY happen???"
"Rob Dyrdek called, he want¬¥s his Fantasy factory back!"
Mr whose the boss came yay I think that this is the colab he was talking about
"um KIWI Co, not cool M."
5:35
I only started watching you a few years ago but i'm now about to finish year 12 in Australia and begin an engineering course at university. How I wish I found your channel earlier!!
You are the best!
"Mark: im gonna give a tiny hint
Him also opining and showing every room in the ware house‚Äô"
"Did he just reveal a 'secret room' on YouTube... Keyword ""secret""üòÇ"
"I would love to meet you guys! 





Now I have another dream that's never gonna come true.......üòÖ"
Just handing out a kudos and  sincere thanks for taking the time to make these uploads. For younger kids ; engineering  sounds like the most boring thing in the world; its been a pleasure to watch all your uploads over the years with both my kids and nephews..
You need to make a watermelon amateur shirt
would hate to think of all the watermelon that got sprayed into the hot wheelz track
"I wanna be an aeronautical engineer... Desging and creating commercial aircrafts... The only thing is I'm so confused is... how on earth do those who actually create aircraft make them when 2 diffrent communities are fighting to explain how a airfoil generates lift... (Burnollis effect ""Equal time argument"" vs Coanda effect and Netwons 3rd law)"
ITS THE COOLEST THING EVER
isnt that just kiwi box?
it look like from movie despisable me
this is my dream house lol love ur videos ive seen every one of them
Then : *malfunctions*

lol kiwico must feel betrayed

You know all those secret passages and doorways are now not well secret‚Ä¶..  But they are still awesome.
Are you now competing with your sponsor Kiwico for the science box market?
Somebody has just taken what it is to be a YouTuber to a whole new level.
"The word ""robot"" comes from the ancient Greek word, Mark Rober."
Im 15 and i still love ur vids lmao
This is epic
what engineering have you done?
6:26 i can see light coming from under the bookcase lol.. kinda un-secret
We're in a ressesion noone has money..
boring
This is like a *dream* secret room! Great job dude!
is that mkbhd??
kiwiCo?
This is insanely cool!
"A future billionare: yes thank you all, i owe all of my fortune to my hero, Mark Rober, his crunch engineering boxes really inspired me so i'm giving him 1 billion dollars and my children"
Even if Mark is just showing his new toy for the camera it‚Äôs still very intertaining for us
can you make like level 1 box level 2 box level 3 box mode 1 is easy 2 is normal 3 is hard
"What about kiwi co. I mean I feel like they are mad. But I still LOVE your concepts and how they seem more engineer oriented and focus on concepts

Edit: Is your monthly class also becoming part of crunch labs"

marquess brownlee?
Can people outside of the states win the trip to the warehouse?

1st on trending
So you're a supervillain now? Someone owes me $20. :)
I think the coolest thing about Mark is that he's basically a big kid.
team peace next? (it ryhmes
3:24 can anyone tell me what song it is?
A manchild
So excited for this next step in your ever-growing career!
This guy living like minecraft
Make a nuclear reactor
Can this sent to China because I live in China.
Not so secret when you can see light shining from below the shelves
Teaching Divide and Conquer as Crunch and Making is a great idea
Kiwi co: i thought we are special
spared no expense...
Mr Beast but nerd lol
Only thing I don't like about this is that it isn't very secret. You can see light under the bookshelf.
Omg chopsticks yoooo i like that piano
"Ayooo!!!, what happened to the NERF bullet @4:26"
You can literally hear the mouse click 3:22
I love you Mark ‚ô•Ô∏è thank you for being an incredible human being
"After you redecorate, make sure light doesn't come through the bottom of the entrance like it does currently, underneath the bookshelf"
"As someone studying Industrial design, this lab and all its quirky features is an absolute dream! Creativity must be flowing there! Much love, Mark."
This is the fastest time you have uploaded a video after  video
"Your brain's ingenious wiring schemematic sir, is the way America's next generation of prpoer cranium growth will come to fruition... You are a great person and I am sure am glad you are a real superhero, instead of a super villain..."
Yes mark rober
Can I get one with euros??
no
I would love to buy these but I cant :( cuz prob they may not ship and also my parents wont allow me :(
rip kiwiko
I want to be  a scientist when I grow up
Ohh you willy wonka madman. I'm happy for you. Well done.
Its not super secret when you can see the light reflecting off the floor under the bookshelf..lol

thats my dream too :)

"Hi Mark, first of all I am really happy that there is someone who could make the younger generation better engineers, but on the other I am very disappointed that crunch lab‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt deliver to India. You see India‚Äôs 70 percent of your are engineers and out of those only 2-3 percent are employable. This shows how flawed our education system is. So, if you could ship those boxes to India the younger generation who will obviously have a better chance become better engineers when compared to the present gen."
What if this Crunch Labs is just a front.
Any fellow engineers that brought a box?
4.6m vievs in 2 days xD
"Yeah, ‚Äúsuper secret‚Äù light comes though the bottom and the people know, ‚Äúoh yeah, there‚Äôs something cool in there!‚Äù"
Imagine you try to rob this place and he pulls out the tennis ball cannon
Wow! Great project Mark! I am not a child or an engineer but watching this video made me want to visit your lab! Guess I will have to wait when you make a build box for a mini spirel blads wind turbine energy station.
I was literally looking for a new vid an hour before this came out
You're awesome!
So cool!
"Other people: ""We built a secret room""! Literally one tiny room.
Mark: ""I built a secret room""!
Me: More like a secret mansion."
"I really wish I had that bicycle horn when I did some touring years ago.   Now, it would be great to have while bicycling here in New York City."

you should try and build a fnaf thingy that would be so cool
This is the beginning of Mark becoming Batman
"It is heartbreaking to watch Mark's monthly contributions and wonder how we would thrive if we as a society had more in common with him.  ""We can't all be NASA engineers"" is not what I'm referring to.  Why does the desire to drag successful people down seem almost instinctive to so many?  We don't need more people with Mark's skills nearly as much as we would benefit from simply having more with his heart, and you don't need a degree for that."
"Last year it was kiwi co, now it‚Äôs crunch labs"

Is there the appropriate amount of egress pathways?
"THAT was literally a dream of mine.
Such a Court of Miracles...

I mean I even like this idea of a picture of a cow, that you can ""milk"" by pressing on the Nose. A small stream of milk will flow out of it's udder, and u can fill ur glass of milk.
This Lab, is on a similar level of unexpected marvels... I want to live there"
The frisbee player was MKBHD
Well clearly you lived if you uploaded this

Being an engineer is so awesome

I'm jealous
"First of all its fantastic! 
Although the light under the bookcase reveals your secrets ;)

My kid loves your videos and wants to be an engineer like you
Is there something that would be subtle to make for someone with dyslexia?
This is what all kids dream of when they were young...
I don't think an engineering uni student is his target demographic for this but I just want them so bad haha
You shouldn't show this to us haha
"12:01 ""Supplies are definitely limited, so make sure you limit it even more!"""
"I don‚Äôt have children but it blows my mind how affordable your new program is. Considering most youtube plans and programs sold cost hundreds and are valueless, the fact that yours is basically the cost of a premium streaming service while offering a physical product is just so awesome to see. You‚Äôre not only making this kind of things accessible for children, but also affordable for their parents. You are a truly awesome human being."

Why not delivered to India
Is it bad that I‚Äôm 32 and really want one of those boxes?
Mark strikes me as the kind if person to not pay his employees a livable wage.
I'm so jealous. I wish I had a super awesome custom warehouse!
This guy is a goat
"its cus you don't know how to properly get down a firemen pole, look at the second pic u provided the guy isn't even using his hands he has it wrapped around clothing."

How about touching the sink but not washing you hand you should have put a sensor on the soap so you have to use it so if you dont wash you will have sticky hands or if you push it and leave in on the sink people will notice.

"Mark, my engineering teacher this year remarked to me about having you drive the robotics team's robot for Hurricane. He said you had so much enthusiasm. I also know your nephew Caleb. It's so amazing to me that someone I view as next to a celebrity takes special care to include those around him. I see incredible selflessness and humble thought behind everything you do.

So Mark is the Willy Wonka of engineering? I like that.

for the didnt wash hands contraption the sensor is triggerd by the tap what if they just turn on the tap and then the alarm wont go of why dont you put a soap dispenser then put a sensor on that
I look at all those kids participating in your videos and I get so envious! It must be so inspiring for them to watch you build complicated and awesome projects. I would definitely spend all my time in that lab.

"but... now it's not secret anymore



edit: hadn't seen the whole video, I take it back"
"""money doesn't make you happy"""
The bike is like Intimidation 100

When do you become Alexander Graham Bell?
Hi
Imagine being his nephew
11:08 You making a toy claymore really shouldn't surprise me
hey a little idea could you try make something to help kids with focusing on homework haha
"That's just awesome u got to hangout with nitro. I used to watch American gladiators as well, and it was always fun to watch. Plus ur new labs looks amazing."
Can I have a box pleas
Never wanted to be a kid again more than now

Remind me of my secret minecraft base
I want that furniture
This is absolutely incredible! I'm proud to support this channel üòÇ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I will never be this smart
Breaking bad?
Phat Gus would be proud
Mark is almost non-human he's so intelligent
I await the day he makes a Nerf drone that flies on its own
Ship to ksa
Now im inspired to make a secret warehouse in the future
this is just freakin genius!!!!
We have a modern day Willy Wonka now.
"I would LOVE to come here, and it‚Äôs such a Mark Rober thing to build. Unfortunately I live in AUS so rip lol"
It would be inhuman to think that mark makes all of his inventions in his garage
"Friend: If you could be anyone who would you be?
Me: Mark Rober‚Äôs nephew‚Ä¶"
I need the claymore
"Arnt you too ""WHITE"" for CokaCola?"
"Ooooooh so cool
üòãüòãüòã"
It's amazing but I hope it follows the building laws especially for fire.
What does he do to make enough to do this???
Can we get some AI on that piano. Her commentary will be priceless .
real life batcave
Mark has never failed to surprise and impress me. I've been watching him for 3 years and it has never been boring. Such a great guy
I wish I could come but I probably can't since im in New Zealand
im so exited im going to watch the video 5 times
Mark is now giving children tennis ball claymores.
Mark you should colab and work with HackSmith!
This has HUGE nuka world DLC vibes with the door
I forgot about the tennis cannon lol
So i just watched a 20 minute advertisement.
Huh
"In a parallel universe, Mark Rober is a software engineer, not a normal one.  Somehow, he still makes code entertaining like he does with physics and learning in this universe."
mark rober living the dream
You are definitely the best uncle now
Dude this is my dream
Awesomeness!
somthing humans do..... is he a robot
did he just change his shirt at end ? üôÄ
6:47 I've seen that in half life 2 before anyone else?
respectfully i didn't ask
please make it available in india
is it just me or is it like every time i make up some super cool sounding idea and the people around me just say in your wildest dreams... mark already made it.
"mans just pulled a mr beast, hes definitly learned some stuff from him"
Can‚Äôt wait to see some videos in there
That office is so Meow Wolf.
love it. i wish i had a office like that.
Isn‚Äôt this gravity falls?
Dude made a claymore
"Crunch Labs sounds amazing, what a cool and innovative idea for someone like Mark to make! If I had a child in my family, I would definitely order."
Well no shipping to India:(
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bigger nuke in a box‚Äù
-NileGreen"
"Ah yes classic youtuber secret base/tunnel/etc.
Let me film and show you everything it no longer becomes secret.
Looks very cool though."
Friendship with KiwiCo ended.
Wow this is epic and is this based at ur house? Looks so fun
Hello
oh no
i thought it was mkbhd on the frisbeeeee
"the crunch labs is amazing and I think that this is going to help many kids, oh and by the way you should make super overengineered rc cars"
It's finally here...the perfect video!
Dude you‚Äôre awesome.
Is Nitro living there now?
wow
"Love the build box! English speaking kids have so many choices. Are there any plans to dub yourself into multiple languages? I guess Swedish will come last üò¢ but if you had it in German, Spanish, French etc I think it would be really successful ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I can never go there even though I want to
mark rober is my childhood hero
16:25 HOW DID YOU DO THAT
"I'm not in the USA so idk if it's even possible to buy the crunchlabs box, and even harder to get the plat ticket :skull:"
"7:19 He says 20 million people but video has 3,5M+ views"
YOOOOO HALF LIFE 2
you can see light coming from the bottom of the door
"My school has white board wall too, it‚Äôs called Rogers new technology high school"
i remember when the halloween costume came out.. mans built an empire
oh ok what bro that is cool
He's moved from promoting kiwico to directly competing with them üòÇ this is peak character development
I am glad someone else thought this! He even helps make some boxes for Kiwico.
Came to the comments section just to find a comment like this ü§£
"Yess, I was thinking the same thingüòÇüòÆ"
The wall of 3D printers tho
Someone in my class is doing a poster on you
I also have a childhood love for the Murphy door. This absolutely rules Mark!!
And now Mark is one step closer to becoming Dr. Brain
Love what you do Mark
wow i love it
POV: Big Al's Tattoo Parlor
When Mark hangs out with Mr Beast too much
Legend
14:46 watermelometer
This guy is living my dream.....o7
Are you a mechanical engineer or an aerospace engineer
Hey Mark how will you know we got the ticket. Do we have to do something for u to know that we got it and what if someone doesn't live where u live would we have to buy a plane ticket to go  to your  warehouse
I guess 3.7 million people know the secret entrance
Yay new video!
So we're you not sponsored by Kiwi Co. several times? You literally just copy and pasted their entire business.
"mark rober - 20 mil people have seen it ,


the views of day 1= 3 mil 




u gotta wait for the rest of the 17 mil mate"
"@Val if they havent seen it , do they really count?"
Subscribers
"""because men are pigs"" nice sexism. If men have to put it up women can put it down."
"I don't have kids, but I want that...."
This is so cool
Bro mark rober is straight up ripping kiwi co
Make a secret meth lab and cook candy blue meth like breaking bad
Isn't this just your own take on Kiwi boxes or are you working in collaboration with them?
"At this point, It's literally more impressive if Mark posts a video that doesn't go viral."
BRILLIANT!!!!
This gets my vote as the coolest thing ever.
I've always wanted a lab like they had in the dexter's laboratory show. Looks like mark did it. So so cool!!!! /\
this guy is crazy (but really cool ngl)
*Not so secret lab (not anymore üòÇ)
amazing
WHERE IS THIS?
"Bro this warehouse is deadly, can‚Äôt wait for someone to forget the foam pit"
It's lile dexter's laboratory
"mark
rob."
"Team Trees, Team seas and my buddy Mr Beastü§© I see what you did there mark lol"
Mark Robers fantasy factory!! All you need is a warehouse dog
"‚ÄúThis is part of my ongoing quest to be the favourite uncle‚Äù

WHO IS THIS GUY‚ÄôS RIVAL?"
You're so awesome and smart lol I know the kids love you the most haha
"As always, blown away! My son is only 4 but i can see these boxes in his future üõ†"
This feels like tony stark secret room for his suits
what if we live in another country?
"Mark, do you have a scholarship program for kids who don‚Äôt have the resources to buy the kits. Think patreon for direct sponsorship of kids."
This dude is amazing fr
"once sponsor, now competitor"
wow i have wait for like 1000 day yeah it have a long time
"What an excellent idea for inspiring potential young engineers, legend Mr Rober"
I saw number nine. I love nerf.
what state is that warehouse tho first before i buy the boxes
There no machines lol couldn‚Äôt get them through the secret door
He added them before the secret door.
The coolest laboratory ever ‚ö°Ô∏è
Awesome
Love the new lab. It reminded me of the lab from Big Hero 6. Such a cool lab.
You‚Äôll be the reason I‚Äôll do engineering
This is the way
Another amazing video from mark i can not buy your product but is ok and cool warehouse
Sooo you've made KiwiCo?
it‚Äôs crazy i started watching when he‚Äôd make those squirrel mazes‚Ä¶ love the videos
"Mark might just put Kiwico out of business
""Foreshadowing"""
I'm a kid and I love it
Question: How can you be sure that you'll be safe with the fireman's piston? How do you know that the piston will always work and that users will hold on the rope correctly?
neat
Kiwico be like üëÄü§îüßê
Ordered!
"This reminds me of that one family guy episode, but now an Reality"
He really is the Willy Wonka of engineering...
The only thing you're missing is Jean-Ralphio.
We love ultimate frisbee!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So it‚Äôs the nerdy version of fantasy factory??
9:50 ...teaching how to use an inquisitor lightsaber
Damm I have to wait for more 6-8 years as my baby is 2 only.
06:24 well the light under the shelf pretty much gives it away
"If you post your secret lab on YouTube, how is that lab secret then??"
Will you fly me out from Australia if I was to win ?
He inspires more people than Elon Musk
always wanted my own room where i could do these stuff.
Real talk though. The fireman's piston might be a great thing for firefighters!
From cool science guy to sold-out infomercial guy took about 10 yrsü§î
Okay on my way!!!!
Congrats! It's a great idea!
"I Mark! I have a question, would you ever think about making adult (18+) boxes like these? I don't want to take away from the kids, but they look so fun! Just a suggestion of course üòçü§© Thank you for making these for the kids, what a wonderful idea!"
14:48 hmm that kinda reminds me of someone in a car ü§î
I also want to be a engenir
mark I could see the lights under the secret door at 6:26
Is Mark Rober ripping off Kiwico?
This is really one of the coolest things I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm not even halfway through the video yet.
Signed up ;)
Amazing!!
POV Kiwi Co. couldn‚Äôt sponsor video mark: When something doesn‚Äôt exist you make it that‚Äôs the beauty of being an engineer
100% Buying the crunchlabs box for myself seems really interesting
Simply amazing
did mark like buy kiwico or something lol
wow
This is amazing
Wow! Presentation was flawless!
Oh....its just a really long commercial
I am jealous.
"This video makes me smile. It makes me feel like a kid again too. I could imagine having so much fun there.

It's also really fantastic that you do so much to get kids interested in engineering and all the possibilities it offers."
Damm his feels like a inner child's dream come true
Follow the science.
such an inspirational person
"That is one AMAZING LAB!! I‚Äôm all signed up! Can‚Äôt wait to start getting my monthly boxes!!
You are so creative and talented! My family loves watching your videos! Can‚Äôt wait to do these boxes together!"
Too bad for me I'm from Maldives soo maybe world wide shipping?
hhahH
Low-key looks like Zach kings office
Full of motivation and inspiration
"0:42 But before we see if I actually live, this video is sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends"
"""I've Got a Huge Meth Lab Under This Dry Cleaning Service"""
"Bummer for me, wanting to be an engineer.. asked my mom for a crunch box .. she said we dont have a money tree‚Ä¶ : ( that‚Äôs unfortunate.."
"""""One of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something he always respect us , the audience and his  team, and his is polite in all videos We Congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to come,,üôèüôè"
cool!
Dude the crunch lads looks super cool only thing is I still cant play with Legos without having to take it apart and put it bake together at least once
I want the toilet stuf wherever I go pls! This would make the whole world much better!
I love it!  I bought three subscriptions.  My kids are really excited.
Isn‚Äôt crunch labs just like the kiwi box?
Not really a secret door if u can see the big warehouse from the outside of the house lol
GRAZE THE ROOF POG!!!!!!!!!!
0-0 Wow
I wish I have money lolüòÇüòÇüòÇ
i am 16. i want one of those build boxes.
This guy is exactly what I thought being an adult was when I was five. Glad to see him living the dream ü•≤
Me tooüòÄ
@MonkeyJedi99 i‚Äôve never seen such an amazing quote in a youtube comment sections
"Oh, to finally grow up enough to have the childhood you always wanted!"
Same here
"mark: lemme give you guys a hint 
*literally shows us how to get inside*"
hey mark rober im in a difrent contory cald georgia and y whant crunch labs mishns  and how can y get the mshins
are you plannin to do international shipping? i love your channel but not in usa.
Almost as cool as Colin Furze's bunker.
Is there projects that are 16 and up?
"where were you 40 years ago when I would have loved this... .. oh yeah, you were 2.. that place looks like a ton of fun."
"Hey Mark,  would you buy a ticket for me to fly to California if I win the platinum ticket?"
"Holy crap, almost 7 min of wasted time fluff in this vid..."
Its like a movie
mark rober is a child in a super mans body
I just wish mark rober to be my uncle
Incredible as always.
"Sorry, I just can't get past your friendship with the Kimmel abomination."
"Get me a Job dud, I'm desperate"
You basically copied Kiwico which has been doing this for yrs now.
"Platinum tickets üòÜ was gold copywriten? 
Great video! great lab! Your gunna make a ton of kids day.. I have no idea how to say that better
Hopefully we get to see you take down more scammers in the near future."
I suppose the light that emits from under the bookshelf doesn‚Äôt give the hideout away
"Awesome. I live in the United Arab Emirates. Will you be shipping over here too? My kids would love this.  Ps I think that the light is leaking out under your book case door, could be a give away. Lol"
Where is the nuclear reactor and your roomate Nile red
Can you make me one
This is a bit like the neverland ranch
The whole video its an advertisement
who else but Mark Rober?
"Definitely gonna try the crunch labs, I wanna be an engineer when I grow up"
TAKE MY MONEY!
Lol there's light coming from under that book shelf in the office....
This is 10million times cooler than Mr Beast‚Äôs chocolate factory
I'm like 85% sure this guy has molested a kid.
We now all know what you don‚Äôt need to be secret well I just got it so never mind
6:48 *Gravity Falls Theme Plays*
This is honestly my dream...a secret room? Come on!
So basically... it's Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory
"Vsauce, mark here"
Engineer the force. I have spoken.
Can‚Äôt wait for him to legally acquire NileGreen for the lab
Wow
"So, the squirrels were just proof of concept?  You go Mr. Rober!"
Only Rober could make such an awesome 17 min commercial. P.S. those boxes are amazing and when my kids get older they will be getting them
"That's it, I found an architect/engineer for my future home"
engineers solve problems
Disposable money must be a nice problem to have
"Mark rober has made my childhood dream come true. As a kid I would only play with hotwheels, and now he‚Äôs made the longest hotwheels track"
Of course a diet Pepsi button would be the perfect thing to open a secret door üòÇ
thank you for doing this mark
Ohh yes you uploaded again I thought you were too busy and will almost never upload but now I understand you were building this thing cuz you inspired me alot
"I remember when Vsauce started making curiosity boxes, before they stopped making content."
Early
"mark rober be like

today i am atemting to make a thermal nuke"
I think he used this in one of his live streams
"Yep, that's the place I wish I could work in"
"his personality comes off as phony and exaggerated, like Jimmy Fallon"
Hey mark do you think you are able to make a car that runs from water.
What happens when you have to clean the toilet
yay new video
yo yes
15:00  mark as a weapon maker for war
You sir are a wonderfully mad genius and a delight to watch
8 billion people on Earth & countless others who‚Äôve lived on this planet & yet I‚Äôm still confident saying that Mark R. would be the funnest/coolest person to be friends with!
The inside of that building reminds me of Rob Dyrdek‚Äôs Fantasy Factory
uff...
This guy is amazing he is definitely smarter than Elon Musk
Awesome ü§©
"I would love to buy them but sadly not available in my country, no Latinoamerican country is on the list"
Mark Rober and Dude Perfect are winning YouTube üëëüèÜ
Every kids DREAM
Awesome! Just like in a movie!
Not really a secret when everyone knows...
Where in the bay area is this ware house?
why are you using a green screen ??? :O
I am 34 and would still order the monthly Crunchlabs Build Boxes. I grew up with KNex and Legos. My mind loves to learn how things work and fit together. XD
Glad you didn‚Äôt choose Crunch Brain Fitness as lawyers for those meat heads would be knocking.

Doesn't the Hot Wheels track count for that???
"This guy is amazing.  He makes every adult want to be a kid again.  I can‚Äôt even imagine how cool a whole educational amusement park he could build. Like literally, like an Epcot sized park.  Disney‚Äôs gotta go! Too woke.  Mark is awesome"
Anyone else notice how he‚Äôs basically going into competition with Kiwico?

BREAKING NEWS - Kiwi Co is dead officially.
hi.
Gravity falls vibes
Love the FPV footage
Bro just built his own fantasy factory
Pov: You‚Äôre jealous
I already know where the to open the door
"Hi I‚Äôm Howard, recently my mom have been scammed for 13000 I hope you could help my mom, I‚Äôm also a huge fan."
I need help my mon
bro that's such a cool place and I'm almost 28
Kiwi co be crying
"It's nice to see this kinda stuff when you begin to think the world isn't so great. One of those ""faith in humanity restored""  moments."
that is a kid living in a man's body and i'm all for it
Rip me being 17 and unable to enter
you got a family member like a little sibling that could?
"Yeah, if I had the childlike wonder and energy, with the biggest brains and skills, like Mark does.. I'd have built American Gladiators in my gigantic office as well. Alas."
"Hey Mr.Rober. Is this only for kids? If not I""m a fan, and would like to participate."
KiwiCo?
"_Me watching the video halfway around the Earth_ : Well, this is nice.....for Americans; but hey, I can probably watch the winners take the tour here on YouTube which is still nice."
14:52 welcome to demolition ranch
Bro bouta turn into a super villain
Dude mark rober is so COOLüî•üî•üî•
wow!
I can only offer a virtual handshake in respect. How fantastic to take the success of a Youtube channel to spread the spark of imagination and learning to so many others. I have no doubt Mark cannot do this all on his own so also huge respect to all his unsung family and helpers and enablers that have helped him achieve this!
Try collabing with stuff made here. It'll be a banger for sure
Great !! Just Enjoy Your Videos Mark !!
Watch mark forget he moved the foam pit
L kiwi co
This guy has made a literal bat cave
Bro I love Mark Robert and all but I swear he‚Äôs a kid in an adult body that‚Äôs a genius
I hate having grown up
Isn‚Äôt this like Kiwi Co?
Woaaaaahahnjjjjj

Cirst he saved the trees then the seas now hes fostering your children
Great job! So awesome!
I'm a kid. And really wish to visit crunch labs. Although. The rest of my family doesn't know you. And not being able to go is sorta sad.
Mark is living my dream!! :D
"11:26 ""It's bot only okay, but it's also important to fail a bunch in order to hit that big break through.""

It would be cool if you could do something for older kids/teens
"What an amazing project, thank you Mark."
"Hello mark, you are the only reason I am still going through university thank you for giving me hope"
This is awsome
"I love this!! I‚Äôve wanted to try doing stuff like this for a while now, and crunch labs is the perfect opportunity!"
Does anyone feels the same vibe from Gravity Falls?
Lol
"So we have to lift the seat up and put the seat down.
That sounds fair."
It was always my dream as a kid to have an awesome factory to toy around and do stuff like this... and then I grew up...... And my dream became to make it all tax exempt...I think you have done both.. Congrats.
I want to be an engineer just like you
Nilegreen!?
this is the sickest thing I've ever seen my entire life
"In your re-design you should use a mirror as a secret door so you can literally go ""through the looking glass"""

"I think I'd notice the glowing light coming from under the bookcase, lol"
"I love the idea, sure there is a HUMONGUS garage door on the other side that may sell it as the ""secret lab"" =), but I do love the idea, it is clearly made to make childs dream. I can only imagine how extatic they can react entering from the secret door with the platinum ticket!!!"
"I feel really bad for his nieces' and nephews' other uncle... he has no chance against Mark

All jokes aside though, super cool as always, this is crazy awesome!"
"If I were him, I'd totally make myself a t-shirt that said ""Timmy's _Other_ Uncle"""

"This. Is a cool Video.

Nice Job!

Love it"
meanwhile........ checking to see if i have enough money to pay for gas this week......
"Mark, my engineering teacher this year remarked to me about having you drive the robotics team's robot for Hurricane. He said you had so much enthusiasm. I also know your nephew Caleb. It's so amazing to me that someone I view as next to a celebrity takes special care to include those around him. I see incredible selflessness and humble thought behind everything you do. Thank you for being my role model and inspiring me in many ways, morally and physically. I hope to someday meet you myself, maybe at Caleb's mission farewell!"
Long rime no see
"I'll buy it for a dollar!
Aight! Deal!"
I'm an engineer and love teaching kids.  I'm so jealous. I'm praying for your success.
"you never disappoint, mark!"
RIP KiwiCo! ü§£
6:50 again love the PvZ music
I can't wait to buy this for my niece
That‚Äôs so cool
Just imagine you get your dream engineering job working for mark robber and one day while working you just hear the faint sound of an electric nerf gun power up.
The light from under the sliding bookshelf gives it away :D
How are you still not the greatest uncle? Dude you're literally Grunkle Stan from Gravity Falls at this point

"Dude, stop yelling all the time..."

I can see the secret passage way below the bookshelf
Is this still a secret i mean million of people knew it now lmaoüòÜ
"Mark it really makes me smile when you talk about inspiring the next generation of engineers, mainly because I for one, AM a member of the next generation of engineers. currently making my way through high school hoping to specialize in mechanical engineering and get a masters degree from college!"
Mark loved your comment
You can do it!
Omg.. How I wish I was 20 years younger
It's like the real life Dexter's laboratory I love it
I‚Äôm early- ish. üòÖ

That is every kids dream
my literal childhood dream
When the delivery Guy has Seen this video
I am 35 and I love your videos üòÇ
This is such a wonderful idea. I would've loved to have something like this when I was younger.
Super emasculated
I would love to see an escape room built by mark himself without the tips and tricks it would be epic !!!
I hope my mom lets me buy some of your cool packages
"""these hoes ain't loyal"" - KiwiCo, probably"

I am fully convinced that Mark is engineer Mr. Beast
How can I be more like you because you are super successful and I‚Äôm just a kid
RIP Kiwi co
so freaking cool!
Hay mark what if someone like me in Australia and we get a ticket????
Here‚Äôs where James Bond gets all his gadgets!

"Mark its about time we get you your own tv show. Air it prime time once a week, guarantee to be the best thing on tv. Why cause it‚Äôs science, it‚Äôs engineering, it‚Äôs creatively and last but not least it‚Äôs Mark Rober."
Mark what if I‚Äôm not 8 or 12 but instead I‚Äôm 19 and still want to grow up to be an engineer like you
"From telling subscribers to buy kiwico crates to owning a company which builds one uniquely, that journey's amazing. Keep it up Mark‚ù£Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è"

Holy cow. I wish this was a thing when I was 8 or 12!!! Now I‚Äôm 29 but uh‚Ä¶ I might get it just because hahaha I wish I could do something like this for medicine. I‚Äôd love to one day get the newer generations excited about medicine!

"When I was a kid, used to build balsa wood airplanes powered by a rubber band. The batteries would never wear out, but sometimes the rubber band would break. Oh and those plastic rockets that you fill half way with water, and pump up with air, those were fun.

That's where I learned about some engineering stuff."
Literally the next Bill Nye
I think he‚Äôs already better than them I
If we have to fly out there do we have to pay for it because If I won my family probably won‚Äôt have the money to fly out
"I have this dream too , To have my own Dexter's Lab"
Mark are you still on that battery-on-wheels traveling to Colorado
Failing it isn‚Äôt a bad thing it‚Äôs just learning something new that doesn‚Äôt work but it might work with other things
Dang does this mean no more Kiwico sponsorship.

It's like the fantasy factory for awesomeness

I have always wanted a secret place like that except I would fill it with million dollar cars and have a lounge and bed so I could live in complete seclusion plus an epic gaming room. Mark must spend all his time in there.

Keep up the great content!"
Hey mark i love your videos I was wondering I you would let me be in a video
Sale Sale SALE! well if I was in your shoes I would have done the same thing by now
You are my favorite YouTuber and I admire you!! I would like to know what kind of engineering branch or what career I would have to go into to know how to do stuff like you. I am 15 and I really want to learn but I don‚Äôt know how to start.

When you are a kid in an engineers bodyüôäüôä
So Mark Rober built his own batcave
Mark I bet that you cant learn nodes/blueprint (computer codeing)
"10,481st"
This is what science should be like in school. And this is the kind of stuff engineering colleges should teach.
You have too much money.
i wish this is available in the Philippines
How in the world did you get a camera on a hot wheels?
It would be my dream and it‚Äôs ok if you can‚Äôt
Can this be delivered to COLORADO SPRINGS
Yooo
Hold up.........stole from Denny's
"You and Mrbeast are mine and my kids favorite 
Thank you"
Squirrel maze???
Sadly you probably don‚Äôt live in Kansas so I don‚Äôt think I can find you
The only problem with trying to find that secret base at my local orthodontist is I'm in australia üò≠üò≠üò≠
I can't wait until Mark finds someone taking a bit out of the foam bit. Cause you know someone will take a bit... There's always gonna be someone.
I need street fighter II in my home just like that
All you see literally blue light escaping underneath the bookcase XD
just checked out the website Ill probably do the save 60 plan and buy it. I have been building things my whole life!
Reminds me of Gustavo Fring
wow  so when do the tours start...
I would like the crunch box but I'm more into model kits but I might  get one
I‚Äôm almost twice your age Mark but you ARE my favorite uncle :D
So its just kiwico but with a video tutorial by mark?
"If you have a problem sliding down a fireman‚Äôs pole, you‚Äôve bigger problems!"
Mark Rober you are just cool
Ima ask my mom to buy some.   Teehee
MARKYYY
Is it possible to get this Internationally? I would love to unbox one for my audience :)
"It's says for me, that it'll ship, but it will cost more than $100, also the taxes of my country another more than 100$, so basicly I doubled the cost by living in my country. :( 
I hate this... but it's sooo coooo, I wish I were live there."
@Pokecraft I would like a mark Rober but the special dog version
@Pokecraft I would like 2 mark robers dog special addition
"Just tried to buy one but then i saw that it doesn't ship to nz  : ((((
would love to see something for us kiwis :/
don't know about other places tho"
Agreed Max
Imagine being a casual thief breaking into this place then pulling the eagle.
"Congratulations Mark! This is outstanding, I wish you the best of luck with this endeavor."
Rancho Neverland vibes
Mark just casually uploading everyone's wildest childhood dream on a Wednesday. Okay. ü•¥
Let's say I was a delivery guy. Am I supposed to ignore the light under the bookshelf
Every single kid's wildest dreams at one place! This is so cool.
"I'd love to come out and make some funky projects (I have several in mind), but I also realized that that warehouse was not meant for me. It's made for the kids. To inspire young engineers. I'm a grown adult, and as much as I'd love to meet Mark and do some wacky stuff, if I really want to make these projects of mine a reality then I'll just do it. I've got the resources that those kids don't. In light of that, I ceed my chances at a platinum ticket to the younger generation. May what you create be awesome and fun!"
ive been playing plants vs zombies lately and 2 of the youtubers ive watched since then have used pvz music
Mark i love your video i want to be like you
Omg science is so cool!
Mr Beast might as well buy that place for a video.
i was thinking that to
bro mark is making me want to be an engineer so badly..
Only mark rober would just make kiwico but better
At this point just open a school
"Mark, I think and hope that one day you can start a FIRST robotics team. Especially with this warehouse"
Love it
Bro is Anne frank üíÄ
this is just mark flexing all of his youtube fame and wealth to all of his viewers.
nice
Checking the bookshelf is the obvious choice!!
My brother helped me with the programming part.
bro the pvz music still hits diff ngl
Mark Rober is my hero
wow that is heaven for a nerdy guy like me
"Current: Ammeter
Voltage: Voltmeter
Pressure: Barometer
Mark Rober: Watermelometer"
yessir
"If I was there for a day, I‚Äôd be at the piano the whole day"
WOW!
You keeping all my paintings in there?
every man‚Äôs dream
TO THE ROBER CAVE!
Chopsticks and phat gus are the most iconic characters ever
Aren‚Äôt the boxes kinda ripping of Kiwico which was one of his sponsors?
This feels way quicker that came out
Liked the video because of the PvZ music
"Someone could just take a dump, not flush it and still walk away with his hands dirty üßê"
Mark I made a project on engineering
Erm...... Kiwico?
Real Civil Engineer would be proud!
DEEDEE GIT OUT OF MY LABORE`A~TORY!!!!!
Crunch Labs is one of the coolest things I have ever seen.

Do you sell your crunch lab build box thing in denmark?!? I would love to have one But if you dont sell it here please say it

Classic mark :)
But before we see if I could actually live let's just see the place hehe
This is so amazing! I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how this video is!
This is epic you never disappoint
Would it be possible to deliver it to india?ü§£
This is better the Willy Wonka‚Äôs chocolate factory!!!
There are so many hints to other videos
This is so cool.
Bro made entertainment 720 irl
"As a 27 year old...I kinda want a box.... BUT I wouldn't want a chance for the platinum ticket, I'd honestly rather children only get the chance."
I love how there are YouTube's 2 biggest tech reviewers casually signing something in this video like they're best pals with Mark.
Yo mark your prob not gonna read this but you should try to make a mechanism that allows you to jump higher and no I don't mean you'll go like 15 feet but just a Lil bit higher I've always wanted to see this be made and omg your warehouse looks great
Ultimate zombie apocalypse safe room
"KiwiCo: Hey Mark, you wanna do  another sponsor? Oh. I see how it is Mark, I see how it is."
Mark Rober‚Äôs fantasy factory on mtv season 1 coming soon
Can you make it available in India pls?
"So I have to ask, at 16:49 is that in fact Manu Prakash, the foldscope guy?"
Yes
Pog
"Hey Mark Rober, I'm 31 and I want to be like you, where do I start? XD"
I'm 45 and I want to be an engineer like you when I grow up! ü§£
I thought kiwico sponsors you.
no mark let the sweatshop kids out
so awesome
I did not now that you now about Beyblade
What is the song they play at 3:24 ?
do you have delivery to mexico ?
This is the best MTV cribs episode
"""10,000 dollars in a glass suitcase""
Shows a suitcase with 500,000 in it"
Mark is the official Mr. Rogers of science. He should have a nationally syndicated show
"I wish I was like 12 and not in my mid 20s, I'd buy the box instantly"
Oh this is just awesome
"if i had this, my life would be complete"

Sounds to me like I just don‚Äôt have to flush and I‚Äôll be fine
Kiwico will be mad!
Fantasy factory 2.0??? Atleast what I thought when I saw the foam pit
Only mark whod do This like he is crazy
0:09 well now i know how to break in

This guy would make a great school teacher. üòÑ
"Mark, after Cristiano Ronaldo, you are the coolest guy ever!"
Any reward for finding the lab?  I would love to check it out.
Mark Rober makes me happy to be an Engineer. The best version of what I hoped to be.  Thank you!
POV: scooby doo
I am doing Mark's engineering course and I may have to end up buying this too. Lol
He has the lab from odd squad
this box will change humanity
Mrbeast!?!?
:0
hey mark can i suggest u a new project Make a well functioning tree house which can do every a kid may need.
You mean Dexter‚Äôs Secret Lab
"Truly awesome. Honestly, just a wholesome and inspiring cause. Thank you for what you do."
This is a certified Mark special
this the coolest place to ever be made
My two favorite YouTubers in the same video üéâ

Was the frisbee guy mkbhd
you're incredible
Rip off!
of who?
Mark I just want to say I love your videos and I want to be just like you one day
Mark is a top 3 YouTuber for sure
Epic
WOW
Must be nice to have money.
If I had this guys videos as a kid I would have become a scientist. He makes science interesting
It‚Äôs all fun and games until someone rolls the foam pit away while you‚Äôre not looking.
That toilet alarm for not washing your hands is the best part
im only in australia so yeah
"After you redecorate, can I have your Selectric?"
I love chopsticks
just...wow
AWESOME VIDEO!! Like always! I want to work at NASA when I‚Äôm older thanks to you Mark! What degrees do you need to build rovers like you did(at NASA)?
"this is no secret to me cuz I knew it from the domino video that where is this place why mark have this I my theory is true
so tuned in for the next episode of Mark Rober Theory , but util then see ya later."
"Imagine you combine Mark Rover, Hacksmith, and Mr Beast and there you have it, real life tony stark"
bummer
Tony Stark is based off of Elon Musk.   They've confirmed it.   So Elon Musk is already the real life Tony Stark.
he's actually willy wonka... but with like ingenuity and science instead ethically questionable employment of ethnic minorities and child endangerment
OMG this looks like the most fun office ever!

Literally hundreds of people are...
You should collab with the Hacksmith sometime

This things crazy!!!!!
"So basically, this is the most elaborate way to get kids to buy your crate.
I like it."
Bro made the gta arcade
Can't wait to watch this again in a year and find out that i actually commented
"Ok cool, but what about the actual engineering part of the lab, you didnt talk about that at all"
@Alexei Utgoff i only saw a few tools and what looked to be a 3D printer in one scene
The entire thing is the engineering part...
Made a secret passage with light pouring under the secret door.
"I'm expecting to see a new science channel show called ""Crunch Labs!"""
Mark is def the modern day engineer version of willy wonka.  And kinda the home alone kid too if you think about it. : )
Ayo what is so cooooooooooooooool also this looks dude perfect‚Äôs studio
please can u make more educational videos?
this is nuts!!
"Mark, if you're thinking of any possible upgrade to this, a mini roller coaster would be awesome. üòÅüé¢"

Great job Mark. As an engineer in an executive roll we are definitely seeing a need to stoke the young minds and future  of this world. Thanks for making a difference.
"mark rober: ""secret room""

also mark rober: has a massive building behind his ""dusty office"" room thats definitely not a secret engineering warehouse or anything."
We need an unnecessary inventions and mark rober colab
"I love your content so much! Making a dream come true is so fun and cool, especially a secret lab!"
Is crunch labs just a copying of kiwi co
You think Kiwi co was the first?  V Sauce did it a decade ago lmao
That's dope!
"0:05 Let me guess, the hint is that you don't have to dramatically turn the eagle ornament in order to push your bookshelf sideways"
Massive Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory vibes
You should make a system that automatically makes you coffee or something whenever you wake up (in the warehouse) or enter the secret warehouse :)
"the coolest thing of being an scientist, or an engineer. Is just having a whole warehouse, cuz I mean like the whole idea is literally cool"
Congratulations on the warehouse build dream becoming a reality!
W A T E R M E L O M E T E R
Awesome
This defeated the purposeüòÖ
This is too epic!
"3 million views in less than a day...

Yes. This was the dream of A LOT of us!  Congrats Mark and so glad to see the finished product!"
This place is 90% play and 10% engineering work
did you just call us pigs???????
E
Its not a secret if you show it on youtube -Sun tzu the art of war
"Wow. If I don't buy this for myself, I am buying it for my friends kid. This is so thoughtful."
Is that the same place you used for the domino video
"This would be a dream, looks awesome mark"
Mark Rober continues to make my own dreams come true.
"I dream of working for mark, this looks dope"
"I have an autistic son that will LOVE this Crunchlabs monthly build! Unfortunately we live in Bali, Indonesia.... Maybe one day"

Watch out: Rudy Giuliani may get in. His tweet today said he only drinks Diet Pepsi.  Seth Meyers' bit on it today was pretty funny too.
Had to watch twice so cool üòé
Am the only one that's thinking about kiwico?
Rob Dyrdek And Mark Rober collab? Meet the Robs
"I find it quite interesting, bc this content is definitely aimed at kids, the crunch box is for kids to build and everything in the videos is explained very simply, and yet, none of these videos are marked as ""for kids"" it does seem like the target audience is definitely younger than 13. Idk, just interesting"
RIP Kiwi Co
Mark Rober got him a Dude Perfect engineering warehouse.
HOW DID U DO THIS MARK?!
Can You please do video kiling peopl wit rock
Mark Rober - Mr Quality Over Quantity...
Wow you own shoes? Never knew
Garage you will be missed
Got your own fantasy factory
"Now that he had shown us, we can 3d print the platinum ticket üòÑ"
Why are you competing against kiwico?
Dude just made Dexter's laboratory irl XD
KiwiCo got real quiet after this video..
"Hey mark, you should try and do what mrbeast did for 4th of july a bit ago, or maybe an alternative to that"
Bro that‚Äôs my dentist place
I‚Äôve always wanted a secret bookshelf door to a cool bunker or something
Maybe you should Collab with Mr.Beast and make a maze with a bunch of booby traps designed by you and the first one to reach the end gets to keep the money at the end of it. Placed there by Mr.Beast.
MKBHD appearing to demonstrate his ultimate frisbee skills earned my like
shows it to millions of peplo
So awesome! Kids will definitely be inspired!
11:16 no sorry dude i dont want œÄ=3
HOW AWESOME IS THIS PLACE!!
6:26 I think the light coming from under the bookshelf is a bit of an issue
"If Mark Rober ran for any office, I'd vote for him."
theres light behind the bookshelf
"You are my favorite person EVER. For reference...I'm a kid's entertainer, educator, videographer. And you are far and away everything I would ever hope for to achieve and to aspire to times 100. I'm just so glad you exist to do all of the things and inspire all of the kids in the most playful manner that so many just do not comprehend is necessary. I'm going to keep doing my thing, but I feel better that there are people like you out there with such a playful spirit, inspiring kids to create, explore and have fun. You rock, brother."
Amazing human
Getting some Fantasy Factory vibes and I love it!
Mark has never failed to surprise and impress me. I've been watching him for 3 years and it has never been boring. Such a great guy

Omg my friend and I are totally obsessed! We love you and would love to come out! Both you and my dad are engineers and you guys inspire me. I would love to be like you and invent whatever crazy ideas I have in my ADHD brain. Keep doing doing what your doing!!

Mark op
Don't worry Mark. I think your frisbee leap into the foam pit was pretty rad. Like a caracal leaping after a bird. Very cool imo.
proud of you but to build a warehouse before a recession is crazy...
"Your new secret lair is splendid, but I am VERY impressed with your monthly boxes. It is a terrific way to introduce young people to the delights of engineering. I wish you and your excited students much success with it.üñ§üá®üá¶"
"This is one of the best things I‚Äôve seen, as a kid I have dreamed about a secret room like this, it‚Äôs insane what some people can do and mark is the best engineer I‚Äôve seen, I hope he continues doing stuff he wants lol"
I'm 23 and i want him as my uncle xD
EZZZ
gah... this or tinker crates?
Plot twist.  He still isn't the favorite uncle.
I'm an adult and I want to do your engineering crunchlabs. Is this allowed?
Why not! Have fun! We are all still children deep inside!

As a side note, I really want roof to floor whiteboards."
yeah Mark ...I'm sure ANYONE will be able to...sounds like a fishing guy that I know of that said kinda the same ..maybe you all can do a collab...
Can you make a train horn with the liberty to cereal without grabbing it and grabbing the milk and can you like make 1
And now a word from our sponsor‚Ä¶ KiwiCo !!
"Mark rober copies Mrbeast but its 
engineering"
I love this channel.
The Fireman's what? üò≥
This seems like every YouTuber ever does this‚Ä¶where‚Äôs all the ‚Äúengineering‚Äù? No CNC machines or routers? Only a few 3D printers? No computers for CAD or CFD? A few basic hand tools on a peg board? No draftsman tables or surface plates? ‚Ä¶Or am I missing something?
Already ordered. My daughter is excited about the boxes and just in time for summer break. I would love to see a counter on the webpage to see how many orders you get on these build boxes.
i do not know how to leave something better then a like..
Reply to me! I love you!!!
Let's go!!
There‚Äôs something you didn‚Äôt thin of‚Ä¶.(I mean if perfection is your REAL goal)..that is a randomized selector that selects any one of 25 entry switches.  Only YOU have the APP on your phone that lets you know WHICH entry switch was randomly selected.  Of course if you were to invite a ‚Ä¶let‚Äôs say‚Ä¶‚Äôcustom cabinet maker‚Äô‚Ä¶for instance‚Ä¶to see your warehouse ‚Äòhe‚Äô (or she..if it‚Äôs not a he) can suggest incredible options‚Ä¶(of course if it were ME‚Ä¶I haven‚Äôt worked on anything newer than the 16th C for a couple decades so it might be unusual‚Ä¶.

I wouldn't be surprised if all the firehouses started using the piston. What a f'n genius. ü¶æüí™
"i know it shouldnt. but as a handyman by trade, that ball crashing through the wall hurt my soul."
This crunch lab box is stunning. I‚Äôm 34 and I would get it for me. I only know sound engineering. None of this mechanical stuff. This is simply amazing.
"O-My-Gosh

I don‚Äôt even know how to react to his AMAZING WAREHOUSE"
This is why Mark is the best. Nuf said.
I need this toilet lol.
"Mark Rober: I made a secret passageway to a warehouse!

Except you can see the light coming from under the book shelf so anyone can see there's something behind it.
For April Fool's day next year you need to make the starting room Crunch Labs decorated
"6:29 ""And clearly you just told 22 million people how to get in to your office""."
wow
"is crunch labs just like kiwico? does that mean you're technically a competitor now? how is that going to work considering you've worked closely with them before, its a cool idea its just nothing new"
Awesome idea
6:49 but mark what if I actually want a Diet Pepsi
"Mark,  you misssed the word ""place"" in the title of your video."

Where's the qr code?

"if only this video had come out a week or two earlier. Now I won't be able to do these because I can't buy it and my parents probably won't because they just got me a graduation present, so if the vid had been earlier then the Crunch box could have been my present"
Mr. Rober you a an inspiration to us all and I thank you for being an amazing influence for children.

"I think this is really cool, but all this is advertising you're just yanking money from little kids who think it would be cool to go to a big science place and meet Mark Rober."
You are so amazing Mark! The warehouse is awesome!

We need Squirrel Maze 3.0! ü§çü§çü§ç
Hey mark I‚Äôm 10 in 5th grade and me and my class made a basketball hoop out of cardboard
Mark you are so created! I‚Äôm definitely going to get the box! Thank you!
"Trust me, you have been the favorite uncle for awhile now"
You've got light escaping under the bookcase. Kinda gives away the secret entrance.
Mark is making the world a better place.
-It's a secret to everybody-
I don't know what the visibility of the foam is when on the balcony but maybe you should have a sign saying whether it's active or not just in case somebody jumps when they shouldn't.
I'm guessing his security system is also insane too. Like his squirrel course with traps and  holograms and lasers lol

Omg hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
This is so freaking beautiful! I'm so freaking proud of this moment!
I‚Äôm going into 7th grade next year and my dream job is to become a electrical engineer. Crunch labs sounds like the perfect thing to get me started. Thanks Mark!
@Naxoriss Thanks for the shout out dylan ü§ì
"The ""a"" should be spelled ""an""."
I feel like you've gone from fun honest builds to commercialization very quickly... loosing interest.
Will you be doing years worth of projects that if we choose annually we're not going to have to worry about repeats anytime soon?
I'm willing to bet Willy Wonka and Batman would be jealous.
"Between you and Stuff Made Here, engineering has never looked so cool. Thank you for igniting passion in people to know more about all the things you do! üòÇ"

Crunch labs sounds like one of those hydraulic press channels

I want to see this but I live in Australia
So now Mark Rober is gonna promote his kits more than kiwi co. Pretty much what they are.
Mark Rober is the least villainous mad scientist to ever exist.
Epic
You guys think it's possible to form a symbiotic relationship with ants and have ant farms that they automatically drop off their dead for us to eat and we feed them in return...
keep it up bro u always inspire me to learn and engineer and pursue my dreams of being a computer hardware ENGINEER
Dude! This is truly amazing. Thank you for doing what you do!
"Mark Rober is one of the coolest guys ever. üòé
Watching him has been inspirational for me and my son moved on projects together because of Mark. I just got done watching this with my son. We're both freaking out just how much cooler he just got. This is huge. We want to visit now. Lol"
"I've just got to say, you've been super inspiring for me to pursue engineering. I've been watching your videos for years now and they just keep getting better and better. Unfortunately, I never exactly have enough time to do your engineering class, but just watching your videos have really made me want to give it my all, which thankfully I can do with my school's robotics team. Hopefully I can be a great engineer like you one day. Thanks so much for everything you do for all future engineers out there."
Robber?
Mark Robber's a great person
"I love ‚ù§Ô∏è your videos 
Can I get crunch labs"
you can see the sculpture from backyard scientists video with the melted aluminum!!!
Mark you should get a subscriber and let them come to Crunchlabs and explore it
please send me a email
wow that billed box is really cool except for the fact that its a direct rip off of tinker krates that I know you've heard of because they used to sponsor youre videos
"Amazing Mark! Thank you for sharing, you rule!! Woohoo!!üí•"
Okay your the coolest uncle now
2.2 million views by the time I saw this. Chance of winning Platinum ticket? Probably 1 in 2.2 million and dropping.
you should build a roller coaster there
Where did you find dexters labortory ????
You are the King sir! My brain would have exploded out my ears with excitement over something like that when I was a kid.
Dang mark throwing hands with KiwiCo
"Dear Mark Rober, Please build a nuclear reactor. Dear GarryTheWorm."
the cannon does more damage than what hacksmith builds
I think he should make some sort of show series outta this with kids. Kinda like the baking shows but this is has teams or something that build things and get to be judged or make it a competition outta of it and hold it there
We are so excited about this!
Your son probably loves it in there
He said willy wonka‚Ä¶mr beast colab leaked??
"It makes me so happy to see people ‚Äîas talented, as kind, as awesome as wholesome as him‚Äî succeed."
Mark Rober is this generation's Bill Nye.
That guy seems smart he' should be an engineer'
# f kiwi co
how many secrets does this guy have? First the online classes and now this. Mark is insane.
i heard pvz music thank you
his neighbors: why does he need a really big box on the side of his housr
Maaaaaaaaaaaark! You can see the underglow of the lab's white light under the bookshelf
"I think you need something bigger next time
it's so cool"
Mark you do realize that you just gave every waiting room person a nightmare. Every kids going to be playing with the decor in the hopes that they can find your Lab.
I love how no one would suspect the light coming from the book shelf. 6:27
This is the most awesome place ever especially for kids so much fun! And i want to have that someday!
kiwico rn: üòë
"how does mark rober only have 22 mil, in my opinion he should have more than mr beast, mark, you are a legend and the best youtuber on the planet"
The solenoid that keeps the door shut seems like a potential code violation...
"Such a childish video, as an actual engineer, I prefer his videos with actual engineering."
"Ohh so you called the warehouse crunch labs to write it all off on tax as an office/storage space for the crunch labs kit facilities, I see üòé I'd do the same don't worry heh"
your lab must look like the fairy godmothers(shrek) factory from the outside
I love what you do for the children of America! You teach them well on how to understand well and become smart! You should go international in all countrys who speak English. Thank you for all your work!
Woah
would you ever consider making a crunch labs box for teens?
"This is so cool, I wish I could visit"
"Did anyone else notice around 6:26 how there's light shining under the cupboard, giving away the ""secret"" entrance?"
*ME BEING SHOCKED*  :00000 OH MAHHH GOSHHHH
"I have an idea of upgrading chopsticks.
What if you hacked an Amazon Alexa to make chopsticks say and play music instead of the Amazon Alexa but still have custom messages available.

Anyone else concerned that toilet system could be bypassed by leaving without flushing?
Nice.
I must say your tidy tool wall should be an inspiration to Will Prowse. But he is much better at batteries!

This has the same vibe when Dude Perfect first moved to their new HQ. More opportunities and expansion and has everything you would ever want. Doubles as a workspace and a fun zone.
ITS THE BACKROOMS LEAKED

I think he made those secret passageways just for fun. 

Moreover, his nephews probably have other uncles as well."
I have a very serious question though. yes he's my favorite creator but who is he competing with when he needs secret passageways after everything? Who is hel threatening his status as best uncle on the continent?
@Sparkleydog1234 AJ {rip technoblade}  mark helped at least on the ocean one
Schisser ich nicht Deutsch-land
Okay this is crazy
Straight up copied kiwi co
Nitro is the best
you should do a video on the most optimal paper airplane and the physics that goes into it
You should tell the Fed about pneumatics so they can get a soft landing
what about the giant spot of light under the bookshelf lol
A cool idea would be to mix your movable bowling ball and a drone to trick your friends
It's all fun and games learning to be an engineer until you get to thermodynamics.
"Amazing workshop just one question, if you get the platinum ticket in Australia what do you do?"
That place is awesome!  You make science/engineering so much fun.
this gives me breaking bad kinda vibes lol
"Mark is on such a whole other level as an YouTuber, each one of those builds could have been its own video, but he Crunched it all together with a massive revelation."
"Its fun how he says nobody would suspect that there is a secret room in the office, when you literally see light coming out underneath bookshelf."
guys the QR code in the video is a rick roll.
I feel like the office entrance needs to be activated by a statue of Shakespeare like the 1960s Batcave!
1 and a half minutes in I love the lay out hope to be able to have something like this of my own one day

"I feel like crunch labs is produced by kiwi co. The boxes & packagings, materials, and booklets are very similar."
"hello, I am lovin the videos and seeing how each video makes me smarter, I really want to support you and get those monthly boxes, but I can't afford it, so im doin my best on saving to try and get at least one box, see ya."

Only Mark is so successful that he only sponsors his own businesses.
This might honestly be the coolest thing I've ever seen. This is every child's dream I feel. The hot wheels track is a very nice touch

"Mark, I want to say what you are doing for the next generation of engineers, or even kids that just wanna make a cool toy, is extremely heartwarming. You make this random person on the internet proud of what you're doing, and I'm glad that people like you exist in this world.

I absolutely love science, and I'm looking to potentially go for engineering myself. It has always intrigued me but never clicked until more recently in life. I wish I had someone like you years and years ago to really get me to take that push forward a lot earlier, so I could really grasp my love for tinkering and science.

Keep on going Mark, you're an inspiration to so many people."

üîù DM üì© Giveaway üéÅ
"Build boxes are cool and all but I think there are a few issues with them that prevent them from being proper tools to instill an engineering mindset. One, you have exactly what you need, nothing more nothing less, and it‚Äôs exactly what you need, a real engineer doesn‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôll need until they figure it out for themselves, but since you‚Äôre given everything it doesn‚Äôt let you experience that. The other thing is that it tells you exactly what to do and how to build it, once again a real engineer has to figure that out on their own. Ive been interested in engineering but I just don‚Äôt think I have the mind for it, and its hard to get that mindset when the things im missing aren‚Äôt really being taught. I know it would be hard to implement these kinds of things in a build box, but you‚Äôre an engineer, I believe you can find a way, you always find a way"

You have inspired me so so much, since I was 7 I have wanted to be an engineer and you made me think that it‚Äôs possible. I would love to be an aerospace or biological engineer and I would love to work for nasa it has always been my dream. I even go into a really difficult high school in my area to get into for manufacturing and engineering. You have inspired me so much and your videos definitely get my brain going. Thank you for letting me see it‚Äôs possible! I really hope you see this and maybe even respond! I love engineering so much and people never take me serious when I say that because of being a girl but you have made me realize I can do it if I work for it"

"Hey mark, i have a quick question: i run a small twitch channel in German language dedicated to engineering. Software, electronics, 3d printing, lasers. My goal is to get people into the field of technology, tinkering and engineering. I was wondering if it would be okay if I built those boxes on stream and make them twitch chat controlled. Some of my viewers already have kids so this might even be beneficial.

Would that be okay? If not that's totally understandable. I'm also not going to link the channel here. I that's a rude thing to even ask: here's my favorite excuse. Language barrier. üòÅ"

I have a hard time believing that you wouldn‚Äôt suspect a secret entrance when you walk into a giant warehouse only to find yourself in a small room with no doors inwards‚Ä¶ but I have an easy time admitting that it‚Äôs super cool.
Imagine the warehouse being underground or in a mountain. Then it would be more mind fucky.

Mark basically made the Fantasy Factory.
"Maybe Mark can answer! Men need a logical reason to remember a rule. to leave the seat down. It's not that they don't want to, most do! Been asking for centuries but no answer has ever been given.

"I was thinking about people working in skyscrapers and if there's a fire and they cannot escape.  If everyone's desk contained a magnetic panel and in each corner you could pop out a window and there was a copper or aluminum tube that goes to the ground, you could somehow put the panel in the tube and step on and it would fall but since you are on a magnet in a copper tube or aluminum tube, it will fall slowly enough that you will get to the ground safely due to Lenz Law.  Ok it needs a lot of engineering but if you watch these videos of Lenz Law there is a way to do this."

Well people will find it now ;)
This is my childhood dream x1000.
"You are my favorite YouTuber by farr. If everyone was as passionate as you, heaven would be overrated"
I love the crunch labs engineering toys. The kids in my life are still too young. Hope this catches on so it‚Äôs still around in five years.
Bro this is literally gravity falls

I can just see Mark Rober going down the pistons with a coffee in the morning and being like ‚Äúokay team what are the ideas to launch ourselves to the moon using only a nerf gun‚Äù
I literally stoped half way through this video and bought it I‚Äôm so exited for the crunch labs crate.
i love those boxes! to bad that you don't delivery to my country :c
This is crazy great job mark love your vids
i want to win so bad i love your videos
"half-life 2 inspired ""super secret"" entrance"
being a engineer has to be cool
Oh so cool.
This but with cars and real guns
im just waiting for someone to jump into the container only to midair notice someone moved it
I hate it when people close the toilet in a public place
"these crates look cool, but whats the difference between these and kiwico crates?"
"This may well be the greatest thing I have seen for the benifit of kids and the future I have ever seen.  This is something that kids will really learn from and be inspired by rather than the useless crap they are increasingly subjected to at school. 
Takes a special kind of person to put this together and watching your vids I always respected you were but this is truly next level stuff. 

Well done mate. I hope this is even more successful that what you dream and I am sure it will be. Hopefully things like this catch on around the world.  It is a fantastic contribution to the future of kids and a productive, educated society."
Kiwi Co. be sweating
all kids dream
Awesome !!
YOU SIR. are a blessing to this world :)
Nothing has made me want to be a kid to experience something as much as your box has
"Yeah, as far as those fireman poles go, I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre not supposed to squeeze your hands on it on the way down, I typically use mostly my legs and use my hands more for control"
Are we gonna get a video about Artemis I(since it‚Äôs launching soon)...?

So THAT's where the domino video was filmed!
Someone has been to Omega Mart at Area 15!
"Me: Alright guys, we're gonna make a secret base...
**Mark Rober intensifies**
Me: ...in Minecraft..."
Discs in the launcher look a little to Flippy for my liking. If you've got any resembling the flight of Felons of Firebirds HMU.
I wouldn't of been surprised if in the video Mark showed a secret door that led to a secret underground volcano base.
"In my next life, I would build a place like that for myself.....

In the meantime, what are you offering for adults????"
"hi mark!! im so much younger than you and i fully understand and absolutely ADORE your videos! (im 11!!)
your videos are inspiring me to be jst like u!!! this video is amazing, and i i hope u have a nice day. :D"
13:28 such an obvious cut üòÇ
I can't wait for the first winner of the platinum ticket to get to crunch labs and basically have to solve a unique escape room but to enter instead of escaping
Uh for the fire pole thing I thing that u could‚Äôve just used the things used for rock climbing but looks a cool :)
"Hey Mark Wonka, can you stop using frikkin watermelons (any food) in your videos? Think of the cheeeeeellllddreennnn"
Cool! Now we have kiwi co and crunch labs!
Can I work as the receptionist?
isn't what kiwico already have done that?

What about a durian u never did a durian is spikey and strong try it with the  tennis  launcher thing

8:35 I see you got that metal statue in the background from backyard scientist

Mark - can you contact me?  I have a VERY RELEVANT (lifesaving) application for your pneumatic elevator.
You could've shown me a picture of the warehouse and I would know Mark made it.
I love your video mark its awesomeüòÄ
Congrats. You‚Äôve just awoken the paranoia in millions of people who will now go touch every object in places. I‚Äôm one of them
Love it! You and Jimmy sure are pushing this entire thing to a whole new level. You guys are just the best! üëç
Mark rober Ur a legend also to all hot wheels fans out there watching this video i bet the two timer will go smoothly on that track
"I've never understood people who wash their hands AFTER being to the toilet.
Your hands are waaaaaaaaaay dirtier than your junk. Plus, if you wash first, your hands might actually have time to dry, meaning fewer particulates will stick as you go around touching door handles, etc."
The only thing in my mind now is a Crunch Labs vs KiwiCo ultiment showdown. Preferably on the White cliffs of Dover or the end of Australia or somewhere epic

Infomercial.

The plants vs zombies music is a nice touch

Hi

Mind freakin blown guy..ü§Ø
My kid wants to see you a lot you are his favorite YouTuber he‚Äôs is 8
Where did you get the foam pit blocks
"Your crunchlabs idea is spot on Mark. As a College Prof for mainly science courses (biochem, analytical chemists, instrumentation, etc) it is pretty clear the lack of critical thinking and intellectual curiosity in newer generations and fostering those skills is a necessity these days."
"The secret door room, i feel like it is every childhood dream you just realized. Such a cool video, and luckily for us we have someone like you on yt."
I think so to
Oh my word. This is so extra üòÇ
Getting a Lab facility is the new youtube meta
"Congrats Mark two questions one is can you do a few more of the live streams you did during the part of the pandemic really enjoyed that style of content, The second question is what is the selling point of your boxes vs kiwi co / what made you want to make your own alternative."
"This looks familiair. A secret lab, even with a big red button. Does Mark also have a sister called DeeDee?"
It‚Äôs supposed to be fantastic Gus
I've always wanted to have a go on a fireman's piston
"Wait, no"
Someone has visited meowolf recently
"The secret lair was the only thing in the way of mark becoming a supervillain and now he has is


We are screwed if he gets a little too angry with the world one day"
why all these greenscreen scenes?
Wow hi
Hey mark who does the cleaning duty
Shout out to Gus üêø
Um.. I need to have a kid STAT!
Love it! Living Vicariously through you!
"Wow, Amazing!!!"
Mark got himself a slice of the Kiwi pie. With a Crunchy base. A true genius.
I am a child and I was the exact same and I also wanna be a mechanical engineer!
I like how he put pvz music lol
Anyone Feel Like This Lab Feels Like Zac King's Lab But Better?
Is it worldwide
This is awesomeüòÇüëèüëè‚úåü§ó

what are the chances that the same person gets all the tickets
Kiwico 2.0
What about Kiwi Co.?
Sciences versious of Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory
i want to do it but i don't have enough money
This is the best engineering video I have ever watched
Wish this was in Florida :(
"Knowing Mark, he probably even has a magic device to make the building seem smaller from the outside."
You are an amazing human.  <3
Fulfilling his dream of having a Dexter‚Äôs Laboratory

"If it's not under a volcano, it doesn't count."
"Will crunchlab be available in Europe? In different languages? My son (11yo, Netherlands) would love it."
It‚Äôs like when someone said they got the ticket but they didn‚Äôt
Look rope where do you live and what do I do when I get the ticket?
Since you are still 8 years old.I don't see a problem
This is so cool!  I'd love to build a trebuchet with y'all one day
"You're my hero, sir üëèüëèüëèüëè"

Absolutely a fantastic video.

GOATED content creator
Mark Rober pulls bitches
NITROOOOO
YESS NEW VID
This is just the pinnacle of our future people. We must let our creativity to the next level by all means necessary!
So question. Do you have to turn all the speed boosters on to run the track? Because how awesome would it be to have some sort of sensor set up so when a car is x distance away it auto turns on and then turns off after the car leaves it. Would make the track a lot more fun if it just always worked at any moment.
mark you are literally the BEST youtuber ever!
"""...which just might have cemented my status in my ongoing quest to be the favorite uncle...""

Dude, that quest is over. I've never met you and you are BY FAR my favorite uncle. And I'm 32."

no more kiwico sponsorships anymore i guess
how about making custom kits where you can pick up any pieces you want to build your own ideas?
Breaking News: Mark Rober‚Äôs New Lab Has Just Been Declared As A Modern Wonder Of The World!
Wow Nitro. What a blast from the past.
Are we not going to talk about the fact that Mark is literally piggybacking off KiwiCo's success?
Hello Mark! Just when youtube got boring you posted again :)
Crunch labs is awesome im buying one even rho im 15
"Know I know... If I ever get the chance to meet Mark Rober, I'm  definitely bringing quarters!!!"
Oh this is is a nice eagle can I- OH MY
Dude is living the life

Chopsticks is my favorite invention you made
"me and my failmly watching this. mw brother gets the smirk. 

i am just wating for my little brother to cause mayhem."
"waiting for mark to now come out with hits like, Beat it, Billie jean, Annie are you ok, etc etc."
Pretty awesome!
sometimes I wish I was an engineer instead of a vet lmao
That‚Äôs awesome. I love that you engineered the toilet to lock the door and not to just put the seat back down.

I am in awe and inspired
This is so cool wish I could have that
Wow That‚Äôs amazing Mark! your videos are always so awesome and inspiring you are definitely my favorite YouTuber!
I love your video's
"Lovely Idea Mark, but how is KiwiCo going to take it?"
Secret?? Hmm everybody knows it now is it still a secret thoo?
The whole ‚Äúno Mark Rober‚Äôs we‚Äôre harmed in this video‚Äù implies that there are multiple of them. Cloning lab?
"This is just incredible! My hats off to you mark, loved this project a lot mate!"
Speaking of Fhat Guss did she give birth yet

Mark sounds different In this video
Its amazing but people will know it‚Äôs there because it‚Äôs just a massive warehouse with a tiny office so from outside people will know
Foam pit on wheels‚Ä¶. Just look before you leap.
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL
You know. These secret passage ways aren't so secret if everyone knows about them.
Wow that is very cool how did you build that!
"Mark ""Dexter"" Rober."
"Oooo, what does this button doooo?!?"
You're doing some really great work here Mark!
Great vid mark keep it up

There goes the KiwiCo sponsorship. üòÖ
"I was so excited when I saw mark had posted, he never disappoints!"
Hey Mark on Number 5 is that Plants vs Zombie music ?
This video is gonna have a lot of people suspiciously looking behind pictures and furniture at their doctors office looking for secret passageways
Your amazing
Wish I had your money and time wasted
"You dont burn your hands in firepoles If u ""hug"" it with your arm"
Why u be wasting watermelons tho?
Danseez is the best song
6:20 amazing choice of backround music
I wish I had Mark Rober when I was younger
Super cool!
You should change your nerf guns with Airsoft
i love how there was plants vs zombies music just randomly in the video
i love your videos can i have the toy box thing (23313)
So kool for the younger folks.
mkbhd and mark rober crossover???? sign me up
New video!!!

"Mark, You are a modern hero."
I used to think there really were kids with dexter¬¥s lab style hideouts like these lol
Mark Rober: Sheer genius!
I love this!
Secret passages? Goofy ways to get around? Mark Rober is living my best life and I don't mind.
Wait wasn't that mkbhd throwing frisbee

Mark becoming batman irl
this is goated
I saw that it was called crunch labs and as an animator in the industry I think it just triggers some subconscious ptsd because I stood up and went to go make some coffee
"ok, mark rober, the hacksmith, colinfurze, and simone giertz (and I forget who it was with the awesome lab...)
you guys seriously need to collab for a superhero series, lol
the hacksmith is building modern stark industries
mark rober has the batcave
colinfurze is just a mad scientist
we're having IRL superheroes who don't fight with violence, they fight with youtube videos, and brains!"
"I love this so much, not only the warehouse, but also his new brand I am definitely going to have to buy one"
inspiring kids to be engineers instead of inspiring them to be drag queens will make the world a better place üëè üëè bravo Mr Rober..
I think firefighters could benefit from the new and improved fireman‚Äôs piston
"Uhhh... I think you missed the meaning of Secret. The warehouse part is not a secret, unless you make the shutters and back door hard to spot outside. Can clearly see through the holes on the shutter side... Also a warehouse is huge, expect people with One Digit IQ? Hahaha. Peace."
Its just insane how many IQ he has
Hold up! This box is only for kids? Not for 28 year olds? It honestly looks pretty cool. Great job Mark!
"20 million, hah, cute"
RIP Kiwi Co
This business model is genius. There are produced now customers literally every single day!

"Mark: ""So instead of the fireman's pole, you have the fireman's...""

Can you do a video about water powered cars?
he should build a giant frisbee launcher
This is he best YouTuber merch ever!
thanks mark rober
seems cool
"Seeing this makes the childlike ambition go wild.
But then i'm immediately sadder than before because i realize i'll never have something like that."
"Dude this is exactly why I love you, you do so much for kids who just want to have fun and build stuff, I'm even considering over the summer asking my parents if we could get crunch labs and just have tons of fun"
"This is extraordinary!!!!!!!!

A dream of mine is to have a secret bookcase that leads into a secret lab with secret passages!!!!!!! SECRET PLACES!!!!!!!!!üòÇ"
I remember people speculating that Mark was up to something big. We had no idea!
I wish I had 0.1% of your brain power. üß†
"yeah no one would probably be fooled, yeah dude isnt using the majority of this building..."
New mark vid!!
that's actually cool
very cool
Wow this is so cool you're videos are so well done and great
Congratulations Mark! Ir really seems like you dreamed about this place your hole life. It's a great achivement for you. And what you do encouraging children around the globe si awesome. Congrats from Argentina!!!

Take my money
Time to go tell my parents about this
I see a new Mark Rober upload and I click. It‚Äôs that easy guys
This is definitely giving dude perfect hq 2 vibes

"It's great to see, my daughter's a bit to young but I may stock up on some boxes once I get a handle on the money situation in this economy. It's been really rough but we will all get through it somehow."
I would never get anything done for the rest of my life if I had access to a lab like this.
>>>üì©üîù<<<
Does the Crunch lab box ship anywhere or just us?
Would you consider making a build box for children younger than 8?
it looks EXACTLY like the lab from breaking bad ...

If i can have 2 jobs ill be a chef engineer when i grow up
Built a Minecraft base in real life
"lmao I love how ""nobody would find it"" while there's a very suspicious bar of light glowing under that bookshelf ;P"
What if you get a ticket in another country than the US?
i love your inventions and your youtube where you wil help others (i am the same) also i am photographer and what i one day wil build is a lens for in the dark becuse i am a night men haha and it can be verry handy to have (and a beeft up stormchase car)
Ww
‚ÄûAnd I‚Äòve just never had a great answer for that specific question‚Äú yeah you had Mark. You had one and they were you greatest and most loyal sponsor. If this isn‚Äôt a joint venture I feel like you just ripped of Kiwico like crazy.
Pov: it looks at first like dude perfects place
You should see about selling them at stores like Walmart or even a place like Barnes and Nobles
The melons must suffer!!
This video is the smoothest commercial I have ever seen
Congrats
Only Mark Rober can make a 17 minute long commercial look fun
for real where do i enter my credit card info

This was the HIGHLIGHT of my day (and I did some CRAZY FUN stuff)
Keep it up!"
Everyone look for an oversized tooth decay poster
The secret door in the office needs a seal at the bottom for light seeping through.
üì©üîù
who is this for?
üì©üîù##
You are one of the most amazing person to be gracing this planet with your existence and sharing that experience with the world.
This is the Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory for smart people
This video is absolutely mental. Thank you.
Life Goals
üì©üîù##
You can see there is a passageway behind the shelf by the Light that shines underneath it.
KiwiCo sweating hard after this video‚Ä¶.
"OMG
That is an amazing place to work
Between you and Chris Ramsey
You are both awesome
Him with his puzzles and tricks and you with your glitter bombs and that warehouse
Thank you so much for sharing your videos with us
üôèüíúüôè"
"Amazing! But we could definitely see the glowing bean of light under the bookshelf, as well as the scuff marks under the statue that triggers the door :P"
Just incredible‚ù§Ô∏è
"Mark, you're insane! üòÆ"
Under the secret door you can see light
Hi mark
"Its just the coolest thing to see how much he and his channel evolved over the years!
keep doing what your doing mark!"
One of the best news this year already
I want a secret lair!
"I don‚Äôt know how to say this other than ‚ÄúCongrats!‚Äù. You‚Äôve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it‚Äôs so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."
Amazing video
"I would absolutely LOVE to come to your lab, but I don't have any cool ideas of things to build like you do, I would be so nervous"
"With NR 5, you can see the light under the bookshelf
Can you push another soda button?"
Hey Mark not to be that guy but where is the squirrel maze 3.0
so fantasy factory engineer edition
"Mark is actually a genius. He literally made a way to fix peoples unsanitary habits and also made all of our childhood dreams a reality. 
PS.  There is literally no imaginable possibility that you aren‚Äôt all of your nieces and nephews favorite uncle."
Facts....watch the nerf gun video. Mark definitely wins Christmas every year.
this is insane
you nailed it bro.
I just dream ‚ú®Ô∏è to be able to buy all your boxes üì¶ and give them away to kids around the world üåé
Why are all the science nerds lookin like they were once jocks LOL
"OMG I actually get a chance to meet you. Sadly my family doesn't have much money, so I guess I'll try and get a job real soon"
gravity falls type beat
Now it‚Äôs marker beast
WOW! Mark thats so cool:)
This is every kids dream house
Waow
It‚Äôs funny how Mark Rober sounds like Randy Pausch
"*""But before we see if I live, I want to talk about today's sponsor,*
*RAID SHADOW LEGENDS""*"
Bipity bopity yeet
wait what you an actualy go? ahahahahahaha
"Every single gamer is jealous of his base

And every non-gamer"
"You Sir, you are living my dream.
You built the base that I build in every Minecraft world 
üòÖ"
"You need to collaborate with ""Stuff made here"""
"SUCH A NEWS, so cool !
Wish you the best in this new venture."
.
"since you release a monthly video, you could have the person that comes to see the crunch labs be featured in a video... just an idea you might like"
if this isnt trending ill be mad.
we need more people like mark rober
I'm going to sign up for the one year
Does someone know what song chopsticks played?
and I‚Äôm out here wondering how the copper cable is spinning around my double a battery lol
Not a lot of equality in the bathrooms there...
Not a single upload that isn‚Äôt a an absolute banger
Except I can see the light coming from the crack under the bookcase at 06:24.
:O
I'm definitely going to buy it
"Holy Guacamole, this is amazing"
ik it's for kids n'all...but gosh I love this stuff
Me showing my mom my Minecraft world
How are you not the favorite uncle by now
I didn‚Äôt know my father went there!
"Mark Rober, Mr Beast, and The Hacksmith need to team up to become a super hero of sorts."
Kiwi co???
So you grew up off Rob Dyrdek and his Fantasy Factory...Coolüòè
"Flawed hand wash alarm. All it takes is for the handle to turn on, not necessarily washing their hands."
Day 4 of asking mark to make a gigantic 3D printer
You are awesome!
I teared up from how wholesome this is
Bro has like a thousand things he works on everyday
daddy
I need a phat gus plushie
I find it crazy when youtubers are secretly working on stuff like this for a year or more. Never once saying anything or hinting at it somehow. Makes me wonder what else mark is working on even now
He employed every amazing strategy including the willy wonka golden ticket
I can play piano
te amo amiokr riober :()))))
"HOLY I had no idea that my favorite tech tuber is also a very skilled pro Frisbee player, when I saw the ""Frisbee player"" in the video I thought to myself is that Marques Brownlee? and I search it up AND YES!"
why does this sound like an end?
"Oh no you‚Äôre bad go gosh, giggles!"
(:troll:)
"Hey Mark, love the crunch labs packs. Will you offer any educational packs so that teachers are able to bring these lessons into classrooms? Love the design process and it would be awesome be be able to bring this to students!"
This is a great idea! I know I would have loved something like this as a child.
Wow
Mark is the Bill Nye of the next generation and I love it
This is soo cool.
Yesterday a friend asked me where is my happy place. I told him I didn't have or know of one. This is it. This is my happy place... and I'll never be able to visit or have one of my own. üò≠
yes but mark THE LIGHT UNDER THE BOOKCASE THE LIGHT ITS VERY VISIBLE
At the start I was wondering if it was a Mr Green video
We need a subreddit where people can show their kid‚Äòs Crunch Lab Progress/ results. Or their own perverted creations completely abusing the provided build parts‚Ä¶
Do you ship to Canada?
"A 17 minute commercial...







I'm not even mad"
"I''m glad I wasn't the only kid obsessed with the Assault event from American Gladiators.

Though, if I had the means, I probably would have built the whole course with the crossbow and rocket launcher.  Gotta fight back..."
Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been here for over 5 years I am so proud ü•≤
Awesome and wholesome as always love it‚ò∫
Simply amazing üíï
4:06 me after my mom is chasing me because I didn't do my chores
mark i challenge you to a engineering duel unless you are a chicken here are the rules we both make crazy insane water guns no super sokers and the time limet is entil today next year  if i win you have to give me your water gun but if you win i give you mine
pleas respond or els i will quit engeniering for a month

I RLY want to go to crunch lab!!!!
soooooo.... you selling that toilet seat contraption or what?
I love this. You always have the best ideas.
How long does The Hot wheel track take to complete? @MarkRober
That's as secret as the Fruze tunnel.
Congratulations in accomplishing your childhood dreamüëèüèΩüòÅ
"My inner child was screaming just thinking what it would feel like to actually find the platinum ticket. Then I remembered I am 26 and should probably go to an actual kid. Congrats Mark, you have built my dream place <3"
Why not just make a toilet seat that closes itself?
"Dude, could I come by!?! Love this spot!"
The issue with the shelf door is that you can see there's a doorway behind it because the light shines underneath it
Did mark just become art attack but for engineers?
6:26 the light coming from under the book shelf makes it pretty obvious that there is a room behind it
"Even with the current dip in crypto currency's I'm glad I can smile üôÇback at my portfolio of $107,000built from my weekly trading I have received my sixth withdrawal which is  every 14 business days per trade investing through expert Mr Arjun B Jagat"

Can you try to make the worlds smallest steam engine
"Does anyone know what song is playing at 6:19 (during section five, basically) because it goes hard thanks! :)"
Can you please invite google to 3D Map the place so we can digitally walk around and check it out?
the carpet is a dead giveaway
If only I had kids
Cloudy and a chance of meatballs
Mark Wonka üòÑ
Hello can you make a combustion engine
Thanks for letting us live the dream with you Mark!
crunch labs looks amazing
i think mark rober might be the coolest person in the world
Is he Mr.beast?????
You are a wonderful human being.
"crunch labs kit, but only 1st world kids could have it...."
why now
"This is super cool, but just don't make the mistake of accidentally leaving light below the secret doorways, since that always gives everything away."
Pov half life 2 6:43
OK all cool. But üòû the crunch labs in a box look disappointingly _exactly_ like Kiwico and are even monthly too.
Master; genius!
"Only Mark Rober would show a secret engineering lair behind an office, show it off to the world, and probably still keeps it a secret."
Mark Rober's Fantasy Factory
"I'm glad to share the same world as you, Mark. You are truly an amazing human. Thanks for all you do."
I want something like this so bad!!!
Lets see you make a robot that can juggle.
16:26 I just wanted you to know that I saw that clip üòÇ
Very cool !
Ill live there!Its so cool!you've outdone ylurself!
You really need to armor that wall so you don‚Äôt have 100 üï≥ holes by the end of the year

Early
Firemen piston what??
Your son is going to love this
Mark is just the best person to ever be given this amazing positivity and he puts so much work into his videos. Keep up the great work üëç
Your so friggin awesome! Awesome warehouse
Oh I so wish that I could‚Ä¶. But since I live in Canada‚Ä¶.
DAYUUUUM
"Cool place, except for the cucked toilet"
8:09 omg tinker crate 2.0
"This is awesome, congratulations"
"7:21 actually, 1.1M"
Mark Rober just evolved.
Kiwi co copy
This video is ironic because it‚Äôs gravity falls 10 year anniversary lol
No more kiwico sponsors
"I love it, i would love to have manual in multi languages :)
The idea of building and after that still have a fun toy is amazing for kids. 
In future future, when i will have some kids need that for them."
Is it only me or you kinda took the idea of willy's wonka factory of mr beast
nah
This is super dope! Congrats!
I was hoping for squirrel maze 3 but this is cooler
Imagine flushing a bug then getting lights flashed at you
Soooo wanna make a box for adults or teens? A grade up per say
I heard kiwico going oh sh*t all the way here.
This lab cave makes Bruce Wayne jealous!
Litteraly gravity falls
Woah just woah u  mean this is real and not cgi?
2:36 Please make a really big version of this
"I loved American Gladiators too, Mark.  So jealous!"
"I‚Äôm happy for you, Mark. üíúü•º"
Can I have one pls
This is awesome in so many ways. Mark keep doing what you love!
I bet Mark Rober would be amazing at Minecraft redstone
Can I have one of you have guns I am a subscriber
1000% entertained. No mistake.
mark rober you are insane in the most awesome way possible
Remember To Pray Before Eating And Drinking. Spread The Gospel.
Can you tell me in the next video if you can get The Crunch lab boxes in Australia
You should try something new like hanging out with Matt from OFF THE RANCH
Dexters laboratory vibes
Just don‚Äôt pay attention to the light coming from under the secret door
Can you one in Boston for me cuz I have altisum like your sun
Did I just watch a 17 minutes advert?
i like your vvids and i love engineers and stuff but my dream job is to be a nasa or spacex space researcher
I want to get it but it is way out of my  budget
Ay chopsticks is back
"Love your work, keep going"
wow. just wow.
As an ENTP 8W7 and you as an ENTP 5w6 (the natural INTP enneagram) I'm so happy you exist thank-you for you and ALL you do - You amaze me seriously keep up the amaazeballs of all whom you are you most excellent engineer...!!
THIS IS REALLY COOL NGL.
"are these out forever like how quick will these sell out and when they do are they gone forever like most youtubers merch or are they like mrbeasts beast burgers and feastables
because its a bit too late to buy immediately but.....I want em im very yes just yes"
So Before I become a part of a 1st degree I
Can you get it in Australia
I love you
Ok but why not a giant sphere pit next to the cube pit
is it just me or is mark losing his voice
"Wow, it's like the guy who built a bunker in his basement"
"""No one will ever find"". Shows the internet"
#1 YouTube house tour
that looks like Mrwhosetheboss at 3:03
He is a low wage worker here
It is
"I know I'm 15 but Im looking for a job opportunity how how about I work for you guys

Just kidding I really want to see the base though"
Its 300 canadian
"That looks super cool! Is there any chance of the boxes becoming available in the UK, or other places? I would definitely buy some."
When you see Mark Rober made a new video
"*Be me, a Cybersec major in college*
*Sees Crunch Labs toy builds*
*Insert Spongebob ""I don't need it/I need it!"" meme*"
At 6:26 there‚Äôs a dead giveaway for the secret passage with all that light coming in from under a portion of the bookshelf.
Dexter's lab
That place is mind-blowing amazing! it looks like something strait out of a movie!
"6,400th comment"
5:40‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This is a superpower that most people don‚Äôt TRULLY understand‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúMark Rober‚Äù said it best‚Ä¶
My son would love that hot wheels track. Think I may build one around my house for him üòä
Nitro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You know mark you some how keep amazing me I hope that in 5 years I will be just as amazed dont forget what you started it for.
Now you got 22 million people jiggling stuff in random waiting rooms....LOL
The only problem about this is that I am not a kid anymore enjoying that amazing engeeniring box. Anyway awesome Mark!
How the fuuuuuu did he get a shipping container
This is hands done the coolest thing ever. Please tell me to will be posting more often now so we can see more of this excellence.
You're too cool Mark Rober! Please Chill.
Thanks for the invite.
"This is my dream. As a youth, I see this as a place where creativity is what builds it."
Best mark rover video ever
.
Like Mumbo Jumbo but irl
ultimate Frisby was invented in the town I live in
This is a 17 minute commercial for your product.
Me as an empath sensing Mark Rober is happy
Not to be a Karen but isent that just a copy of kiwco
so cool
Mega Colin vibes
Definitely not just ripping of kiwico
"Can we not get it my
Monthly because I don't have enough pocket money monthly"
Mark you should team up with Stuff Made Here for a project!
"Mark Rober and Gus Fring, collab of the century"
"And with this, mark has pushed himself from legendary to godlike."
As soon as I saw nitro from the American gladiator I knew this was gonna be worth the click
That's fun and lovely but only in us not in eu:(
What colors are on that T-shirt ?
"Day 1 of asking for a shout out (Sorry if this annoys you)I have always been wanting a shout out on a video. So can you please give me a shout out on the next video. (BTW you are probably not even going to see this comment. If you tell me to do this on a different channel, I will because I don't want to annoy you."
15:48
Only Mark Rober makes me question my life choices of work. Should I just quit and start my own engineering projects instead?
I imagine mark with Mr beast making an epic video like this one but with cash on the line or something idk
Mark. Take me with you. Please And thank you
Kiwi co feeling the crunch hehe
"this is cool, Mark! Great job! :)"
Okay but like real talk could I just pay to visit?
cool
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you gentlemen have a Pepsi?‚Äù
"I've nothing to say, this is just cool."
‚ÄùBut befor we see if i‚Äôll actully live‚Äù
Chicken üêî
"This is so cool, it pisses me off! :P"
Breh the nerf guns make this dorky but funny ish .. get an airsoft gun u wont >:]
This is the only channel that both my daughter and I watch. Now I can build Rober-majigs with her too. Ok ... that's pretty neat.
"Soo do you need a live in nerf ball wrangler?
Cause this is cool lol.
This warehouse looks amazing."
Love your content
This is soooo cool I love how it is secret too!
Kudos to Marques!
989851
"love to you mark for inspiring so many people, im currently in my second year of mechanical engineering and i love how you teach everything very clearly and very entertaining"
The only give away to how to get in is the fact that there is scratch marks around the eagle
i wish i can have it but my mum said i cant get it :/ an i live in Australia anyways
Excellent. Kudos.
This is my dream I‚Äôve always wanted something exactly like this.
If Batman and Bill Nye had a son.
He just re-made kiwi-co but better
dude you literally just told us
Kiwico punching the pillow rn
I really need to stop watching this kind of videos
Thus is awesome
i‚Äôm eating pizza while watching this video
Anyone else reminded of gravity falls with the entrance
"Awesome, it looks like a fun place!üòéüëçüá®üá¶"
The light under the bookcase is a giveaway to something being behind it.
"Platinum Ticket haha. DADDY, I WANT A PLATINUM TICKET! GET ME A PLATINUM TICKET!!!"
this is so cool
"Yeah, Mark, if only there were any other crates for kids that you totally didn't rip off... Hmm, no, I suppose there aren't..."
And don't even get me started on how your private Disneyland is definitely not the place where your 10 unpaid interns will be designing the toys in CAD for uyghurs to build somewhere in China.
What about a crunch box for someone that's maybe idk.... Like 32 or something
"This is so freaking amazing, and it‚Äôs so awesome that you‚Äôre sharing your passion for science with the world in a new way!!  Visiting this place would be a dream come true for any of your fans."
I love your channel and all the badass creations you've designed & made easy & fun to understand
KiwiCo be sweating...
I like how the piano music changes to the original music
You make a building box for kids but I think it would be fun as an adult
at my school we are learning about space and me and my freinds are doing the mars rover you madeüöó
Will you ship to Kanada?
Hlo
Great video
I want to become engineer
My passion for engineering grows every time I see a mark rober video ‚ù§Ô∏èü•π
Can we agree that we millennials are basically kids with money? And that's kind of awesome.
I will never understand who could be cool enough to beat Mark Rober in the favourite uncle contest
My dream lab üòçü§©
All the 1.2 million people interesting‚Ä¶.
I swear mark has to much time on his hands
:)
Kiwi co just got salty.
"i don't understand how he does this. he makes a video every month, but then has THIS. like when does he have the time to make a full company and huge warehouse??"
Real ones don‚Äôt flush the toilet or wash their hands
Early
"Do a carbord plan 
air fight"
First MrBeast and now Mark Rober‚Ä¶ what a crazy world we live in
do you ship in Canada?
"This is absolutely fantastic and it's no wonder why you have 22 million subscribers. You are gosh darn awesome Mark, never stop pushing science to its brink!! üíØ"
i will learn engineering just to work here.
You can see the light üí° bottom of door lol
I wanted to buy this for my daughter BUT you don't ship to Switzerland :(. Why? There's so many countries in that list...
It must be really cool te know that there Will be a entire generation of engineers that you inspired to become one. Think of all the inventions that Will be maid because the kids love your enginering thanks to you
Can you guys some day invite subscribers
omg this is so amazing i love it!!
Bro literally copied Kiwi Crate üíÄ
That was the best advertisement i‚Äôve ever seen
Nice.
"Nobody:

Mark Rober: Builds a secret room, then continues to show the entire internet where it is and how to access it. 

I love this guy."
But theirs a glow under the bookshelf exposing the secret room
A LOT more appealing compared to those american 'high class' apartments and such. Probably costs less too somehow
Here's an idea for the future my friend I suggest maybe creating the same opportunity you have for kids but for adults who lit's too like cool stuff like you build To that way the adults can have some fun as well because some adults like me who is 23 like building stuff and like a challenge and think like a kid sometimes
"oh, wow"
I would like to come because it looks so much fun lol
Mark and Marques
"words cannot describe how jealous i am this is soo cool
i feel like everyone has dreamed of their own building treehouse thing when they where little 
the nerf clean up must be a task and a half though"
The passage should not be lit until the door opens. It shows light under it giving it away in the video. Love the vids as usual!!
I used kiwico before and I broke one of the parts by accident XD
"THIS IS A SCIENCE KID DREAM,ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤"
"I have a question.
What if you life in German?"
Woooooof
so cool
Gonna be the hottest toy around
This Is Awesome
"Even though you may not in for just money., this could possibly end up placing you in the top 5 richest YouTubers with a little help from shark tank. Wishing you the very best.  Much love ‚ù§"
0:30 Of course mark is still alive because he posted.
That a lot
"I'm gonna buy it for me. I see no age restrictions there.
absolutely beautiful - 300$ / year is a real nice deal for 12 boxes."
love this guy
"""Greatest thing I've ever done? Discovering Mark Rober."""
hi
"The can see light coming in under the ""secret"" bookcase entrance....."
Great idea :)
Well it‚Äôs not secret anymore
Not so secret anymore üòè
This is literally a knockoff of the secret annex
There's so much room for ACTIVITIES!
"Yo, this Dr. Kleiner?"
Who else is wondering who is competing with him to become the favorite uncle?
The Dude Perfect of engineering
You are my inspiration to become a rocket engineer but sadly even if I got the ticket I'm on the uk
0:09 me wondering why there‚Äôs so much room with no door to get in
its been 1 month since he uploaded..
Beautiful! Outdid yourself again Mr Rober
Rob Dyrdeks fantasy factory for nerds üòÇüëçü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"ALSO, pls team up with NileRed, it would be a great collab"
So I guess the people at KiwiCo aren‚Äôt his friends anymore
"DC Got Batman with his batcave, we have Mark Rober with his secret engineering lab"
this is so cool! i wanna win the ticket lol
Just fantastic and amazing. I try to transfer your spirit to my students!
Did nile green upload to the wrong channel?
He really transitioned from science guy to trend guy
The first time I watched this video I was eating Watermelon
You‚Äôre amazing mark
Is the crunch labs available outside of the US?
Just had my DT gcse thanks for the video it helped me recover from the exam
"imagine if every teacher in schools have passion like you, the world will such a better place ..."
"You are such an awesome person, and believe me when I say that I don't give that compliment often."
bruh the light under the bookcase
"You should never use an ornament as the main lock, use it in combination or one or two other objects like a book and a switch. NOW THE CLEANING LADY CAN BUILD THE NEXT SUPER WEAPON AT THE LAB while you are at the Irish Pub drinking Jameson with yourr buddies!"
Low-key reminds me of the fantasy factory
Why do you like using watermelon so much
"So this is what you do when you have tons of money and nothing but time, eh? Must be nice."
wow
"If i had a choice to choose whom I want to be  in the next life, if there's such, it would definitely be Mark."
"""Welcome to the least secret Secret Office in the world, all 22 million of you!"""
"Mark, this is incredible! I bet you've made Mrbeast jealous."
!!!!
"All of this creativity to have a secret lab‚Ä¶. AND YOU TELL THE WHOLE WORLD. 

I hope the world will keep your secret!"
CHOPSTICKS
Honestly I would know because the bottom of the shelf is emitting white light. Kinda hard not to see.
Crunch labs is the coolest real life lab no matter what people say.
This is simply the coolest thing ever!
Ye
Aayyooo hi sacred
@marestic should be seeing it on the news in 10 years
bro is gonna build a house on the moon in like 10 years
We have to stop mark‚Ä¶ he has become to powerful.
"Love your videos And salute to you 
You are filling the new generation kids with creative ideasüí° ‚ù§"
New to your channel and simple put‚Ä¶.inspiring!
I saw a white tv
ahh yes more recruitment for the mechanicus
Hey Mark! This is a great video! Thanks for the great monthly videos. Ever since I started watching you videos I started to have a deeper connection to math science and engineering in general. Your one of the people who inspires me to be an engineer. Thank you and keep up the great vids. :D
"Mark, you should have had a Stark industries and cross out Stark and replace it with Mark"
"I am almost 50, and I want this soooo bad! üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
""
"If/when Mark retires, he will have created thousands of new engineers to replace him. This is fricking awesome."
Zombies  attack the lab. mark: uh uh uhhhhhh NERF RIVALS
This looks like DP HQ
"I think just hanging out with Mark Rober for a day would be cool, regardless of age. He just seems like a really cool guy."
Mark Rober video. All dopamine levels replenished
Kiwi co probably feels a lil betrayed after all those sponsorships
Secret rooms are every child‚Äôs dream
"Amazing space for creativity, passion, and above all...fun. Thank you for reminding everyone with every video how fun and cool science and engineering can be. Congrats on bring your dream build to fruition."
This is some bill nye the science guy stuff I love it
"I can already see the video ideas, and more mr beast collabs"
I‚Äôm a seasoned ME and even I want to build these kid toys! üëç
I‚Äôm 27 and I‚Äôm getting a crunch box. Better deliver to the uk mate!
Hope I get the platinum ticket!
The toilet one is a girl who lives with a boy‚Äôs dream
Badass
You should make a baseball bat with adjustable power levels so the minimum would be like swinging bunt and the max would be Barry bonds swing
"You gotta admire the fact that the Diet Pepsi button opens the door XD
Top notch security, like who drinks Diet Pepsi???"
this feels like a movie
Why the heck are you wearing catchers gear
"This is unbelievable!!! I can't imagine how much thought and effort was put into this massive project! Congratulations, Mark, you've built pretty much every child's dream lab :)"
Mark I never knew you liked plant vs zombies that‚Äôs the roof theme
10:53
"i really do like science, especially when things get theoretical 

.... i just dont understand any of it"
random thought you should try to work with nintendo to make more labo games
Amazing but you kinda pulled a fast one on kiwico
if you guys are ever hiring interns i‚Äôd love to just help around the shop and learn from you guys
"Idk Mark, its not that secret when the sliding door has a huge wheel at the bottom and light is visible. lol but its a childhood dream come true"
YOU CAN SEE LIGHT BENEATH THE SHELF SO ITS KINDA OBVIOUS.
Wow.
This is awesome! I love it!
one day this guy is gonna invent a literal wormhole opener
i want to go
this is something that i need to say and i want you to know mark rober that i really enjoy seeing the idea process and final product of everything if i ever meet you be prepared for my adhd mind to show every idea you could think of see you possibly
Woah ü§Ø
I love this living childhood fantasy.
I'm so happy for him üòÉüíôüíõ
This dude is actually Tony Stark.
üòé
Willy Wonka factory for engineering?  Heck yeah!
"Dude this new crunch lab thing is awesome! I hope I can get some of those! I help my dad make some wooden things, they are inventions, he isn‚Äôt a engineer, but it‚Äôs still making things, and making something cool, and functional, would be even better!"
i cant believe mark rober would resort to money laundering using an office front
if transport to san fran was possible i would prob be more likely to get this for my niece. as is.. its up in the air.
I feel like ive seen the start in my dream
Im getting some serious fantasy factory vibes. You should totally team up with rob dyrdek. He would be down to save the world with you.
This guy is one tragedy away from being a super villain
"What you are doing for children's education is amazing. I wish I had some of these kits as a child,  I would have built tf outta them."
"‚ÄúThe average person wouldn‚Äôt be able to find it.‚Äù
*proceeds to show exactly where it is*"
Very cool but I have a suspicion in future years we'll be looking back at this video in the trial as the turning point from cool fun uncle to creepy basement supervillain
Isn‚Äôt this kiwico?
"Is it your three children?

It wasn‚Äôt"
You are so awesome
not very secret mr mark.....
can you make like an adult version of crunch box üò≠
Hooooooooow
"*Secret tunnel, secret tunnel, secret secret secret secret TUNNEL*"
why just why mark
If I had the hot wheels track I‚Äôd put like 100 on and never turn it off
being Mark Robers neice or nephew would be so cool
YESS WEVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISS
When can you buy this in Denmark?
How does he know that I play soccer and the piano and I study a lot of math? ü§®
"If the secret lair is 10x bigger than the official building, I think people will notice from the outside. Also, there's a light shining under your bookshelf. :D"
"Mark, what you are doing is just so amazing!!! So humble and awesome!"
this is so cool
How would you ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem that at 6:26 we can see light underneath the secret passageway? It might be because we already know that‚Äôs the door but what if someone oblivious of the secret passageway spots light below the bookshelf?
Just turn the lights off inside the warehouse when it‚Äôs not in use?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
"Don‚Äôt Worry, Mark Said He‚Äôll Change The Lobby After Filming This Video"
"""r a package here"" - Mark Rober 6:26"
Saw that too! Integrate a small panel at he bottom that raises up when you turn the statue.
i love the Plants vs Zombies music in the background of that part
this guy needs to grow up.
gustavo fring
Imagine your in a nerf battle u jump down and the container isn‚Äôt thereüíÄüíÄüíÄ4:25
I hate to be that guy but isn't the automatic toilet seat-based door lock a fire code violation?
"I subbed on crunch labs before it hit 12k 
This is my evidence and you should do it too."
I have the monthly kiwi ko membership and it is SO cool
This is every kids dream
"Mark Rober thinks of everything. Also, Mark forgets to cover up this bright light coming in from under the bookshelf!!!!"
You should try doing a Collab with e HackSmith what you guys could create would be amazing
i‚Äôve loved science before i even watched your videos :)
Are you going to replace KiwiCo sponsoring a load of channels... Because looks remarkably similar?
wait how AREN'T you the favorite uncle??
rip kiwico
"Mark, you are officially the coolest person i can think of off the top of my head"
ha i found your secret lab
It's not a secret passageway if you tell everyone about it.
I spoke too soon aparently
You're a super hero Mark.
"Next you'll be saying that a Dorito chip invaded your mind and that you have a twin brother, who is the exact opposite of you"
This was a long advert
It‚Äôs a bat cave minus Alfred. I‚Äôm a jealous wreck.
Got it I simply won‚Äôt flush then wash my hands check and mate
"i mean honestly for someone as amazing as mark, the bookcase entrance is kinda weaksauce.  u can see the gaps around it and the light from inside the lab shines through under the shelf telling you something is behind it"
The pain of not living in the usa...
This was 2 hours ago and this video has 2 MILLION views!
"Oh wow diidnt realize he passes 20m subscribers 
congratulations"
Kiwico in shambles
that is a lot of money for someone in poland
Goofy ahh uncle
He literally created our Minecraft Secret Base in real life. Mark can do anything.
You need to obscure the light coming from behind your entrances because they don't look so secret when they glow.
That‚Äôs cool I want to go there
I know you won‚Äôt see this but I love you and everything about you I just hate puzzles like crutch lab cause I end up messing up the project like crutch lab love the idea but whould not be able to do it you are most likely the closest thing to my dream life I whould love a crutch lab warehouse like this so just wanted to say love you and all you do you are amazing all your videos make me smile
i dont even leave my room if i got this my parents would'nt se me again
"I think I speak for us all when I say that there needs to be a more adult version of the toys 

Featuring slightly more complex versions, maybe even something that gets built over time. 

Please try and make this happen"
OMG I GOT THE TICKETTT
This is beautiful
"Mark your videos are the coolest. I love your videos
 ü§©ü§ó"
"This is a cool project, if i had kids i would buy them this boxes."
I want to get one but don't wana take that chance away from some lil kid! I know that would just set their life on a whole new amazing track!
Marks voice sounds a bit different. You okay?
This is just a Minecraft mumbo jumbo house irl
"You're kind of really awesome and I really want to be like you when I grow up

thanks for this :)"
BIG W
Can I order this box even though I‚Äôm 23 üòÇ heal my inner child
This has Dude Perfect warehouse vibes
"Am I the only one who pointed his smart phone at the opened Crunch Lab box in the video to test the QR code?

BTW, my uncle is a fireman and when he refers to his piston ...."
please tell me there is a bypass and a failsafe on the no. 6 (toilet lock). Otherways someday you might find someones more than crispy remains in there if there is a fire and the power gets cut with the solenoid in the lock position.
"Glad you went with the design i described on ur original disc launcher collab vid (its just the obv design lol, not taking cred).
Whole heap of jelly, i was one of the first people to be part of the Questacon science schools, I was given a scholarship designing science demos for use in schools but promptly got hospitalised and spend 6m recovering and couldnt do it."
Can everyone just notice how he made a literal arcade out of wood?
"I know there is a very low chance anyone sees this but I have a question can people in the UK also receive boxes because I love engendering and science it‚Äôs what I have have always wanted to do and the thought of having the experience to have a full on video to learn about engineering gives me so much joy , btw
Everyone is beautiful in their own way have a nice day or night"
You are definitely my childhood hero!! ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Super cool secret door, but I'm sure you're already aware of the light peeping through the bottom of the book shelf door that is a dead giveaway. Either way this is the dream secret lab."
"I am unsure how to feel about this. On one hand, the fact that you made this to help brings forth a feeling of happiness...but also a feeling of innate FEAR. What you have done here reminds me of school. The one place I have come to look back on, not with longing, but the opposite. What this does is remind me of days I look back on with DREAD. So...why? Why do this?"
"the bright light in the under path of the shelves may be a bit of a giveaway, might need a raised floor to step over like a sealed hatch from a truck but you are probably aware of it"
Mark is actually working on automating rocket artillery out of Ukraine
He made his own version of tinker crates that used to sponsored him
Wait until I pull up with the engineering factory inside of the largest crater on Earth
You've made a Batcave.  Which makes you Batman. Which makes you my new hero.
no fair I want one!!!!
Mebeast beast like ‚Äúhold on you can‚Äôt just top me like that that‚Äôs illegal‚Äù
well done - bit pricey at ¬£20 per month though
This actually amazing
I‚Äôm happy you did a video after long time again.
"It‚Äôs nice to see ambition pay off congratulations on all your success, and thank you for using your influence to help kids see the value of science and engineering."
THIS IS MY DREAMMMMMMMMM
what if my crunch box gets porch pirates
It was better when you showed the process of construction of your cool things
"We need the host insane Collab in history, with the biggest YouTubers"
Wow
you are the best
This is probably my favorite thing on the internet. Can't wait to know more about what is going on be builded there. It's the dream ü§©
I know you will life
Too cool!  I hear Tony Stark is jealous of your lab.
I feel like someone is going to jump off the 2nd floor not noticing someone moved the foam pit. Wiley E Coyote style. :)
The thing is Mark there‚Äôs a light underneath that book shelf that people can see
"Mark Rober just casually ripping off Curiosity Box
8:25 - He pretty much says nothing like this has ever existed ........... yeah, sure buddy"
@Luminate it's Vsauce's monthly Science box
Wth is a curiousity box lol
Ok
"Yep, I don't get why he doesn't say ""there are others like this out there but here is why mine is better..."""
What is curiosity box
Mark Rober is becoming Batman
"I wish SO much that this was a thing when I was a kid, I'd 10000% have got it. I'm in England, I hope this can be distributed to the UK some how for us guys, we need it."
Well I can see some weird animations set here lol
So Mark Rober has become a Mr Beast  clone. Pretty cool I guess
Congrats this is the most insane thing you have ever built! Keep going Mark!
"2:45, how about me that is overweight? is it still gonna hold?"
@KyleNamite so like 1m?
Yes. It can handle any weight.
Am I late?
Typically when people build children's playhouses they're for children.
Wait mark must‚Äôve got inspiration from mrbeast latest vid on YouTube no doubt about it
But when is this in dutch...
What an incredible vid as always Mark!  I can‚Äôt wait to see what you have in store for us in the future!
Behind my secret door are the nuclear launch codes
i hope you get this and fly me out to meet you
Mark Robert is it true that pennies are going to be extinct soon?
"Climbers thinking ""oh... the auto belay device works the same way...."""
"Mark Rober is possibly the only person in the world who can say, ""I hid a factory in my house."""
"... it‚Äôs not his house...

it‚Äôs a warehouse"
**Laughs in John Kramer
Lolll
I mean i wouldnt be too surprised if Mr Beast did that
I would suggest that he is not the only one
"This is really great üëç,  i support the new move"
I Washington 1 602 yay
EVERY KIDS DREAM!
hi mark you inspire me to be a engenire when i grow up. My birthday is oct 12 and i am turning 12. I would love to be in one of your videos and visit the crunch lab. I would love to build things with you and even have a nerf war with you. you are my insperaishion and my and my hero.
Bruh i live in canada so even if i got a platinum thingy i wouldn't be eligible to go there
Why are you showing us this video if someone steals your items
I need to make myself one of those going down thingys
when can i move in
Kick
Mark seriously is a real life gyro gearloose.
"Team trees
Team seas 
Now: Team memes"
no love for adults?
@Demoman his product is targeted for 8-12 yo kids
Wdym
"Dang, y‚Äôall hiring?"
Mark really is a legend
He is Willy Wonka now :-D
Crunch Labs = Mark‚Äôs Clubhouse
I love that Mark is one of the only youtubers that uses the nostalgic no copyright music. Really brings me back
It's like the Fantasy Factory for engineers. Awesome!
mark you are a great person thx for everything
"Mark, build a roller coaster. That's all, you need it. EDIT: OR A ZIPLINE"
or a train with a train track build into it
mark rober is slowly turning into make it real
Instant like and comment mark rober you mad genius ü§£
This is really awesome Mark. And now I know what I'm doing for my nephews birthday
"Hi, I am your big fan. How can I get one of your engineering complects if I live in Europe, Latvia? Please answer."
This is the next Mrbeast challenge video
When is squirrel parkour coarse 3?
You just single handedly shut down kiwi-Co
i hate to be that guy but your crunch lab monthly crates are basically a copy of kiwico
small note: you can see the light under the secret entrance to the lab! you may wanna fix that in order to keep it SUPER secret! (or at least keep it in mind for when you revamp the room)
go away bot
Congrats and goodluck
HELLO
I always wonder why he always uses the plants vs zombies soundtracks
I'd be very interested to know what the max weight on that fireman's piston is.
you are the next bill nye
"I wish i could be inside that building‚Ä¶ enyways! Your knowledge is like 70% of god,s knowledge."
"Sadly, its not a secret anymore :[ BUT YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB!"
MrBeast if he was an engineer.
3:47 I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶STOLE!?
"You're awesome, Mark!"
:O
Breaking bad wishes they could.
"Gawd I wish I was a kid again to experience this shizzle. 
This would have been exactly the kinda thing I would've loved."
I signed up for the crunchlabs boxes! Im going to be a awesome uncle! Hahaha thank you
Is getting closer and closer to become either Umbrella or Ansem.
CAN I PLEASE COME WORK WITH YOU
A true engineer
My son is going to love doing this thank you Mark!!!
Should've been called the fireman's pulley
he made a 2x2 piston door in real life
Can I come and work for you?
I wish I personally knew Mark. I could chill in this epic lab and learn even more stuff than I learn from his videos. Mark's so cool!
Fireman's piston... hehe
you have one of the most awesome jobs there is. Really really cool what you do
He should try a cellar theme going underground to abrand new world
Ik I‚Äôm not gonna get it but ok :(
you scared me
So the obvious question not addressed in the video:  what happened to KiwiCo?
engineering isnt about following intructions tho
Fantasy Factory vibes ü§òüèª
He just robbed a dennys
"KInda off topic but have you ever thought about doing a ""survival science"" episode/series? Cuz earlier this week my neighborhood lost power and when I showed people in my apartment the water bottle flash light trick, a bunch of them went around setting them up to give the whole place some light"
As someone who is currently following an engineering study at university level I am really happy to see how engineering is made fun and understandable for kids these days. Great initiative and I am sure I would have loved something like this if it was there when I was twelve
GTA casino heist.
"as someone who handles money all the time, 10k is a single strap of 100s. its much smaller than that glass case."
I thought nilegreen hit you with a train
Dude! You are a freaking LEGEND!!!
"I get in my head about the state of the world these days, but then i watch one of your videos and i. Reminded how much purity there still is in the world"
Ayyy let's go
Calm down Mark.
6:26 not so secret when you can see the pathway under the bookshelf
KiviCo rip off?
"You had me at ""Nitro"" ü§ò"
"hi hi, could you make a video about the perfect way jump? like in volleyball or basketball?"
"The average person wouldn‚Äôt, but gravity falls fans would"
ok
This is Rob Dyrdek‚Äôs fantasy factory for science nerds. I love it.
Takes so much time on all his bangers much respect
I really want to go here for my birthday now!
all this stuff is so amazing and you're bringing on young Talent into the world of engineering
this was super cool :D
Would love if there was a graph behind the diving foam pit so you could use recording software to evaluate people's dives
i love the fact he makes the far side contraption. i just looked at it before watching this video
Im way too lazy to be an engineer
So what's the purpose here? To make every single person in the world as jealous as humanly possible?
whenever he makes a video it makes my day
Legend
"6:18 I did NOT expect that music, I learned that song with my friend on piano"

New Bill Nye:
Nice that even Arun was there üòÅüëç
Just make sure you cover up underneath that secret door. Or the secret entrance won't be that hard to find with all that light shining in from underneath lol. Either way it's so cool üòé
only mark could get 1 million in less then 3 hours
You should make some ‚Äúhard to build‚Äù toys for adults - wanna be engineurs
You are the one who inspires me to pursue engineering and this is amazing how big of a parcel did you have to buy but never the less you are a amazing person and keep building I want to thank you for inspiring me in managed to create a build to order cafe in my school using a converse belt and you inspired that and thank you
Mark Rovers child is gonna have the best time of his life in there
Mark went and made a better kiwi crate
Seriously cool place. Rob Dyrdek would be proud

Ps: at 3:51 is soo cute"
7:07 plants vs zombies song
Why are you always shouting?
The lab is amazing and we too are super stoked  to try the kits! Wish our neighbors were as cool.
"Aww.
Only 17 minutes? Looking forward to a monthly video kinda bites when it's such a short offering, it seems like there could've been alot of interesting things to talk about too.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Oh well it's still a üëç from me.
üòÖüëç"
This is so cool
Mark Rober is basically living our childhood dreams for us.
So uh Mark are you hiring? I'll be the janitor that totally doesn't play with all the stuff.
This is my childhood dream that i never had.
"wish all the best, maybe we need more than just Kiwico"
This is truly amazing!!
Just ordered mine. I'm gonna be 35 this year... Got my wife's permission.
Classic Mark
Colab with @Hacksmith when?
Now more then one million knows about this
Totally not seeing the light under the bookshelf
the crunch labs thing looks so fun i might even quit doing kiwico
"> ""Sir, i need 3 of those crunch boxes""
- ""ok. Cool, your kids are going to be very happy!""

> ""Yeah... My kids..."""
"This is like Fantasy Factory, except for science!"
Loving engineering is great until you go to college and get hit with the worst professors and workload and lose all passion for it üôÉ
Man‚Äôs doing red stone in real life
"Thank you. You don‚Äôt know how much this means to my son, whose school does not have enough engineering-type lessons."
And now you are the engineering Willy Wonka

You are a true legend Mark would love to see you in NZ some time bro lol keep up your truly awesome work
Love the videos
"Yup, totally not jealous."
bruh the ball went threw the wall 0:33
"Honestly, congratulations and thank you for doing such an amazing program. I can not wait to see the generation you are inspiring comes up with."
instead of normal hotwheels . you should put a regenerative led diode using wheel turn as energy so that when you launch several hotwheels it will all look like beeps of led from far away showing where they are LOL
"Mark i think we all know that there is such a small chance to get the box with the invitation, so mabey you could do somting else to get the invitation like somting a bit more fair."
this is why we love you mark
You took kiwi co.'s Idea and mad it better. :)
self indulgent nonsense.
"Correction you,v just told 22 million people"
Mark Rober everyone. The leading cause of feeling like a kid again‚Ä¶
the videos from the box includes subtitles or audio on spanish??
kiwico?
Yo
What a legend!
Very cool marky

Luckily I had a normal upbringing since half the stuff was potent enough to either blowup, poison or irradiate half the town I lived in."
"Let's make a secret lab nobody will never find. . .


Now let's show everybody so that they could find it"
"Yes! i play ultimate frisbee all the time and on a team, and i‚Äôm so glad it got the recognition it deserves! Thank you Mark, and congratulations on the dream warehouse."
The intro ks so crazy it sounds like mr greens parodies
What if you created a prank test tube that when you use it self destructed
Wow it's only been 2 hours and he has 5.8 k comments

Where is the pool
"This is like DPHQ2 and the Fantasy Factory had a baby. This is engineering heaven on earth. Congrats on the achievement and the launch of the box, Mark!"

Simply keep it going mark! Stay great as Always
Neat
The light that shows from under the bookcase kinda gives away that there is something behind it. That or there is a lighting system under the lip of the book case.
Hello
Rober's fantasy factory
"Awesome!!! But after buying all those kits and getting gear badges, we just get some connecting gears in the shape of a rectangle? I was hoping for something a little more awesome - maybe a giant fighting robot that's a combination of all the other kits? ;-)"

"As someone who wants to go into engineering, one of my biggest worries is that I started too late and don‚Äôt have the knack for it that you would get at a younger age and so, I think it‚Äôs great that kids nowadays have opportunities like this to foster their creativity and love for engineering and science at a young age, you are truly an inspiration for the next generation mark"
"I started uni at 26, i‚Äôm going for 8 years to get a masters in engineering, i know its not /that/ late, but there are older people on my course, it really is never too late, you got this buddy, i believe in you!"
"It‚Äôs never too late to start it!! A lot of my fellow students in engineering school had a lot less hands on experience then me, but the curriculum is designed so that anyone can learn. Focus on learning lots of math while you can, it‚Äôs the hardest part of engineering in my opinion."
But do you have a working tardis?

Dang. Someone is a glass half empty kinda guy üò¨
"Yep, this is very secretive, only a million people know about it"

In the office through the secret door you can kind of see a light shinning through
kinda hard to go there when your on the other side of the frickin planet :P
"Mark seriously has one of the most entertaining and most interesting channels on this platform, and it makes me want to try making things even though I've never engineered anything in my life before."

"""The average human will never find the secret entrance!""

...Well, they will now, since you showed it to everybody."
"Mark, is it possible for you to make an engine run on water? It'd almost be like a better tesla"
show us where the oompah loompahs sleep
That's a lot of light coming from underneath that totally normal bookshelf. üëÄ
"I kinda miss when Mark‚Äôs vids were actually experienced difficult engineering projects and not targeting 5-10 year olds‚Ä¶ 

I understand that‚Äôs the target, but I hate calling 10 year olds engineers because only <1% of them will actually have the competence to become a true engineer. It‚Äôs not as easy as following tutorials and putting gears together.

That said, Mark has done great things for the community and I have the utmost respect for him, but Ill have to stick to the Stuff Made Here guy for the WOW factor."
Video idea: rubik's cube robot vs fastest rubik's cube solver human

"awesome, but the toilet seat thing sounds like a fire hazard"
"Wow I Just Want To See The Foam Pit, The Nerf Guns, The Glitterbombs, And So On"
Wooooo
"That is every child‚Äôs dream

I want it NOW"
mr beast said he hates you because if you cared about natrue you would plant 100 trees
this Crunchlabs programm sounds amazinv. too bad it doesn't ship to my country. but its cool anyways
secret passages are basically useless but i want one just cause its cool.
One of those twirly chairs was at this museum I went to
Really makes me wish I was a kid again.
That was perhaps the most nonchalant Marques Brownlee cameo I've ever seen
"Mark, I am a senior citizen, twice your age, and I want to thank you for the joy that your videos give. I think the greatest thing you do is show young people how to live... how to contribute... how limitless their futures are... how to be a great Dad (LOVED the video with your son)... and how to have passion to make the world a better place through engineering.  I couldn't make the grade, nor the tuition, back in ""my day,"" so I chose a different path of service, but never lost my passion to create.  Even now, in my little retiree's workshop (about a 100th the size of yours!) I still fabricate solutions to problems and generate gifts for friends and family. I hope to do this to my last day. You are a credit to your wonderful Mom whom you lost WAY too soon; to that awesome son of yours who uses his talents to bring joy to others; and I suspect even Fat Gus admires your engineering prowess as he thwarts your efforts with his intellect superior to mine, anyway! All the Best and With Respect, Richard A."
Keep it up Richard :) You are a true fan :)
"You sounds like just the type of guy I wanna be when I‚Äôm older, creating and design new things when I‚Äôm retired and watching YouTube!"
"This comment really made me smile. Keep going, Richard!"
This comment should be pinned.

Utc Plymouth uk engineering school
That's so very sweet mark. I appreciate you taking the time to make learning fun. So many kids will appreciate this. Keep it up! :)
"Mark Rober, you wholesome son of a gun you!"
I am always so excited when you post a new video! You are so amazing! Thank you so much for amazing content!
So awesome for kids!
It cost too much
With every upload Mark is beginning to become more like Mr.Beast
"Would you consider doing some more advanced engineering kits? I‚Äôve always wanted to build a drone with a camera from scratch and code it. Although i know I‚Äôd learn lots of new things from the kits you are about to release, i feel many older, aspiring engineers would advance from this stage fairly quickly. I reckon there are lots of others who would also love to buy more advanced sets. Thanks Mark!"
+1
"Heck yea, a teen-adult box line at some point would be super sweet! I like your idea as a first. (Same desire here, and tiny high res cameras are cheap now, drone doesnt have to be anything special at all, the principles and building is the important part of course)"
@NevFN just say on the box supply your own ‚Äúthis model‚Äù arduino.
He can‚Äôt really do it unless he creates a rip off arduino and sells it
"@Ahdok I would imagine that at first, a kit would come once every 2-3 months as they would be intricately designed and would take longer to build. Even 1 or 2 advanced builds would be an incredible start for adults to get into engineering. I‚Äôve considered becoming an engineer myself recently but I don‚Äôt know many places that i can start. I think the best way would be to dive into a practical build to experience engineering first hand!"
Mark fr must be an amazing Dad
This looks straight out of parks and recreation. Do you need someone to do the paperwork?
if i won i would have mark make hanzos bouncing arrows :D
It‚Äôs looks like it is from a movie set
Great üí° ideas
Mr beast already did Willy wonka. Please don‚Äôt stop on that line fam lol
"Smiling, thank you and have a great month."
I feel like nobody who watches him know what he is saying when he is talking about engineer üòÇ
Why don't I just touch the sink and not wash my hands
"I like the idea.. But honestly there is a huge gap at the bottom where you can see the light coming from the other side of the ""Secret doorway"".  An engineer must have a solution for that!?"
Do grandmas qualify?
Mark makes the best vidos ever! It‚Äôs amazing
Holy moley!!!! The best and greatest place on earth if you ask me !!! That‚Äôs amazing!
"now which toy would you like ""yes"""
that looks like corridor digitals office too
so cool! are you going to translate the videos and explanations of your crunchlabs boxes in french? and sell it in Europe? thanks!
Stark?
The new Minecraft update looks great
today must've been a very sad day at the KiwiCo office
You're truly living the dream! Congrats on building your next-level mad scientist's lab. Can't wait to see what amazing builds come out of this!
Well it's not secret anymore now is it
"I'm a simple men, I see Marques I like"
"Sorry if this is already answered, but is there a lower limit of age for your course?"
"I love your ideology to engineering, because u live out all your child fantasies"

"uh, .. mmm,..  not sure how to break this to you.... But you are not supposed to use your hands when you go down a fireman's pole."
Hey mark I‚Äôve been watching ur channel for a while I am about to build a diy fan but do you deliver to canada
"Ordered a year!  Thanks Mark!  My 5 year boy is my mini-me, he is gonna love this!"
You just edged out Whistlin Diesel for best warehouse.
Is Mars Rover teaching kids how to build a road side IED with tripwire?
so mark has like 500 friends? or does the word not mean anything to americans?
Are you time traveling back from movie idiocracy? Finally! Lets make kids think!
Its official guys... Mark Rober is Batman
this is amazing i have ben waching you for 2 years so this is just unblevibelüòâüòâüòâ

That lab is one of the coolest and most inspirational thing to do with a warehouse. Can't wait to see your adventures!
drug lab
This is super cool! I kind of want to make my own fantasy factory when im older.
"I feel like there are only a few people interested in doing this sort of thing, because a lot if people are so engrossed in video games. I'm happy there are other people that are genuinely interested in this sort of thing."
What if he stayed with NASA youtube would not be the same in my opinion.
this is amazing

I feel like this is the end of an era and the beginning of a new one
what if he missed the foam pit?
I want to be a kid again to get the Crunch Lab Box-and Im 56. Love this for kids!!!
I think I was I was the 1M view omg OMG
so no more kiwiko sponsors
Yes
Would makes sense
I agree
Yes
Impressive. I wonder what videos will come out of this
"If there is not a full video coming of a full-on Nerf war, I quit happy"
This is so dope bro congrats
"Mark, your so darn epic. I love your content your brain your desire to create teach and share. Top tier youtube content. Pura Vida"
I hope anthony can have a ticket
try the tennis ball launcher on a nokia phone
"Hey Mark! Protip: the 6 dart revolvers can be *very* quickly fired if you hold the trigger button and pull back the slider very quickly. If you can stuff more than 6 darts into a single cylinder, it could be a devastating high for rate pistol, as well as really lightweight and accurate"
Mark you are absolutely the best guy ever! I love your videos but your cause is even more admirable.  Awesome job and congratulations on the endeavor and I looked forward to seeing this grow!
Hey mark I‚Äôm an orphan and if you need a son like uh just maybe umm if u want a son like‚Ä¶üëâüëàü•π

All of this stuff is so cool Mark! I can't imagine all of the work that led into this stage - keep working on your lab and inventions!
This guy is amazing
You are a genius with a giant ‚ù§Ô∏è
I loved this video its so cool that u made something like this
Did he just invent Kiwico? ü§î
"It's only years later that the kids will realise what it takes to be an engineer when they will get to learn probability, statistic, linear algebra and Calculus...."
Is this international? / do u ship to the Netherlands
Or the bright light shines from under the bookshelf
"Mark is BY FAR the most entertaining engineer of all time! Not only that, but this guy just straight up listens to his audience. Great job Mark!"
Very cool i love the lab it looks awesome

it would be cool if you made tunnels in the walls then a room that you can only access thru the tunnels!!!
the question for crunch labs is could i use honey with it
This is like the best shark tank !
I love your videos
I feel like his vids are so famous that under a million views and under 3hours is still a valid accomplishment lmao.
"this has to be one of the coolest things i‚Äôve seen on this platform, it feels like you‚Äôre living a literal dream inspired from dozens of movies and shows almost like it‚Äôs nearly impossible to think this could actually happen to yourself. it‚Äôs kinda sad but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
My guy became a salesman
omg wow this would be my dream house (if it was a house) lots of creativity put into it. Very impressed

mf got the whole rick & morty garage
You are an amazing human. Wishing you the best.
small note: you can see the light under the secret entrance to the lab! you may wanna fix that in order to keep it SUPER secret! (or at least keep it in mind for when you revamp the room)
Pfp Bot
AH! You just told us how to enter!
"Mark, you made being a kid FUN AGAIN (even for us
adults)...i really appreciate you..you are a real life modern day Willy Wonka."

"I like how @ 6:26 you can see light underneath the bookshelf, indicating that there is something behind it.ü§î Overall great video and SWEET warehouse!"
POV: you cant keep up with the first commenters

What‚Äôs the difference between the $24 and $27 boxes though? Doesn‚Äôt really say on the site
"I‚Äôve been asked about what I want to study in collage, I‚Äôm a freshman next year and even my younger sister in 7th grade knows what she wants to do, watching these videos, I might want to study engineering."
Hi
"Crunch labs is great, but RIP Kiwico."
This one kinda pogg tho
"I am so excited for everything coming in the future, I am 16 and I lovee engineering, science, and ect behind everything, I am so stoked for the new Crunch Lab boxes !!!!"
Just be sure to check and make sure the foam pit is in place *BEFORE* you jump. üòÇ

That‚Äôs where he makes meth with Walter white.
i don t understand why the girls aren t rouning after you!!!
EPIC
not secret anymore‚Ä¶
yes
OMG
mark whenever i see a new video by you i gasp and grab a bowl of popcorn
Dude you truly are a creative gift to humanity!!üòéüòé
mark is litterly a real life tony stark
"Can't wait to come visit your home! At night, alone, while you are sleeping."
I got a patent I‚Äôve been trying to build I already know what I need to do it‚Äôs huge if I can get if off the ground could use some advice
So crunchlabs is basicly export valorisation against kiwiko?
This gave me goosebumps
"Cant order from Switzerland, im so sad ;("
I love this idea so much. I only wish there was a box for people who are interested in engineering but aren't kids anymore. Congratulations on the launch and major props for all the years of hard work that you've put into this and everything else you do.
"So in other words, if I DON'T flush, and DON'T wash my hands, the alarm won't go off?"
Hopefully he doesn't copy the boxes from the existing one. That would be a scandal.
early
Just like every minecraft world i have
You are an AMAZING human being! I love your videos and I love how generous you are. So nice to see someone trying to pass on the passion for engineering. Keep up the great work!
This isn't real. You cannot convince me this is real. This stuff doesn't happen in real life.
"Absolutely love it, however you can see light from underneath the bookcase"
How often do you use calculus as an engineer?
"Me who thought he did all of his videos in his garage: I‚Äôve been tricked, backstabbed and  quite possibly bamboozled"

"Awesome Mr Rober, all the best with your venture!"
"9:10 It's fascinating how extremely wholesome yet violent his inventions tend to be, I love it!"
I like parent who don't know his kids age 8 or 12 lol
yeah xd
thats just epic. I have nothing more to say
"watch out kiwi co, you got some competition coming your way"
Is this only for Kids? Asking for a friend.
Make giant anong us
O-O
Immediately placed an order for crunch labs. I can't wait to do these projects with my kids.
Can‚Äôt wait for you to do another collab with dude perfect! You should show them this place!
Sofa king cool.  Would love to know how much it cost to set all that up!
the PvZ music for the secret entrance part
Mark I think if you found any cross crunch labs you could post with them and or explain how to combine certain sets but have them figure it out after it happens like 5 qr codes come with these fore mentioned
Forgot to mention but thank you for making this videos
This guy's the best
You're totally awesome üòÅ
I need all these toys
This is so amazing. Keep up the amazing content.
What about the massive amount of bright light coming from under the book shelf?
But i use ¬£ instead of $ so how do i change and how is the delivery gonna work??
wow. I‚Äôd love that lol
What‚Äôs wrong with you
You should do a collaboration with Elon musk!
Wow that package is really cool! Amazing way to connect with the young.

"brooo you should hav caled it Crunch Works like the legendary lockheed martin Skunk Works.
thb it was a mised opportunity"

Why mark rober doesn‚Äôt wear his wedding band anymore is he divorced ?
My parents say no so even if I buy one and get the ticket I can't go
Gotta make sure to have a sign to indicate whether  the foam pit is under the balcony or not lol
Okay
someone give this guy a TV show already!!!!! (he has probably already turned down some offers)
crunchy
Huge fan of your content and love the new lab. Did not love the audio throughout this video though. Mix of your yelling and maybe bad mics? Made it sort of hard to watch
Can you buy tickets
mark is the only person on youtube that can make me watch an advertisement
"This is THE best thing you ever made, well you did put a robot on Mars, but still I think this is way cooler"
It isn't so secret anymore now you told all of us about it...
This the coolest
This why no uploud ?
"9:38 Mark you could've snuck a rickroll in there, come on such a missed opportunity, smh. (btw, love your content =D)"
Bro that looks so amazing!
Every kid's dream
I wish I could work there lol
"Please make a phone where if it‚Äôs yours it senses that it‚Äôs yours when you pick it up but when anyone else touches it it turns off and makes an alarm sound 
That‚Äôs probably impossible to make but I am 12 and still have an imagination which I can‚Äôt control"
This is such a Mark Rober thing to do and it's glorious
my guy got a Rob Dyrdek Fantasy Factory
I have a bad feeling that mark  is gonna turn out like Zach king ( but better )
"Well now it's not so secret, dammit Mark"
What a wonderful idea. Make learning engineering principles fun and exciting for kids and they will WANT to learn more
Ok dexter
I can only see entertainment. Not enough engineering
You uploaded this on my birthday and ill take it as a present. Couldnt have been a better present.
This is perfect I need one of these. This is my dream
"Coolest thing ever dude. I cant imagine how stoked you are! Congrats on the success, you earned it!"
so mark if i find the entrance in public can i just stroll in?
how long has Nitro been trapped in there? He looks so much older now
"Mark: *shows the CrunchLab Build Box*

"That's a fantastic idea, I am not in that field, but if 1 in every ten thousand people decided to demonstrate the generosity you two practice , the world would be a better place!"
Alan is here?
"@High Definition no disrespect to you, but if you study animation a bit and try it, you'll see how intracate and technical it is. Just like engineering, it can be as simple or complicated as you make it. Is a bouncing ball as complicated as making a statue of liberty? No. But how do you get a full sequence of animation assembled and distributed to other people? You'll need some pretty crazy engineering to get there. Animation is every bit as complex as these kits will be."
Yes! you should!
"""Shout out to drone operator btw"""
You are my hero...

Hey

you had every oportunity to make it a gold ticket. smh
i wish that you could hire other engineers to work at crunch labs

"I'm going to get roasted in the comments but... Mark, could you please consider using more inclusive language in your videos?

Just like in Gravity falls."
"I don‚Äôt know how to say this other than ‚ÄúCongrats!‚Äù. You‚Äôve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it‚Äôs so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."
@BW we dont care
Seen it coming since99 the womb wont leave a clue then stomp with the baby shoes
"@BW It‚Äôs a freaking bot, tryna protect it?"
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this of Mark.
mark rober gives me hope in life
how you can come out here to build with my team and i*.
"back when he was working with NASA:

So Mr Rober, what do you plan on doing when you are done here ?

-Be Awesome, natrually."
THIS IS AWESOMEEE!!!!
what about kiwi co seems a little similar
Meh...
"by the way, go checkout  infinitelegend657, btw I'm Dominic's sister :D"
Omg Mark this video made me cry. My favorite job I've ever had was when I was in college. And it was being a teacher/curriculum developer for a program called SPICE. Science Program to Inspire Creativity and Excellence. They would do summer programs and outreach activities to make science fun and engaging specifically for middle schoolers (that's when the biggest drop in interest for girls is). And I LOVED making science interactive and exciting for young minds. Nothing is more rewarding.
"At this point, Mark is really looking like Batman.

Think about it, he brings criminals to justice, he makes a ton of gadgets, and we now know that he has a secret base."
There is no word to represent how jealous I am of this lab! Great job!
Another great video. Always love seeing the things you come up with.
Did the items from the benefit ever go out?
RIP THE WATERMELON
"It's bad , i just see the rules ... A french ou belgium can not win ... Realy it's more sad than bad , but i m angry , why we can never have a chance ?"
You should make a robot that fishes automatically with sensors
Let‚Äôs go!! He posted!!!
RIP Kiwi Co
"Thankful that Mark Rober isn't planning to take over the world, mad scientist style.
OR IS HE!?

First toothpaste, then squirrels, then porch pirates, then scammer mobs, ... and now he's got a LAIR!
How will he continue to outdo each previous video!?"
This is the most Mark Rober thing I have ever seen.
PLEASE DO SQUIRREL MAZE 3
Finally he was made a new video
How after the 2 months
how is your box different than KiwiCo's boxes for older kids?
"My oldest kid isn't even 2 but I'm thinking about getting this for myself - er uh... my son, anyways. Cmooooon platinum ticket!"
That mkbhd jump was something else
This place gives me MAJOR Rob Dyrdek Fantasy Factory vibes.
Mark Roper! I hereby nominate you the Bill Nye Science Guy Award for promoting STEM and making science cool and fun again.
"OMG, kids are so lucky these days. I CRAVED this sort of thing existed 40 years ago...."
this is giving me james bond vibes
The Platinum Ticket is like the Golden Ticket from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

Bro outdid the batcave
"if mark hasn't won the best uncle award, i dont know who has."
That makes me wish I was 10 again ...
I'm such a big fan!
Yoo that‚Äôs so cool. Also 5432 comment
This door locking toilet seat contraption sounds like firehazard/lawsuit written all over it... other than that.. :thumbsup:
WHERE IS SQUIRREL MAZE 3.0?
I bet Elon musk would be interested in working with you since you find the easiest way to make easy even easier
Who knew the real life Willy Wonka would turn out to be an engineer.
I love all the frisbee I recently got into ultimate frisbee and I love it I love all the physics about frisbees that you were teaching as well
Why are there no valance in your videos?
Best secret
Oh my gosh this is AWESOMEEEE
Well it‚Äôs not a secret anymore considering he showed us
why?
how much kinetic energy does that tennis ball cannon discharge at full power?
Yay a brand new video:)
"thats it, imma work as a mailman so i can get inside :D
best strategi ever guys"
The fireman Pheumatics pole is actually cool
It feels so strange with a mr beast style intro but it kinda works
"The design of the warehouse tho, it's amazing!"
Literally what every kid dreams of. I love your videos Mark! Both educational and entertaining
bro just entered the wizarding world
"1,000th"
Kinda sad that it‚Äôs not available in India üò¢

don't Forget to crunch the numbers
Yes
Well I know what my kids getting after he finishes his kiwico!
So this is where you keep Nilegreen prisoner.
"just ganna say, nice place wish i could have a place like that"
"This is so amazing, I love how Mark has an idea, and can make it become a reality!"
No more kiwi co sponsores
If only I could afford it :')
Mark can you solve the Rubik‚Äôs cube?
"Mark: **has a nerf wall**
Corridor: rookie numbers"
"Ah yes, an office in front of an inconspicuous massive warehouse. Nobody would know it‚Äôs there!"
"Hi Mark, not sure if u will see this message but here goes. I sent you an email to business email on the 23rd of May regarding you possibly visiting Barbados. still anxiously awaiting your response."
"Do you think think you'd ever end up making boxes for an ""older"" audience? I would love to learn to wire basic things and make fun little gadgets"
You better watch out for your sister Deedee and her attempts to infiltrate your secret laboratory.
Mark Rober's version of Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory
Everyone gets knocked down sometimes; only people like you get back up again and keep going.
This is amazing u should make these around the world so crunch labs can be global
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS MARK ROBER!!!
Da best
Shout out to AG Nitro. When i was a kid we had a dog named after you.

I bet KiwiCo feels very betrayed by Mark ü§£
I was looking for more comments like this lmao
10:34 thanks for caring!
Absolutely incredible! Well done Mark Rober! Greetings from Germany!
"uncle mark and father elon, unstoppable ü´£üî•"
The first Crunchlabs kit looks amazing! Even as a young adult I kind of wanna buy it for myself ü§îüòÅ
this is just kiwico
"are you taking tours by any chance
hmm knowing my luck i will never get it hmm how much to i have to give to team seas to get in jk"
When a person sees this video: The dentist why is that dude touching our stuff and moving them around.
Seeing mark Rober doing all this stuff for kids warms my heart
"Hi i know  i dident get the ticket in all but i was wondering if u could make a dog car like a car that my dig could press a button like on off go stop i think that would be cool and i think my mom would like that bc her berth day  day is soon 


Ty if u do it"
"If you hadn't been one before, this project would cement you as a STEM hero, Mark. Well, well done! I am continually impressed by everything I've seen you do."
He is making so many future Engineers that will progress our future. A true legend.
Well done!

Instead of a Fireman‚Äôs pole you have a Rober rope
I love the tribute to Mr beast most current video... Willy Wonka factory for engineering!
this might be the coolest thing I have ever seen
"I am speechless... Just amazing... Hopfully these things will be still available when i have kids...

If every child could use these builds this world would be like a 5000% better place. Please keep going with your ideas"
Love your show... keeps my mind young

Kiwico shaking in their boots
$465 incl shipping and taxes is a bit too much for 12 boxes...
why would you tell us
This is incredible! I was just wondering how to help my son be ok with failing sometimes he always gets so discouraged when stuff doesn't work out the first time even with his mother and I cheering him on it breaks my heart because he is such a smart kid...these construction sets could be just what he needs to get past his lack of confidence
"If you're not failing at something, you're not trying hard enough. Failing is part of it. You know, if you're not trying hard enough to even fail then I think you're in trouble... because that, you know, teaches you more.  - Johnny Knoxville 

If you never fail it means you're not pushing the boundaries of what you are capable of."
Reminds me of Dexter's Laboratory
No doubt mark rober is on touchable in his ideas
omg a selectric to guard the secret lab!!
I‚Äôd love to meet mark rober
Things you do when your majority viewers are children.
"*Not much of a secret, mark.*"
Wait a minute. Have I been watching a kids channel this whole time?
3:07
This is so cool.
Mark just made a step by step guide on how to break into his warehouse
Wouldn‚Äôt somebody wonder why there‚Äôs a factory next to an offfice that isn‚Äôt being used?
I have been waiting years to get a chance to meet a youtuber I really like. I now have a chance but I probably wont win so thats really sad.
Wow
This is like secret bookshelf door but times a million üòéüòéüòé

The Tennis Ball Cannon is perfect for Jackass
Mans just ditched his sponsor and made his own
Sickest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Unlocking a secret entrance in video games be like
"Mark Rober: builds insane warehouse
MrBeast: can I buy this for 10 million dollars?"
Love the plants vs zombies background music
The eagle was a nice shot
me who now knows how to enter: time to speedrun getting a ups job
"Dude, come oooon. This is literally something every kid reams to be in at least once, no to say own one."
"This is quite literally, my dream. It looks like heaven to me!"
im on the day that it was posted
this entire concept is a literal dream come true
Amazingüëç
I wish my uncle was an engineer
This is awesome! Though if you want your next secret passage to really stay secret you might want to consider attaching a felt mat or something similar to the underside of the bookcase (or whatever else it might be in the future). At 6:26 you can clearly see light under the bookcase.
I'm not an average person but I'm below a average person
"I'm not a kid but you inspire me a LOT!
When I was a child I wanted to be an engineer without really knowing what I wanted to be an engineer. 
Now I'm a bit frustrated to see that it may not be possible anymore. Anyway, I enjoy watching your videos and imagining that one day I will be able to do something like this..."
"@Mark Rober so with this platinum ticket thing, will it be an all inclusive trip? some families can't afford the flights"
"The ""amazing collab that mrwhosetheboss talked about in his last vid is with mark robber.

How much for a little space.
It‚Äôs amazing mark and I live the crunch lab ideas and I know the market is crazy but dk you think you could figure out a way to sell them individually so it‚Äôs easier and more affordable. Thanks mark!
"I literally watched the whole video without even clicking on it, yk what I'm taking about.
This is the true power of dedication shown Mark :)
Really enjoyed your video <3"
Then we stole... Wait what.......
I should have done engineering instead of Computer networking. Engineers have all the fun
There is light shining from beneath the bookcase. Oops!
"Hi mark!
I have been watching your vids for more than one year
I have loved engineering for my whole life and will like to go to college at Virginia tech for it‚Äôs engineering

Absolutely Amazing üëèüèº
Grunkle Stan would be proud
"Wow. Seriously excellent. Honestly, I‚Äôve come to expect nothing less than effort of this caliber from Mark and his crew. You guys seriously knock it out of the park every video! Your product will be an absolute hit, I‚Äôm certain. The lab was amazing as well! Always look forward to more videos from you! Exemplary work, everyone! +1"
can you make a car
I love what you do keep it up mark
What did you do in the fome pitt Mark?! MARK!!!
11:08 i laughed when i realised it was a claymore
"I think you should make another way down using copper and neodymium magnets! Then, after that, engineer that very system to incorporate it into high rise buildings as an emergency fire escape..."
this is so freakin cool. Wish i could live there.
You are by far the coolest person I have ever seen
AWSOME
Mark you need to make a pet grooming invention I beg
"(this is a joke)

you too can pay $30 a year for monthly uploads!"

It‚Äôs not fun if you can‚Äôt share it with friends
I wish I could come but my family does not have enough money to afford the boxes every month
"Me when I saw this: ""Ohhhhhhhh Myyyyyyyy Goshhhhhhhhhh Duuuuuuude"""
Mark is just living out all my childhood dreams. I'm so jealous.
"A‚Ä¶Warehouse‚Ä¶
You had the ability to do all this, and you didn‚Äôt make your own Batcave?!?! Dude‚Ä¶"
Me watching the video and in my head thinking ‚ÄúBILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY!‚Äù
How much did that cost? How much WOULD it have cost if you weren't a rockstar engineer? Asking for a friend who also wants their own bat cave. The friend is me.
The real life tony stark does it again
"please

6:19 they really got the plants vs zombies music
That‚Äôs awesome!
I want to know what the other uncles do if Mark is still on a quest to become the favorite one
I love that he still kept the desk
Bold to assume that a person who doesnt wash there hands will flush the toilet.
"Oh, this is so amazing!"
You just showed how to enter the secret lab now criminal might break in
"You've just made both my childhood and grown-up dream come true, thank you. I find myself having an ear-to-ear smile while watching this video. Thank you."
mark is literally the best
When you make a secret base in a minecraft single player world‚Ä¶
Now I see why he didn't post for so long... To make Literally the coolest thing i've ever seen!
5:46 So now I'm not going to flush either.
"This was so amazing, but sadly I don‚Äôt have money so guess I can‚Äôt buy the boxes"
Anna Frank style
"This made me have big Gravity Falls flashbacks, and it makes sense for this to happen 10 years after the show first aired lol"
Nice
"To hit that target with the tennis ball, just ramp up the pressure to 100% and it will go pretty straight. The question is if you hit the bullseye but the ball goes through the wall... does it count?"
"@Skorp It won't go straight, but what I meant was the parabola was going to be quite wide"
"Well, the ball is spinning. It won't go straight, look up the Magnus Effect :)"
i mean why not hit it pressure or not its still hitting it
"Nope, he said it had to go down the tube too (15:18)"
E
The quality of Mark Rober's videos are amazing. So well thought through.
Mark is the uncle every kid would want.
He literally made what I do in Minecraft.
Awsome!
lol cept that you can CLEARLY see the light coming from under the bookshelf entrance. This is definitely awesome though
"Two Marks in one room and a Far Side reference, lovely"

Yo secret agent Mark when?
"this is so great mark!!! i love watching your videos! and this looks so awesome! i e always wanted my own secret ""base"" and you've inspired me even more to try them some day"
This is a really cool video
Shut up and take my money!
This is just a giant advertisement targeted towards kids. Is it legal to advertise like that to kids without disclosing it?
"This is amazing, I've always wanted my own space but this takes the cake. I am truly inspired by you and your videos and I can't wait to start the crunch labs course!!"
why do you have a limited supply of single months
I watched all you're videos
is this the nitrous circus warehouse? it looks great Mark
"If Mark is not the favorite uncle, I really want to meet his brother(s)"
"We can see light under the bookcases ..... It means it is really obvious , you need to fix that  :)"
Mark Rober will be a billionaire someday.
"I love your videos, I have been watching them since I was 10 and now I am 12, You've inspired me to become an engineer and work at NASA when I grow up and I thank you for that. It's has been my dream to meet you, all your videos are amazing and incredible, and you keep me interested and excited for what comes next, every time you post a video I stop what I'm doing and watch it, and every time, it was worth the time. Once again, I love your videos and hope to be an engineer one day.

P.S. I noticed that your terms and service says ""NO PURCHASE NECESSARY"", so I decided I am going to do my best to understand the method on how to do this by following the rules to the best of my extent, it would be my dream if this actually works."
Is it OK to buy this for someone in their 20s? Asking for a friend.

This seems like the same thing as Kiwi co boxes.
"No offense i think this is cool and a job well done, but would it be fair to say this is in competition with kiwi co and their boxes?"
You know it goes fast when it turns kenetic energy into warmth energy‚Ä¶
Mark may i please get a shout out for my sister she is Such a big fan
This gives off the same energy as playing minecraft and building a gigantic complex Redstone base in a single-player world
The warehouse is literally every kids dream! üòÑ
its jsut amazing to see how happy he is showing us these things
epic.  keep up the amazing work
Dude.
Dear mark love your videos and I was hoping you could make a Narnia wardrobe that only opens when you take out a coat pls make because I haven‚Äôt got enough money or time
I like it... But what happened to squirrel warrior.
"This was cool, but it did kinda feel a little off, probably cos it was an advertisement"
Nice selectric typewriter on the front desk there
CRUNCH LABS SUPREME
"Sweet, its awesome you are encouraging the next generation to have critical thinking skills in such a easy way, if everyone had these skills our world would be so much better, and cooler!"
"Was about to order, but.. why no shipping to Norway?"
This is like an engineer wonderland
AWESOME!! Kinda like Dexter's Laboratory!! ( only better) üòÄ‚úå...(WAY BETTER!)
"This has now become my dream as well.


Thank you Mark"
LOVE IT!
"maybe you could do something with the light leak under the book shelf... it kinda gives the secret away.   this is amazing, ill bet the kids love it!!"
"I would love it if there could be a more advanced course, even if it doesnt come with a package. I would love to understand and expand my knowledge."
Tell me you've got too much money without telling me you've got too much money................
"honestly, turning a statue or pulling a book and something moving is my dream."
"Mark, you're absolutely awesome. Sounds like years of working with KiwiCo inspired you a lil bit here ;)
The new warehouse has gotta be the coolest workspace I've seen, looks like a fun place tom spend a day! :D"
"@Sudhanshu Gupta *ahem*
This is a bot comment"
"Cool but,
Why all the Green Screen though?"
"You big, derpy, wonderful child!"
I love you're videos
this guy just living the dream <3
Mark is the next MJ.
"When Mark Rober uploads, it doesnt matter where we are or what we're doing. We all immediately watch!!"
Gravity Falls anniversary coincidence?
Cool
Me going to my minecraft base 0:11
14:38 don‚Äôt you mean flying colors? I think that joke would land!
It will be great to see some cool collabs with YouTube creators at this place.
Your lab is so cool love all the little secret details and pathways. Crunch labs seems so fun.
"That's better than going to the chocolate factory...well almost... :)
Sound engineering Mark...!"
please
That‚Äôs what Anne Frank said
Crunch Labs has got to be the best thing on the internet I have ever seen!
No Mr. Rober isn't paying me for my comment.  I mean unless he really wants to.  I prefer the trip to the lab!
can I meat you some day
I live in Sweden and if i win waht Will hapen then
Hi
Not so secret if you were to tell more than 10 million people üòÇ
Not sure if the coke banner by the secret entrance was on purpose but I like the hint.
Mark Rober is the best hands down
im you're #1 fan
Real engineer challenge: make yourself those toys with your kids
Is it just me or does his voice sound different
He is flexing on bill gates
Wow. This is like every child's dream.
Finally a video! It feels like a trillion years since the talking piano video! Huge fan!
Isnt the crunchy box basicly the same as the kiwico box?
"Only Mark Rober....

Wait, is this Dexter's Laboratory? Like his ADULT laboratory!"
I was crying because I might never see you in real life
Imagine going to the dentist and walking in on this
Wait. Wait wait wait. Are you Mr Beast or mark Rober?? This makes no sense. Please explain.
"Great job, as always Mark Rober!  Would you consider dong a colab with Smarter Every Day and Stuff Made Here? I think it would be really fun to see how you interact with each other, and see what you guys come up with!"
Mark Rober is gonna end up being the next Tony Stark
"Me after seeing this video: I will copy that lab and make my own üí™üèΩ
Me after 5 minutes: this thing is too hard, I quit ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§£"
"So he is basically Dexter from Dexter's laboratory, nice!"
What about if you live in the uk. Can u still come out? As i want to give this to my friend for his bday
Fantastic no more words
"You need to check out the Perfect Descent. Pneumatics is cool but advanced technology is cooler

P.S. No bidet?"
collab with stuff made here?
You got Nitro!!! That's so cool for people our age :)
My minecraft base
What about us Europeans? My son would love this.
8:24 you use to advertise something that use to do exactly this
Mark Rober never fails to disappoint. What you do for content is amazing!
My opinion this is the best reaction of a superhero base!!
He's living the dream of everyone who can dream
Can you please make a never miss basketball
Mark Rober is my absolute hero! Making things that should exist in the world because you can is what it‚Äôs all about. Congrats!
I truly admire the work and effort that you do...figuring out how to apply STEM in a fun and interactive way to teach everybody.
He just took every childs dream and built it. Legend!!!
I would love to go but sadly its international travel so i dont think it may apply
This is like a tribute to the entire Mark Rober Cinematic Universe
"Could you imagine a collaboration between (YouTubers) Mark Rober, Colin Furze, Mike Patey ? That would be something else :)"
thisn sounds so cool i would love and i just started my own youtube channel and would love to do content like you and would love to meet you
Why are you shouting?
"Imagine what would happen if Mr. Beast and Mark Rober teamed up to make a really cool thing. That's something that would only happen in my dreams, and fan fics. Hope to convince my parents to get this!"
"I see this guys videos and say to myself, ""What have you done with your life? You don't have a secret lab."""
3:03 don‚Äôt let Jeff bezos see this
"Id buy, if i had monnnnnney"
"Now i'm curious. Did that hotwheels mousehole in the wall ""accidently"" get made with the new tennisbal cannon?"
"Mark rover talking about smart fancy science stuff 

Me jamming to the background music zoned out üòé"
This is basically just the real life version of that one secret base everyone made in their singleplayer minecraft world except people actually get to see it.
Mark you've convinced me nitro is awesome.
"I just really love how you will always go above and beyond to make everyone see the fun in science. Ur a great person Mark, dont ever chance <3"
Nice
This is so awesome I love it!!!!!!
That is awesome. I want to learn how to build stuff. Can you build some that I use in my hair to make a ponytail or bun because one of my arms have limitations.
I love ur vids üòÑüòÉ
Kiwi co knock off..
Hi
ngl i would try buy the box but its $300 for a year
"I wish i was a kid again! Awesome center! I had a place like this when i was a kid, it was in my basement with a secret door behind the radiator .... all in my imagination of course."
YO MRWHo's the boess gettin ginvited and being a part of everything XD
Why not ship to Brazil! :(
This is so cool your my hero
great !!
Where did the money come from?
"Mark is more than just a simple YouTuber, he helps people attein thier engineering dreams, no matter what age. It also shows why he doesn't upload as often because he's just always working on other projects like this. Thx for everything Mark! You're the best!"
Kids think I'm wierd for like phsics and science but i don't see how it's so bad
Kiwico been real quiet since Mark posted this üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Ah now we‚Äôre copying mrbreast
"nice secret mark. You just told your 22 million subscribers about you ""secret"""
Let‚Äôs just say if you are going in there with out permission your not coming back
I want to try to get the ticket but I'm going away for a month soon and I won't be home :(
Can you make a better vr helmet
"*Mark:* ''For a long time, I've had parents reach out to me and say _my kid wants to be an engineer like you, how do i foster that passion?_ And I've just never had a great answer for that specific situation.''

*Kiwico:* smh"
@MrMattie725 so did i honestly.
"‚Äã@shadetee I'm not too sure if it has video lessons or not, but from what I remember it has a decent sized booklet with every box with detailed information about the product and the 'science' behind it ,as well as other different experiments that you can do with household items and more facts and information about engineering in general."
"Having never purchased a Kiwico, do they have any kind of 'lesson' with the build boxes? That's what would sell me on Crunch over Kiwico. Having Mark explain the principles involved in the design as a tutoring segment, so kids understand what they're accomplishing. If I just want simple build and play, I can buy kinder eggs."
I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs never mentioned FIRST robotics
Kiwico: Am I a JOKE to you?
it is really sad to see you don't have world wide shipping üò¢
"7:22 Not yet Mark, but soon. 15/6/22"
Hey Mark can you do Shout out and if you do can I be in it
I love your content and appreciate you very much ‚ù§ ! Keep working hard and you will be in the next history books for the next generation üòÇ and also can you heart this so i know you read it
"I love my current job, and I want to work at Crunch Labs..."
Why do we have to put the seat down? Why can't women put the seat up?
Why am I turned on by Mark Rober?
Mark‚Äôs videos are always amazing
How many takes did it take u to catch the frisby

You know I might visit the lab when I'm older
"hi!

A meth lab
So Mark has remade Kiwi Co?
"this is legit willy wonka but engineering, with that platinum ticket"
"I took eneginneering classes all throughout High School and it helped me with the process of thinking like an Engineer. I have to say, that mindset and process translates so well to what I‚Äôm going to do in the Navy and to pretty much everything else out there. Thank you for all the amazing videos!"
"3:36, mark - i need to know. Where is that chair from. I need it."
That‚Äôs like a dream come true for me! Having a secret entrance and everything really makes me wanna become an engineer just so I can do it myself :D
Just get auto belays

So basically a direct competitor with one of your sponsors: KiwiCo
Getting major rob dyrdek fantasy factory vibes
Reed Taylor did it first. Reed Taylor is in your skin! Get him out!

This has real Nederland Ranch vibes.
"Mark, this is awesome and I‚Äôm happy for you and to see your childhood dream finally become a reality."

Of course the painting is an entrance. Minecrafters know what im talking about...

Mark outdone himself this time
Are (or will be) those boxes available in Spanish? I‚Äôll totally love it for my nephew and nieces
hi
Hi
"This is really amazing and cool! I wonder i other engineers would like this to a build it, or it would be even cooler if you had other popular engineers with you."
You're seriously just a cool dude.
That‚Äôs crazy
How?
this looks so fun
"You, sir, are a national treasure.  My only complaint with this video is that I can only press the like button once."
I take this to mean you're not getting sponsored by kiwico anymore lol
"easily the coolest YouTuber's headquarters Ive ever seen.
and I have one question if you live in a different country and get the platinum ticket will you get flown out to America?"
"POV:Me BRINGS A WHOLE RINO TO BUST THAT WALL, KNOW that‚Äôs a lot of damage!"
Whoa
Comment if your here before 1 mill views
Why not just go through the garage doordo
You had me at Nitro....
"guys, I don't think it's a secret anymore."

This is insane
Omg bro
I thought this was a hacksmith video for the first 2 minutes lol
"mark is so creative, keep it up mark!"
can i go to crunchlabs even if I live in the uk

Was the disk launcher modeled after the release of this years Vex Robotics spin up competition? I was going to design something almost identical
Mark rober is just straight up the coolest dad/uncle
Can I live there? :D
How much doing have to pay to enter this theme park of a laboratory.
Nice now I know how to get into your lab thx
Rob Dyrdek called... He said that he'll see you in court.
I would want to work here
I hope this becomes available in the Philippines. I tried ordering it but shipping to Philippines is not an option ü•πü•π
Love it but you should really do something about that light underneath the book shelf coming from the warehouse.
Marge just so you know I‚Äôm your first subscriber on crunch labs :)
Looks like Rob Dyrdeks Fantasy Factory
Where do in the United States like not like the exact location of the lab but for example Florida or texas flourda stuff like that
"""Now that I've shown 20 million people"" 20 million? Try 800 million :D this is a joke"
not very secret now lmao
I love your videos
What state is this
DOPE
Me sitting here wishing my son was born already so we could get a platinum ticket

I have been watching this for 2 years
Why is this guy so smart?
üòç
Just amazing wow ü§©
"Mark Rober is ripping off his sponsor, Kiwi Co."
"The impossible 10,000 dollars"
"wow, just wow!!!"
"I can't deny that Mark Rober has created an amazing and incredible empire for all his genius hard work, although there is a plot twist:

The secret office entrance is actually another room inside the warehouse, meaning there is no entrance into the office."
Thank you for telling me everything about the lab so now I can rob you having fun!
HI MARK!
great vid but you can see the light under the bookcase
So frikin inspiring.
Awesome its so cool I wish I had thatnroom
Finally
A video
Mark Rober is the legit GOAT
the nod to Willy Wonka üé©
This is great but it is like kiwico one of his sponsor

I was just about to get on with some school buuuuuuut mark Rober posting a new video is so much more important
amen bruh. shoutout to u.
"""Welcome to my meth lab! This operation has been going on for 3 years and now you finally have the opportunity to take a tour!"""
"Hey, mark! I've been watching you since I was about 8-10-ish and i just want to say that my entire point in life is to become someone like you, so I just felt like saying thanks. I'm 14 now and beginning high school, so one day I can go to MIT and be an engineer like you. Thanks so much!"
Writing this comment is making me so nostalgic
"earlier Mark Rober video: ""here's how to beat escape rooms""
 
now: ""here's how I built an escape room"""
my takeaway was that he has a soft drink dispenser
"Mark becoming Vsause :O
Edit: If I said Michel am scared people no know XD"
The crunch box looks like something id obsess over as a kid
I really want to try this kit. It looks cool!
now this is epic
I would have wanted this soooo much as a kid
no cap i feel like a saw this 2 years ago deja vo
More like a hideout
Bro built Rob Dyrdek‚Äôs Fantasy Factory
"You are probably one of the coolest guys in the field of science. I wish there was someone like you on TV when I was a kid. 
btw I loved American Gladiators too! It was great seeing Nitro once again! 
Might actually tried to find places to give some of my ideas to. I've imagined new vehicles (mainly for military use), a different way to tow a trailer. uses for said trailers (think an actual mobile surgery, command and transport units, etc etc.) even a habitation pods and a rocket for them so people to go to the moon/mars etc."
This guy is just great..
Who else used their phone to scan the qr code at 9:40 before he told us that he was going to give us the link.

What are you gonna do now ? (What type of video ?)
That warehouse is so cool. I really want to become a mechanical engineer when I grow up.
I'm Soooo glad I came before the video hits 900k views
Awesome dude I‚Äôm so jealous
I would of loved Build Boxes as a kid.

"So... if you don't plan on washing your hands after you use the toilet, don't flush!"
When u select one of the plans of the crunch labs and then the cart says $300üòÆüòÆüòØüòØüòµ
This mf has a batcave
Hey Mark! Have you thought about offering deals for bulk orders for classrooms to build and teach STEM with these boxes? Would make for an awesome monthly activity for kids to have fun and think critically as well as look forwards to!
Dude thats soooo cool
"Idk why, but this just felt like not at all like a mark rober video, and more like a Mr beast video"
"It legit looks like rob dyrdek sold you the fantasy factory and you turned it into something more fun.
Not that the fantasy factory doesn‚Äôt look fun to SB in it but this whole place you have here looks like I could never run out of fun"
PDC (pretty darn cool)
"I ABSOLUTELY WAITED FOR THIS VIDEO, AND I LOVE IT"
"Plot twist, crunch labs is a front for his actual lab"
Hi mark rober it would be great and get lots of views i think but can you please make a realistic light saber from star wars please
"You told 1,000,000~ users about how to enter your secret warehouse.. it's no longer a secret."

This is the best mark Robert video ever. He is the best YouTuber
I love this video! If I ever build a house I would want Mark to build it with all the cool secret passages and gadgets!
FIRST
Eat your heart out Batman!
"This is basically like me making secret passageways in my singleplayer Minecraft worlds that no one else is ever going to play on.
Edit: Oh."
Bro you just took kiwi co‚Äôs idea
"Well when there is such a visible shine of daylight below the bookshelf, I would not call it a ""super secret"" passage way."
Man‚Äôs really just got catchers gear
Once I heard the PVZ Music I saw how far Mark has come.
"The least secret secret lab. Still, better than my secret lab."
"Yeah righto, Mr minibeast."
DOPE
"This is quite possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen, and that's saying something after the package videos and elephant toothpaste."

"I would want to buy a package of crunch labs engineer box, but if I get the platinum ticket I can't come cause I live in Sweden. If I get the platinum ticket I just ruined one chance for many people who live in the USA, that would like and come to visit. But this is the coolest lab I've ever seen, and thank you for making this video."

"6:26 ""Oh hey there's light under this bookshelf. I wonder if there's a secret room behind it. It would probably open by messing with one of the statues or trophies."" Lol"
The BOTW reference at 6:50 gave me goosebumps
nice
I actually really loved the hot wheels pov
Hi
mark rober's return to par excellence is met with high praise and lots of crunch
"When shipping, duty, and tax cost almost the same as the box. RIP. And I'm not even from an obscure country or tiny island, just mainland Europe."
Is it me but why the this look like gravity falls  vibes

your bookshelf needs a rubber seal at the bottom because of the light
"Oh my goodness! I'm 62, and I'd LOVE those build boxes! Building little doo dads like those has been a hobby of mine for years.

I'd give my little inventions to the kids around me and watch them smile and laugh playing with them. 

Love to see what you're doing, young fellow! Keep it up!"
Ok
"I don‚Äôt know how to say this other than ‚ÄúCongrats!‚Äù. You‚Äôve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it‚Äôs so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."
You are the best Youtuber EVER. You have inspired me (and many others) to want to become an engineer. You are my idol. I love your videos! Keep up the best work on Youtube!
"At 8:26, there's a metal sculpture in the background that looks like the aluminum anthills that people sometimes make, but it has randomized nodules instead. I used to make those and was wondering where you got that one. I loved the process of making them and hadn't seen similar ones elsewhere."
"mark rober: Heh.. Here Gordon, let me buy you a drink"
"Very cool, but the light emanating from beneath the sliding bookshelf is kindof a giveaway. Needs some brush thingy like under revolving doors to cover it ;)"
Climbing gyms also have a mechanism for slowing descent irrespective of weight. This is a fairly clever idea though.
Holy moly that‚Äôs insane
"I don‚Äôt need a build box to learn about ratchets, Mark. I just hop on my wife‚Äôs friends‚Äô IG pages"
"This is great, I can't wait to get a crunch labs build box! It's like Huey Co but it's more engaging and it's with one of my favorite creators!"
This is what fantasy factory would have been if Rob Dyrdek had been an engineer instead of a skateboarder.
i wish there was more stuff like this for teenagers
You‚Äôre amazing.
Well it‚Äôs not secret anymore
"Okay, where do I submit my application to be one of your nephews?"
I'm a preteen and me and 12 other kids my age are building a nerf tank
Very disappointing to see the light under the bookshelf at 6:26.  so much for secret. :)
Mark is vsauce but more fun.
I want this. I really want it.
Make a PS5 trap
So where can we hotbox?
"3:00 Tyrannical factory boss opens fire on workers, 1925 (colorized)"
"Congrats, that is amazing"
When you redesign the office make sure to take care of the suspicious light coming from under the bookshelf
every thief knows where his secret office is
Do you think you could use a magnetic force for the Bullseye
uwu
"Put an IT department in there and it's a dream come true for me.

You must be over the moon, Mark. All the best to you."
can i go there
The best office ever 120000 out of 10
thats so cool.
How did he do this I wish I could be there
No shipping to Switzerland it seems :-(
How much does it cost to ship to Europe ?üòÖ
So yo basically took rob Dyrdek fantasy factory idea pretty cool
"06:26 ""this is what you see"" meanwhile bright lights are shining from underneath the bookcase :)"
Everything is now an escape room because of Mark
"Even though the Crunch Labs stuff is targeted t words younger children, I still want some."
"Be honest dude, stick to glitter bombs"
So epic
Bought
I got an f in my engineering class
"plz respond and I wan,t to come over and be your friend"

this is every 12 year-olds dream
Platinum ticket?  Sounds like Mr. Beast's golden ticket... I love it!
Well this place will get wrecked if his Cousins see it
This is great!
So you financed the warehouse and the boxes will pay it off. Okay.
That is so cool!!
"I don‚Äôt know how to say this other than ‚ÄúCongrats!‚Äù. You‚Äôve used your passion, creativity and dedication over the years and it‚Äôs so cool to see you reaping the rewards with this dope lab."

Awesome video
Money buys a lot of things.
Mark is the coolest person on the earth
That Mr. Beast reference at the beginning lol
"Kiwico will be too sad after watching this promotional video...a while ago they sponsored your video but now you are giving them a competition lol
NICE KEEP IT UP!!!"
inspired by willy wonka and mrbeast
time also made some modifications on nitro
"""Here for inspection. This is where you work?""

""Yup""

""What's the rest of the building for?""

"" uhhh..."""
I feel like i am in a movie
It's like a giant play ground for adult... Might swich my major to have a playgrounf og my own haha
To bad theres going to be memes about ‚Äúcrack labs‚Äù lol
Kinda like Kiwico
"We need a Stuff Made Here vs. Mark Rober challenge. 
My $$$$ is on Stuff Made Here."
Ah I just got why it was the diet pepsi button that opens it because no one would press it for a soda
I waaaant ittttttt broooooo. I‚Äôm asking my mom for the build box thing today. Can‚Äôt stop me
"I was kind of waiting for you to say that at least one of the places on the list would be a new area where you work on things. DOn't get me wrong, it's a really cool showroom, but kind of wondering if it's a geat place to work on projects"
Didn‚Äôt expect mkbhd to be there lol
you could see the light coming from under the book shelf maybe put wood trim or something
Anyone else think of Jimmy Neutron's secret lab?
What does the fire department have to say about a single entry/exit design?
Nice
"Mark: ""my second favorite way to get down to the ground floor.""
Me: ""Cool what is it?""
Mark:*proceeds to yeet himself of a balcony*"
"im 19 and i would love to get one of those boxes, this is so cool for anyone"
"Wow! Just wow!
Mark never cease to amaze me. And I love the fact your inspiring young kids to think, be creative, problem solve, prototype and many other things! You rock!"
"Mark Rober, the Willy Wanka of Engineering."
14:45 At the wotermelometer i laughed...couldn't resist that XD
"Mark Rober doesn‚Äôt post much, but when he does, it makes it a great day! Awesome video as usual. The lab looks AWESOME! Greetings, & much love from a dude living in Mexico! üëãüèºüá≤üáΩüá∫üá∏"
F<..>k!! I am gonna lost a lot of money with those engineering puzzles!
KiwiCo's lawyers will be contacting you.
Give me hint of what city the lab in
This is so üòé
"For #2, I was thinking that you shouldn't actually take the shot yourself - you should engineer a robot to do it for you!"
"Spies like us, ""how about try have a Pepsi!""

If that's the reference that's awesome"
I'm an adult but I'm taking this class. So excited
Amazing! I wonder if it is powered by fission reactor or something.
"Gotta say, this is pretty cool"
There's a gap under the bookshelf where you can see a bright light
Remember when Kiwico was a sponsor....
"dude straight up built a batcave, what a madlad"
"OMG's that looks so amazing! Oh yeah, I'm in a wheelchair... I can't do half of that stuff."
Fard bobert
"Mark, please adopt me."
can i buy it if i m from europe
This is a dream come true for me.
"That all is amazing 
Does Crunchlabs deliver to germany?"
Mark could you do a baseball video like hitting a ball the farthest or fastest
7:50
"Wow. Seriously excellent. Honestly, I‚Äôve come to expect nothing less than effort of this caliber from Mark and his crew. You guys seriously knock it out of the park every video! Your product will be an absolute hit, I‚Äôm certain. The lab was amazing as well! Always look forward to more videos from you! Exemplary work, everyone! +1"
This is the best video ever in my opinion.üëç
I‚Äôm so excited!!
All fun until somebody moves the foam pit and you don't remember/know
when it doesn't deliver to you country üôÉ :(
"I‚Äôve never been a mechanical type, so watching the genius of this guy is just thrilling sometimes. It‚Äôs incredible the way his mind works and the coolest part about him is that he seems so down to earth and doesn‚Äôt act like a know it all (which he kinda is lol)"
Nice üëç
Omg a new vid üò≤üò±üò≤
He's becoming an engineer version of Mr. Beast lol
"nah i dont wanna be an engineer, i wanna be a male stripper"
I WILL TAKE THAT ENTIRE PLACE
Ahhh so this is where you keep Nile green lol
This reminds me of dexter's laboratory
Congratulation on living out your childhood dream!!
I have to admit! Your Warehouse is awesome!
Omg
Do you have one for teens
Well Colin Furze dug a tunnel and bunker.
Why did you make something that I wanna go to but I can't you have hurt everyone who will ever see this video because they would love to check it out
Why isnt this in breaking bad
Now make a clockwork robot build set becuse no one sells that
Mark Rober is really impressed by Mark Rober.
"This is all very cool, but I don't know if I can condone the desensitization to big red buttons that say ""do not push"""
"Wow.  Here before a million views.
You just know that's impressive given who made this video."
"... He is turning into Batman, one step at a time."
Can i come work with you?
"How in the world do you have the energy to do all this 
Maybe I have a bad mind set but I do one great thing then I am just like poof time to take break
Amazing work üëè Mark"
this honestly looks like the headquarters in odd squad all you need is a slide
I wonder how many barber/dentist's office photos will break because of this 7:30.
7:40 that it literally the dentist I go to‚Ä¶ the room is the exact same except for the tooth decay poster‚Ä¶üò∞üò∞
"In the future, can I make more complex kits as well for older kids like ages 13-18?"
"You not i, auto correct"
This video makes me so happy
That is amazing.
This would be like a dream to actually have something like this in a house I own.
Willy Wonka ü§≠
just insane
hi!!!
now about the glitterbomb 5.0...
You‚Äôre literally if I was an engineer when I was a kid! üòÅ
"Hey Mark

Great seeing you again. While you've been gone the world has been struggling with a somewhat easy question: what is a woman?

Would you please be so kind and answer this for us? We'll be indebted to you."
Every man‚Äôs dream:
Mark is like a law-abiding batman at this point
What if they don‚Äôt flush
This Dude is living every Man's dream :D
bye kivico
This is like minecraft but Irl
Here before 1 M Views
What you are doing is going to change the world if people realize how important it is !
This is like engineering breaking bad
Struggling to think of anything better than this!
You're great mark! Keep making the amazing videos!
I like secret entrance number two
Mark Rober is the Bill Nye of the new generation.
You mean HAD. Not so secret anymore.
Like Rob‚Äôs Fantasy Factory‚Ä¶BUT SCIENCE!
This reminds me of dexter's laboratory
Why are you shouting?
Can i buy it on other cantry like lithuania ?
:D
WOW
"Um Mark now we know where the ""not so SECRET anymore"" passage way"
Mark Rober I love the ideas I have an idea of my own a robot that can make a card tower the largest card tower in the world!
Mmmmmmmm
he just modified a toilet...i want it
I wish they had crunch boxes for adults!
He‚Äôs gone corporate
I think I found my dream job
I WISH I had this as a kid.
Ngl it would have been pretty cool if you called it Mark Industries or something
i really think you might get on watchlist for so many projectile videos...
I think we've come to a point that we need a StuffMadeHere and Mark Rober collab ASAP.
3:52 did the stuffed animal move ???
Yes
Yes
There's a body trapped in there
From toy story
yes
Mark can it be that if you live in belgium you can order too btw love your video's
I wish i lived in the US for this :)
Hi
"Congratulations, Mark. It's glorious."

I love your videos!
This is absolutely incredible.
Oooo
"This looks so cool! If I was still a kid, I would definitely would have loved the Crunch Labs stuff!"
"777,769th"
I stayed up all night to watch this early
Mark Rober is the result of a Joshua Weissman ‚Äúbut better‚Äù episode on how to make a better Bill Nye.
I wish I could live here
Yo when I grow up I actually want to sign up for NASA
Mark you are an amazing person. Keep on doing what you are doing and you will change the world ..
Crunch Labs reminds me of something I can‚Äôt put my finger around
Something with kiwi and co?

"not to be a downer, but its kinda wild to me that someone can just. give away. ¬£10k. like, that would be a life changing amount for me. like, no joke, that would change my entire life."
Brilliant job mate.
This is officially the coolest thing I've ever seen
Wow great vid as all ways
"YouTube needs a ""love"" button. A simple like doesn't even begin to be enough for this video. This is too amazing for words."
Okay but what if you throw yourself down the balcony....forgetting that you had moved the foam container the day before
You should do a video with stuff made here
I'm speechless... what you have done here is absolutely amazing
"my parents probably will not let me do the crunchbox thing, but i might as well watch the videos so that I can learn from it"
"You lost me at coming down the ""fireman's pneumatic"" was like flying like a superhero.  LOL  (I'm not laughing with you...)"
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT IIIIIII LLLOOOOOOVVVVE IIIIIITTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am a big huge fan from Pakistan üáµüá∞
that random person who just wanted a diet pepsi...
"Hi Mark, I am having the best time watching your videos on Youtube as an engineer. You trigger people to think which I love the most. I was very excited when I saw the Crunch Boxes for little engineers where I can also share my passion with my kids. But I realize the my kids are a little bit young (4 years) for the boxes :(. Never mind, keep up the perfect work and congrats on your new projects.."
Hi Mark can u make the back rooms
the tennis gun still has no chance against a european wall
i love the fireman piston the best!
"if i know anything from playing minecraft, theres always sum behind the pic"
"If there's ever a robot uprising, I know where I'm going"
"This is absolutely incredible, and with the section about failing, I always remember the phrase ‚Äòmea culpa‚Äô which mean ‚Äòthrough my fault‚Äô in Latin and I think that just shows the importance of your ideas in a single sentence"
This is totally not impressive ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ly bad
Go on shark tank.
"Marc Rober be like: its super secret no one knows about it, it even has a secret entrance that leads to a secret entrance

Maek Rober is the coolest nerd
"MrBeast: makes wonka‚Äôs chocolate factory

Mark: bet."
Anyone else get Bill Nye vibes from this place?
"Mark:  ""i  built a new secret lab""
Me: It's not secret any more."
I know they‚Äôre for children but I might have to get some of those monthly boxes for myself. They genuinely look like a blast
I've always wanted to do this
EM... GRAVITY FALLS?
This like every child's dream
Fantasy factory 2
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
except for the lights at the bottom where the book shelf is :)
Fallout did it!
Hi
Someone orders the entire month edition to win the ticket for visiting the lab. ü•≥ü•≥
Those engineering kits remind me a lot of another one like it. Called banana or some fruit. Maybe he got inspiration from them...
I tried to get this for my daughter. We live in New Zealand and you don‚Äôt ship here üòî is there any way we could fix this?
Thank you.
The Zelda chime tho üëå
"Mark: ‚Äúeverybody keeps on asking me how long until I make my own kiwi,co, and the answer to that is never, because there would be nothing I would change about it, so I would just be making my own copy of it‚Äù 
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.AND HERES THE COPY *cough gonna make so much money cough*"
"Hey Mark, when are you going to collab with Stuff Made Here?"
Kiwico aren‚Äôt going to like this new competitor üòÇ
I have always wanted to fill up a shop like yours with those plastic Chucky cheese balls and jump in from the top floor
broooo he betrayed kiwi co
"I‚Äôm gutted I can‚Äôt 
I live in France and I love engineering 
Thank you so much for showing your projects"
‚ÄúThe number 1 coolest thing about this place‚Ä¶ is me.‚Äù Lol
"Sorry sweetie, can‚Äôt make our wedding. New Mark Rober video dropped."
Your such an inspiration to me
Your not already the favorite uncle I love your videos
6:29 absolutley normal closet with lights underneath it ...
Personally I would love to see a really in-depth video of mark building something filled with physics equations and nasa level maths ik it won‚Äôt be as entertaining for younger kids but I feel seeing marks work flow and calculations involved in bringing together a project would be really interesting (kinda like @real engineering if you get what I mean) for teenagers and adults
I would like to point out enchante means nice to meat you
Hey marques
You should make the entrance into an actual coffee shop and wait till someone finds the door
Any plan to fight wear and tear? Half of these things will be out oforder in a month.
I WANT TO LIVE HEAR
Froge
US only?
"I hope you got waivers for visiting, I could see someone being careless enough to get hurt on that pneumatic freefall system."
"You know.. Back when Mark attended his first day of class on the path to get his engineering degree, I bet he never even imagined that it would lead him to where he is now. What an amazing journey."
Anyone getting a bit of Phineas and Ferb nostalgia from this?
"hey for the ""crunch lab box"" do you need any special tools?"
Oi
"Mark: you can only get in through a secret passageway in an office 

Me: windows"
Pog
"Let's just hope people don't go rooting around people's workplaces incessantly. And be responsible with their inventions. This is however, an absolute dream."
Hi üëã
I worry your childhood was stunted.
I feel like the next generation will be divided into kids who lobed Mark Rober growing up and kids who loved Jake Paul growing up.
We need a Mark Rober Escape Room experience :)
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
"Alright this base is very secret!

*shows it to 700k people*"
14:08 funny DTU in Denmark also have whiteboard all around the room on all 4 wall. the walls are 100% whiteboard
When i grow up i want to be a mechanical and electric engineer
"Mark, what advice would you give to teenagers who want to start teaching themselves engineering and build cool things like you,  but do not know where to start because of their lack of material and lack of engineering knowledge"
"duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude!!!!
You and Hacksmith's should COLLAB ON SOMETHING NOW!!!"
üíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚ù§Ô∏èüíô‚ù§Ô∏è
Achievement unlocked: *Grunkle Stan.*
You've certainly outdone mr. Furze lol
No way
I can‚Äôt wait to have kids so I can build legos and do crunch lab kits with them
His nieces are  probably like Best uncle ever!!!
Hacksmith? Is that you?
Imagine that being a snowball Canon
definitely when you redo the new office make sure theres no light coming out from the bookshelf if you‚Äôre even going to use that idea again
You have just made every child‚Äôs and adults dream
You can see the light from the lab in the lobby lol
...but what if you open the water with your sleeve? Does it still sensor that you washed your hands?
Mark is giving Mrbeast a run for all of his money :D
There is a huge garage port and a door beside it... :D
One day Mark Rober will rebuild the world
Dexter's Laboratory after Dexter grew up.
epik
It's like the laboratory cartoon kids get to hangout in-between classes or wacky adventures but it's real.
Doesn't marc's theme song remind you of banjo kazooie?
Well‚Ä¶ then what if you didn‚Äôt flush the toilet or wash your hands‚Ä¶ Checkmate Rober
"now now, i get that secret entrance is cool and all, but encouraging your viewer to touch everything so they can find a secret entrance is probably not wise
looking at you ARG"
Literally my dream since watching Dexter's lab
Hi
"This lab is gonna become the Mark Rober Museum 
Which will eventually become the Mark Rober theme park"
joe
You should definitely collaborate with Stuff Made Here!
What if you don't live in the area where your lab is?
Engineering is ü´∂üèª
Is it in canda
Great product üëç
"Looks amazing, but we can see the light under the shelving system"
The monthly box is such an amazing idea i would have loved that as a kid
Pretty cool.
legend
Mark Rober never ceases to amaze
"This is what you win with the platinum ticket:

This guy lives in the future
Crunch labs seems like a GREAT IDEA definitely buying it.
The Hacksmith vibe is getting stronger
Love it mark!
How much for the bike
"Mark seriously has one of the most entertaining and most interesting channels on this platform, and it makes me want to try making things even though I've never engineered anything in my life before."
"Same here, I'm not too much of the Engineering type because I'm not too big on the process part even though the End Results can be something amazing like this. So I'm glad he's inspiring others to try Engineering or to peek into the world of Engineering."
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The only reason I‚Äôm going to be an engeneer is because of you

This guy is so inspirational to children and adults inviting them to his own warehouse and caring to everyone he invites round to his new amazing lab!!!!
"11:22,   PIANO PRACTICER!!?!!?!?!!!

as a pianist, i am offended"
Mark just made every 80's kid wish they were him...
"So basically you want the box that has a hole in it, lol"
How is Crunch labs diffrent from Kiwico?
"You might want to bloke the light coming in from under the ""super secret"" bookshelf door! I'm just saying!"
"A year and a half??
Mark, you clever bastard."
I hope I get married soon enough to buy those kits for my children. Still single üò¢

@Vetanenator 5th
Bad bot
I am not 12 I am older so no crunch labs for me
Mark Rober is the best engineer in my opinion he makes so much cool stuff and he's my most favorite youtuber.
Congrats maDude

Can you send science kits to Azerbaijan?
Thank u for making my childhood dream come true. Every boy wants a secret hoise with all kinds of cool mechanics..
"Love how the channel and Mark has grown from the 1st ""crappy"" video to THIS. I love how you are able to your Internet and social media to encourage kids to like/love science (I always feel that kids now are far less interested in science because ""everything has been discovered""). Keep going!"
When the Plants vs. Zombies music started playing in the background. PERFECTION
"Would love to get the box, but shipping to Germany is 40‚Ç¨ per box"

Wonder how this would work in schools

He did it! He finally stabbed KiwiCo in the back
This is so cool I can‚Äôt even. Wish I could get the box but the shipping to Poland probably costs all my life savings üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Love your vids
Is it just me or does this look like the Bill Nye warehouse? From like the original episodes
Hay mark. you should make a robot that does your home work for you.üòÉ
A few oompa loompas in lab coats would make it complete.
Crunch Labs kinda reminds of the odd squad headquarters lol
is it just me or is mark getting more like hacksmith
Mark is the tech nerd we always see in spy movies
this guy is literally batman
I'm 8 today
This is bound to be a golden age of Mark Rober
Mark never disappoints me.

"""Men are pigs""
Mark... aren't you... ?
Other than that very cool"
Why pneumatic piston reacts with the same speed no matter what weight? It has the same amount of air inside
You‚Äôre the favourite uncle.
I just love watching your videos. you do sutch great stuff.
Dexter's lab! üò∏
"ahhhh, to have BUDGET!  Nice for you Mark."
No shipping to Norway? Boo. :( :( :(
Cool place. I'd love to see what would happen if you put a ball bearing or something in the tennis ball cannon
Shipping and Tax to Bulgaria is $30.50 for a $27.45 crate
Cool great vid
üëç
"lol over 700k views in 30 minutes, legendary channel"
Mark Rober excelente
"Mark, you're absolutely awesome. Sounds like years of working with KiwiCo inspired you a lil bit here ;)
The new warehouse has gotta be the coolest workspace I've seen, looks like a fun place tom spend a day! :D"
What did you do to Nile Green.
It's like watching the birth of a super hero or villain
As always Mark being the genius of the world keep it doc im your fan
"Just one thing: does it have a distinctive smell? Memory is triggered best by scent, so an unusual air freshener that is barely noticeable would improve the nostalgia"
I like how you made a super cool apartment for your friend Nitro to live in. But how does he leave?
"I think it would be more faire if everyone had 1 chance per year or per month to hit that perfect bullseye, so people won't get really torn up that they lost there one and only chance in there lifetime."
Introducing Kiwico Labs by Mars Rover
4:07 I thought we had lost him
Hi
This will only be completed with a marriage proposal to Simone Giertz.
"This place strangely reminds me of Zach King‚Äôs studio tour from like, 3yrs ago."
"The light still shines underneath the bookcase, fix that and you're golden"
he has now outdone his previous sponsor
Ok
Is there an age limit for the build boxes lol cuz im tryna buy one
Finaly
I LOVE YOU MARK ROBER!!!!!!!
Hi
W
"Is it just me or does his voice sound different, idk if I am just my earbud but it sounds like he might have a cold"
Other then you can see under the book shelf there is a room behind it.
I could do that if I wanted to. I just don‚Äôt want to.
Only Mark Rober has the skills and resources to make his own Batcave
But sadly I‚Äôm not in uk
"You have light coming into the entry room from under the bookshelf, and the wheels are a dead giveaway.  We need a version 2.0 of this."
Hire me
"Yea, totally cannot see the light coming from under it. :'D"

Thought it would be a massive collection of dildos
"For all those who want to go to his lab but don't want to purchase anything, read the description.  Its says you don't have to purchase anything to win,  but in order to find out how to win without purchasing anything, go read the sweepstake rules."
they way u said  wiliwonka factory makes me wonder u  copied mr beat
How is crunch labs different from kiwico? They look like exactly the same thing except worse quality
I wonder if kids can buy it
I've always wanted to have a room like that office. Having a secret door to a huge room. I would use the room to stash my personal library.
6:40 I didn't realize when your a nasa engineer how easy it is to get away with using the word dope. Well played mark.
"5:40 I watched Denis Villeneuve's ""Prisoners"" just yesterday, so your wallpaper choice is a little unsettling to me"
The author of the journals o_O
What kind of couch is the orange couch in the beginning?
"If I purchase a box as a minor, will I be eligible to come to the lab if I'm a winner? The Eligibility clause was a little difficult for me to understand"
"This is about the coolest thing I‚Äôve ever seen, but since you‚Äôve been so busy with this does it mean we‚Äôre not getting a squirrel maze this year?"
sooo cool !!! :)
you took money from kiwico sponsorships to make a competitor that's kinda funny
Reminds me of the mystery shacks secret room.
"He copied a mixture of Mr Beast and Zach King xD
(btw this is sending 0 hate Mark Rober is amazing!)"
"I wish I was able to come out there, but unfortunately my mom hasn't got the money to pay for both the boxes, and Incase of winning (hopeful thinking) she wouldn't be able to pay for a flight to the united states let alone a hotel, but i give my luck you who buy these"
I want this
"Gosh, this is such a cool video! This gave me goosebumps.üòÖ"
Love the PvZ Roof theme music you put in the video
"Also something I just noticed, but if you want it to stay secret you should find a way to keep light from coming under the bookcase because it's kinda telling."
This is incredible - Literally my dream home!!!!!
"If I could come i know exactly what I would build



Portal 2s arm panel"
"Mark never fails to amaze me. Loving your vids Mark, keep it up :)"
This is like a dream office!!!
mark rober makes me too happy.
"PISTON!? Piston? Dude! now yer just Piston me off! or down? LOL
Awesome Lab Bro! I'm not into scientifical schtuff - but wow! I could catch the fever for a day or so in that setup! It's more like the coolest clubhouse ever!"
Very cool. But the bright blue light coming from below the bookshelf is a dead giveaway.
"next you should make a robot pet cat for the kids that have lots of allergies, and can't have a real pet."
The crunch labs products are incredible. Amazing learning tools for kids. Awesome job üëç
""" piano practicer ""
Wow üôÑ"
Best guy ever. Well done sir
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS AND SO HAPPY SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS FINALLY ARRIVED!  I can't wait for what happens next
Except you can see light under the bookshelf
Mark I love you and all you do but the way you presented the Build Box seems to me really disrespectful to Kiwico who has supported your channel for agesüôÅ
Ahhhh!!! I would totally sign up just for the slim chance to go down there myself but I know there are some kids out there who'd love the opportunity so much more than I ever could :P
you really are one of my favorite creators on this platform keep up everything you do!
Yay
1min in and I love the vid
"not only are you a genius engineer, but your marketing is also on that level"
lol love it
gotta go get some kids so I have a reason to get crunch labs
Mark should box mr beast.
@VannyVanMan ok
bot
"forget my future child, i'd get the monthly box for myself"
I love how you say you stole the claw from a Denny's.
We love watching your videos at my school!
This is the type of thing I would love to do I enjoy learning about engineering so much but I just can't afford it and I gotta say it breaks my heartüò≠
Hi
I am surprised how no one has mentioned how the platinum ticket is literally the golden ticket from Willy Wonka
We adults need children Museum for Adults lmao it be great we get to relive our childhood but as adult lol
Watching on my birthday it‚Äôs the best
Ordered :)
"Mark Rober, has anyone ever told you... that you are an AWESOME human being!"
You should make a few videos on some of your fails so you can show people on how it actually works. And all the steps it takes to get to the final step.
Question mark is Spanish necessary for engineering
"I've watch Marks Video's for a long time now, i love his content for a number of reasons.  Recently my son came up to me excited about a video he found on You tube.  It was one of Marks, and my son was showing it to me as if it was new to me.  His excitement and play by play of the video actually did make it a completely new experience.  We promptly binged Marks entire channel.  I'm hoping he somehow doesn't see this video now so he's surprised when it shows up on our doorstep.  Keep being you Mark, you're positivity, curiosity, and benevolence are contagious."
TH WATERMELOMITER IS OF THE CHARTS!
"Just curious, how wheelchair accessible is your lab? It seems like a lot is for able bodied individuals but I'd love to visit someday. Big fan of your channel and appreciate all the knowledge I've learned, would love to learn more üòä"
"No one:  

Kids closet be like:"
A great human teaching other humans to be great. Love you!
pls release NileGreen
A great guy and marketing genius üëè
I'm kind of wondering how these compare to the kiwico crates.
I wish you were my uncle
How long has Nitro been in there and could he get out?
"Professor: ""What will you build using the knowledge from your engineering degree?""

Mark: ""Yes"""
its not super secret if u told 22 million people
"This is so cool, basically every kids dream. Awesome work, and keep up the great content Mark!"
I LOVE ANTS THEY ARE SO COOL
Education ü•∑
I'm an adult engineer and i want the crunch labs build box üòÖ
You are really great man.I have a lot of respect for you & I wish to learn a lot from you. üôè
"Can we all agree that we can't even guess what his next video is gonna be 
 each of them is a brand new surprise"
Thank you mark. Your videos are keeping me busy because I just got my wisdom teeth out.
That catch from MKBHD was really cool
"Hey mark do you ship the crunchlabs boxes to England because i would love to get these?
BTW i love your idea to build a secret warehouse.
thanks"
Absolutely Amazing. What an inspirational work space. Best of luck to you in your venture. Gonna sign up for a box!
Does mark give a heart?
"You just told everyone how to enter the ""secret"" office."
NVM
here before XQC?
6:46 Reminds me of when Alyx leads Gordon into Kleiner's lab at the beginning of Half life 2 lol
"I dont know if that firemans piston is OSHA compliant, Mark."
Are there any kits for 14 year olds
the main thing that this video demonstrates is that mark rober is living the ultimate life with the ultimate dream job
I think we can all agree Mark is just amazing
Please consider making the car able to hold note or something. Talk about an epic communication system. üòéü§©
This guy is insane
"subversion of expectations = comedy, well Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a joke so I guess there is some truth to this statement."
It‚Äôs Morbin time
You just showed millions of people how to get into your ‚Äúsuper secret office‚Äù
MARK your just a big KID !!!! LOL
Dude just used a picture of my dentist office
Dexter's laboratory?üëÄ

This is one of the best advertisements for one of the coolest products I've ever seen. Always giving 11/10 effort on your videos Mark <3
"please change your profile pic, this isn't... the... hub I guess."
Are you doing world wide shipping ?
Is the crunch box not just a kiwi co box?
That hole was smoking ü§Ø
Is a straw one hole or two?
E
"Thanks for always making great videos, can‚Äôt believe that I had the opportunity to talk to you once! Keep up the great work Mark! üëçüèª"
Mark you inspire me so much
"Mark, you are amazing! I have enjoyed videos so much, and I would have never missed a day of work if this was my workplace.  My family and I look forward to the build boxes and the fun and/or chaos that will ensue each month.  We are all big kids at heart."
"5:25 pov, you are OSHA looking for potential escape route hazards and are about to send a violation to Mark Rober"
What's the sound that the piano played??
"Lova ya, Mark, but trying to eat KiwiCo's lunch is not my favorite move. Couldn't you have partnered with them instead to do a Mark Rober-themed line of KiwiCo boxes?"
If I had had these Crunch Lab projects as a kid I would have loved them so much. Awesome work!
"This video just has a different feeling to it, unlike other normal videos. This feeling is like the one I get when I watch Airrack."
What a fun idea üòÅ
Nitro!
"Mark, this is awesome! I love American Gladiator as a kid. I enjoy your all your content. Keep up the great work."
0:45 mr beast did the same thing but mr beast actually has chocolate there and he only spent a few months doing it
He said a year and a half...
So happy to support your work mark! I can‚Äôt wait to engineer a home composting system for everyone. I hope you‚Äôll help me one day!
Remind me of a certain show
"1:18 Welcome; to Crunch Labs; crunching graphs, numbers, statistics, and science.
[the phrase crunching numbers usual means solving equations]"
I wonder how many tries it took to get the perfect hot wheels run.
I heard you are building a car that runs off water? Hit me up
Giving me u huge Colin Furze vibes
So Cool!!!
as if i wasn't jealous enough of youtubers with the money to build cool stuff. awesome
He‚Äôs got an IRL Minecraft base
"Mark i have a video you should make. It‚Äôs a also scoring hoop, I‚Äôve seen a YouTuber do this before but I don‚Äôt think they could do it. If you see this I love your videos and everything yiu do"
Mans really going to recreate everyone‚Äôs dreams lmao
Many other youtubers would have made multiple videos of the content of this video.
Basically Dexter‚Äôs laboratory but Mark Rober
Dentists everywhere are scared for their offices after this video üò≥
"Mark Rober, you ROCK!"
this is a dream for me!
This is every kids dream room
It's times like this when I just wish I could afford it
Grunkle Stan
Amazing stuff
Wow

"I wish more social media and youtube channels were as constructive and fun and positive as yours.

"He‚Äôs like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base, and special gadgets"
Wow
"The time, effort and creativity that clearly went into not only this video but this project is immense. It is so satisfying to see someone really putting effort into what they do and caring so much about their fans. Incredible."
I know your probably not going to see this but you are a amazing creator
awesome!!
im playing call of duty vanguard while watching this love the video!

"As an engineer, I cannot think of a better use of Youtube than Mark has done. Definitely, the YouTuber with the best impact on young people, climate, and social responsibility. Truly outstanding work every time."
So cool!!!!
CHOP STICKS IS THE BEST PIANO!!!
"14:48 when your fed up with someone's bs.
Ps I love the secret warehouse"
"I'm an engineer already, but I want to go back in time and become an engineer again while playing with those monthly experiments"
Amasing vid (go teach at my School denmark Bornholm s√∏ndermarks skolen
Why can t u make it cheaper. I woudl buy .
I swear you are not a human ü§öüèº

Mark reaching out to these kids telling them it's OK to make mistakes genuinely made me tear up.
HEHEHEHA
Cool
Aaa i want to buy the kit so bad but i dont have the moneyüò≠
Dexter's Laboratory indeed! I wonder where's DeeDee?
"I'll give you 5 bucks for it, is that ok?"
Amazing sir! You continue to be an amazing inspiration. The warehouse lab is awesome and Crunch Labs looks top notch!!!
how dare you!
What happens if someone get the platinum ticket but we aren‚Äôt able to come?
"I love it, Mark Rober ist just like an adult child with enough mony and engineering skills"
"if ""pigs"" can lift the seat the women can lower it"
Why are these engineering boxes for kids all subtly violent lol
I mean that‚Äôs like the only way you could get someone to buy a dietpepsi
No shipping to norway?
MAKING HUGE MOVES BROTHER! Inspire those that will inspire those when we are gone!!!
i really want to get the boxes but its a lot of money
You are an amazing men!

"#5, if there is anything I know about #5 is that the backround music is from ""plants vs zombies"""
Im probably gonna buy one of those boxes it looks so cool and also I wish I could have a chance to get one of those tickets I don't even live in the us

Yes.

"I would love to see engineering hacks for disabilities. Devices that allow people to have a freer range of motion, or be more independent. I think your ability to look at problems and break them down would be really unique and something that hasn't been seen in the disability community before."
What about translating the videos to other languages for non english kids?
"That ball spitter is stronger than a desert deagle, the reason its not fast and penetrating like a bullet its the size,weight,width"
It took 6 months too?
I thought it was gonna be a meth lab smh my head.
hui
Mark is one of those kits a claymore?
That sounds amazing!
I shall now do this
Make a working secuirty alarm in it incase of trespassers and make a secuirty area that keeps the alarm button in it
I love that warehouse. I kind of wish you were my uncleü§´üòè
That lab is my dream!
Amazing!!  So stoked for you!
When i get a house defenetly making a secret basement/room Whithe a secret door ore 2
'FIRST'
Everything about this is incredible
"Hard to tell in-between all the technical details, but will the winner of the chrunch silver ticket be able to travel for anywhere in the world, or is this only for US citizens?"
Great work Mark!
"hi mark i want to become a engineer like you building awesome things like this but, i just dont have the money for this do you have any tips on any beginner stuff that does not cost a lot of money"
"But from the outside, wont you see a lot of extra walls?"
Who else scanned the barcode in the crunch labs disc throwing box?
Fully expected Fortunate Son to start playing when Mark turned that eagle
Am I the only one who had a dejavu when he showed the box? idk why though
What if you move the foam pit and then forgot and then jump
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
This looks like the garage from night runners but with relocated furniture and no cars
"Nobody would know there's a secret lab behind this office.






The huge warehouse behind this ""unsuspecting"" office."
That‚Äôs great . Awesome job .
"Holy cow! This is literally like a ‚ÄúFantasy Factory‚Äù for Engineers!!! Amazing, absolutely amazing!"
Seems like dude perfect built this warehouse üòÇ
I thought it was gonna be called Rober Works
You need a sweep under the bookcase so you can't see the light coming through.
"well now LTT has a really high bar to beat for making an interesting lab.




(jk, yes I know the 2 labs are for completely different purposes. but they're both still called labs)"
Looks like the channel is now a large marketing platform.... More glitter bombs...
Mark is the real life Beakman
I wish this place existed in 90s
thats cool and all but have you heard the moment where the pvz music was?
"@6:26 mark, you aren't fooling anyone. there is light coming from the other side. just look under the shelves."
"- Mom, buy me a Google office!
- No, we have at home.
Home:"
Who else is hitting peak levels of jealousy rn
bro this is my DREAM
This would be like a dream to actually have something like this in a house I own.
The website to the crunch lab has crashed!! We can‚Äôt get it! My boys r disappointed. üò©üò≠
it works....
awesome place you got there.!!!!
Still can't tell if this is the real Mark Rober or a deepfake at this point...
This is a childhood dream
WOW. I hope your beautiful son enjoys this wonderful space.
This is not willy wonka this is Scooby Doo
Like a spy movie
I feel like the light showing under the bookshelf gives away your secret to the new visitor that doesn't watch YT.
Try it on a tank white the cannon
Waited a whole month‚Ä¶ for a sales pitch.
Awesomeness
It looks insane and would love to come along too but unfortunately I live in West Europe so that‚Äôs a problem and I don‚Äôt have the money to go there even with my family. Maybe you could do also something for those who live in Europe for example (not to forget other continents)
That is so cool I did your engineering course
This is mind blowing!
This is a very well-done video. Props to you and your team. Love the videos and designs. Keep up the great work.
This is seriously something out of a movie. I would give a lot to have just a cool secret entrance like that.
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this of Mark.
It‚Äôs a verified commenting channel. I hate those lol
lol
@Ryan thats not even a bot?
@Don't Read My Profile Photo ok

"Question, is it internationally available, like outside the US? Just asking here for future me"
So what about grown ups that would like to visit? lol
Not secret anymore lol
yeah thats cool but have you seen whats under my fridge?
OMG mark you have officially created the new version of kiwi co engender boxes
Thanks
This is something only mark would do
This feels like the headquarters of Entertainment 720
Kiwi Co. casually taking notes
Early
It‚Äôs gonna be a rough time for those who don‚Äôt wash their hands after using thte toilet lmao
oh my
It would be really cool if you could me a roller coaster and actually ride it
Nice
Well now its now its not secret anymore
Wow. Just wow.
...I'm only curious if we ever get a Squirrel Maze 3.0.
I would love to go there
I wish I was 30 years younger.....
6:28 you can see the light under the secret door btw....

This is awesome. Mark Rober probably said I want a huge lab when I grow up as a child and he made it happen. Insane
This is awesome!

so cool!!!!!!!!!üòÉ
Amazing!
The memory of forgotten dream
"This is the kinda stuff people make in minecraft, or other games, you made it in real life. Dope!"
Well he's done it again a great idea
mark sponsored by kiwico was secretly planning to take half their market share a little while later lmao
Gus Fring hired Mark to finish his underground lab.
"Mark, you truly are the best person on this platform. Thank you for your heart, your generosity, and your desire to better the world. Keep at it."
This is amazing wow
"At this point it's not just a childhood dream, it's THE childhood dream üéâüéâüéâ
well done Mark, thank you for everything üëç"
Kiwico will probably stop sponsoring mark rober after he came out with a competitor.
"This is so secret
Mark: Ok guys this is how you get into my super secret base"
The crunch lab box is a copy of Vsauce curiosity box
I will definitely try it out
What age group do you suggest for the boxes?
this building is the most mark rober move he has ever done
"What a pity it is not possible to ship it to Brazil, I think my brother would really like it"
If I went in the fome pit I might start drowning in it and I'm young sooooooooo ya
"Of course he has to

looks like something i would make is minecarft lol
ooh
Great idea for a future project
OMG Mark!! You‚Äôve outdone yourself here üòÇüëèüèª
With all these gadgets Mark Rober could win a war
One of the most based YouTubers
Crunch Labs! Let‚Äôs Go!! This is better than the WW Choc Fact imo (but maybe only smart people would agree lol) üòèüëç‚ú®
Crunchlabs seems a bit close to kiwi co....

Mark this is seriously amazing
Unfortunately #6 may encourage the pigs to just not flush the toilet
"Mr. Beast: Imma give away Willy Wonka‚Äôs factory!
Mark: 0:46"
"Awesome as usual. Mark Rober? More like Mr Awesome! Okay, that sounds better in my mind..."
so the door locking toilet seat... in the event of a fire how is the person supposed to be able to escape to safety?
Can I buy Fat Gus plushy‚Äôs

I love this
This is amazing
Keep up with watermelons love it

This is cool and all but WHERES SQUIRREL MAZE 3
"Hey, really cool project I got an Issue tho, how are the Kids supposed to solve the issues if they have a step b step guide. And its too Hard to just build on their own because the result is determined ?"

this reminds me of the Peter griffin going inside the staircase into a laboratory thing
every person's dream
This guy is Mr. Beast: Engineer Edition
I wish I could get the set I ben watching you since you be designing your haloween costume you came such a long way
And this is how Mark Robert becomes the richest person in the world....... Take my money!!!!!!
"He‚Äôs like a superhero at this point. Fighting criminals without breaking the law, secret base, and special gadgets"
THATS STRAIGHT FACTS!!!
@Landon Park Namtab!
@Don't Read My Profile Photo ok
Batman.
Hmm something seems suspicious here it says view 3 replies yet there are 4 maybe it is because one of you tried to take yours down or maybe one of you is a bot...hmm
"Mark Rober i have a question, what if you like to create and build but don‚Äôt have money to get materials?"
"I think alot of this realised that it's not just mark rober working on this with a few people here and there, he actually has a team"
this guy is inspiration incarnate.
I don‚Äôt know how I ever missed this Cribs episode
But is there a secret underground passage that leads into your kitchen pantry?!
I need to know what in the WORLD your brother is doing to be so cool that you need to build THIS to +1 him
I wanna see you make a bow that perfectly curves the arrow for a nerf battle to hit then bounce back to you so you can catch and use again idk if its even possible though

Love it! .... but gotta fix that 'light spill' under the secret door.
"Dude, this mind blowing. Sending education toys are amazing."
"I thought of the movie ""Spies Like Us"".  
""Would you gentlemen care for a Pepsi?"" Hahahahahaa! Brilliant!"
Im early :D
"Mr Beast: Builds Willy Wonka's chocolate factory
Mark Rober: Hold my engineering degree"
Ok buddy
"Mark, you're absolutely awesome. Sounds like years of working with KiwiCo inspired you a lil bit here ;)
The new warehouse has gotta be the coolest workspace I've seen, looks like a fun place tom spend a day! :D"
"Yeah, at first I thought they were partners on this project, but it looks like KiwiCo isn't involved at all.

Well, it's just business, but still..."
"‚ÄúWhen parents asked me how they can I get their children involved in engineering, I don‚Äôt really have an answer for them‚Ä¶ until now!‚Äù üòÇ that made me laugh with his past sponsor KiwiCo. Dudes just pushing them under the rug. 

Sounds like he‚Äôs made an all round more engaging product though."
Dexter would be very much proud
I always thought that the background of the desk was in his garage but this is way cooler
Any chance u can bring these too the UK??
11:00 HE SAID BEYBLADE!
He sure did
Where is squirrel maze 3.0
I think it'd be fun to see Ants Canada help you with giving that ants farm a make over ;)
*phantastic Gus
4:07 cod dolphin dives be like
#6 - can't catch me if I also don't flush
Mark's taxes must be manic
Wow
Im surprised the ‚Äúfavorite uncle quest‚Äù is still ongoing
Incredible Stuff
Who was the FPV pilot?
dude is living my live üò≠üò≠üòç
"Amazing Video, Room and Project! Well done Mark!"
You're an amazing person.. üëè  Thank you for all you do and your videos.
You underestimate the power of 4chan
Sorry to burst your bubble but the light under the bookshelf totally gives it away.
Here before 1m views is crazy
i would of totally buy these if i could afford it :(
So cool!
I don't know what to say XD <3
why would you tell us the secrets tho?
I have a friend who also made a train horn bike and it is quite the work of engineering.
At 4:13 you said no mark rovers were hurt so is there more then 1
you are one of the best human i know... gratz for beiing you!
Mark just can create anything from fantasy with the power of explaining music
I need that crunch lads box üì¶
These videos are always so cool and epic
Nice job Mark. But can you make an airbag that would initiate if it detects somebody falling you probably should use lidar or something like that
Wow your smart
i hope the crunchlabs objects arent limeted
*539k people
"""heyy Vsauce, Mark here..."""
Hey Mark any thoughts on hiring some college interns over the summer for Crunch Labs?
"Are you In n
ework"
"You are fantastic human being, I love your videos attitude and approach to life. You are truly an inspiration"
14:42 wow now they building a clash of clans base defense
Mark is truly an inspiring person
I want your crunch box so bad but I don't have the money.üò≠üò≠üò≠
All fun and games until someone moves the shipping container without telling you ü§£
Yo when can I visit
I fricking love that he has the same workbench.
Love It Mark Rober! I‚Äôve always wanted a place like that too.
You know your the one who inspired me to be a maritime engineer
Mark Rober builds a meth lab
Oh my goodness this is so cool! This  fulfills every single one of my childhood dreams. Thank you!!! You're the best.
"Sorry mate, but what does your former sponsor kiwico think of this?"
One of the coolest videos I have ever seen üòé
ITS ANNE FRANK!
"Warehouse? Bruh, this is your own personal Batcave."
So it's kiwico?
‚ÄúSecret passageway bookcase‚Äù‚Ä¶ with the light shining under it from behind ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This looks like the best physics class ever!
does it use co2
"Mark, can you help Ukrainians against the war with Russia?"
ok for some reason this video made me wanna play DOOM 64
You've been watching Ants Canada haven't you?
I‚Äôd love to meet Mark. Seems like a great guy
"I'm glad he made it a 70's office, not conspicuous at all..."
I could see being either half asleep or half lit and trying to grab the rope handle to drop down and just missing it all together and stepping off to my demise
Nice
Shipping to germany?
This is amazing I‚Äôm so sad I can‚Äôt get one
KiwiCo: We're never going to financially recover from this
When Marc Robert copy Mr beast
that tennis ball gun thingy is deadly
Are you secretly Batman? That place is amazing
Loved it
It feels weird that I'm early
Mark love you and your videos but the crunchy lab boxes  seem  like a knockoff of tinker crates except that you added a video and pins other than that it's just a tinker crate. (I'm not hating on it and mean no disrespect and I'm probably going get a lot of hate comments because of this but I just feel like someone needed to point it out )
Amazing job mark. while I don't want to go into engeneering (Im more into IT) I hope that these boxes will reach people enough so that they can have fun and make more people enjoy engeneering and want to learn more about it and go into it. <3
Great video but I feel like Mark just completely ripped off Kiwi co
Superhero cave.
Next time he's gonna make an exp farm in real life. Just wait for it.
üò≥
"If it‚Äôs Mark Rober, you know he‚Äôs going to have a watermelon üçâ lol"
"Aww, baby's first claymore!"
crazy
"Way to back your sponsor Mark üòÇ.
Basically KiwiCo is regretting its life decisions üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ."
cant get sadly (its not in my country) hopefully soon though
"There's a flaw in the ""No Hand Wash Alarm"". Just don't flush ;)"
I swear I wouldn't be surprised if he had a... Math lab from Breaking Bad in there.
What camera did you guys use the film the onboard view on the hot wheel car?
i see these ones meant for kids......and i really want an adult one now thats more....complicated buidling things was always something i enjoyed and being an engineer was something i wanted to be but just couldnt get through the schooling....
Ult√≠mate frisbee ‚ù§Ô∏è
Make a tv show there.
Is it Available in India?
My dream hangout area
This is like kiwi co but better
You are definitely the bill nye of the next generation
"mark, whyyyy"
Amazing
Bravo Mark üëè
I wish it was Guss labs
Kiwiko 2
What if I didn't flush?
Mark rober is like a child except really smart and can make whatever he wants lol absolute legend. Incorporating fun and work.
"Yeah! Another sweet video! This is so cool! Can you do a collab with TKOR or Unnecessary Inventions? I would also love to be able to have the chance to come to crunch labs but sadly I  live in Canada. Mark if you see this comment, just know you are my absolute favourite YouTuber. I have been following your work ever since I got access to YouTube from my parents."
Please tell me there is a Mark Rober/MKBHD collab video coming...
KiwiCo shaking in their boots
The secret engineering lair is literally my dream
I always wanted a secret safe.
Rip kiwicoüòÇ
I cant g‚Äôet the chrunch laps because my mom says it üò• and i live in denmark
Ur a great guy but these crunchlab thingies kinda remind me of kiwiko like the box is the same size and the things are basically the same ur building something out of cardboard or whatever like idduno feels like a knockoff
Omg wow they got MKBHD and Mr.Whosetheboss both some of my other most fav creators
"Anyone else think Mark was shouting a bit too much in this video? But otherwise,  great vid Mark."
Woo! - can you get the boxes in the UK?
Engineers are just people who refused to grow up
"11:45 Seeing that twisted and mangled piece of metal just makes me think about the damage I caused to a robot that I helped program over a year ago now. My school has a robotics team that competes in FTC, and I was testing an autonomous program during lunch at a competition and completely twisted and bent the axle about 180 degrees, rendering it useless. That also wasn't even the first or last axle we damaged that season, we lost three or four axles in that position due to both autonomous and human error"
"This feels like the natural evolution of those kids shows that foster creativity

I love it so much"
Now expand your warehouses to interactive science museums/exhibitions in different locations around the country.
"I love your workshop, new life goals"
when Mark makes a new video its always a banger and you know it!üíó
Mark. Release the children.
This is amazing
"""As you can see there is a large refrigerator behind my office. It's where I keep all the dead bodies."""
I want this. I want this so much. But I want it as an underground fight club kitchen.

He‚Äôs gonna get robbed
You are awesome Mark
Yay he posted again!
"""Think like an engineer""



*WACKS EVERYTHING WITH WRENCH UNTIL IT WORKS*"
Does anybody know if they will ship to the UK ?
"@Mark Rober


I think you officially made @Mr Beast jealous."
"I have a hard time figuring out the audience for this channel. High tech glitter bombs, but for 8 year olds. Mark, make a second channel for kids."

Dang only if I had money
isn‚Äôt that just a kiwi crate
"That is an amazing idea! Crunch Labs boxes is something i would have loved as a kid! I was always the one taking my RC cars apart to see how they work, and wish i had something this cool to do instead"
Hi
where is squirrels part 3
Amazing idea and cool place for kids! üëç
AWESOME!!!!!!!!
58 minutes

Only a donut?
Rengoku??!?!?
dude please stop yelling
Is crunch lab available in Germany?
hey mark you should do a collab with thehacksmith
i need this
An idea from me!Make a robot that can box.
"Watermelons: Exist
Mark: And I took that personally"
This video was marvelous!!
"THIS is my childhood dream, the PERFECT hideout!"
No way
Well done. The crunch labs build box and facility is top notch
"Now I‚Äôm jealous, this is literally the stuff of every kids dreams"
THATS WHERE YOUVE BEEN
I don't have enough money and my mum wont let me well I am not really surprised she doesn't even let me get stock for my make-shift business.
Nice

"When mkbhd is in a cameo just as ""an ultimate frisbee professional"""
I own a fantastic gus plushie
I guess we all want a secret room. But it's Mark Rober who can actually build it!
Nice. Looks like Kiwico 2.0
√ú
When I'm older I'm going to be a ce (combat engineer) because of you
"Mark, a few years back you posted a video about flipping a coin‚Ä¶ I think you should make a robot to do it. Where you can both have an equal chance, or rig it"
That's one of the coolest things I've ever seen!
you are now officially a mad scientist
THE LEGEND FINALLY POSTED
This is great
This guy must be stopped XD
"ok mark, i have to know, how much money did this all cost?"
U
"Well it‚Äôs not a secret anymore, now is it?"
Dang this is amazing
Mr beast is gonna bye all of those
I love your vidioes about science and stuff
Can you buy these boxes in other currencies like GBP or is it just USD?
Ok gruncle stan. Where‚Äôs dipper and Mabel
"I feel super bad for the kids' other uncles, honestly, the competition seems quite unfair"
I love your videos I wish I could be an  engineer just like you one day
Freakin Awesome!
Nice
"3,455th!"
I WANNA BUY THESE
Dang
NICE!
Dude!  A super secret room no longer remains a super secret room when you make a YouTube video showing everyone your super secret room. Duh!
Another great video Mark. Every video is never disappointing
Brilliant! I love the hard work and intentionality into all of this!
Mate you should have a team produce/write/film a Home Alone style mini movie in that place!
Epic
Cool.
This is insane
First million
6:20 yooo graze the roof from pvz
Similar to Kiwico?
Now you need Steve-O to come and take a shot to the body at full power XD
I've imagined a underground TV room.
I love this
I want a kid just so they can do the crunch lab boxes! Please never stop!
YOU'RE THE COOLEST SMART GUY IN THE WORLD
Like a badass scientific Fantasy Factory üòéü§ì
Mark this is your best video ever
58 minutes
Give me 2 decades and I will make a bat cave of the same manner
so you copied kiwico ?
This is where your coworker conveniently disappears off to when you're looking for them.
What‚Äôs up mark imma huge fan
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
Mark Rober you are amazing
"If I could meet you for a day, I think we could make an elephant toothpaste rainbow tornado !"
Yes
That office was amazing and wow science is cool
I would buy theses but am broke
uhh mark you play button is kinda close to a flamethrower will you mind putting the flamethrower far from the gold play button
"So, this is Crunch Labs. Does this make Mark the Cap'n?"
Keep up the great work
For some inventions
"WOW THATS SO COOL 
I WANNA LIVE THERE!!! ü§©ü§©ü§©"
Hello mark
WOAH
The toilet thing is funny but that is for sure a safety violation. What if someone has a stroke or heart attack? The door is locked unless they can close that seat.
I was just watching some pvz vids and when I heard that theme I freaked out
This is really awesome. You've come a long way! Congrats üëè
i am 13 so can i have a crunchlab
"How does the door lock for the toilet get through regulations, seems like a huge hazard in times of emergency hehehe"
this is just rob dierdecks dream factory thing and also kiwi co lol
It's not a secret when you tell everyone....
Hey Mark
Mark didnt you just copy the kiwico box concept?
Mark is taking closet nerd to a WHOLE new level.
The other uncle must be pretty cool if Mark is still competing with him after all these years.
He‚Äôs hacking
"Mark Rober, but with the Dude Perfect set."
"So if I decide to have kid(s), I wont be able to give them this, cause it will either be sold out or decomposed..."
Wait what!! üò®

There is light under the self at 6:26 not hard to tell there is a secret door

Not so secret now is it?
Here because I saw a go kart. Nice.

Any chance for a collab with Stuff Made Here?
"Hey Mark, I love your video. I have been watching then since the Beginning. It is my birthday in a few days and I would love for you to sign a mark rober hat because that has been my dream"
there's something that I had a go at where you attatch a harness to a wire and you just float down.
"""Did I miss a video""?

Omg I'm just super early! <3"
"2:40 I wish we got to see a family friend 3x your weight go off it lol, just to see it work ofc"
I have some ideas
Nice!
Sold out.... I'll get it next time >:)
Lots of us were here before the Crunch Labs YouTube channel was a 5k subscribers just want to say that :D
"Mark, what would you do if by any chance the ants escaped üòÑ"
That‚Äôs like a dream come true for me! Having a secret entrance and everything really makes me wanna become an engineer just so I can do it myself :D
"@Prajith SenthilKumar true, but one can dream"
agree but unfortunetly not all of us will be able to do something like this as it is simply impossible(unless you have the money) to get the plot of land the team and your personal stuff wired into it also obviosly the money
Admit it you wanna be Batman
Reminds me of Q Tech from James Bond
Awesome!
Hi :)
Wow this is beautiful! I can‚Äôt wait to see how much more amazing content comes out of this!!!
"Hey Mark can you make a kit around tornado sirens and make them cool sounding and to appeal to the siren geek's, also make a squirrel maze 3.0"
Can I be in one of your videos
I can see the light under the bookshelf which leads to the secret room!

Hmmmm what about a staircase that flattens out into a ramp
"I, currently want to be a surgeon but I still absolutely love physics and really enjoy mark robers videos. Even though I want to major in biology"
very cool

Me at 21 contemplating getting the box just to spend a a day with Mark
All I need is a bedroom
"Could you do a video about nieces and nephews vs uncle, or uncle vs uncle"
"Its always been my dream to have an electric train track that winds throughout my house, do you think you could build that?"
"Yay, new vid!"
ME ETHAN LOVES YOU VIDEOS
is this warehouse OSHA certified?
This is some of the coolest stuff I have ever seen I never want you to stop posting
I love your videos
kinda early‚Ä¶.
Mark Frank
I simply wouldn't trust that target. There's probably some trickery going on. Like it moves just enough so you can never hit it :P
Yo
You are so cool for doing this
"I like that you have not only created this massive lab, but also simultaneously made it like an easter egg/escape room style thing to try and find it. It will be interesting to see how many people, if any manage to find the secret entrance"
"When he showcases the tennis ball cannon for the first time,you can see smoke rising out of where it hit."
HI MARK
This is soooooo epic!!!
I'm pretty sure this isn't just your dream marküòâ
This warehouse looks A-MAZE- Ing
This is is I imagine what the batcave would look like if batman was jimmy neutron! Great job mark üëç
"I love how when mark tells chopsticks to play a banger, they modify the music to have piano in the background! Clever touch!"
"first mrbeast, now mark rober. i guess everyone want to build willy wonka's factory"
"lab not so secret, 17:14 see the light under the bookcase....now not so secret"
??? What do you mean
Did @markrober just crush his previous sponsors business model kiwico by iterating on their idea üßê
"I‚Äôve always wondered what would happen if you gave a million bucks to a highly motivated, super creative engineer type.  

Turns out it‚Äôs everything I‚Äôd hoped it would be! Lol absolutely wild!"
Mark Rober is cool
In dexter‚Äôs laboratory‚Ä¶
Someone just lost any and all future kiwi co sponsorships üòÅ
I‚Äôm so glad you finally achieved your childhood dream
you can see light going through the bookshelf mark so if anyone was curious or slightly suspicious the can see your secret entrance
:^D
I WANNA VISIT IIIIIIT!!!!
#6 Not a great idea if there's a fire. This is a law suit waiting to happen.
Yes
"Although a great idea and a natural one for his career, I wish there was a mention of Kiwico, considering Crunch Labs is Kiwico branded Mark Rober. There are now competing competitors and it's bad business to shoutout competitors, however they've sponsored many of his and other big science youtubers. He wouldn't be here without their support so I really hope he gives them a mention for fostering his goals and ideas."
@JJSameer he's said _that exact sentence_ about kiwico before. ridiculous
@Lucas Compton it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt matter the length of how long he‚Äôs been on the platform. Kiwico have sponsored him which is like the only way to make money on YouTube. He‚Äôs owes them everything.
My thoughts exactly. Kinda rubbed me the wrong way when he said he didn't have great idea when parents asked him how to foster that passion. He's been sponsored and by Kiwico so many times üôÅ
"Mark made videos looooong before KiwiCo even existed. He might have worked with them in the past, but he doesn't owe them anything..."
well its not really secret now
Not available to Mexico üò≠
I personally enjoy rekrap2 more
"If you google the definiton for ""cool uncle"", google gives you the link to this video"
Mark can you please make this available to British people because I really want to make those builds
This is one of the best advertisements for one of the coolest products I've ever seen. Always giving 11/10 effort on your videos Mark <3
You forgot the whole tools part lol
If Kiwico was public their stock would have just been dumped üòÇ
It‚Äôs literally Willy wanka for engineers lol
Mark Rober just stabbed Kiwi Co in the back ü§£
Mark doesn‚Äôt  just make cheap videos with low effort he actually tries and each video he makes is always better than the last
So you‚Äôre essentially the American version of Hacksmith industries
Mrbeast is way better than you just to let you know
<3
No kiwi co was harmed in this video lol
This is my dream
Ummm cool
OoO....
Rober‚Äôs Laboratory
For the algorithm ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is amazing
Mark did kiwico dirty
There is gonna be a museum about mark rober.
My childhood dream
As a kid that waremansion looks like a kid heaven. Dude u inspire so many people to invent and follow the ideas u always dreamt of. Thank you for yet another amazing monthly video!
Best. infomercial. ever.
Bro just has kleiner's lab from half life 2
"Wait, did u reevent kiwiko? :)"
Imagine Collin Furze collabing with this guy
This is awesome Mark!
Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
He is the best uncle
"This is great, Mark. How excited you must be, bruahaha! ü¶ß"
Ur best. Love ur passion and videos ‚ù§Ô∏è
55 minutes late
This is friggin amazing
"Willy Wonka? Hmmm sounds familiar... almost like I've heard that recently

Ngl this one is better sorry Mr beast"
This is somehow far cooler than the hacksmith warehouse
this is the sickest place to be at when ur gonna work
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen
"Should have got chopsticks to play ""graze the roof"" from PvZ (6:28)"
mark rober is a genius big brain he is just a tiny more big brain than me. I have an iq of 10 and he has a iq of 11
Seriously impressive Hot Wheels setup!
@Don't Read My Profile Photo we never did
@Brian Patterson the newer legend meets an even newer one

I‚Äôd love to have that toilet room in my own house
"This kinda reminds me of Zach Kings ""office"""
"Mark, I'm glad you're using your talents for the betterment of humanity."
"Ooh the myth of the compostable plastic bag. The EU already tried and failed. Composters need much longer and higher temp, which most just don't have the money for."
This reminds me of Battle Universe

Except at 06:26 you can 100% see the blue light emitting from below the bookshelf making it pretty obvious there‚Äôs something being it
This is so impressive
Mark... we need to talk about the beam of light shinning out from beneath your bookcase.
No shipping to Bahrain:(

Not even 40 minutes and the month to month sold out already!! Insanity!

You are absolutely impressive :O i want it too :O my childhood dream
We need more people in the world like you sir keep up the amazing work sir üòâ
THAT IS SO COOL!
Let's go Nitro!!!
someone has been watching mr beast
Mark is a literal genius.
What happens when someone forgets the foam container got rolled away and jumps of the balcony?
I wanna know what if you dont wanna come cuz if you get it what should you do like email you or something?
A movie come to life
"I came here for Mark Rober, I got Gravity Falls"
I love your videos and I want to be an engineer like you when I grow up
Wow just Wow
so cool mark
this is like the kiwi boxes
This is SO cool!
"Here's my secret entrance that no one will ever figure out! Just don't tell anyone...& if you do, tell that person not to tell anyone..."
This looks straight out of James Bond
"bro built his own aperture science, he's just like cave Johnson"
This dude is so wholesome.
No other words just DOPENESS
Lets be honest what is stoping Mark Rober from becoming Batman?
very cool:)
SO COOL!!!
Is this limited to north america ?
It kind of reminds me of Anne Frank‚Äòs secret Annex
Willy wonka factory for engineering üòÇüòé
mark is actually really cool
YESS NEW MARK ROBER VIDEO!!!
Wo
Honestly if I was younger I'd definitely ask my parents to get me the crunch box lmao

"I was very hyped and added to buy it for my daughter, but it does not have Chile as a country for delivery :("
"6:28 need to eliminate the light coming from the lab, not so super secret if you can see there is something behind the bookcase. Regardless this is awesome and I love your videos and courses"
Very nice video!
There are very few people who know how to live life to it's fullest - you are one of those people!

Competition for Kiwi Co. Mark's going to have to sponsor some YouTube videos to catch up.
Hmm
11 seconds is he saids i will give you a hint not a hint just gave it out that's not a hint
hello neighbor basement door?
I love this man's Content
"If you gave an adventurous kid:
- practical knowledge about engineering
- even weirder ideas than it already has and
- a TON of space and money,
something akin to THIS happens.

Mark, don't change. Ever. This is fantastic!"

"I spent part of my childhood in Portland, OR and there's a place called OMSI there.  I swear you've recreated their children's room and I love you for it."
36 minutes
Can you be my freind
this video is so fcking epic
U so amazing
Literally everyone‚Äôs childhood dream
"I'm not much of an engineer myself, but I can totally agree with the idea of failing over and over again in order to make progress. I just finished my Junior year of highschool, and in that time I took a woodshop class that allowed me to choose whatever I wanted to build, and gave me a year to do it. I chose to build an entertainment system for my room that would fit my needs and satisfaction. I cannot tell you how many times I screwed up in the process of building this shelf, and this shelf taught me the lesson of that design process ten-fold. I had to change the way I went about putting it together so many times and every time I screwed up I had to remind myself that I can fix it and make it work. As of now, it resides in my room functioning way better than I could have hoped for. I'm not sure if this is exactly the kind of lesson you are trying to teach with the CrunchLab boxes, but I can say with confidence that it is incredibly important to know about and I think I can tackle future problems better now because of it."
"This is really cool, I‚Äôm so happy you did this! Thank you Mark for always being creative üôè"
Your awesome Mark üëå üëè üòé
This place looks like a super hero base
üòé you're wonderful and you're so funny you're also one of the best YouTubers mark for life baby
Can you make your own stuff with the crunch lab box sets?
I can not believe how AMAZING the warehouse is!
this is so cool! Ur so amazing with all ur experiments. I love how you do so many incredible things! Keep up the great work!!!
HE'S BECOMING BILL NYE THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mark robers believe it or not museum
Well that was more of an advert video
"500,000 view in less than a hour!!!!!! Your awesome!"
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
Rip kiwico
What type of engineering is mark?
This guy is a genius at making money
"The average person doesn't happen to have been a gorrilla weed grower so okay,but I would have noticed that immediately just being who I was..."
"Please please pretty-please let it be such a huge success that in a few years' time, there will be a German version (and Chinese and French and Romanian and Spanish and Thai and Suaheli and Ukranian and Afrikaaans and Georgian and Russian and Comobidian and Pidgin-english and Lao and Swedish and Bergasa Malay and...)."

He's outdone Half Asleep Chris
Ok i need a similar warehouse asap
Mark you are so cool I love science and engineering I am 8 but I try to do my best doing science lol.

Only Mark would make a secret door that opens up to an ENTIRE WAREHOUSE of the most epic engineering fantasy factory
"Out of pure spite, I am going to do this to prove u wrong."
It's a bit... off putting to brag about it like this.
"Did you know, he makes $70,303 from one video?"
<3
It's your turn üòÇ
Those kids are telling their friends about their uncles secret lair and nobody believes them.
Cool!!!
Day 156 of saying ‚Äúthat I love your video‚Äôs‚Äù till I get a heart from Mark Rober
I want that bow
mats a genis but he is also just a guy that wants to live his childhood dream pranks.
Please license that to Brazilian Parents!!
17 min long merch advert
im choosing mark to be our zombie apocalypse leader
Mark is that guy in word problems that buys 45 watermelons

"As a mechanical engineer, specifically cnc machinist, watching your videos fills me with excitement to watch my children discover the world on engineering. You sir are an amazing human."
I guess kiwi co won‚Äôt be sponsoring this channel anymore.
Crunch lab is literally kiwico
"Mark is just a absolute great Human beeing. im always exited when a new vid got uploaded. keep it up champ! 
Much Love from Germany!"

POV: mark has the genius idea of making his warehouse deductible
Oh well It‚Äôs not a secret anymoreüòº
This some Gus Fring ish
"i feel like all men, including myself, are all ten year olds in larger bodies."
Hey mark rover can you make the longest silly straw
"I'm from europe, so I can't purchase tre crunch labs box :("
Mark has once again made our day
Would have loved to have the boxes when I was first discovering engeneering as a passion unfortunately I'm past that threshold already. Love your content and wish you luck with your new business. Thanks for helping me discover engeneering!
The light under the bookcase for the secret passage makes it somewhat noticable.
üòÄ
I want to come but im only eleven and my mom probably wont let me come but i still want to come
Does software engineer count as engineer
I've wanted to have a warehouse for ages and hopefully I can make it true like yoi
How does kiwico feel about these lol.
This is the dream house we all wanted when we were little kids
Early?
I love your video
hi great fan
Wow Mark Rober keeps suprising me of what he'll come up with. This stuff is insane
This is SO DARN COOL
Ayy before 1m views
small note: you can see the light under the secret entrance to the lab! you may wanna fix that in order to keep it SUPER secret! (or at least keep it in mind for when you revamp the room)
I'm %110 sure they know lol
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Nice catch, I'm sure it's just to keep it from dragging and the secret thing is just a gimmick. Still very cool though."
"Totally, like a brush door sweep thing."
"In a thousand years, when this place is deserted, I can't wait for someone to randomly find this secret room and be amazed."
As a kid it was my dream to do a run through the American gladiator course. Well done for making big kid dreams come true
This is cool as my cat which is the coolest thing ever
"Mark rober you should collab with stuff made here, you two could probably make something really cool!"
Hi
I don‚Äôt get how he wouldn‚Äôt be the cool uncle
Mr beast 2.0???
"Earliest I've ever been, love your videos Mark   Rober!"
Wish epic
every science nerd's dream basically
"Feels like a kids fun-house more than a lab imo.  A bit excessive, for my tastes, but to each their own.  I want to build my own version."
Do you sell these boxes to germany to ?
"I can‚Äôt even say first in ten minutes, 3k people have already, Mark deserves it"
This is cool that all I will say and that and that and that üòâ
The secret entrance looks like the one in captain america
Mark Rober is one of the best content creators on youtube. You can really tell how much time and effort goes into making these videos.
I couldn't even imagine some of the things that Mark has built in this lab.
"Dear mark,
i loved this video how do you think i can become more like you?

your #1 fan, enimemes"
epic
Did he really say men are pigs?üòÇ
Great vid
"I think i never saw such an interesting and awesome video which is actually an AdvertismentüòÇ
Well done Marküëçüèª"
47 minutes
i DEFINITELY wont put that signature on a check or anything haha
You need to make a video on how to make the firemans piston it is awsome idea
mrbeast has been really quiet since this videoüò≥
I bet mark could make the entire us military arsenal in 5 years
I feel like a few kids would have to take a whole month to think of what to do with you because there‚Äôs so many things that they could do but then also want to think of something that hasn‚Äôt been done before because I feel like kids would have more fun making something their own
How much money does this guy have??
Agelimit?üòÉ
14:16 do you know A channel named Ant Canada
Yes
Thank you for making science and engineering exciting and fun for kids!! I'm glad my daughter gets to grow up with amazing things like this!

This place is the definition of an epic workplace.
0:45 why all youtubers started being willy wonka?
@DeltaFoxtrotDX no not all that was a observation XD i meant only mrbeast
All?
"I can't even believe how cool that is, THIS IS AWSOME!!! I love your videos so much and when you announced the crunch lab I freaked out"
That is so cool !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Ok guys I have a plan.
Whoever gets the ticket makes a discord server and explains where the crunch labs facility is. Then someone goes there and finds the entrance without trashing the place and posts where it is without entering. Then whoever gets permission goes there whenever."
WOAH
The goat uploads agian time to get popcorn
Hii
Do you ship every ware in the world?
Will you or the team pay for the flights to get out there because it would suck if we have to pay
Literally get adrenaline flowing when Mark Rober uploads! The editing is amazing
"Watermelometer is my new favorite word, after parabola"

"I love how Mark gets Nitro on his video, and they both start bashing each other out. Mark is awesome!

By the way, I think Mark's brain has hit the Schwarzschild Radius, for how much thinking he does, that brain of his has to be huge, and yet his skull is only human sized."

Omg
im the 3001 comment
"It's actually people like mark that encouraged me to become the engineer/designer and creator that I am today.  Keep inspiring, love from Amsterdam."
Reminds me of Fantasy Factory.
How is there even any contest for favourite uncle at this point?
"This looks like a dream come true for every kid, definitly want to go there!!"
I hope this doesn't go wrong and people start going to random places to find this
Mark Rober's Laboratory
Absolutely amazing Mark!  We need more people like you in this world!
i bet you sold your tesla ..
Mark- not secret when 2 million people have seen it. Me- there are only about 400k views. Edit: wow 5 mil views
"Not only are you an engineer and content maker, you're also a great salesperson. I didn't want to get the crunchbox originally, but I kinda want to now"
"I appreciate that you always push our younger generation to pursue critical thinking and problem solving! There's been countless times I see both my generation and older gens just give up so easily over the smallest problems , but I love that you made your own engineering box kit! It's so much better alternative  than kiwi co company 

Thank you for your hard work Mark! You're a hero to many!"
Where the heck was this when I was growing up. I always loved engineering and building stuff.  Kids these days have no idea how easy it is to do something awesome.
Hello pease notice me I watch all of you vids
nice.
Hi
rip kiwico
"i dont use soap when washing hands after im done, youll have to make a soap quantity detector maybe"
Crunch Labs is KiwiCo on steroids.
cool video mark ;)
This seems like something people would build in Minecraft never in real life. Congrats Mark on accomplishing something truly remarkable.
"The crunch lab box idea is great and so is everything but not everyone has that type of money so, thats that. for the people who can afford it, enjoy!"
This guy is the Willy Wonka of engineering.
howdy partner i love you
Kinda getting robot vibes from mark making robots that so things better than humans kinda suspicious‚Ä¶
There's an alternate universe where Mark Rober is a supervillain and I'm glad I'm not in it
Both mark and mr beast are gonna be in the record books for being the most phenomenal youtubers ever.
Yaaay
I love that Mark Rober is basically Willy Wonka of physics. Super cool warehouse

Comment from germany
Hi Mark
This is exactly what I needed when I was a kid
I‚Äôm not a kid anymore but watching you build everything you have over the last few years that I‚Äôve watched you it‚Äôs an awful lot of fun. I am looking forward to getting my box so I can build the different things.
The sound effect from Zelda made this video epic lol haha
There needs to be a YouTube award show like the Oscars. Of course it would be very short in length since it would just  be a host handing Mark a bag full of all of them
I want to go for my birthday that's coming up but I doubt I can win.
I love you so much mark
"And they say, that money can't buy happiness..."
Don't mind just waiting for MrBeast to comment.

"I‚Äôm super impressed with the hot wheels track.
I‚Äôm curious if them tiny wheels get hot! 
Do some trial and error and see what‚Äôs going to fail first üòÇ.

When I was really young, I was super into hot wheels, I seen one be broken, and I glued it back together in a different way.
I then started taking apart all my little hot wheels and making my own."
"I I I I ‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt know what to say. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking at my dream building, I want to be an engineer as well and I want a workshop, could I have the lab when your done lol"
This is so cool! An amazing build!!!!!
This is amazing. I so wish I could afford a lab like that as an adult and wish I would've had the kits as a kid!
check your audio levels. lot of variation between dialogue levels and music levels sometimes come in much louder than normal
Mark rober is the guy she tells you not to worry about
"As usual, you need money to win money. Imagine that!"

I‚Äôm turning 16 in July and love putting stuff together for instance I have this BMX bike that has a ‚Äúbed‚Äù on the back for fishing and I made a trailer for my kayak that attaches to it. The only problem with this is that I‚Äôm getting a bit big for it and i will have my drivers license soon, therefore there will be no point in having it. I would still love to sit down (or kneel down) and put stuff together. I was just wondering you don‚Äôt have to (obviously). Thanks"
"Of course, nailed it, totally out of the park there, Mark!! Love it!"
Egg
tell me you have youtube money.. without telling me you have youtube money
Hi
I'm 37 and I want 2 subscriptions for the child I don't have yet.

40 MINUTES LEZ GOO
"Brilliant. I know what I will get my neice when she gets older, and my own kids, whenever that happens."
I am so jealous
"I REALLY want some Crunch Labs kits because I may be 14, but I have always loved physics and engineering. Thinking of getting a kit specifically for that (and from you!) is just so cool."
"As someone who specializes in fridge marketing, this was epic."
4:06 when ur parents dont buy u robux
RIP
Mark doesn‚Äôt  just make cheap videos with low effort he actually tries and each video he makes is always better than the last
"i think i know what you are referring to but, his videos are not cheap, but in fact are more planning that spending compared to other channels"
True!!!
ur soooo coool
"Hmm what video should I do next?
AHA a secret room!"
The secret place is just like in the movies.
"Hi Mark. Kiwico  was one of your  sponsors at some point, now are they a partner in this new venture?"

"WOW. I never wanted to be an engineer,  but Mark,  even I'm thinking about getting the boxes.  (Don't have an kids.)"
I have a question. How do people get the packages if they don‚Äôt live in the US?
"ah, I am a piano ""practiser"" and an engineer. Guess I never thought that they were so similar in terms of thinking :D"

"7:40, Foreshadowing? Or a red herring?"
Don't mind the huge bay doors to the outside. Better paint the outside garage doors to look like a wall. I'm just jelly.
How much is 1 crunch lab kit in riyals?

who else wishes they could do as much as Mark Rober?!
"Mark please hire me. I have a bachelors of science in EE and lots of expierence with rapid protyping equipment (3D printing, CNC, Laser etc) This would be such a cool job."
it's not very secret any more
Really throwing Kiwi co under like that huh.
Early
There was a building in my town called ‚Äústrategic wealth management‚Äù and there was nobody in there everü§î
one thing: you might want to think of a way to keep the light out from coming from under the bookshelf
I first thinked it was sponsored by Crunchyroll
"""My new Willy Wonka factory"" wait, you stole this from JimmyüòÇ"
"This is really cool, althought it's not much of a secret anymore lol"
Why is this like gravity falls
Is it just me or does Mark‚Äôs voice sound different?
Mkbhd and Mr Who's the Boss? ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü§©

That is amazing

"What's the Cut at 13:28 for? If the button turns on the lights, there shouldn't be a cut in the video...
unless it doesn't turn on the lights."
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cut. It looks like the lights just go on suddenly.
One of unnecessary cut
5:22 bruh im not
That‚Äôs what they all say
crazy how many views this has gotten and will get
You should try to do a flite test collab. All they do is engineer RC airplanes. They have designed multiple UAD that better the environment. It would be so great if you could do something because that has huge potential
you have my dream
"I discovered your channel in my first semester of mechanical engineering. I am in my fifth semester now, an I have to say, after difficult college times, your videos make me remember what engineering is all about."
I want crunch labs but have no money. and there's no way my parents will do it for me. a literal snowball forming in the center of the sun.
Congrats mark
"Oh cool, it's the ""look how i have way too much money"" video."
mark uploading and providing us with peek content again. What a legend
40 mins ago?
Mark every time you post a video I love it and watch all the way through they always make my day üëç
naming it crunchlabs does make me a little worried about worker conditions ...
Wow
"mark has the best videos on youtube
aways so creative"
Comment for the algorithm.
NO NORWAY?????????? üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Best video I have ever watched wish I could afford itüò¢
"This is legit, hands down, the most AMAZING thing I have ever seen. I mean, this is what I call every kid's dream. Mark Rober, you should invite Dude Perfect over there! You guys could make a trick shot video or something!"
Sheeeeesh

What if you set up ANOTHER secret exit where you have to get a high score on the arcade or put in the Konami code or something
nice ripping off kiwi co mark
"Is the latest fad in the STEM YouTube space a whole lab. First LTT announces his lab, then you beat LTT to opening your lab. 

Props, sir. Your lab looks awesome."
I thoguth I was the only one that got their hand burn when using it
Cool
This is seriously something out of a movie. I would give a lot to have just a cool secret entrance like that.
Hi I‚Äôm mark rober and I made a secret meth lab from the dea
Wow! Coolio!
"Couldn't find it in the FAQ: will you offer translated content?
It would be great to have translated booklets, as well as subtitles for the videos, especially so we don't get the technical terms wrong. I'm specifically interested in German, but I am sure there's a market for a bunch of other languages. Perhaps some of your followers that are also physical engineers would be more than happy to help with translations."
"Translations / subtitles would be beneficial to non-native speakers not only in order to build the project and learn the science/engineering behind it, but also as a way to study/practice the English language while having a lot of fun."
Definitively agree! I'm italian and there's no actual Italian youtube channel that does the same as mark's one! I would so much like to follow it myself (even though I'm well passed childhood üòÖ)
Servus
This would be so cool
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can anyone tell me the song that the chopsticks play
Mark Rober can you do a video where you make the best Beyblade that would be really cool
Mark this is incredible.
I'd love to have you as my uncle. The stuff you make is on another level

I have been watching since the first video 10 years ago and I was wondering Mark Rober can come to my house like would be crazy just imagine it.
"Thought his idea for the brainstorm room was much more common, the engineering lab at my university has the same whiteboard walls and it's where I do all my hw üëå"
and wheres the watermelon storage room
i wish i lived in the U.S. so that i could get the crunchlabs thing
I feel bad for the other uncles
You and Elon Musk are the coolest people to live
this is awesome I feel like im apart of the Lab already
^OwOv
"THAT IS SO COOL DUDE


hope you teach that in your science class üëç"
The world needs more Mark Robers and now you are helping to make them ! I had the odd teacher along the way similar to the way are but none as amazing as you! This is amazing and you are an amazing Human being.
Mark Rober Makes boring things so much more interesting. Mark Rober would have made 7th grade science soo much more fun
I'm a young kid and I love ur videos my dad is an engineer and he said he can relate to this kind of videos :)
hey mark? how much did all of this cost?
bruh.  dextor lab vibes. üòÇüòÇ4
(7:10)How is he still not the favorite Uncle ?!üòÇ
"""The parents would ask me and I wouldn't know how to answer..."" except that's the same pitch you made when you were sponsored by kiwico..."
cats are cool.
The mad lad did it. He built himself the Batcave

"Looks fantastic!! Call me boring, and I am genuinely interested, but how does your new space deal with dust - especially with all the construction that goes on? I can imagine the Hot Wheels tracks being quite susceptible. Industrial sized extractor fans?"
Hi
kiwico watching this like 0-0
Well here he is the Geinies
its not so secret if you show us XD
honest question: how is this crunch labs box different than the kiwico boxes?
"That is so cool, I will definitely be asking my mom"
That‚Äôs the coolest lab in the world
I‚Äôm pretty sure Mark has secured his place as the coolest uncle in history by now
I wish this was a thing when I was getting into engineering as a kid! I will still be an adult buying this tho
This guy would be the coolest uncle
this is something we all wished to have as a child
6:26 You forgot something. And that the light that explores under the bookshelf
Wait a second you just reinvented the fireman's Pole
This guy would be the coolest uncle
So cool!
whoa
Yayyy new upload !
Mark always makes my day
Ok
This is rad..
Huge blue light under the closet.
i like to think it's called crunch labs because of the sound fat Gus makes when he crunches into the walnuts
"Not so secret now, is it?
Edit : Sorry , did not watch the video all the way to the end."
"1:18 I know that sound, I saw it in fl studio"
@noxy519 ok
"@DoraTheDestroyer i actually did see it, it was in: drums/SFX and it was called ""SElect SFX 2"""

Do all scientists just hate watermelons
"Grunkle Stan, Gravity falls be like:"
Phantastic* Gus
On number 5 used plants vs zombies music
Is this the last video? the ending deemed like it.
My Dad is friends with the American Gladiator Cobra ( steve Luxton )
"Holy crap! The production value Mark! Jeez, what a program!"
the more i think about Mark Rober might be the brightest bulb in his generation
i will definitely buy a crunch lab product once it comes out
Lol
Nice to see Marquez there.
NEW POST!
How did you get the money for the crunch lab
"14:20 the two ant colonies may be at peace with the combined graveyard but just you wait mark
They could start rebelling agents each other (the Great Ant war will happen)"
"@lentokone toveriturbiini well we will see if the colonies start fighting each other, Mark better update up on the ants"
When he said he had two colonies I was instally like: Well that will not end well... Hope you are interested in seeing an ant war
Sir Mark Rober arise........

You have become a capitalist üê∑
I don‚Äôt know if this is intentional but number 9 is the nerf factory and in french 9 is neuf which is pronounced nerf I think
Reminds me of Rob Dyrdek's fantasy factory
Can we get localized crunchlabs boxes pretty please? Specifically for kids non-mothertongue is quite a barrier!
You're the reason I am going to college for engineering. Seeing this whole crunchlabs concept makes me so happy.
me too.üòÄüòÄ

Ok so Mark Rober is the real world Dexter. Now where is DeeDee?
Very cool idea. You definitely help leave the earth a better place than it was when you found it.

Mark rober is carrying the crunch labs yt channel its gaining 10 subscribers every second lol
I‚Äôm early?

Insane!
3:21 i genuinely thought i was about to get rickrolled there XDD
you never fail to impress
"Wait, foam pit, tennis ball launcher, breaking world records and a factory that is out of a ""fantasy"".. hmm feel like I've seen this before."

Absolutely beautiful.

Can you make a rail gun?

16:05 I think I can just look for the dart hole in the box.
You don't pick the box yourself bum they ship it out randomly
I'm positive they cover the hole or something but yeah that's what I was thinking
Yeah nobody saw that light under bookshelf ‚Ä¶
LESS GOOO
What type of engineer are you as i am struggling what to do for my alevels starting in September

"Ok, it's Amazing."
This is just wow üëç

That's so awesome and beautiful.  Sharing so much with a community of people.  AMAZING!  Thank you for your hard work.
Was the mouse hole for the hot wheels from the tennis ball gun
Sadly I‚Äôm not a kid anymore so I cannot buy those boxes and find the ticket üò¢
I am watching your videos for about 3 years now and you never disappointed me . I am only having 1 word to say hats off to your work
Mark just betrayed kiwiko lol
"I know I have been clickbaited but I don't care. I am going to enjoy this, I hope. Thank you <3"
Well its not a secret anymore...
Dude I have nothing but admiration for you. Congrats on filling your life with things so cool every single day
"Hi Mark,

Loved the video, but you might want to make sure that kids don‚Äôt try to hit flames on candles on their own. Who knows what might happen if they hit the candle causing it to fall overüòÖ"

@Mark Rober I want to make a house like your warehouse. Full of secret ways and passages
"@Mark Rober because you're super talented that you can build a robot that can do all the work for you, even my hamster thinks your cool."
What part of our history together makes you think I didn't design this?!?  Of course I didn't pound every nail in but this is like a dream come true for me would never outsource the design!!!
I'm looking at buying this duplex. I was thinking of a pneumatic platform and outer pole to glide you down. It was also softly reset.
Nice Warehouse
This guy is frickin' awesome!

"I'm curious, what does your son think about this? I'm wondering how autistic children would like this. Is it meant to be done by a child independently? I know my brother might get frustrated when he can't do something easily, but hopefully one of us will be able to help him."
You just inspired millions of children....and adults
"I'm so happy for what you have accomplished. I've been following you since 2016, and I've became one of the biggest fans!"
"Half an hour, 300,000 views."
This is so awesome Mark!!! I love all the little details you put in and how it's all so Mark Rober-y! It's clearly an engineer's hideaway if there ever was one! I've been wondering what the space you did your domino video in was and now we know! Nice work!!
He really does amazing work
Yup!
this is super creative
CrunchLabs sounds like it needs a Dude Perfect collab
THIS is why i wait 1 month to watch mark's videos
so amazing
KiwiCo be like :o
This is seriously something out of a movie. I would give a lot to have just a cool secret entrance like that.
My little girl is gonna have a blast watching me have fun with the Crunch Lab boxes.
Platinum ticket !?  Mark is the new Willy Wonka except for cool toys instead of chocolate.
True
I am so happy that Youtube clicks can make dreams come true for you.
"Mark Rober, AKA Batman."
This is not nice bro im broke so I cant visit lol
Real life Dexter laboratory
International shipping?
You are an absolute gem of a person this is fantastic. The enthusiasm and happiness for this place in your voice is infectious. I will definitely be getting some for my son/myself. I have loved your videos for a long time. Can wait to see more and see the boxes.
i loved this idea
i been waiting and i am super excited for the vid
"We now know mark, can someone send me his location ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"I love this! I have always wondered what it is like being around you, but the video shows most of it :)"
"Hey Mark, the lab is amazing! Sounds like your piano might need tuning, though... Nudge-nudge wink-wink. üòâ"
This is a kids dream I would live her and not go anywhere else
Dude this secret lair looks awesome and littttüòéü§òüî• keep up the amazing work mark and hope you're having a safe and blessed day as always stay lit
True
Always love initiatives to help kids. Keep it up.
"16:20  Mark:  ""I'm no statistician...""               Mark is to Statistician as NASCAR is to Pinewood Derby."
This feels like a Rick and Morty episode
"mark, i almost got arrested after i twisted opened a vault in the bank to find your secret room"

"I love mark‚Äôs idea about the crunch labs! I wish I had that opportunity when I was younger. However, I would love to see something similar for high schoolers as well. I think it would be a great addition and would awaken the excitement for science, math, and engineering that has been vacuumed away by boring and unenthusiastic teachers."
Yes
"woah, thats so cool"
Dude that awesome
DUDE!
i need this
I thought this was a NileGreen video
Hacksmith may be the real life Tony Stark but you are the real life batman.
he know how to be an influencer!
Yay! Another Mark Rober video!
Thank you so much Mark Rober these boxes will help me pursue my hope of being an engineer one day
"Just image how cringed out the guy that didn't his hands would be, bruh"
P.AES SEED ME ONE I LOVE BUILD

MARK YOUR BACK ITS BEEN A WHILE
Did Mark just rip off Kiwi Co.?.
He didn‚Äôt

@AwesomeMan116A kinda
Wait wat u knew this was going to happen?
This is AWESOME. This would be so fun to work in!

Yessir
I had to double check if this was actually mark rober because Nile green trained my brain.
9:22 that's actually kinda cool
Literally my childhood dream.
11:27 references The Mario Effect.
Wait no you want it to be up
"Mr Beast, Mark, and Zach King need to have a lair duel"
"Mark,

I Have Watch Your Vids for 2 years And I love Every Single one You Have been My Hero. If You Have read this Plz respond I Would Love If I Could See You in Real Life Plz ConsiderüòäüòÅ"
P.S That Base Is Sooooooo coolüòâ
You can get there from the huge garage door in the middle of the secret warehouse ü§£
All hail fat gus
Holy crap these are actually like affordable it looks like too. You continue to be awesome
dam
I had to double check if this was actually mark rober because Nile green trained my brain.
Money definitely buys happiness.
I'm sure every business owner everywhere loves that you've told people to move and play with everything in every office they ever visit.
4:16 don‚Äôt jump when she shipping container has moved. Then you can use it to ship you to the hospital
"Have to ask, is this the room where all the dominoes were layed?"
This is so cool
It really is!
I'm totally going to sign up for that
im a big fan
I‚Äôm also a big fan
"I got an underground lab too ! 
I make dmt tho"
This is amazing!
Yup! It really is
OSHA has entered the chat
I wish my grandsons were just a bit older (5 & 2) I would send for this in a heartbeat!
This is so COOL!
Finally a new video!
"Claim your here within an hour here!

Cool!
This is my dream
I love how he is so creative

o hi mark
Gravity Falls
John-Caleb Bradberton!
The only issue is there is light showing under the secret door. ;(
grunkle stan irl
Why not just have the seat automatically go down
The secret that a couple million people know about
Still not as cool as Zach King's warehouse üòú
Epic
Well....Kiwi co are gonna be out of business within the month lol
Dude this video is literally the most epic thing I ever seen
"This is absolutely awesome-- I love the pneumatic pulley system. I'm a bit older now but I know that if I were in a younger age group that you're targeting, I would have absolutely LOVED doing projects like this, and I also really appreciate the pretty affordable pricing so that a lot of kids can get their hands on it. Really awesome stuff, Mark! :)"
More kids will learn more science on this channel than in public schools - what does this say America?
The ball going through the wall is like that one episode of Malcolm in the Middle where Hal makes a baseball launcher that busts a hole through his garage.
Wow. Hey siri define mark rober. This is exactly what I think would pop-up. LOVE U MARK KEEP IT UP DOG
I think I can speak for everyone when I say we are all so lucky to have mark  üôÉ
Mark Robert I have a video for you on my channel for team sea my channel is acebadger vk
u have to pay to get to the balcony faster. *enginir*
This is so cool Mark! I wish I could come here!
I fell like colinfurze would love this place
"""Every time someone learns critical thinking a conspiracy theory dies!"" Thank you!"
But a lot of conspiracy theorys are real
honestly the title read like a nile green video
"So, you're saying you have made a claymore for children and instruct them how to build it? Hilarious"
Cool
Cool
that is super cool dude!!
"Weird question, but don't secret passages run into issues with fire safety standards?"
I'm 26 and just finished my first year of my mechanical engineering degree. You were a big reason that I chose mechanical engineering and I still wish to be like you one day.
Mark really just built himself a super villain lair.
Hi
Wish i had crunch labs when i was a kid
I love everything you are doing in this video and how you are representing the engineering community
best video
The secret room behind the bookshelf is the cherry on top.
I just found this video
Ah. Kiwicrate.
thats insane
you are a watermelon war criminal
10:27 30 views in 4 hours??  No way is that Mark Rober.
@redu  I wonder that too
yes i wonder why this video on a channel that nobody knew about only has 30 views
Will you please tune the player piano?
This is absolutely insane
Mark never disappoints
"Thank you for making smart cool, I feel like you should be the channel of choice for all parents that raise kids with an ipad"
Glad to see MKBHD in this video
That is AMAZING. How did you think of that?
how do you always come up with your ideas? My problem is that i dont know how what would be cool to do?!
wow that's awesome
Nice
OMG
"I'm so glad that STEAM kits are a thing now. Growing up, kits sucked (look at any of nerdecrafter videos for the endless examples). Too bad even my friends don't want kids XD"
So awesome! Can I come visit?
who else thinks the mouse hole came from that canon
I can‚Äôt believe the Crunch Labs channel was made on October 27 and now he reveals it. I wonder if anyone discovered it before this video.
Did anyone else click the video without even reading the title?
I love it mark but what about something for high schoolers
"Love these vids, keep it up"
Science class would be 10000x better if Mark was the science teacher
It reminds me of Batman‚Äôs layer. It‚Äôs now my dream to go there!
Says ages 8-12+....does that include 30 year olds? :D
So bro made the Kingsman Lair IRL ??
Will there be multilingual versions of the instruction videos? I'm from germany and I want to give it to my brother who does not have English capabilities at a sufficient level yet.
Amazing
"Yep, this is more important than my exams."
Is it only in America if it is it now s ok love you videos
ok
It‚Äôs all fun and games until a kid pulls the fire alarm thinking it‚Äôs the entrance to a secret laboratory
Great video keep it up
Are you hiring üòÇü•∏
"The mirrors don't become invisible, the lights just turn on in the other room."
Can I pls be in a vid with you???
i wish i had this
Hm
Thats sooo COOL! Lets just think of all the effort you put in your vids! <3
Just Amazing
"Best rhyme ever:
Team trees team seas and my buddy mr beast"
Wow
Just gotta comment on this: Mark called this a ‚ÄúWilly Wonks Factory of Engineering‚Äù‚Ä¶and MrBeast just did the whole actual Willy Wonka Factory
I was really excited about the crunch labs thing and i literally asked my mum to buy it for me and then i found out that they dont do it for uk :( üò≠üò≠
You should make a trick shot video with dude perfect based on the disc launcher.
Adres?
I‚Äôm getting a feeling that the tooth decay poster joke wasn‚Äôt a joke‚Ä¶
Yea. Big secret when millions of people can see that. My closet is more secret than this.
This is super cool! Honestly I have no words that can describe how amazing all of your videos are
"244,000 views in 30 minutes! wow..."
No way you got Nitro. Sooooo cool
E
Lol
pVz music gives me nostalgia
"Let me in
LET ME IN
I NEED THIS"
Mark and MrBeast are doing more for the world than ALL the cowntry leaders.
tiny desk engineer. you need a tiny desk engineer. look it up.
GO MARK GOOOOOO
You'd see a huge brightly lit space below a bookshelf...
"Hi Mark, love your project's! Keep up the great work! üòÄ"
amazing
I take a bite out of these videos and gain information though the taste and satisfaction of these videos. None of your videos leave any taste sour but sweet in a strawberry pie type of way.  you must be on a time crunch to get these out when you were doing your warehouse.
Very cool
Can you please make it possible to deliver here in Switzerland that would be awesome !! üôè I want my 10 y-o sister to do more intelligents stuffs than playing video games üòÖ
Nice
Every popular YouTuber has a nerf armory
this is a straight science fiction fantasy to me
IN CO GEE DOH üòÖ
"6:52, mark goes into the backrooms"
"Forget the builds and invention, I'm in love with his secret base!"
So Mark rober is starting a meth lab?
Let it to Mark to come through in a crunch. Thank you for the tour and educational kits.
W
Idk if I would notice the big light gap under that bookshelf
the secret is that theres a underground obstacle course for all the bosnian children he has kidnapped
Hello
Just wow
hi
You have out done yourself Mark once again!
It looks normal
you are amazing!!
Hi
"To bad I live in Europe and never gonna the light of this warehouse any time soon

And I am *very* into engineering"
why arent u my uncle
Venting
"I'm new to this channel, and this guy amazes me. He's a real life Willy Wonka for sure!"
It's happening y'all this guy's actually turning into a superhero
"""Keep the lab location super secret.""
*Camera pans over to bookcase with light from the secret passage shining out from underneath.*"
Mark never fails to disappoint us.
"Wow i mean, WOW, not only a phenomenal engineer but compassionate, empathetic and an all round morally decent human being and those crunch labs kits are an awesome idea, especially the Willy Wonka style ticket to come play in your engineering dream factory very VERY well done Mr Rober"
What a great guy
w o w
"Sure wish I could actually buy this, me being 15 my dad expects a lot more from me and It's pretty overwhelming, I never got a chance to learn the basics from anyone in my life, but Mark completely changed engineering for me, thank you so much Mark! I'm hoping I could learn mechanical engineering myself by actually building things :)"
W
I was here
This cool but y  Denny's  of all places üòÇ
This is the dream i couldnt get as a child
Yes quite the secret... we are all now aware of. Oops
I would do anything to get in there Mark! That‚Äôs now one of my bucket list things is to be there with you! Your one of idols
"Also, I love science and have always looked up to you! I completely love the idea of this and secret rooms are my passion"
You‚Äôre*
2:23 thats how s&s space shot towers work
Mark
Wow this is amazing mark and your the best engineer on YouTube
KIWI CO ?üòê
"When he had ""225"" as being to heavy, I felt that."
I love the idea of all these cool projects I personally thing I want to be an engineer and the fact the I have the chance to do this is just amazing
"Don‚Äôt think this is a lab, more like a playground, but close enough"
Love the new vid ever times they come out i am happy to see them
"every video he makes has the words ""the passed year and a half ive been secretly building/working on this"""
30 min ago wow
I wonder where this guy would have ended up if he chose marketing instead of engineering
lol
Mark would really be the coolest uncle. He is playful like a child yet incredibly smart and wish to teach the younger generations. Amazing youtuber
"Great video Mark I hope to visit Crunch Labs one day, just meed to fly from Melbourne, Australia to California!"
dang engineer jest want all humans to be a engineer sonds like some thing i herd of naw...
"Imagine a collab between Mark Robert, Colin Furze, Stuff Made Here and The Hacksmith!!!"
Imagine being there...I would live there..
Actually cool :0
This is amazing
AMAZING WORK MARK!!
"""We stole this from a dennys"""
He went from Mark Rober to Mark Robber
Wow
Shipping costs more than the box ):
"Mark I love your videos, but you really need to use some new background songs in these videos. Just mix it up a bit!"
"Love your videos, keep it up"
"11:09 that month's cog wheel will have the word ""Ottawa treaty"" on? ;)"
4:37 am I the only one who noticed that really looks like mkbhd?
Not all heroes wear capes but some build ninja warrior courses for squirrels
"This is an absolute dream. You have been my inspiration for as long as I can remember. I am 14 and my goal is to become a mechanical engineer, you have been my inspiration to succeed, thank you! Easily won the cool uncle award in my opinion!"
"""I built a massive secret lab""

*This is where he is building the mini-nuke for glitterbomb 6.0*"
Hello
"Mark is just casually turning into batman, he's already got a bat cave"
"you made yourself a ""Dexter's Lab""
Living the dream"
Warehouse sponsored by Dennys Coca Cola and Nerf.
YO IM EARLY YAY
"this dude is dope, he just made my dream secret hangout"
The perfect combination of being fun as a kid and being nerdy as a scientist. What a banger of an Office Mark!
mark thinks he's grunkle stan lol
I want one üòç
"I'd have loved this when I was a kid, though I learnt about flywheels by combat bots and Hypnodisc."
Thanks for the smile I have.
This is so COOl
Only problem with the super secret bookcase entrance is the light being very visible under the bookshelf.
Rob Dyrdek looks different than I remember.
That is so cool
Wow
I want my parents to get this box for my brother! I might if they don't. We're all engineers (or getting there) but he's not at college yet. It's time to really show him our passion! I'm tempted to get one for myself. Or try to make my own with the equipment I have. This would be so exciting for me to get especially as a kid. Thank you so much!
"I have a question, how long will Mark be making crunchlabs?"
this is the first time in my life i wish i were in the usa
28 minute mark! Yay
That is so lit
Glad you‚Äôre helping kids that want to be engineers. I remember when I wanted to do the same as a kid that found your channel
Noice
Me being a kid ‚Äú MOM I LNOW WHAT I WNST FOR MY BIRTHDAY ‚ÄºÔ∏èCRUNCH LABS!‚Äù
Nice
How much did this cost XD
"This is giving me DUED PERFECT warehouse vibes but in a Science way, I LOVE IT!!!! great warehouseüôåüèΩ"

Straight out of a movie

We need teachers like you Mark!"
"Please Mr Rober, we‚Äôre begging you, post a video on how to make the glitter bombs so we can get back the porch pirates in our neighborhood PLEASE!!!"
Claim ‚Äúhere before 1 million views‚Äù here
this is so cool! keep creating mark!
I really want to be a Veruca Salt and ask for that stadium. NAH IM JOKING. You deserve it Mark. Hard work sure does pay off
Video #3 of commenting about Graze the Roof being in Mark's video playlist

‚ÄúAlways check the bookshelf in an inventors office‚Äù
"I love how Mark refused to make the entrance to his secret base a book, instead making it a knickknack.

No cliches on his watch.

Except, I guess, for a bookshelf secret entrance..."
Ello
Only Mark Rober and Mr. Beast would say they built a giant secret lab behing a bookshelf
Did you copy kiwico?
I want a carrier like this where I enjoy what I do or makeüòÇüá∞üá™
yooo
Trailmakers ez
Make a serial code on each ticket so nobody makes their own
First thousand.
The crunch labs project is not available in my country(uae)
"Soooo, where can I get one?"
This is amazing Mark! I can't believe the progress you've made on educating the world over the years. Its absolutely mind-blowing and honorable. Congrats on your biggest project yet. <3
Would love to see Colin Furze and Mark Rober collaborate on a crazy engineering project.
3:18
Hi
I have never been more jealous of someone in my life. This is the coolest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Marques Brownlee the professional frisbee player üëÄ
Mark's got his own DPHQ2 now.
This is AWESOME !
wut
I want to be your niece and nephew.
walter white irl
i want this for my gaming room
Yesss
you revolutionized a work area that is fun for your employees and doesnt make them bored ever
"Imagine owning that...
Nevermind I can't ."
Rob Dyrdek has inspired so many people with these warehouse's and it's awesome. So many people get these big spaces and do their own Fantasy Factories. Dope üëç
I‚Äôm pretty sure you secure your spot as the favorite uncle in every video
what about that massiv gab under the bookshelf where the light shines?
Before this I was like ‚ÄúWhat is taking him so long to make a video?‚Äù Now‚Ä¶ I feel like waiting all that was worth it
This is a dreamhouse necessity for sure.
"Welp, it seems like KiwiCo is gonna have some competition"
I‚Äôm really hoping to see future updates
"I Was Here! 199,233 views"
I wonder where he gets these out ideas
I would just turn on the sink and turn it off then I can still get high fives
me when dronks
"Looking forward to the future Mark. CrunchLabs looks exciting!!

Love the cameos."
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Btw love the retro 70's design of the office
Fir- wait no 199733rd!
This guy never gives up
"Mark please view this!! Ever since I saw your videos when I was 6, I was inspired by you, I tried to send you a letter but I lost it. You are the whole reason that I want to be an engineer when I grow up. My youtube channel is too, even though I do coding. You are my #1 idol by a gazillion."
ur mom
drop me a like to prove u read your comments and also thanks for the new vid been waiting alot :)
Fully was expecting Marques to say : *...So I've touring this space for two weeks and I must say it's pretty dope*
The one problem with the bookcase design is that you can see light from the lab beneath the bookcase so maybe if you have some type of curtain maybe on the other side of the bookcase to stop that light then it can be even less detectable but idk I‚Äôm not that creative so you can probably come up with something better than that
"Great stuff Mark, Bravo Zulu Amigo."
"This is really a great thing you‚Äôre doing. I had some learning toys as a kid I used to build things with. I used those skills to do other things in life. The secret lab is the highlight though. I wanted to do that, too, but probably not as well as you‚Äôve done."
Time to buy the entire stock
"the only sad part about the platinum ticket is if u dont live in the us, but oh well, its impossible to have it perfect :p
but ik my lil bro is gonna love the box, thx for making it"
woohoo
Yay!
"Mark's quest to be the best uncle:
Mission accomplished

There‚Äôs already 1.3K comments though‚Ä¶.?
U are?
bro wanted an escape room work area lol
Crunch labs
13:27 liquid crystal with a voltage through it so that the crystals align to be see through
So instead of getting sposored by kiwico you just became them

Farside comic makes me so happy
I love the new vid

Cool Video but isn't your bulding box just a copy of KiwiCo's concept?
This is literally everyone's dream
Bro howü´†
CRUNCH LABS vs. KiwiCo.  Let the battle begin.... :D
I'm surprised you don't want to keep this secret to yourself.  If I made one I might.
Can an inexperienced person build with you?
GOOFY AHH ADVERTISEMENT

"OMG MARK IM SO CLOSE TO BEING 1 HOW IVE POSTed this comment when this was 24 mins but its got 177,888 veivws HOW HOW"
This is like every kid‚Äôs dream! What a fantastic place to work!
The light from the hallway bleeds through the bottom of the bookcase pretty badly
If a parent asks you how to get their kid a head start in engineering and your first answer isn't FIRST robotics you should rethink your answer.
Love ur vids please give me a shout out

mark rober has just lost his kiwi co sponsership
nice
"Dind¬¥t u just completly stole kiwi cos idea? I get that u still put a lot of work in it, but its basically the same thing that they do and u even head a sponsorship from them a lot of times."
I just watched a 17 minute advert and  ... I loved it : ))
Do the naughty kids get a round with nitro?

Ah yes the platinum ticket
Its a kiwi co by mark rober what else could i want
That seems very similar to kiwi co
Who? I don‚Äôt think so
"He's like the Hollywood version of Colin Furze. Better looking, more money, less talented."
this Platinum Ticket is beyond words level of genius...wow
Hmm mm coca cola.... Mmmmmm
Hi
I'm the average person and I found it...
"MrBeast, Mrwhosetheboss, MKBHD, Mark Rober

BEST COLLAB EVER POSSIBLE"
Mark I have always loved your channel but for some reason I fell like you are now more focused on money than the channel
This is how Batman really started. With Glitter Bombs and Nerf guns in a secret room behind a shelf.
"I may live in a whole other continent,
But i still love your video.
If i lived in America i would buy your package.
Hope you post soon. Bye"
$$$
Mark! I'm starting engineering school as a mature student come September. It's your incredible enthusiasm and outreach in videos like these that inspired me to take this leap. I want to be just like you when I grow up! ;)
Kiwi co. is gonna be mad
W video

"And here I thought Colin Furze had the craziest engineering ideas on Youtube. Also, really happy for Mark that he can live out his dreams. Well deserved!"
Will videos be available in Spanish? Very intrigued for my little brother. Feel like he may have potential he's just currently in M√©xico. Awesome video regardless.
Why does it feel like the whole lab was designed to cater for children?
"Looks like 9yo me having fun with marker and paper.
I WANT IT."
Why are you copying Mr. Beast
Now Mark shows that he actually never grew older than the age group he wants to work with the most... Just that he's a child with a huge sum of money now.
Suiii
"Reminds me of the fantasy factory, but for engineering. Dope."
HELO THIS IS LIKE AMAZIN PLS REPLY MARK
Nice
that pvz music hit different...
the light under the bookshelf gives the position of the lab away.
AHAHAHA!!! (that horn on the bike!!üòÜ)
That cool
The Zelda audio clip reminds me of the day I received my gold cartridge copy of the legend of Zelda for my birthday and Christmas by the way Yes what year was that 87
love you
Just. Just wow! ü§©
What if im not from us how do i get a box?
The amount of progress u have made over the past few years has been astonishing.
Mark really out here living all of our childhood  (and adult)  dreams

kiwico watching this video: -_-
This was really cool
My Minecraft base in a nutshell
Hi
i don't know why but my main takeaway from this video is that i have decided to dedicate my life to beating the hot wheel track record
Could my parents buy a crunch lab box/creation in germany ?
I watched like all your vids
"nobody will ever know!----162,404 people as of 6/15/2022: interesting"
"11:24, ah yes, pi = e = 3 and sin(x) = x"
U should make a soccer goalie
It reminds me of Gravity Falls lab.
You never fail too amaze me
Lol if someone breaks in mark will just blast them with his tennis ball launcher
"""Deversion of expectations = comedy"" 
Now that's a golden quote if I've ever heard one"
"about to finish secondary sch planning to study engineering in the future u make it look fun, hopefully it is"
Genuine question.  Why is he always yelling?
I mean it kinda looks like a knockoff fantasy factory
That is one long advertisement. And I don't mind.
Mark you e inspired me to become an engineer I'm my future and I have an idea I would love to see you make... I had the idea of a taser that uses static electricity
Mark Rober and MrBeast are slowly becoming each other.
"he is finally upgrading from the workbench my a ""subtle"" margin"
Willy Wonka was a visionary
4:38 is this Marques Brownlee? Form MKBHD
@*visible confusion* no... he still does... He talked about it in his podcast. It's kind of the NFL of ultimate frisbee and he's real into it
Marques used to play in a Frisbee league  before doing youtube full-time
@Tony Thompson oh it is
Yes
I love this
I love ya mark
Thanks
if there is a small hole in your box you basically won
This is so cool
mark rober is like the willie wonka of  chocolate  science
Wonder what sheldon has to say about all the engineers thereü§£
OMG I want the boxes
"I‚Äôm definitely getting the crunch labs boxes for my little brother, we have been fans for years now and you haven‚Äôt disappointed us once! Love the vids and impatient to see more of your secret lab!"
Mark Rober Does not upload often but when he does im here lol
"Will the month to month be available for the first drop? I would love to try this, but I just don't have the money for 12 months."
perfect if the cops raid your office
I am cat
"Am not sure about the whole toilet seat thing, but im gonna trust you that i wont break and get stuck lol"
All of his fans breaking in

Grunkle stan?
I can tell someone will be making a whole video about trying to find the lab
is it me or does his voice sound different
There was so many things I legit forgot about the tennis ball launcher lmao
Oi
"""I'm gonna give you guys a hint"" proceeds to show the exact method of getting in"
"MARK ROBER
MARS ROVER"
Sounds like kiwico
Love it great work I wish I could do stuff like this in boring iowa
"note to self, if ever get the chance to meet mark and visit his lab, remember to close the toilet bowl"
"additional note, wash hand, never use the air fresher and look at light just in case"
Mark Rober is going to be a billionaire.
Great  job I like this I have  learned alot!
Certified Greg moment.
The bright light coming from under the bookcase isn‚Äôt a dead give away or anything üòú
i love this youtube channel mark
Mark mind if I work here
Man‚Äôs built the setting of a Disney channel sitcom
So we‚Äôre not gonna talk about the mkbhd visit
"Honestly, I'd rather pay the same to have a shop filled with some Haas and Doosan mills."
"Can't wait for some kid to get a box with a ticket in it for their birthday, and never open it"
You can easily spot the secret entrance by the glow under the shelf 6:26
So that is where he has been keeping NileGreen.
Amazing! Did anyone else clock the light under the bookshelf?
The light under the Bookshelf is a little obvious.
Congrats mark üéâ
so cool
"As a future mechanical engineer, this leaves me in awe. I love this love. I think I might have a crush on Mark now. LOL"
Mark you are a legend
The light coming from under the secret door gives away the secret door.
this guy is like a better vesion of Elon Musk! also how do you cleean out the ant farm?
I got in trouble for touching everything at my dentists. No secrets found
"""secret entrance"" *has a massive glowing light coming under the crack under the bookcase *

I love all you're vids
i was tne 869th subscriber of crunch labs
dam i get it
This is awesome
What does kiwi co think of this?
Its like Kiwico But on Steroids
Best video so far...
this is just a mr beast video with different editing
"I bet everyone has thought at least once ""Wouldn't it be cool to have a secret room behind a bookshelf""

Mark just went ahead and did it üòÇ"
"@PMLGMR What are you talking about, John Green is doing great."
"He wasnt the first one though, but it didnt really end well with them..."
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e !!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing amazing amazing. You are doing more for our kid's future than many school systems these days. Kudos Mark. Ingenious ideas.
It's no longer a secret
"Mark Rober, you are the best, can you make a video on computer programming
I am a big fan of that and you"

"Amazing work Mark.... 
What I think you should do is to get Colin Furze over and make a mega project... or even do it both ways, Colin comes over to you and make something then you come over to his an make something."
WHAAAT
Give me the room
lets take a moment to appreciate how much time he puts into making this stuff for us! Keep it up mark!
fard üíÄ
Marks in direct competition with kiwico ?!
love the theme song
Haha downvotingg for the feministBS about toilet lid open. Saying men are pigsis funny but I bet you wouldn't make fun of women the same way would you Mark? Freedom of choice means you get to keep the lid closed and I get to keep it open and both of us aren't infringing on each other's freedom
A
I DIDN‚ÄôT EXPECT TO BE THIS EARLY 21mins
"I still don‚Äôt get how he makes this, amazing."
"Great build!
But one suggestion:
There was a bit of light coming out from under the bookshelf, should be easy to change with the makeover"
Imagine going that would be insane
Amazing mark hats off
You don't ship to Montenegro üò≠
Is it just me or does anyone think that this is where Mark tested Dom?

You could help schools with the crunch labs boxes.
Where's #1 it ends on 2
Sorry on is not a permanent thing it's an idea never mind
My kid is only four so I hope the CrunchBox is still going strong when he's 6 or so!

This is how we continue on the path to innovation.
nerds rule!
"The warehouse is really cool, such a room has always been a dream of mine
 
only one problem is that the light source from under the bookshelf gives away its location"

Noice"
I wish I were Mark Rober smart.
I need to know where I can get one of those toilet seat door lock things for my house lol
Wooow... Epic video Mark as always

INSANE WORTH THE WAIT !
This just got a ton better
Mark even refilmed the hot weels end so the camera wouldn‚Äôt be in the shot
new vid=awesome
Hey mark I just wanted to see if you noticed but there is a light gleaming under the bookshelf and I think that makes it obvious there is a room behind there (only if they're observant can people see it)
I really really wish I had stuff like this around when I was growing up. But I'm content with learning by proxy these days.
Your a genius x
I'm a kid and I love to build
Ummm grunkle stan??? Lol that is so gravity falls
Mark is the Engineer version of Batman
Your very own Batcave üëå
Crunch should never be celebrated. It's inhuman.

The light shining through under the bookshelf door is....sad.
My dream would be to go there! It looks so cool!
People from the outside who sees a massive building üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Didn't kiwico sponsor your videos? There was a solution to sparking engineering for kids. Marketing at its best. This is an alternative solution mark. Congrats.
This is crazy amazing! Crazy what engineering can do!
Let's do calibration at lodza later
This is now my favorite video on the internet.
Epic
The office looks like a attorney's office or like the one from The Office LOL
This is literally every child's dream
Can I have one?
He made the literal Rover Cave
Mark rober  invites you  to a office. You think it‚Äôs boring. Walks into a secret lab. Wow
"Wait, wasn‚Äôt the warehouse used for the domino robot the same one as this one???"
Sweet
Thank you so much for finally uploading!
"Mark, you are every kind of smart."
8k views and it was posted 3 minutes ago
"""Because men are pigs""...? Wow nice blanket statement there buddy. Funny how you probably felt perfectly comfortable saying that about men, but wouldn't dare say something similar about another group of people."
me ?? :(
Mark you are one of the most inspirational STEM based YouTubers there is. Starting that box to help foster kids imaginations and a true love of learning and discovery is something I wish I had growing up. Never stop my friend
True!!!!
Did he just cut fire?...
this is how I imagine my future house
"Ferb, I know what we're going to do today!"
how did he know my dream-
Mark robers next video: I built a secret tunnel to mars
"Hey You send it to Poland üáµüá±üáµüá±üáµüá± ??? 
I would like to buy something for my child 
Maybe someone now??"
I‚Äôm really curious how you are not the favorite uncle yet. What are their other uncles doing and their channels must be awesome too.
Can we all agree that Mythbuster was one of the many inspirations for a lot of us on the 2000 springing a lot of engineers in this time
Looking forward to an eventual collaboration between Mark and Stuff Made Here.
"Going big or going home - Mark's choice is never in question! Go, go, go!"
I wanna see Mark collab with Backyard Scientist again!
"But before we see if I actually live.

"But....there's light coming out from underneath the bookshelf....kind of a dead giveaway something isn't normal:P

Mark must secretly have grown up with a meddling sister called DeeDee.
I can not imagine how much money this costed
Wow
Stellar!
"Here, 5000 miles away, 4.A.M, Your Amazing works makes my heart beat. Thanks MARK Your video always inspire me."

Hi
Are the upward-to-downward inflections in Mark‚Äôs voice a regional thing?
awesome office
Hi I'm a big fan and I would like to know when and how do i do your next class
100k IN 17 MINUTES
Would it be a possibility that having your crunchlabs videos in other languages?
Amazing
"how to get to mark rober's cool lab:
1. track down the ticket winner
2. go all Mr. Slugworth and offer them money to tell us where the lab is
3. go to the lab
4. get arrested for tresspassing"
I have zero money so I would like to buy it but I can‚Äôt :(
"Love it, excited to see what will come out of Crunch Labs!"
Second attempt at trying to suggest you doing a video about FRC since its amazing and meaningful and awesome also when parents ask you what 8-12 to twelve year olds can do to start om their way to becoming an engineer FLL is the perfect answer in my opinion
I thought this video was gonna be how he made a secret entrance
"after Mr. beast's Chocolate factory video and yours this (Special Mention: MKBHD's Studio tour video), I literally inspired a lot and set my goals for the future. Thanks for being here all of you guys... lots of love from India"

@Prof. Parabola thank you so much

Would be hilarious if a package thief finds one out and wins the ticket

I really hope it doesn't come out one day that you're a chomo building all of this to attract kids. I don't get that vibe just sayin I hope that doesn't happen.
"i‚Äôm a legal adult and i‚Äôm still tempted to buy the crunch labs build box thing

This is such a wholesome YouTuber
k bro
I'll buy This place for $5Mill. Hmu.
For some reason I feel that moving the foam container around the place could have some consequences
Need to prevent the light from shining underneath the bookcase
WOW! This is so Cool !

YOOOO
I guess kiwico won‚Äôt be a sponsor anytime soon anymore ^^
oh so this is what happens when you let the engineer play with their tools.
That‚Äôs so awesome that he got his piano to play the Mark Rober background music lmao
What happens if the toilets switch breaks or the doors?
"Mark Rober, you're not a quirky education scientist. Steve Spangler is."

How about we collab and I translate these videos into German? I‚Äôm always a bit sad that things like kiwico are English only ‚Ä¶
that foam pit does not look up to code. put a safety railing on there or something.
11:08 Mark  Makes  a Claymore mine lol
If I at least have this

"8:17 you sure you didnt had an answer? Because i think you would have told them to buy Kiwico. But i guess you wouldnt be making any money with that recommendation, and thats why you made your own box: The Crunch Labs Box!"

Mark Rober x DudePerfect = Office Wars. Nerf Duell

I think the fact that Mark has dedicated a whole piston to being an action movie protagonist is a sign that the environment might be **a little** hostile.
Much better than mr beasts factory ngl

@TheRmbomo my thoughts exactly!

It's always interesting to see what a person does with their cash when they make mega-bank off of YouTube videos.
Amongus is not dead
"Continue the joke

I need to know. Did Phat Gus ever have babies?
I love his Science videos they‚Äôre really fun and awesome
Mark is back in business
"Wow, just, wow. If I would have that place, I wouldn't need any more things in life!"
"I love how Mark refused to make the entrance to his secret base a book, instead making it a knickknack.

No cliches on his watch.

Except, I guess, for a bookshelf secret entrance..."
Seemed like a cliche to meh
wym? my office looks just the same.

"The biggest fraud on youtube, you can't build anything"

This is like every 8 year olds dream lol
"Ok,"
"10-1  are my favorite ones
(That is all of them)"
how about an entry like agent P ?
I feel like Mark is an adult on the outside but on the inside but a middle schooler on the inside.
This is SO cool! This makes me wanna make a secret room for myself üòÇ
Lol
Mark rober is turning into a breaking bad character with this lab
Mark has done it. He's created a lair.

Mark Rober NEEDS TO TAKE A STAND AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE< NOT GLORIFY SHOOTING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AT KIDS FROM ABOVE.
I would love to have the dopamine levels of this of Mark.
I think it‚Äôs a museum for everyone because science is for everyone and fun is not just for children
Yeah it‚Äôs super noise

Quite early
I watch all your videos and I love science
"I'm not sure why Gustavo Fring needed to hire Mike and all those Germans to build the underground lab, I feel like Mark would have been a much better asset, not to mention he would have probably provided the meth-making equipment."
Yay
This guy is literally batman

Always a great video!
Awesome
Woah
