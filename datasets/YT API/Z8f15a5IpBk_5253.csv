"i love this Vietnamese aunty british accent

congrats on 6 million !
Uncle Roger be like flavour is like money so put whole bag of msg but turn out the saltiest broth in the world
I like how he did go many things he said not to do when reacting to other videos
"Normally we put ginger, onion, shallot, and garlic in the oven to char"
2:01 kinda dark
"""You know what MSG stand for? 'Make Shit Good'."" I can't agree more, Uncle Roger!"
I am sorry Uncle Rogers but MSG is not good for you
I know he kills these people when he dumps the msg especially because meat is so expensive
I love Pho (Because im VN and maybe everyone in VN love it :D)

Damn that a lot of smg 😱

You know its good food when youtube even comes to watch it
"Foreplay is a waste of time 
- Uncle Roger 2022"
Vegan pho made me miss Real pho with actual meat in it
It's all great until... You put all the MSG into it =_=. MSG must be used appropriately. Too much will make your tongue uncomfortable after eating. Makes you not feel the exact taste of it. MSG must be used appropriately. MSG must be used appropriately. MSG must be used appropriately.
"""Sorry children"" my favorite part"
10:42 funniest part of the video xd
My parents use induction stove but they char ginger and onion with foil wrapped around it.
"IT'S THE THING FROM FORTNI-






jk lol TERRARIA"
"Jesus Christ, I got nothing against msg but you def trashed that broth with a whole bag of it. Even if it's for the shot. It still got in there"
"Pho, sounds like Fen “粉” in Chinese. I would assume the two are relatives."
SALT ON CRACK ALWAYS GETS THE JOB DONE
Asian always hold the whole bowl I know because am a fellow asian
FUIYOOOH
"I'm from Vietnam and I couldn't be happier to see our traditional dish ""Phở"" is on this episode. Mrs. Thuy is correct. Authentic Pho doesn't have MSG in its broth. There are a lot of restaurants that serve ""Phở"" in Vietnam. Some of them traditionally make broth from bones, meat and other ingredients like in the video. However, in order to make more profits, some restaurants just add as much MSG as they can to its broth and you may not feel the difference. But we, Vietnamese, who eat Pho more than anyone else in the world,  can feel the difference between MSG-based broth and authentic broth. In fact, To add more natural umami flavor in the broth, we often use dried ""Sá Sùng"" (a creature found in the beach). They are quite expensive but delicious."
Finally.. something I can criticize him on..that’s not a induction thumbnail when he was roasting the grinder and onion..that was a regular convection cooktop..
Haiyaaaa Unco Roga you put your meat in dirty ass metal sink ..... disgusting
cấy tô ăn của ông Roger vói lại cô Thuy hơi nhỏ cho ăn phở. lắy tô bự lên!
"If you guys want to remake it, remember to quick boil your meat and bone. Bring it to a boil, then drain out all of the water with white cloudy meaty clums, just left it. You cant use that unless your broth will have blood flake like in this video. Also, keep an eye on your broth, slowly cook it and skim it when needed. Only then my soul can rip 🤌🏻 for keep the broth clear"
The book caressing is giving me hsc flashbacks
"I love how you roasted 2 of my people, the irish and the french lmao"
I think she got traumatized with all the MSG you put
It brown
"Why have I not watched this guy before? This is my type of cooking show. There's a difference between swearing because you're a twat, and swearing for comedy.... Guess which one Gordon is?"

uncle roger put to much good shit in his bowl
Auntie thuy is so genuinely wholesome so it’s a very stark contrast from Nigel’s uncle roger character who is the purest example of a loose cannon. I like the interaction between the two. So good.
"6:33 **pulls out MSG from his pants**
Auntie Thuy: Oh hell nah 💀"
"“So mean to Westerners”
No as a westerner it’ll never be “too mean”"
"Uncle roger, your hair still there after eating that much king of flavor?🤣🤣🤣"
"For real though, wouldn't that much MSG essentially destroy _any_ food?"
Anyone from Hue?
"12:26 Fucking LOL, yet she has a more English accent than me, an Englishman!

Happy 6 mill man. This was comedy lol
Now I wonder if her speaking voice would have been the same if she'd grown up learning Vietnamese only. Because my brain cannot combine this voice with the occasional Vietnamese I hear. Is there a video of her speaking Vietnamese?
People gonna piss out sea salt

"Well isnt it sad that uncle roger can barely cook but critiques chef for not using the proper technique. 
Each chef has his/her own style of cooking and you cannot judge the taste of the food just by the way its cooked. some simple dishes itself taste fanstastic and critiques from these kind of people affect their careers of course. 
For example: How do you think jamie oliver became such a renowned chef? Do you think the people who eat at his restaurant has lost their sense of taste? Like people just send their dishes back and immensely critisize for an underdone steak or overcook fish. Everything has to be perfect in these kind of restaurants.
Coming back to uncle roger I bet he can only cook egg rice cos thats the simplest dish which doesnt require much effort. This guy can't even chop a garlic finely. you give him a fish to filet or butcher a chicken i'm sure it'll be a mess. He doesnt even have a proper kitchen to cook at and is always cooking at someone's restaurant. Although his content is funny its not fair to support someone who can barely cook. ask him make something he's gonna load it up with MSG and artificial flavours. 
I also don't mean to disregard the traditional techniques and flavours used for traditional dishes. They have their own class and the culture of the community needs to be respected and protected.
In the end it doesnt matter on what or how they cook. all that matters is taste and the smile it puts on the face of the person eating. this is the essence of cooking and love"
I'd love to see Uncle Roger do a review for the channel Bok Young. She cooks some very yummy Korean food.
"if you freeze the meat before cutting it thinly its easier to cut.
sadly, its been frozen then.
but yeah."
2:19 thats cause somehow some manganese ions got in the fire somehow (me a nerd at sience)

"Have you seen Irish people cooking veg? Expect soup.

I say as a man in Ireland. They can't even cook their own national veg... Potatoes you'd think they get it right.. But no always queen's potatoes, mushy bland, dry flavourless.

You're expecting wwwwaaaayyy too much.

But then I can't agree enough about the whole TV chefs fucking up every recipe they encounter.

If you want a fast pho, that's fine, but it's not authentic, call it fake pho, because its not the real thing and I think people need to be more respectful of the important of food in other people's cultures."

"“Cause no one wants to make vegan food. We don’t give a s***.”

As a Vietnamese person, that is very true in my family. My parents killed our chickens for food, I heard them screeching for help as well."
I am Vietnamese and a bowl of pho makes me think of the screeching sounds of animals when they are murdered. Some Vietnamese love to make vegan food.
I really enjoy your videos! Will you be doing a video on Auntie Esther being on Iron Chef?!?!?!?

Rate KWOOK fried rice and pho
I wanna see it
Can we spread this
I nearly spat out my drink from the amount of MSG he put in the broth lmaooooooo
No we don’t use msg in pho
"Chef
Noun (shef) 
A person who cooks shit you can't."
I've been to Auntie Thuy's shop and would like to congratulate her on how accommodating it was to all the aussies there. The ceiling was very warm and nice to sit on.
"Maybe Uncle Roger saw you, that's why he was throwing salt. May your soul rest in peace!"
"@schoolboy405 is your a still o, or did you put it back on? 😁"
Lmfao
"Uncle Roger is the leader of ""micin"" generation."
I may need to buy the second book. I didn’t know that’s the way to pay respects to your parent
Uncle roaster :)
I make this at home. Bowl of soup cost me 100$ Hi fuken ya.
The super nasty sexual jokes are the best part. I love Uncle Roger.
You’re name let me remember about gold roger- 💀 (btw I love your contact keep on the good work ✨🤌)
Msg=make food soo good🤣 I died laughing a bit there as he poured a whole bag in there

"I really like pho, so maybe I will try to cook it.  To cut the beef really thin, is it okay to put it in the freezer for a few minutes to firm it up?"
Funt fact: Phở without accent (Pho) means hooker in vietnamese 😂😂😂
"I have been trying a new dish and noticed that every recipe I find brags about being MSG free... and that's just WRONG! I promptly looked up Uncle Roger hoping to find a recipe with the MSG... and couldn't! So I just have to ask if Uncle Roger has a suggestion for an Egg Flower Soup, with MSG!"
Happy 6m uncle roger
"https://youtu.be/ZnhlRTteL8w

"MSG, Make Shit Good a classic Uncle Roger"
"Oh god, the whole bag"
What if Uncle Roger hits 7 millions? Can you ask Auntie Hersha to cook Biryani?
"Uncle roger, pls sharpen the knife before cut the meat. That knife cant even cut toufu properly. That is a basic knowledge even 3 years old kid know"
2:40 It's how Vietnamese truly pronounce Phở
Her personality is so cute lol
When will Jamie Oliver respond to him...
chúc mừng 6m sắp (chú hiểu được thì đọc nha😂😂😂)
3:12 that “no you cheap” 😂💀🤣
Hi Uncle Roger i think you must react Brian Tsao Egg fried rice
"Review auntie Esthers ramen, you will love it 🍪"
"I was a chef for 14years and worked in places like zuma all sections and i will never work 60/80h a week to get paid the same as a waiter, actually less cause they get tips.
it's not hard to get chefs, you just don't want to pay decent wages and provide decent working conditions like decent changing rooms actual breaks and decent staff food,
 basically your business model is based on exploitation and starvation wages
it takes minimum 7 years to become a good sushi chef however, now i'm on my 3rd year psychology degree so next year i'll be making more money in less training time, why can't you find chefs???
they get better hours and same wage at tesco hahahhaha good luck"
Fuiiiyoooo
Congrats uncle roger
"Uncle Roger should go watch Primitive Wildlife, its very.. wild"
He ruined it with all that MSG.
😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬💀💀💀💀💀☠️💀💀☠️
"Jesus christ uncle roger that is a  shithouse pho dude. Really really bad, even jamie Oliver could make it better that that.  Cant believe how bad it is. She cant be viet, 2 pommys trying to make pho bo. Fooyu 
-No narrow bones. 
-Didnt boil at start 5-10min tip out, wash bones n pot, start again fresh, fresh water. Never boil, just bring to, them very low!slow simmer
-Onion, ginger not charred enough, should leave some black char on it for flavour
-Never add fish sauce or msg at start, never,  only at very end add these
- Dont add spices,  ginger,  onions at start either. Last hour or 2
- Use shitload of marrow bones cook at least 12hrs, very very slow bubble
Probably more shit things but I'm tired to check extra shit things u do
Oh yeah, daikon is no secret thing at all, it's common thing used
Was there brisket? I forget. It's the best cut for pho bo.You forget that too probably"
Vietnames people love MSG 🥰🥰
"My grandma always said, ""too much msg will make you go bald"". Uncle Roger balding soon after this episode."
สวัสดี​ครับ
"Come for the pho, stay for the joke 😂"
"Hey, a fellow Malaysian here. Sadly when you drop MSG into her family recipe, I can feel every ancestors around the world descending from heaven to end all human being"
gosh I love auntie Thuy's voice so much
"As a vietnamese, i felt pretty fine watching this video :). But tbh, this is not how TRADITIONAL pho should be done. I mean, every steps u did are all fine, but they are, IMO, for the Southern pho. Pho is originated from the North of Vietnam, so..u know what I mean.. :) 
p/s: anyways, I'm happy that you have hit this huge milestone, thank you for letting people around the world know more about our best dish 😁"
I GASPED when you emptied the packet. That was a LOT.
I love her voice omg

Fuiyoh 6 million subscriber
too much MSG!!!!!
Roger is not funny. He lacks  creativity in his jokes.
Roger needs to stop advertising that all asian food needs msg. No thanks.
"My asian mom amd grandparents never puts msg in the cooking! There's so much flavour already, more appreciation for natural tastes."
you gonna make fur
"""Frendch people who take over your country, they're mean""

As a Vietnamese, this is too savage :))))"
I felt that.
french indochina pretty brutal
"@Alex S my brother is american! I like history and american too specially the independence era! My country is very complex, it used to be the creme de la creme of Spain until we had our independence in 1821."
@CULI-FABRIZIO United States and I don’t know much about Peruvian history except Simon Bolivar but I’m definitely going to research about how Peru got it’s independence.
@Alex S yours?
She's cute LOL
"Oh my god, that's too much MSG.  My god."
Bila nak buat nasi lemak?
Thats ACTUALLY too much. If i had this pho i am on the toilet for 2 days straight. Kind of disgusted now. The Pho is ruined right?
"@Chef Thuy Pham you deserves more than 100,000 subscribers like aunty liz channel haha"
@Chef Thuy Pham 🤣😍🙌🙌❤❤ Thank you! I know its comedy but whenever Uncle Roger puts MSG in a dish i feel the thing is ruined 🤣😂
"Luckily I made another pot! Don’t worry, I’ve got it covered! 😝"
Tbh U just fucked up Pho with that amount of your MSG. I’m pretty sure that broth tasted like water in a pond
MSG makes shit good 😂😂
"Thank you so much Uncle Roger, for making this on special episode. Auntie Thuy, you're such a talented chef, please keep it up your good work. I'm Vietnamese, too, and I'm really proud of the food, culture and nice things that you've shown to them out there ✌️❤️"
💚💚💚
That MSG pour had me in tears!!
Roger ruined pho with MSG
I feel bad for aunty Thuy.  I enjoyed watching it though!
I love her voice tone ❤️
“This sound remind me of something.” 🤣

"foreplay a waste of time.. ""youre cheap"" lol"
Too good!😁👍🥂
"She is so sweet and loving person. And when she told about her book and her past, she showed her heart of gold. Such an angel."

This is hilarious!
Lol very funny video
"We need more books with home style recipes. I like to walk in resturuant ask a chef to make me something your mom made you. Those who will, are actually proud to do so. A shocking request rsp in U.S."
to others.
Uncle Roger is starting to become a menace and I'm here for it 🤣
Did he pull the MSG packet from out of his crotch??? 😅
i love how nigel never breakers character. at all... its awesome and very respectable as a comic. Will Ferrell would be very proud.
Protect that woman at all costs
"Use induction, to char get a kitchen torch.  They're super fun to use!"
Msg doesnt make food better when its bad it doubles the taste for example:if your food is cooked by Jamie oliver  and you add monosodium glutamate its gonna make that sh*t worse if your food spicy  it makes it taste like chili Jam spicier and sh*ttier if your food is good THEN it makes it better
Anyone else say the title of the video in Uncle Rodgers voice...
Always traveling with his bag of special white powder.
I hear american in her voice and it make my brain hurt
Bought the book cuz Uncle Roger knows the Pho is traditional
As promised send everyone some ramen noodle!
"All good, but I thought Chinese cleanse the meat by cook from cold water, must not hot water. Why Vietnamese do the opposite?"
Gold. It gold
Oh I get that joke australians live on the bottom of the world
The editing is too good
it is legit Pho. Look yummy!
Haha. Omg so cute. I am happy to see our Vietnamese phở here 🥰

"Auntie Thuy: This is Vietnamese kitchen, here everything is calm
Nigel : I don't want calm, I want WOK TOSS, always"
Uncle Roger! Pls review Mama Mai’s pho recipe from Hello Hunnay! She rinsed the meat 😅 after grilling it on the stove
shouldn't the broth be white and clearer and not so brown?
i love aunty thuy's accent.
"Damn bro

Upload more often bro I’m depressed af and your content helps a bit
bowl of pho full of bones???  Ancestors weeping inconsolably and legs down from chair and running away...
Uncle Roger will get msg cake
"YES PHO NOM NOM NOM.

I love me some pho. But I don't have the patience to make it myself lol (says he who makes brisket, ribs, pulled pork etc on the regular).

Aunty Thuy is just delightful."
"“flavour is like money, more always better” uncle roger’s wisest words yet. Also congrats on 6m!"
"wise words, from a wise man."
Honestly one of the only creators I fan boy over. And PHO. I've eaten pho twice a week for a decade. Can't get enough of it. Perfect video. Not many people can make me laugh these days. Thank you uncle Roger.
Good to see an Aussie friendly restaurant. 🦘
🥰🥰🥰
I like Auntie Thuy.
💚💚💚
This guy is annoying!!!
"I like how we still haven’t gotten the beggars chicken video but we got pho, both are good but I still want to see him make beggars chicken"
waw.. just love this IDEA so much... great to watching.....
Uncle roger should say PHOiyoh instead of fuiyohh just for this veeejio
Gordon Ramsay is scared 🥶🥶🥶
Fish sauce has msg.

Felicidades! For That 6M! Nice vid
Why American say pho its phở

Congrats Uncle  Roger may your success and humor be known FUIYOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"""Rememebr foreplay is wase of time"" ""That's because you're so cheap"" LMAO Sounding like an old married couple already"
😂 😂 😂
Now we all know Uncle Roger's sex face. 6:55  It's the perfect amount of pleasure! Hummenah hummenah meow meow!
Uncle Roger was raised in a home with full of MSG diet.
bro really messed up a whole batch smh
"Careful uncle Roger, dont go further than this"
No such thing as “vegan  pho “. That’s vegetables soup.
"She sounds like Gemma Chan, or is it just me"
Aunty thuy is hot😅
She's so sweet!
"Uncle roger: puts half a bag of msg


Me: ok then why not just put msg in boiling water, PHO! Why spend hours with your beef if you can just put msg in water"
@Chef Thuy Pham thank god
Don’t worry! I had another pot uncle Roger was not allowed to touch!! 😝 x
Similar spices for making garam masala indian cuisine. :) :-) I love it.
"As a westerner I’m not offended lol
Yeah I have cowboy boots what of it!"
everyone shits on chinese government shills everywhere else whys this guy get a pass
Hard to believe it tastes good with the whole bag of msg
AMAZING I LOUGHED SO HARD XD
Auntie Helen has been quiet lately….
Funny how this mf racist as shit 😂
I just subscribe
Uncle Roger can't cut meat. Haiyaa
"This video really lets you appreciate all the time and care she dedicates to crafting the best flavor, the dish looks amazing and I am tempted to buy the cookbook."
"Vietnamese cooking is beautiful in so many ways. Often, the best dishes are the ones where the ingredients are simple, inexpensive yet cooked with clever techniques, lots of care, love and respect. We had very little growing up in Vietnam, but every meal was so stunning! I never want these flavours to get lost or forgotten. I took two years to write my first book as I was working 16 hour days, 6 days a week! 😮‍💨 I think you will enjoy the stories even if you don’t cook from it! ☺️ (but do! It’s yummy!) x"
It hurt my eyes to see Uncle Roger adding the whole bag of MSG. I almost couldn’t believe it.
"Remember niece and nephew, just a pinch of MSG is enough! Uncle Roger pouring that much to get cool slow-mo shot for camera only"
I want the vegan teacher to react to uncle roger
it be so much fun if you react Swedish kitchen making rice
I was the 6 millionth sub.
"Gotta love how Aunt Thuy is so nice to Uncle Roger, but at the same time doesn't give a fuck and commands him around 😂"
😂 It’s an Asian auntie’s tough love style 🥰
Aunty Thuy is right the pandemic was good for laziness 😂
"Haha! 😂 Jokes aside, after the laziness, it made us re-evaluate our lives, our priorities, and we had the time to step back and saw things from a different perspective. Business owners were forced to diversify, it was sink or survive! I can’t wait for my new chapter with food! 🥰🍜💚"
"Chemistry is off the charts, super funny"
💚💚💚
"as a Vietnamese person I'd like to say a few things, the meat cooked in the broth (brisket in this case) should be taken out after 2-3 hours of cooking, don't let it cook in the broth for 8 hours, it will fall apart and you don't want to see falling apart meat in Phở. I think most people don't know that Phở has its name because of its noodle. Phở  is actually the kind of noodle, just like Italian noodles have several kinds (spaghetti, fusili, tagliatelle, etc.). This dish originates from the north of Vietnam where they serve Phở WITHOUT soja sprouts and strong herbs like basil or culantro, only coriander and spring onion are in the Phở. Of course each regional Phở has its own beauty but I personally think that the beauty of Phở lies in its subtlety, clarity and that it stays elegant and minimal. I think Auntie Thuy's Phở is too heavy (although I really love meat too) to be elegant. Thanks Uncle Roger for letting people know how to make proper Phở!"
The outtakes are the funniest 🤣
I‘d love to work in that kitchen….a calm and quiet SPA…the book is great btw
"I’ve been told my kitchen is too calm and quiet to be an Asian kitchen! 😂 But I’d like to think, the noise from my restaurant would be from diners enjoying our food and having a good time. Our chefs are happy and loved, so our energy and focus are on creating beautiful dishes, with complex exciting layers, all balanced and bursting with flavours! 🍜🥰 I’m so happy to hear you have my book! Enjoy! Xxx"
"family ""secret"" pho recipe"
Omg auntie Thuy is so sweet ❤️
💚💚💚
loved this video! auntie thuy is a delight!
💚💚💚
"Jesus christ, 6 mill subs, for some dude acting like an uncle chan, wow!"
"Roger; always a perfect gentleman, sharing every technique 🤭😋😗"
"8:09, I mean I can't get a sense of nostalgia for obvious reasons, but now I'm definitely interested in owning this book."
Yay!!! 🥰 I’d love for you to own it! You’ll see what mean 😂 These recipes should not be lost! Every spoonful of these dishes would take me back in time… I want to share them with as many people as possible! 💚 xxx
https://youtu.be/h0IPcqF2q9U it’s a link to a video
Aunty Thuy doesn't have funny accent like uncle roger.
"5:57, was honestly expecting this part when he said this how you teabag uncle Roger."
Outtakesが特に面白いよね〜‼️✨
Man’s gonna die of MSG
but in my country gas stoves are literally the exception 😭
"Love Uncle Roger, he is so hilarious to stop westernizing Asian food. Funny he gave uncle Gordon a shout out"
😂😂😂😂 yo this dude is hilarious.
How about celebrate 6 millions with uploading 4k video from now?
"When she said “everything is calm”, I was like… the food yeah, the mothers are absolutely not. 😅"
"😂 😂 😂 I agree!!! My kitchen is too calm for the mums, oh and too many rules! They don’t like rules, unless made by them! 😝 x"
Happy 6 million fellow Uncle!
"First time watching your video, you are amazing!"
"First time watch him, this uncle Roger is hilarious"
sooo I hate uncle roger he is so rode
"OOH I'm going to see about that location being used as a setting in my friend's story, it's overall set in London, and the main couple go out to eat a lot."
unsubbed. kind of tired of the character of roger now nigel.
Her cookbook is awesome - the honey and coconut caramelised chicken thighs 😍.
Yay!!! 🥰 Definitely my go to dish for chicken!! X
Uncle Roger is a hot mess
"Yo was that a lowkey dig at Gordon hahahaha 1:16 ""This is how Uncle Gordon toss his fried rice in Indonesia,"" oh man haven't laughed that much in awhile."
PETA gonna be all over uncle Roger for that beef talking bit 🤣🤣🤣
Tea Bag Uncle Roger!?!?!?!?! HIYAAAAAAAAAH!!!!
"The meat is supposed to be crispy and Well Done . Wheres the pan wheres the pan?

According to brittish tv atleast"
I really wonder what a whole msg package does to it :D
"Reminds of Russel Peter's ""why don't you pho off"""
MSG is like money more is always good king of flavor😂
My understanding is you boil the meat with COLD water to push out the gunk.  Using boiling water does not work.
I hate msg n every india hate msg... Maggie is banned for 7 month coz of msg.........
💰💰💰 for you ♥️
Somebody please explain that Australian joke to me lol
"If you par freeze the beef, you can slice it thinner, easier."
"Tbh, u totally spoiled our Pho out with dat amount of msg 🙂"
Don’t worry!! I made another pot that is edible☺️ 🤫 lol
Congrats!
"MY ANCESTORS ARE CRYING
edit: i forgot how much recipe videos by middle aged viet people are there"
"You don't need to put MSG in Pho,Lol"
Aunty Thuy has her own channel??
@Chef Thuy Pham ayooooooo she replied!!
Definitely finding time to start something. But I’m active on Instagram if you are there! 💚
"That is a spa.  You get ""massaged"" in the spa . Human flesh gettin massaged... That is hot stuff."
U gotta warn us when u play the forbidden sound
TEA BAG 😂🤣
Show them how it’s done!
It's funny that this clown says they do it better than western society with their induction stoves when ironically they were invented and developed by an American company.
"if you put msg in phở, you're fucked up"
I blink and uncle Roger is celebrating another million milestone. Congrats 🎊!!!! Love the content ❤️
"YouTube recommends a channel I've never seen before. 2 minutes in, I've already choked 6 times."
Congratulations 🎊 n many more fun videos like this 👏! Aunty Esther r u watching?
Congrats on 6 mil!
"Could Aunty Thuy put her sad, inferior vegan ramen on dispatch too 😋"
Wish we had the ingredients in india
"4:44 That what people who are in love do........ You buy binocular, and then stand in bushes,...That how you show love to people nowadays😂❤"
so we going to ignore stalking confession?
"I just bought beef broth and on the box it say no msg. I wonder what uncle roger thinks.

I got my own msg I put in it"
Why do Vietnamese kitchens have the best little baskets to make noodles in where can i buy those
you spilled everything in the kitchen and were so dispresctful
"Uncle Roger, you ruin the Pho-not suppose to use MSG it is really bad for you.  MSG only restaurants love using them those in Vietnam but authentic good Vietnamese Pho not using MSG.  It also bad for your health and raise your blood sugar.  That poor lady lol.  I think you are entertainer and not a real chef lol."
Uncle roger has more girls than average guys
"Uncle Roger, your subscribers outnumber Oliver's."
"My heart fainted in love with you when you pulled out Ajinomoto’s MSG instead of Vedan’s one. Vietnamese hate Vedan, their factory didn’t process wasted and ruined our environment."
I wish I could get this Pho here in Western Australia. Uncle Roger makes me crave Pho and I only want the Pho that he approves of 🤣👍
Sorry but i have to mention that Aunty Thuy has a beautiful english  accent.. ✌️
💚💚💚
"may never cook this, I'm just here for the jokes😂😂"
We’re just happy you’re here!! 😝
“Her beef thicker than Lizzo” lmaoooo
"“It’s free labour, it’s Asian thing isn’t it” lmaoooo she’s so sweet and funny"
"Lol, the Harvey Weinstein of TESCO"
Sure or not! A full packet of MSG!
"Alright i have a question.

Why char the outside of an onion? The skin? Don't you discard this?"
I going there they wash their meat

msg is often used with each serving of pho

"Can you pls treat the beef respectfully , i am not stopping you from eating it , Cow is a God to Indian people . 🙏🙏"
"In Vietnam we dont love MSG that much, lots of people got headaches after using MSG"
You like to make white people and westerners look stupid why don't you call your grandparents in China and see how the lockdowns doing see if they're alive or not😇 peace out
The return of the yellow racist! 🥳

Uncle roger's mouth is weak using spoon
Heyaaaaaaa
"It's bánh đa, isn't phở 🤭"

He used his own meme XD
The Pho looks incredibly good compared to what I have here.
WOOOHHOOOO
React to kanchi kitchen once.

Too much MSG Mr  😂
"Watching you slice the beef was rough. Always pop it in the freezer for 30 minutes, makes it so much easier to slice! She hovers so much she's making ME anxious lol omg she is definitely a chef, ""you're doing it wrong"""
Haha! 😂 Motivation was the intention. Till uncle Roger MISSED the last push. Total haiyaa moment for me! Lol I became mama Thuy! 😝
She's actually got amazing screen presence. She should do a cooking show.
Very pleasant and sweet. And I love the accent(s). The images of her book and restaurant show warmth and heart. 😍
@Chef Thuy Pham vietnamese Martin Yan😂🤣
🥰 I’d love that! You’re very kind 💚
"Omg, Uncle Roger is more professional than local Pho i often eat. Im living in HN btw"
How to get kidney stone in one meal that msg

"Very bag cooker. And he speak very bag English, all is horrible"
bro I love MSG but holy crap Uncle Roger
"""We efficient""
""No, you're cheap"""
"Dude, this MSG is pure poison and i cant understand why you put this s**t, when you know how dangerous is this for the human body !?
Or maybe you dont know, so check it if dont believe me !!"
"Hang on a sec. 1:18 Uncle Roger called Gordon Ramsay uncle.
I thought you took that title back?"
There's something captivating about an Asian woman with a British accent
"8:02 is very emotional 😢 😭 😪 🤧 😔 😞 😢
And 8:19 is a dark joke😈👿😈💀💀"
Vegan pho taste like sad
"Ceh, nothing special just tawar. 

Better make LAKSA SARAWAK"
@mrnigelng You need to react to Aunty Esther on Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend!
"Wait wait wait, you shit on Chef Vincenzo for his msg fried rice how much he poured in there.

But you poured more MSG into Pho broth......"
What mean pho 哈哈
"Aunty Thuy, respect. 1:30 into the vid, 'uncle Roger you just made my ancestors cry..' fuiiiyooooohhhh!!!"
😝
"Holy crap, this was a beautiful bowl of pho.  Hat's off for sharing this with us."
It would be if uncle roger didnt dump a truck of msg inside lmao
You’re welcome! 💚
"Loved this video, Little Viet Kitchen looks amazing, I have ordered Thuy's Book on Amazon, cant wait to cook her recipes here in Australia."
"Yay!!! Amazing, thank you. I hope you will thoroughly enjoy the recipes as much as I do!! 😋💚 xxx"
Hiyahh??!!  That much MSG??? Lol
My son introduced me to Uncle Roger. Now my parents and I are all fans!
I am dead!! This is my first time watching Uncle Rodger and I was dying laughing!! New subbie here!!
Just came across this guy for the first time. Man I loved his rude and insulting jokes. So refreshing.
"In vietnam we dont usually use white beet for broth just onion,ginger,beef bone that's enough"
Uncle Real Roger
Harvey weinstein of testicles?
The next auntie that appears is always more charming and hilarious than the last
"""How you make charred onion and ginger with induction range: Leave onion and ginger in house, set house on fire because your house suck and you need to move somewhere with gas burner. Or just break into good kitchen to borrow gas stove, Uncle Roger say it okay!"""
OH I LOVE AUNTY THUY LOL SHE IS SO FUNNY 🤣🤣🤣
☺️
It's crazy how fast he reached 6M! When I started following him in 2020 I don't think he had a million yet. Wow.
Hell of a journey indeed haha
"“You know who mean”
“French people who take over your country” 
.. Hahahah exactly ;)"
"This Phở is not the real Phở at all.... We don't put MSG in Phở, Mr.Roger!! Instead of Daikon, traditional Phở would use Peanut worms for the sweetness of the broth."
6:50 lmao
LVK? Lâm Vĩnh Khoa?
Need to feature Auntie Esther on Iron Chef
Vietnamese's best noodle
Poor aunty Thuy was so offended 7 different ways. She doesn't know your fans are not sensitive to your jokes and antics. Love this except the pound of MSG. I hope this pot didn't go to waste.
"No, you cheap🤣"
Tôi yêu Việt Nam!
2:00 omg lol haha
this is  the right PHở  : ) so good
>:] *YES*
TOO MUCH MSG!!!
I par freeze my beef and then slice it on the ham slicing machine set at 1mm and it comes out perfect 👌👌
Mm mm you making some Pho make me some! But it has to be perfect so u can be an Uncle 😈😈😈 (Im Vietnamese btw)
Vietnamese people we dont like msg4
Auntie Thuy must have the patience of a saint
wait for Uncle Roger only Fans
"Congratulations, Uncle Roger!!!"
"Old Vietnamese Lady with British accent, fabulous"
Cambodians actually use daikon in their ka tieu (cambodian pork base pho). Its great!
"To: Uncle Roger,
All types of spa have to handle meat and bones *crack crack* 💆🏻‍♂️"
Great video
Did you actually put that much msg?? 🤣
Uncle Roger Review channel cook with Ranveer Brar
I love Auntie Thuy i want to try that pho

Please let Auntie Thuy know she's always welcome in Uncle Roger video

Thank you! ☺️💚
Congrat 6M to uncle Roger and love Mrs Thuy for making Pho for this special event

Chào ae Việt Nam
Chao!! 🥰
I have a love and hate relationship with uncle roger because he cooks so good and shows some of the best food on his channel but he still haven't came to my house and make me a dish from his channel 🤣💀🥺
HAiyaa! All Electric Stove not Induction Stove! Induction Stove wireless charger for Wok! Resistive stove is electric stove!
This was worse than rape!
Wtf!
"11:18 By the way he is smiling, you know he said something so dirty right after it didn't even made it to the outtakes."
I see she's done her homework too🤣🤣🤣
He ruined that broth lol.
@Chef Thuy Pham haha for sure
"Don’t worry!! I made another pot earlier, I knew msg master was coming! 😂"
FUIYYYYYOUUU
"Best Vegan pho made from 100% gluten free, non-GMO, open-range vegans.
A good chef uses all parts of vegan - no waste in kitchen."
"lol ...but meat so stringy and pale, no fat, no _flavor_"
her beef thicker than Lizzo.. gosh!! ouuch!!
"MSG supposed to put it last Rogger not at the beginning…. It taste better , trust me Im indonesian we use that every where you eat on street food"
ผมชอบสำเนียงภาษาอังกฤษของคุณมาก มันมีเสน่ห์ดีนะ แต่ผมเคยได้ยินว่า คุณตั้งใจพูดสำเนียงแบบนี้ ทั้งที่คุณสำเนียงอังกฤษเป๊ะมากๆ ชอบมากๆครับ ติดตามเสมอ
"Well white people are the only ones who every other race can offend and bully, and we don't cry about it. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"While I do see that in this time and age, it’s not applicable here."
that face as he pour down half and maybe one full poach of white powder into the broth... pure bliss and madness xD
bro - Uncle is the SHIT 😁 best thing i seen all day and i learned something new. Auntie is charming as heck. MSG  stands for - had me on the floor 😂😂😂 nice 👍
nah i dont like this auntie
Uncle roger so mean
You make it wrong the Vietnamese come to you.
The jokes are getting a little old.  Best of luck!
We take white people shit&make it better! Hahaha! Love you brotha’!
This chick is so white washed
What is that even supposed to mean
Aunty Thuy's voice is the mederator of Uncle Roger's chaotic voice 🤣
Uncle roger parmesan cheese has msg in it
"""can i toss?
""no""
*fucking does it anyway*"
"We all love MSG, almost as much as we love pounding… sorry children 😂"
I Proud of Vietnamese Pho because I am Vietnamese
🍜💚
Looks sooooo good and fresh ❤️
i want to go there!!!!
You won my subscription at 10:20 😂😂
No MSG no taste. And uncle Roger pulled out MSG from his crotch. 🤣🤣
wtf uncle roger?!?!? that bowl is tiny
Auntie was great
Great video. Poor aunty Thuy hasn’t felt this uncomfortable for a long minute!
That MSG bag made me cry 😂
Hehe boiz
This was awesome.
"Uncle Roger:*pour whole MSG bag*
My inner Vietnamese: *NO, STOPPPPP THAT TOO MUCH!!!*"
"DID HE REALLY DUMPED A WHOLE BAG OF MSG ON TO THE BROTH?
ARE YOU MENTAL?"
This is our chance for White people everywhere to roast Uncle Roger for his use of 1 gas tank worth of MSG$
😂😂😂😂💯
Wow they got chemistry as a comedic duo
"I´m disappointed that the Code ist not ""UncleRogerMSG"" xD"
that why auntie helen left
"Uncle Roger:  I push it and it always goes in.

Aunty Thuy: That's what you think!

Ouch *Emotional Damage*"
Autie thuy is funnier than uncle roger
Can you react to Joshua Weismanns hot pot video?
The MSG he poured.. OMG 🤣🤣
Uncle Roger said that Nick Giovanni don't throw the spices
"""Don't be like Rachel Ray, her beef thiccer than Lizo"" 💀"
Both aunty thuy and aunty liz are sibling like when they are with uncle roger in a milestone video
"""You're so mean to Westerners!"" No, no, he's not.  I'm a Westerner, and he's spot on.  There's a reason why I've never tried to make pho at home.... I just order it from the Vietnamese Auntie down the road from my house and enjoy."
I made pho at home at it was pretty damn easy!
Same our local Auntie must do it justice to bless our uncultured taste buds
Emotional  damage  .
@konnichiwa Bless the aunties ❤️
"Oh dear 😅 must be hard for you. Asian dishes there are not really Asian. They really hard to find. Luckily, the auntie there to save you"
Omg it looks delicious
Roger. Your voice is so annoying.
Uncle Roger. Please react to Mysta's easy chicken cooking.. I had tears in my eyes.
emotional damage !
"""We were expecting a lot of Australians to come"" Woman you're fuuuunnnny!!"
"Hiyaaaa, put the meat in freezer for 2 hour and the cut thin....hiyaaaa"
10:19 Uncle Rodgerrrrrrr. 🤣 Really?
The spices were in there for too long though and it should come toward the end of cooking time
Bro 100% buying that book
"As an Aussie, I appreciated the floor on roof joke. 🤣
It's a nice wood grain too."
THE MSG FUYOO WHY YOU USE SO MUCH?!?!??!!
sharpen up the knives! :D
no way he put that much msg holy shit
One the best.  Love the outtakes!
noodle sound lol
That French joke got dark real quick
Fuiyoh!!
Great video. Definitely going to buy the book!
"Surprised uncle didn't say those other chefs Pho-cked up. 
Ba dum tsss"
"Thank you for obliterating a perfectly good Pho.  As a tribute to your thorough desecration, I've just made the tastiest, whitest Khanom Jeen Nam Ngiao with the most lovingly, most reverently pounded coriander stems.  Your favorite version."
I'll go bankrupt if I let my gasstove run for 8 hours.
"“French people who take over your country, that mean” 
🤣🤣🤣 I’m shrieking in Vietnamese"
Auntie Thuy ❤❤ she cool
OMG that msg killed me
Why the floor on their? Lol
I am going to open a restaurant called Pho Q and I will take only orders via phone 😆
"She's soo amazing, definitely visiting her restaurant when it opens"
6 M subsribers !! Wooow. Good 4 u !👍
That was super fun!  Thanks Uncle Roger and Auntie Thuy!
💚💚💚
"That thing triggered a Viet, pho noodles must be fully submerged. So get a bigger bow.
And much more onion, spring onion and sliced onion... like your life depends on it."
I’m from Viet name and this is some great pho’
"Why did you not roast the bones and sear the brisket, flank and short ribs. This helps release albumin which helps clarify the stock you eejit"
Uncle
I eat pho 🍜 almost everyday in the winter but almost never in the summer.
how can you make a bowl of pho so dirty uncle roger... It must be the power of your dirty mind
congratulations
Rude jokes about pretty much everything is so rare nowadays!
You remind me of Shopee
i can talk exactly like uncle roger in the same voice
I always flinch when you ruin stuff with too much MSG. You only need a little. Bad Uncle Roger. But you already knew that.
How can we get that neon rice cooker sign?
Lol it's nice there's a pho place in England 👍
As a Australian I can't figure out if the joke is about us being upside down or blackout drunks in restaurants... Time for a breakfast beer me thinks!
"Upside down. I don't think Australians are known as great alcoholics outside of Australia - as a non-Aussie, I've never heard the stereotype, except in one tumblr post, where someone talked about spiders being less dangerous than getting king hit by a guy named Dane in a Bintang singlet, which is apparently a brand of (cheap?) beer."
Yes.
"I died at the ""thicker than lizzo"" part 😂"
"""Don't be like Rachel Ray, her beef thicker than Lizzo."" LMAO"
Ăn phở là phải nhiều hành
"ahaha we take wyt pipo shyt, make it better"
Auntie Thuy Sounds soo good if u know what i mean
Lollllllllll 😂😂😂😂
I'm in love with Auntie Thuy
It warms my heart to see Uncle Roger cleaning meat. That is how we (African Diaspora or most of us) clean our meat in preparation for cooking. If lemon isn’t available then we'll us vinegar.
Aaay aaay aaay aaay something sus
Uncle roger next time make shashuke for us
Where are the vegan people 🤣🤣
"Uncle Roger, no soup is worth waiting 8 hours to make. But I'll try it if you come to AZ and make it for me. No MSG for me."
My my my....what a beautiful meal. Looks so good. Best thing I've seen on the internet today.
🙌🙌🙌
"Just to be clear, this is southern Pho, northern one is more mellow, less overloaded"
Uncle Roger can u do a video reacting to oil London u won't regret it
Bro i can't. Beef thicker than lizzo wtf hahaha
I'm gonna get an OnlyRoger account
"Uncle Roger - living proof msg isn't bad for you.

He must go through a kilo of that stuff a day and look at him! Healthy as an ox!"
"I got angry when you just poured the msg into the broth. Ruined the broth, and probably gonna waste that food :( it hurts my soul.


I’m glad Asian culture is getting promotion, but let’s not do this for the views?"
Oooo cool you came to England for this vid!
https://youtu.be/NRYhNTiGsSw...
"He beat nick and Jamie in one go

Alongside some more people idk"
Review Aaoron and clarie
"I can listen to Auntie Thuy telling any story all day, her voice is so calming and sexy with that British accent... eargamse"
That was actually soo flavourful... Too much flavours
"""why is the floor at ceiling?""

""We expected a lot of Australians to come""

FUIYOH"
Dude your humor is so fucking funny 🤣
"Wow, whole bag of MSG. Small bag but still... Wow"
That's too much MSG. 😁
Uncle Roger can u do a video reacting to oil London u won't regret it  😂
"1:55 auntie Thuy: tại sao ông chú roger lại kỳ cục với người tây vậy ???

Uncle roger: bà biết ai kỳ cục hơn không ??? Chính là thằng pháp nó đô hộ nước của bà đó xem lại đi ai kỳ cục hơn 🙂

Má nó đúng 🙃"
"“Don’t be like Rachel Ray, her beef THICCCCker than Lizzo”💀 I love him"
Use to be fun to watch. But it gets too much lately. 👎
Wow happy 6m I love the outtakes. I'm going to visit this place soon
uncle roger just has a fucking bag of msg in his crotch
Excellent News.. also you may want to try the Mekong Cat at Stockport. It's amazing also.
If only he knew how bad msg is for you 😂
Too weak. Too WEAK
"hmm too much sexual innuendos.  Need more wit, be generous with wit as much as the MSG you used for your PHO"
This sound remind me of something 😂😂😂
ucle roger are u muslim?
"This video was really nice, I think she is a good cook, but rather annoying"
So strange to hear an obviously Vietnamese lady speak with a pome accent….too strange
"Ok Uncle Roger... that's great... if you don't mess up Vietnamese kitchen and... please! You don't wanna smell fish sauce and Laos slipper
:)))"
That french people line was off the hook...
All these aunties are baddies bruh
I liked how Auntie Thuy just stood 5 m away from uncle Roger when he was doing the “Wok Toss (TM)” like she was scared.
"Ha! 😂 Don’t worry, I had my trainers on ready to chase uncle Roger if he dropped my grandma’s iron wok! A gift to me 7 years ago when I opened my restaurant 😝"
Viiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeetttttttttnnnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmm rice and pho is god power >:) you need to eat it
At 6:55 to 7:15 my ancestors died due to high pressure coz of to much salt.
Congratulations 🥰🥰
Indonesian checked !
That msg is a lot u added haiyaaaa
Man like uncle Roger
From Vietnam with love
"funfact: as a Vietnamese there's more than a way to make Pho at home, you just need pork mince or any mince u want then just cook it with oil, and then put water in it and add fish sauce, msg and maybe salt, and then you need to add more ingredients like green onions,... and then just put Pho in it, then ur done!:D very simple Pho made by mince"
"how is she keeping a straight face :D  I know Uncle Roger is using a Stereotypical Accent,  and that's not how he talks, but it's funny!"
"As a Vietnamese person, I like this. I approve✔️"
"04:53 ""This sink is only for hand wash""."
Wow your channel has grown bigger and bigger! Congratulations Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel!
Congratulation! I found this channel today. It's so fun to watch and inspiring! 😀
Damnnn that Pho surely worth more than my whole grandma Wok Fuiyoh.
"Who da fick asks for condom delivery?
I was talking about the ads that i got"
I was here sience 2M so it amazes me to see how much you've grown
"HAHAHAAHHAAH , I'M LAUGHING SO HARD WHEN UNCLE ROGER SHOVED WHOLE MSG INTO THAT POT"
Imagine uncle roger dating Aunty Esther. Then Aunty Helen will go like ‘emotional damage’
7million， uncle roger cook vegan food
"Finally, Some f@ckin dish with the truth recipe with truly chef 
My Vietnamese ancestors will be rest in peace for no mistake part , no strange food add on Pho in one video of uncle Roger 
Thank you so much 🙏"
This weejio is *pho* adults :).
MSG had me like 💀💀💀
Hiya my taste buds blow up from greatness
Uncle Rodger iz make mah day thanks uncle Rodger I good niece ✨😃
Uncle Roger said its a secret recipe but reveals the whole thing in this video
Vietsub. Nice
"Love the way Uncle Roger speak her name Thuỳ, it was real Vietnamese 100% authentic omg😘"
Foreplay is waste of time 🤣
3:38 every indian got triggered
come to India and say that to a Hindu
Nah beef tastes amazing 😋
LMAO
👍
Lol mostly green flames come from chemicals
I have a signed version of Aunty Thuy book! Lovely chef <3
It would be better if you are in Vietnam and use fresh pho noodles 🤤
"I like MSG. But you killed our ""pho"" with that much MSG :)"
"MSG : Make Sh*t Good 
🤣🤣😂🎉"
Actually you shouldn’t use msg or any salt before the broth is ready. This keeps osmosis from happening so you stop the flavor from entering the broth. Easy cooking chemistry mate.
"Why so many meat, put some vegetables"
you not uncle roger now you now uncle pho
Love u <3 Uncle Roger
french people taking over your country is pretty mean
<3
"Roger put to..to much M S. G. In to the soup ,some people will allergic to  M S G."
cool
Now I'm gonna wait until uncle Roger make food with Uncle Gordon
"You should review Koyla butter chicken with chef Saransh
https://youtu.be/z0jSuczVxjU"
Holy cow congratulations 🎊🍾 6 mil what a great job well deserved uncle roger here’s to 6mil more 🍻 congrats 🎉
Please make beshbarmak!
"I can't help but cringe whenever he pours in the msg, yoh😭"
I can't help but cringe whenever he pours in the msg... yoh😭
So proud
"""Foreplay is a waste of time""💀💀💀"
She’s awkwardly distressed while trying to be a polite host the entire time! Hilarious!
I was not breathing for the MSG pour!! 😂
"Congratulations on 6 million, Uncle Roger. Definitely gold.  Thank you, Auntie Thuy!  And what is the cut of beef for the thin slices?"
It’s Topside steak 🥩
"I feel like he eats too much salt per video, msg is 1/2 salt."
"Sorry, like 12%, not 1/2."
"the way you pour the whole MSG into the broth, omg, it blew my mind :)))"
I want spicy ramen now
I could really go for some pho right now
7:00 this is how i forget sadness
THAT'S ALOT OF MSG!!!!!
congrats uncle roger ALSO TOO MUCH MSG!!!!
Uncle Roger after taking the uncle title from Gordon still calls him Uncle Gordon.
i wonder if uncle Roger  at end managed to come out from that kitchen.  aunty thuy diged a hole in the kitchen now. i think.
29 pounds for beef pho? Wow
Do you know this sound?🤣🤣🤣
the french people who invaded your country also gave you the pho in the first place
"“You know who mean? French people who take over a country” !!! You tell those colonialists, Uncle Roger! All of them!"
Did he really put an entire bag of msg in there 😂
God i enjoyed this video 😂😂😂
Congratulations Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel 🎊
"Haven't had Pho in months, this is a sign. Time to buy her Hard copy book and make some Pho this weekend 🤣🥰😁"
🥰 Thank you!! X
"I love msg but holy shit, that amount of msg is absolutely ungodly even for me"
"God I wish I could have her accent, not the Chinglish one I have right now... But pho is also popular in Australia."
HE HATES JAMY OLIVER
Uncle Roger is really good at telling the truth 😂 (01:58)
❤️Congratulations uncle 😆
i completely lost it at 1:54
"As a fellow owner of MSG, i know how powerfull it is, so when you poured the entire bag in there my face litterally went 😳"
@Onayrez As I said to the last person who pointed that out (also no need to respond the same thing to several people in 1 thread) : Nowhere in that pinned post does he state he didn't toss it in. He said he did it for the shot and he said you shouldn't put in that much. Nowhere did he state he in fact did not throw it in with the actual ingredients.
@Onayrez I know it was for the video lol. Just saying from experience that msg doesn't taste good on its own
@shawtazz check pinned comment
@OberK maybe check the pinned comment first
Read his pinned comment.
Literally the worst pho ever! All Asians are disappointed in you and should be disappointed in you
Nick D giovanni nailed it
Happy cancer after eating so much MSG.
Pseudo MSG lover! 😝
"she expect the australians to come, but doesn't have chandeliers on the floor... haiyaaa"
The way he kinda revealed there secret family recipe tho
Pass on that ox tail
Why the bowl so little 😔
Do you realize that induction stoves don't light up? The ones you show all the Time are Ceran Stoves.
1:50 one thing I always find funny about Uncle Roger's vids is this fisheye warp effect whenever he makes fun of white people 😆
"Floor more flavourful than Jamie Oliver’s kitchen 💀
I don’t think I’ll recover if I was Jamie"
Msg= more flawor
Thế còn phở gà
The pho looks really good.
10:17🤣🤣
im going to buy that book and sprinkel msg and light that on fire for uncle roger
Uncle Roger makes it just like Jamie Oliver.
"Thank for your Pho and congratulation for 6M subs. U make this dish too good but so much MSG, in VN we just put it in broth a little bit haha"
"MSG = Make Shit Good, hahaha!!!"
My best friend is half Vietnamese and half Hungarian.Your food is amazing 😍
im making this rn with a whole chicken. my pho is better than local takeout. very simular to this recipe with less or no msg in mine.
I want make vegan salad with pork oil
"You know it's a good video, if Jamie Oliveoil is getting roasted not even 2 minutes into the video"
"I think uncle Rodger might be slowly going insane, with the passing of each video he becomes mone extera."
"do next video , uncle roger review uncle roger making pho :v"
Vegan food so poop some times it just takes tree min/hour(I did not spell it wrong)
bỏ nhiêu đó bột ngọt chắc mất trí nhớ :))
Uncle Roger you made this round eye very happy.
"Auntie Thuy is so cute and nice, I want to adopt her."
"""we were expecting lots of australians to come"" 😭"
Racist. So glad I unsubbed.
Literally no one cares
"On your 7 milliom subs 
Eould you please make buriyani"
Congratulations bro... Happy 6 million Niece and nephew :)
"We french aren't mean, we're winners. Except ww2. We lost that. And our revolution. We lost that too."
That pho looks amazing tho.......
"Uncle Roger! Down the line, would like to see a Filipino dish by you, too :)"
Emotional Damage!!!

Until you pour MSG into my 8 hour broth … 😂 xxx
YAY!
Wait do you add more water after you add everything in? The ingredients are overflowing... help us uncles and aunties who want to make this for reals
the joke she cracked at the very beginning had no right kikling me like that
"""Flavor is like money. More always better.""

Hell yeah! Uncle roger spitting faxxxxxxx."
Wanna see you review an Adam Regusea receipe! :)
"I love auntie thuy, she seems so natural and sweet on cam and can go along well with uncle roger's jokes. More of auntie thuy's cooking please."
"@Chef Thuy Pham oh, it auntie thuy! Hello."
💚💚💚
More of auntie thyu
I like Auntie Thuy ❤
That French joke was on point..
"I know it's only for comedic purposes but him pouring all the msg is sending me anxiety. 😅 He needs to know the concept of ""umay"" (ooh-mai) which is a filipino term. And there are many ways to describe the word but when it comes to eating It's like something so good it becomes too overwhelming and you ended up disliking or fed up with it. This definition usually applies to food."
The *tsk
Congratulations
"uncle, stopp 😂 auntie already said, viet kitchens are caaalm 🤣
i love auntie, she cooks calmly. i hate cooking channels who throw their raw ingredients, thinking that it looked cool. to me it just seemed like they hate their job. 

btw i'm so afraid, the amount of msg poured was (...) 🥲"
No like. So racist.
Bruh r/wooooooooosh
Uncle Roger should cook with Uncle Nick
I really hope you didn’t put all that msg in the Pho… That would be criminal.
no pho would have had that much beef tho cause we vietnamese broke af
Congratulations! This looks so good! Also Auntie Thuy is such a good sport and also very funny.
💚💚💚
I was hoping for auntie esther
"the way they make jokes, it's Vietnamese in English disguise, it's so funny, LoL."
She’s lovely. 💕
Auntie Thuy is one of the most charming people in this planet.
No phuking way
Uncle Roger describes foreplay as a waste of time. We all know why Auntie Helen left him.
fuiyohhhhh
"Congratulations Uncle Roger on reaching 6 M! To Aunty Thuy, I can see the gold in the broth regardless of what uncle Roger says."
Yay!! I’m not colour blind! 😂 💚 xxx
"Uncle Roger, ""what kind of spa do you go to you handling meat and bone"", what's a massage but handling meat and bone? Then people get in a big pot of broth to soak? Spa's are exactly The Soup Experience."
Plot twist  nigel has split personality disorder 😮😮
"As a Vietnamese person, he made the pho perfectly"
"We take white people’s shit, and make it better, aka French baguettes and Vietnamese Phở, bò kho (beef stew), and others… I approve Uncle Roger’s message! Just a bit of “Emotional Damage “ to the western side….ha ha…Greetings from Nashville Tennessee USA 🇺🇸"
Msg full form haha 😂
Haiyaaaa uncle Roger now become a stalker and following auntie Esther?
"At 5:40, missed a ""Sorry, Children"" moment."
"10:53 The broth actually looks really good, so will give it a try, thanks."
Yay!!! 🥰
Oh she so wanted to wack him with that lighter 😂
Hopefully this book is really by her.  Too soon?
NOONONONON DONT COOK THE BEAN SPROUTT NOOOO
I wants to and make this! Thank you auntie Thuy and uncle roger. 😀
that's good
The “these days people show love with binoculars in bush joke” cracked me up 😂
"AI YAH!!!! AHHHHHH!!! YOU NAJE PHO, JAMIE OLIVER GET JEALOUS!!! HAI AHHHH."
This aunty Thuy's personality is so sweet and cute. Seems like such a positive and good human being.
She’s looked stressed in the vid bc uncle roger lol
ok
"@Chef Thuy Pham awww I further rest my case about your sweet personality cuz the boat load of MSG uncle dumped into that pho, you did a great job holding yourself back lol. When I’m London I will make it a point to visit your restaurant"
Until you pour msg onto my Pho!!! 😝 💚
please tell Auntie Thuy to sharpen her knife haiya 🤦🏻 congratulations on the 6 million this content is definitely fuiyoh
The beef need to be very thin because it's not cheap!
"happy 6,000,000. I hope you get to make many more videos."
He forgot the peach chutney jelly? 🤣
You should review and make Bun Bo hue
It’s so mind boggling that washing the meat for two hours and then boiling and draining it like most people do will still leave flavor. It’s like you got rid of all the flavor lol.
Anyone wondering if that whole pack of msg messes up the whole broth?
2:35 u actually put aluminum foil on it and then onions over it
Uncle Roger is SEXY in that orange polo!
Congrats uncle
"The pho looks great, and the meat portion is very fulfilling."
👍
"I make Phở for the family now and then, usually finish the broth at night and leave it in the fridge so we can take out the fat in the morning. I tell you the smell of the toasted spices and the broth in the middle of the night is torturing."
WTF ARE THEY REALLY GONNA EAT THAT WITH THAT MUCH OF MSG?
"Nah nah nah nah he did not just throw in a whole bag of MSG, cousins there is indeed such thing as too much flavour"
the msg looks like drugs
Congrats on 6M! Can’t wait to try this myself (with less MSG)
I never get tired of those Jamie Oliver digs!
I like this😃
i’ll get kill if i just wasted so much of MSG
",...Poor Thuy hahah. As a Vietnamese, I understand how important we want to keep our kitchen clean lol. Mom always clean at the same time she cooks."
Oh my goodness. Auntie is about to kill uncle Roger for that much MSG
"not only pretty, but funnier than you. More please 😂"
"1:09 "" this is Vietnamese kitchen, everything is calm ""

*Meanwhile my grandpa having flashbacks*"
Lol
"Wow, Uncle Roger got 6 million subscribers! Congrats man  🎉❤🎉❤🎉"
"Wow! It was literally just 1 year ago you were <3M subscribers, congrats on the success!"
At seven million subscribers you should make sushi
WOW £29 for a delivery of Beef pho soup from dispatch...... rip off considering it's delivery!!!!
Going to buy the book.
"You just completely destroyed the whole video, also the whole pot of broth within 2 sec of throwing entirely your bag of MSG in. Anyway congrats for your 6M and send hearts to auntie Thuy."
Uncle Rodger has no chill 😂 I love him
Auntie Thuy is so cute! And she’s right it’s gold
New subscriber has arrived .
Jesus fucking christ don't EVER pour that amount of MSG not even for the camera fucking cringe.
You need to do a video of people making bun bo hue!

Congratulation fuiyooo!!!!!
That maybe too much MSG uncle Roger ;-;
"cmon nigel, isnt that shit too salty, innit?"
"Congrats! Shame of the one big error, the discount code should have been UncleRogerMSG"
Dont put MSG to waste food. That amount is hazard.
Hypertension in a pot. Well done;
"""Beef thicker than Lizzo."" 😂😂😂😂😂💀"

"Uncle Roger not scripted proof 11:58 xd
Great job on 6M! I love how I randomly found you on facebook a year ago."
O_O i have the same MSG   <333333 asi-no-moto
"She's so wonderful and genuine, like the total opposite of Uncle Roger."
"Uncle roger I think you’ll like Switzerland since we eat everything with aromat (Swiss msg) can any swiss people confirm?

And congrats for 6 million"
More with auntie thuy please
I love her
the overuse of MSG in your videos is getting real old.
Holy S*%&! That tremendous amount of MSG will kill your kidneys LoL!
So funny 😆

I love how he has just embraced the meme culture.
Beef was bigger than Lizzo lool
"As a matter of fact, the Vietnamese chef who owns the restaraunt by my house, actually talks just like you, but naturally :) He and his mom, who is probably 80 years old, make the best food I have ever eaten."
My favorite food ever. Going to get some right now :)
"Congrats on 6M subscribers. ""Hello hello, this is beef. Thank you for killing me"". This is not somehing you would ordinarily do on your videos."
Why adding the spices so early in the cook? You add during the last hour of the stewing process
I wanna watch you and Gordon Ramsay do a series where you're just dickheads to everyone XD
Chú roger cuối cùng cũng đã      nấu phở it make me feel like woooooooooo yeah baby

'Foreplay is waste of time' 'No you cheap'. Why Auntie Thuy so posh?

She gots an insane British accent
Her beef thicker than lizzo am I the only one who got that joke
make bún
Will you return to your classic nigel ng?
I'm hoping you took the water out after putting in the pound of MSG and rinsed that shit out. A spoon or two I would understand but a whole bag?
What Auntie Thuy doesn't realize is that people don't want to spend more than 1 hour making good Asian food. Hope they buy her book anyway
Thuy is amazing
"Meanwhile Jermy Oliver is learning how to make perfect ""Pho"" from Uncle roger...Haiyahh"
Uncle Roger should review the Babish version of the Naruto ramen.
Beef thicker than lizzo 🤣🤣
"When auntie Thuy said ""You just made my ancestor's cry"""
Poor aunty thuy lol
make pho mà khong có vietsub :<
Congratulations on 6 million subs Nigel.  Well deserved with all the great content you put out.
"The MSG thing in VietNam we call it ""bột ngọt"" and ye he's right it's really make sh*t more good"
"Ok, I LOVE uncle Rogers vids, but I do find it offensive that he is calling veg pho horrible
I'm not vegetarian, but as an Indian surrounded by them, I do find this kinda offensive, even though it's clearly a joke
Btw, CONGRATS ON 6M SUBS!!!!!"
more is feeling even better
msg is the new drugs
I bet she's married to a westerner
"Haiyaa, so many dirty jokes 🙂"
"""Forplay is waste of time-""
""No! You CHEAP""

Auntie Thuy's voice is soo soothing.
"As a Vietnamese nephew, uncle Roger did a great job. Also I have been living in the UK for the past year, and gotta say the Phở by Auntie Thuy is great looking so far, a lot of other Vnmese theme restaurants I been to serve really low effort but high price Phở."
@Đức Nguyễn probably not cus they're a Bot/scammer

"Sorry Uncle, I won’t eat your pho because of that 🤣🤣🤣🤣"

Auntie Thuy is a legend having you in her kitchen and teaching you."
"Very true.  But it's also true that while I'm not a writer, I can still spot some awful writing by so-called authors. (not a jab at you)  Don't need to be good at something yourself to know when it's done poorly."
Hahahaha
"Like Jamie Oliver, ? Lol jk"

@Seiji Ren spiders
@JewelsOfJuly why australian upside down

This auntie loved the dirty jokes from uncle Roger
"A sujihiki would be better for slicing than a gyuto or santoku. One nice clean pull from heel to tip, donezo."
I am ####### offended cos u made fun of singapore food and i Singaporean
Congrats on 6 million subscribers! Nieces and Nephews love you Uncle Roger! ❤
"Omg, that looked so awesome at the end!! However- Uncle Roger... with all due respect... you need to have a proper technique. I do the thinnest slices with my grandfather's ""sashimi knife"" in one stroke. If help is needed, freeze the beef for about 15 minutes."
phở đẹp nó có vẻ ngon
Let's give a round of applause to the greatest uncle in history with over 6 million nieces and nephews!!!

"Charring your onion and ginger also works on induction stoves with a pan without oil.
I did this with tomatoes, onion and chilies for Mexican salsa. It just takes quite some time."
My dad makes pho and it’s always better than any other pho I’ve eaten and I have yet to find better pho.
No...Uncle Roger licked it and then it goes into the pot....NOOOOO   :)
😂😂😂😂😂i love it.
I wish they could home deliver those delicious meals in the town of Chillingbourne. 🛵
"woah thats crazy thats how i would use five spice in my soup too, and no one ever taught me that! i love the idea of heating up the onion and ginger like that though. Instead of MSG I use kombu and dried shitakes."
Auntie Thuy keep us on track.... MSG is a joke
i really like all his videos but his becoming more a subscription hunger!
congratulations on 6m uncle roger!!!!🎉

Me: eating pho while watching this
"03:10 
uncle roger: foreplay waste of time….
Auntie: no, you’re cheap!"
"uncle roger, if you slice the beef like that, surely you cannot work in Vietnamese restaurants. in Vietnam, the seller will cut it as thin as air =))))"
"Viet with UK accents are a rare in the USA.  I had to fake it a few times just to get dates from unsuspecting females.  

Pho looks about right.  Just that the bowl is just too small.  Go buy pho bowl in the USA the bigger the better n broth has to be more than the noodles and junk stuff you put in there.  Must be steamy and hot too.  

Non xin moi

Means delicious let's eat"
Congratulations on 6 mill 🔥

"Is Viet Kitchen has a place in Vietnam too?

That looked absolutely disgusting.
so proud because 'm Vietnamese
aaaahaha
Beef thicker than Lizzo
Uncle Roger should open a restaurant. Maybe he can call it Pho Queue.
Of course Auntie Tui's baby is cute because Auntie Tui is beautiful.
"FUIYOH!!! Congratulations on making it to 6 million subscribers, Uncle Roger!"
That msg probably has been in his pants for YEARS
Pro-tip for thinly cut beef: partially freeze your beef before slicing it so you can get thin cuts.
MSG to the moooon hahahaha
"Why so much msg, wtf brooo"
I have never seen a restaurant serves a meaty bowl of pho like that.
That looks f-Ing amazing! I’d pay big bucks for that!
这猝死量的msg
Auntie Thuy locked the door and paddled Uncle Roger for making her kitchen dirty!
"omg the msg pull from pants and pour was so sick
Auntie Apoorva like"
"auntie thuy thank you for sharing your secret family recipe 
uncle Roger watch your sodium intake your niece and nephews don't want you to have a heart attack
❤️ from 🇨🇦"

0.0 my mom also always uses Daikon for PHO 😍😍
"Bought the book, thank you!!"
The shot of the beef slicing made me uncomfortable
Less of Aunty Thuy plz. Prudish
The Little Viet Kitchen is my favourite place of Vietnamese food outside of Vietnam - Thuy is sooo lovely when I met her and she signed my book. We bonded over Asian parents' disapproval and free wheeling with quantities in recipes - she is absolutely adorable. Can't wait for her restaurant to open up again.
@Chef Thuy Pham hope I can see all of that dishes video from you 😭
"🥰 I’m glad I got to cook for you! I haven’t given up on showcasing Vietnamese food, just enjoying some precious mama time with my new baby. Anyways, I think it’s the perfect time for me to get out of the kitchen, time to really shout about not ONLY Pho, but so much more right?! What about Banh xeo, what about bun rieu, let’s not even mention Bun Bo hue!! 🔥❤️ xxx"
Y THE FLOOW IN THER?
When you make something why you always with an expert make it alone uncle roger
I thought you were from Malaysia?
Bruhhhh you high-key ruined that pho with that MSG vomit. Borderline insulting to the woman who spent 6+ hours making it. It was not funny just cringe
My family is veitnamese and pho is one of my family’s essential food
secret to pho is msg
I really want to eat pho only it must be beef 🥩
Congratulations Uncle Roger 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You cheap hahahahahahhahah
"Tell Aunty Thuy
 I just ordered her book and look forward to making the dishes in it. ❤"
@Chef Thuy PhamI'll let you know how I go.
That’s amazing!! Thank you so much! I really do hope you will enjoy the recipes as much as I do! 🍜💚 xxx

Best episode so far
so. much. MSG.
Her restaurant is in Islington in North London and is INSANELY GOOD.
"After trying the broth with beef and chicken, chicken yielded a lighter but still very flavourful broth that went perfectly with shredded chicken and thinly sliced deli sausage meat. Both are delicious though! Great recipe Aunty Thuy!"
💚💚💚
Uncle roger should watch epicmealtime old school youtube food channel
"Nooooooooooooooooooooo, this is the only time that MSG is fkin that broth up :("
"That's not Aunty Thuy, that is Mother Thuy 🙏🙏"
Jamie Olive Oil Lasagna. Masterpiece.

Did anyone else notice the voice over in 2:00 when he's saying that mean?
"""Uncle Roger should do a video on making a proper british cup of tea but do everything wrong while saying stuff like 'You can substitute the sugar with flour' just to contrast the british chefs making asian dishes wrong"" - Says my co-worker who can't post a comment because he doesnt have a youtube account."
Will the bobbleheads be restocked? My husband wanted to buy me one but they had just sold out.
"WOW!!!  Uncle Roger so Awesome, his 5-spice have 6 spices!!!!!
Plus MSG--that's SEVEN!!!"
Daikon makes it lean a bit towards Thai quiddel.
Congratulations for the achievement. Bravo
It look like food preparation is Uncle Roger kryptonite!
When is it opening
Uncle roger should react to aunty Helen on iron chef
Auntie Thuy is a very pleasant woman to be around
"7:41 That knife duller than Jamie Oliver weejios! You cut with sharp knife and one stroke, not back and forth like sawing wood haiyaaaaaaa"
"Aunty Thuy seems super cool and so nice! Also, now I know where to go in London if I want good, authentic pho ♥️"

I’m Vietnamese and I usually eat pho 🍜
"Very easy and not time wasting weekday meal. You comeback from work at 6pm, start to cook and pho is ready at 2am. You can wake up whole family If they haven't set an alarm and enjoy family breakfast."
Review Uncle Matty Matheson Pho & Ramen
Dude you had me cracking up the entire time.
"Ah, good ol' hypertension with all that MSG mmmmmmmmmmmmm."
"Nice until the daikon...DON'T DO IT.  Daikon has a flavor that can cut through the pho ingredients.  I can smell the daikon from a parking lot.  Daikon is used to make broths for egg noodle based dishes.  AGAIN.  DO NOT USE daikon for pho.  This is a misconception for amateurs.  If you want something sweet, try to use other ingredients without the strong flavors such as rock sugars, pears, apples, etc...ANYTHING but DAIKON.  There are also a few other steps..."
All that MSG Uncle Roger's blood pressure must be insane.
goddamn thuy me up

"I don’t understand the Australian/ceiling joke. Help, anyone?"
Thank you for making the pho
This was good
Uncle roger did u found a replacement for auntie Helen. I saw u kissing in east mode
"Very fun, loved the dynamic between you two. Especially the out takes."
"As an Asian, I'm pretty sure that my parents would be offended if I didn't try to make some final profits off their deaths..."
"Uncle Roger, I think when you “massage” the meat too much, you lose some flavor. I love the daikon Auntie Thuy! Thank you for sharing that. And I think msg used in abundance can mask the natural flavor of dishes. I don’t want to walk away with a headache. Anyways, I admire Thuy Diem Pham. Thank you.🙏"
💚💚💚
I'll work for her!!!!!!  Plenty of experience!!
still waiting for that office chicken not boring pho..
"I finally got to the Asian market today and bought MSG, I knew I got the right brand when Uncle Roger pulls the exact same brand out of his pants, fuyow!"

Oh im so dead when i saw that msg pouring

uncle roger. why no MSG factory yet? it´s market niche. so disappointing.
“Oh know what MSG stands for Make Shit Good” 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
"Uncle Rodger is really in love with his white powder, just saying."
00:45 “steal”
"Auntie Helen jeallloooousss, emotional damage."
This is a really nice video.
"The Pho in our area is really sad compared to Auntie Thuy's.  Gold standard right here.  Not sure what got roasted more though, the onions and ginger or Roger: ""That's what you think"""
I hate watching Uncle Roger ruin all his food with a pound of MSG. MSG doesn't deserve this 😢
"Way do much MSG, A DISGRACE to Asian economic senses, waste of money."
"""its free labor, its an asian thing right"" 
Asian people watching this rn"
Those Asian jokes are funny asf! 😂🔥🔥🔥
"First time i have watch a video ab food i laugh too much, so funny ..but a big bowl of Pho look so good so awesome..very delicious!!!"
"When your vietnamese neighbor makes some great food to share with a couple neighbors, and the soup is delicious, you go to bite into the meat and rice, and it's heated up canned sardines."
I wanna goto Auntie Thuy's resturaunt.  But it's way over in Britain.
"i like MSG, but that much wont taste good lol"
"Oh Auntie Thuy. ❤ How does a person radiate so much peace and calmness and yet can deliver such sick burns to Uncle Roger? If I had 24 hours left to live, I'd spend them watching Auntie Thuy weejios. That'd be a good way to go."
Haha! 😂 Are you sure you watched the MSG pouring part?! 😝
"Holy shit,  he just destroyed the broth with the MSG, mentally  emotional demage!"
"""You know who mean? French people who take over your country.""
Savage! 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"He's so much FAKE, he always cook with someone who has good knowledge of the dish he's cooking. He can't do shit on his own !"
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Normally I love MSG, it's truly is the king of flavor. BUT NOT THAT MUCH HOLY FLYING RICE NOODLE"
Auntie is just fabulous to watch
hahah.. he mess up in viatnemis kitchen..
"Hey yo what the fuck Uncle Roger, why all that msg? Even I dont use so much Meth in my Pho"
"As a Vietnamese who live in Vietnam, I can say I've never seen Pho broth that dark in Vietnam before. The plating is messy with too many things on a bowl. And we do not serve the bone in Vietnam."
That was enough MSG for a whole month of restaurant cooking!
"a kind of spa where they handle meat and bone 
😂 hidden gem"
Aunty Thuy clapping back is the best
Fun Fact: if you eat MSG your mouth tastes better
"""French people who take over your country, that mean"" - oh my Buddha. This is another level of roasting."
Aunty Thuy is pho-king adorable 😍
"UR: “You know who mean? French people who take over our country”

Oof"

Congratulations
Congratulations to 6M subscribers! The pho looks delicious.
1:55 - 2:03 FEKTZ
Pretty sure the broth was salty AF when Uncle Roger put the whole bag of MSG in it… so MSG in this show should be Make Shit Grim. I guess he is waiting for the high blood pressure to kick in. Tsk.
"I’m whiter than the driven snow and more western than Clint Eastwood. Are you still my uncle, Uncle Roger?! 😭"
"5:18 hold up, anyone think she sounded like female Steve merchant for that end of “water”"
"Once you use dried pho, it’s automatic fail.  Totally red flag. Best part of Real Pho is the Pho. Must be fresh pho. No exception."

 Editorial: Could It Be that the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is ""Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway.""? It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, ""Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart."" Ever looked with lust? If you have said ""Yes"" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: ""God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com"

During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.

"Hi Uncle Roger, did you know that in Vietnamese, there is a legend about a kung fu cooking master that can slice the beef so thin when you throw the slice on the floor your dog cannot even lick it up. And the slice gets so thin when the master pours the broth onto the beef, it dissolves with the broth. And the slice gets so thin that if you don't take it with care then will flow with the wind. That story has become a legend, and all the old ladies around Vietnamese has gather to that master's place to learn the techniques, but no one can reach the master's level. And one day, due to the master's ages, he's detached from his earthling body and became one with the Mother Land. And from that moment on, no one can replica that techniques again."
I want Auntie Thuy to be the voice of Disney's next Asian princess

"He who has an ear, let him

Jesus is coming back a lot of people have been ignoring the warnings since 2020 and the only person you’re hurting by doing that is yourself and you’re family 

God is doing so much and has done so much for you to wake up and understand the times and season you’re living in so you can repent and be saved 

it’s like the days of noah. God sending his servants in love because God loves you to warn you before judgment comes and yes of course human nature 

Human beings ignoring God just like the days Noah mockers and scoffers laughing at the preaching of the word 
scoffing at the preachers and persecuting those that come in love and share in love 

scoffing at the word of God and all this scoffing and mocking even after all that you’ve seen since 2020 and have experienced

Yet everyday life continuing people oblivious to the coming judgement upon this world like the days of noah and ignoring everything that they’ve seen and are seeing 

ignoring the fact that there’s a war happening in Ukraine which could potentially lead to nuclear war also ignoring the fact that Israel is about to go to war with Iran and China is about to go to war with Twain 

Ignoring the fact that food prices are rising aswell as fuel prices there’s talks of worldwide famines by 2023 new diseases monkeypox after we just had a virus cause havoc on this world for two years and now we have a new one 

yet people are choosing to ignore all this signs when the bible told you that this would happen in the last days

A time prophesied by Jesus - a time worser then anything that’s happened  in this world yet you can still be saved out of that time and out of the tribulation and it’s only through Jesus that you can be saved from the wrath to come and from hell and from eternal Separation from God because of you’re sins for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus 

you’re in the middle of a spiritual warfare light - against -darkness and you have no idea how great or wicked that darkness is nor what that darkness is doing or planning for you 

the Lord Jesus Christ is coming back to judge this world and to put everything right

God’s will is for all to be saved and for none to perish but time is running out this is not the time to be running away from God but rather to God and for my brothers and sisters in Christ 

my fellow Christians don’t play church you’re either with Christ or you’re not beloved. Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.

you’re either in the light or in the darkness you’re either on Gods side or Satan’s side beloved Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.

Beloved You have to pick up you’re cross and follow Jesus and deny yourself daily and crucify your flesh daily and be holy because God is holy offer you’re body as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing unto God beloved strive i repeat strive ! to enter through the narrow gate for many will try but will not be able too 

This message is shared out of love to everyone so you can be saved 

So Repent and give you’re life to Jesus accept him as you’re Lord and saviour and receive forgiveness and salvation through Christ Jesus 
 
Acts 4.12 
And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved 

John 14:6
6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me

God bless"

"Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him!
Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!

Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤"
"Your worries (yes, anxiety), depression, suicidal thoughts, EVERYTHING will melt away and be NO MORE when you lean on God and put your trust in him! When I have physical pain, I literally pray and the Lord quells it, that I am healed!

Know that there is power in the name Jesus Christ! His name casts out demons and heals! People are bothered by his name. The world hates the truth and wants to continue living sinfully! God's children are set apart (holy) and righteous."

"I adore Vietnamese food, it's underrated and delicious!"
You should review Vietnamese north pho :)
"As a Vietnamese I must say this recipe is suck. First, stop using MSG to describe the taste of Pho. I know for the commercial purpose, people often throw MSG in the pot but this's not moral because I and many more people have health problem with MSG (frozen tongue and headache). So dont encourage to add MSG. Second, we dont eat that much meat in a bowl. We have a balance but your recipe seems to contain only meat, I dont even recognise it a bowl of Pho or a bowl of meat. Thanks."
I believe you never cook pho before. Dont act like you know everything. Oh btw I’m also a Vietnamese and approved this pho recipe.
You the only one disagree. Girl bye!!
I wonder how many people gonna review this pho 🤣
I'm vietnamese and the currency in Vietnam is MSG .He was right !
Her voice so cute and calming...
small corrections: we chop green onions and we don’t put the bones in the bowl
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!  gets me everytime
"More aunty Thuy please,love from Việt Nam ❤️❤️❤️"
"1 pack of MSG in 1 pot of broth
 *Congratulations, you got new replie: Mouba's Soup*"
"MSG = Make Shit Good
Change my mind"
"This is Vietnamese kitchen not Malaysian kitchen,Haiiya!!"
Fair warning - most vegans used to talk shit about veganism before converting to the dark side. So you’re already well on your way.
Congratulations Uncle Roger 💖❤❤❤💖
Pretty good I must say but 'Uncle Roger' make pho? Uncle Roger supervise and eat pho
Uncle roger is probably the funniest person I’ve ever seen
Uncle roger can you make nasi goreng or mie goreng next? It would be nice to see that on your seven milion subscribers celebration 😆
Had to pause the video thought I had a notification. The Phub intro drums is my notification sounds lmao.
9:39 IT'S GOLD 🤩
As an Australian i would like to say thankyou for putting the floor on the ceiling
That pho looks sooooo good! I would fly over to the UK just for that. :D

"Happy 6 million, Uncle Roger!! Love seeing you and Aunty Thuy together ❤️ my mom made pho today too!!"
💚💚💚
"""Hello hello, my name is Beef, thanks for killing me!""

jamie oliver is getting roasted every video lol
Lost memories pho with whole that msg
"Auntie Thuy is so wholesome and nice, she feels like the polar opposite of Uncle Roger. And that Pho looks so guud with all those beef cuts YUMz"
"Hope you will try a cook my recipe, I think you'd really enjoy it! The extra cuts are crazy good! Not traditional, but trust me on this one! :)"
"If you want to forget your ex-wife (and all your memories also), eat Uncle Roger's Pho."
"Congrats on 6 million uncle Roger.. fuiyoh🙋 👌🏽🔥..
And yes uncle Roger use a pinch next time plz😂 don't pour whole store haiiyaaa 🙆"
"In my apt in sg I tried cooking with an induction for the first time... 
It was horrible"
"Honestly, I hate how he ruins the food by pouring so much MSG in for tHe mEmEs. You're wasting time and ingredients to make an authentic meal, yet you go out of your way to destroy it. For what? For what?"
What?! This weedio msg pour made take leg down from chair!
The broth looks like someone pooped some gold leaf steak but ate taco bell prior
Unpopular opinion: the uncle roger character is getting boring
more like becoming unlikable...
"""That's what you think"" HAHAHA"
So dirty this guy
Putting whole onion and ginger and so on seems like a huge waste. The middle part will never contribute anything and is just wasted.
"Why fuck up good food by throwing whole bag of msg in there?
That one scene made me dislike the whole video"
Phooooooo
why only so little msg ?!
05:55    UR: I push it and it goes in        MT:  thats what you think.  MT -1 UR - 0
Now I know why Auntie Helen left you. 😅
This is southern Pho 🍲 a slightly different to the north. Remember most kitchens are run by people from south.
Soon we will see bald uncle roger if he eat to much msg
Uncle rodger put msg in his pants🤣🤣🤣🙈
I'm vietnamese and happy 6m subcribers :D

"12:32 Beef:

"Beef, how dare you rickroll the comment section."
He should make nasi goreng next milestone
That portion is so tiny needs to be 2x bigger
"I love your videos Uncle Roger (and I love MSG), but it physically hurt me to watch you put THAT much MSG into the pot with all of those amazing cuts of beef.... You should know by now that a little goes a long way😉"

Uncle Roger Pho and Ramen instant noodles are the same.  Mwhahaha.
"My godness! Look at the amount of MSG that uncle Roger pour into the broth. My mom would kill u with her flip-flop.
By the way, northen people in Viet Nam prefer eating Phở without MSG, because of unnatural sweetness. Just look at auntie Thuy's reaction at 6:59 - The pain is huge!"
"Uncle Roger, you are my kids biggest fans. Everytime we went to the supermarket they asked ""mama, don't you want to get MSG?"" (A pack of sasa) Fuiyoooooooh"
Bought the 2nd to last book :)
How long is the offer for?
Love the 69k likes
"Finally we have Vietnamese pho, i have seen all your weejo about pho and my ancestor can smile now because of this beautiful pho. Thank you Mrs.Thuy for show wastern people how to cook properly pho."
"You are most welcome! My absolute pleasure to showcase our National dish, in the best and most positive light possible. Behind the comedy, uncle Roger and his team worked so hard to make this video happen in the most funny, yet respectful way to the recipe. I feel very lucky to help deliver it! Makes me happy to hear fellow Vietnamese approve, as you know Pho is very different from family to family, even more so in North of Vietnam. Both ways are delicious!! 🥰🍜❤️ xxx"
Uncle Roger is too funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"It must be said that you should only massage meat in water when you're making a broth, never wash meat if you mean to use it for anything else since the blood is what gives meat its flavor. 

Its also important to know the difference between washing and massaging meat (no not like that!), washing will bruise the surface of the meat and remove all of the color, making it very unappetizing and flavorless (most asian households compensate the loss of flavor by marinating it in an umami base like soy sauce). its far better to massage it and let the chemical reaction of salt and lemon do all of the work of drawing out the loose blood. 

Alternatively you can skip the massaging process entirely — which would cause the broth to become cloudy, but you can clear the cloudiness by straining it, followed by pouring a raw egg-white only mix into the hot broth; as the egg white coagulates it will trap the solids in it, strain again and repeat the process however many times you prefer to gain the clear broth you want without sacrificing the flavor. (only downside is the amount of eggs you'll have to waste to get it)"
I didn’t get the Australian joke 🤔
"This is probably the sweetest co-star he's worked with so far.  Love how she still bites back anyway, though."
@Chef Thuy Pham hello from Vietnam . you earn new subscriber

Auntie Thuy is very charming and sweet. Can I get a copy of her boor or recipes here in the US?
Now I really want some PHO...maybe with less MSG. (puts in 1 kg bag) You can hear my heart going 'oh hell this is going to hurt' and my stomach saying 'shut and deal with it!' 🤣

Uncle Roger shaking the noodles and asking Aunt Thuey if she knows this sound made my day 😂😂😂😂
you put to much msg :(((((
Thuy stole the show. A real natural.
"A trick my mum does when cutting beef thin is to either un/freeze beef halfway- cold enough to get crystals but warm enough not to be a complete block- before slicing it. Slices are always wonderfully thin and tender when cut across the grain.

Congrats on 6+ million subscribers Uncle Roger!"

"Uncle Lojer, you should go tukdin restaurant and review."
I wonder if in Nigel’s creation of “Uncle Roger” did he ever wonder that he might just one day actually be made to cook the food he was criticizing 😂😂
Thats part of his job to make his words foolproof
👍😭😎
♥️♥️♥️
congrats uncle
I remember Nick learned from her to earn Uncle title
I thought msg was salt on crack 👀🤣

MSG means Make shit Good . 
It gives flavour, flavour is like money , the more the better ."
As a VietNamese i never see such quality bow of Pho like this in my town
"I wanted to create something authentic in flavours and technique, to truly represent Vietnam in one bowl. But at the same time, to elevate it with inspirations from London for my customers to enjoy! It was the BEST dish at LVK, and customers would travel for thousands of miles to taste 🥰 This made all the hard work daily worth it!"
"We expecting austrilians to come
Theres an unintentional second part of the joke where the whole kitchen is a fire hazard"
"Remember niece and nephew, just a pinch of MSG is enough! Uncle Roger pouring that much to get cool slow-mo shot for camera only"

It was so hard to contain my laughter! You just never know what’s coming next! 😂
I have never heard of Vietnamese with a British accent and I am Vietnamese! PIP PIP CHEERIO MY GOOD OLD CHAP Uncle Roger!
No bean sprout
fuiyooh
What da pho?
Put a another packet of msg in it & red chil we want that pho broth to roar 😃 don't forget the fryd egg on top do they have a herbal medicine of the pho broth when you live in Indonesia before you moved to the UK uncle roger 😁✌❤
"Once he put all of that MSG in the pot he lost me as a viewer and a fan... there are some lines that are stupid, moronic. Jamie Oliver is funnier than you."
"Auntie Thuy is so lovely, Uncle Roger's antics just slightly too disturbing for her kind and innocent heart."
"omg.. beansprout, are you serious? must be southern-style, which is not authentic at all. Imagine you eat Peking duck but made in the style of a southern province of china. If you make Pho, make it the right way, the northen way."
No tripe?
"As a Vietnamese, I feel special"
But you didn’t make pho…. Someone made for you
You will go Bald eating so much MSG MrNigel
MSG is like coke in Asian kitchen we addict.
"Legitimately WAY better chemistry with Aunty Thuy than Esther, too funny"
Look very good uncle roger 😂 but to muck white powder hayah
Ai yah there's not supposed to be fish sauce in pho besides that it looks really good!  Love the video.
SMG👹  your kidneys 😵
STOP RUINING FOOD WITH TOO MUCH MSG OMG IM HAVING A PANIC ATTACK
I love how obsessed he is with wok tosses but still never learned how to do them well
Toooo much msg. That’s bad.
Holy cow that was alot of MSG
Yep that's was too much msg tho
And so the short wait begins for 7 million...
Yo much msg is that bot too dangerous?
Love Pho 😋
Uncle Roger should try Filipino food.
"Uncle Roger, you unknowingly gave me an amazing 49th birthday present with this video! I'll definitely be buying Auntie Thuy's cookbook and one day hope to visit her restaurant in London. Thank you for sharing and promoting amazing Asian cuisine to the world, and congratulations on reaching the six million subscriber mark!"
"@Chef Thuy Pham I know I will, and have subscribed to you as well!"
"Happy Birthday Nhan!!! Wishing you and amazing day, filled with delicious food, and surrounded by loved ones. But it has made me happy knowing you enjoyed the video with uncle Roger! Yay! Hope you will love my recipes as much as I do! xxx"

"""Hello, hello, this is beef. Thank you for killing me!""

Hindu viewer: :|"
So cringe... 🤪
I like this aunt’s vibe 😂😊
"Where is the funny ?? This is cringe 🤦‍♂️ every ""joke"" is racist or cringe"
The fact that Roger skimped for a 63 year old he should do it with someone who is younger but also looks young for example Shakira that singer. 45 but looks like she is 20
What the Pho?
"Yeah that is mean, Asian people taking over my country 🤦‍♂️😒"
"""You know who mean, French people who take over your country, that mean""
lmao, I felt that"
"I respect everyone who were involved in this , seriously the best piece that I ' ve ever seen on YouTube ,Hats of the Well All ! Love your videos💓"
"""""""one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something .he always respect us , the audience and his team , and he is polite in all his videos .we congratulations ourselves on this achievement . more to come 💕💗"

"""her beef thicker than lizzo"" omggg"
She's the most adorable chef i have ever seen !!
"You are so generous and kind, thank you 💚"
"In Vietnam, we put that much MSG in 1 bowl. I repeat, 1 freaking bowl."
That was a bit too much MSG...
"@Jeremy Nunuhitu Realistically, that's too much. Putting a whole bag like that in the soup, your throat is gonna feel dry for hours if you drink that soup"
That's not enough msg
Thanks Auntie Thuy for letting Roger in the door. We know you didn't have to do that.
"First time Uncle Roger makes Asian ancestors cry. 😂 Good burn, Auntie Thuy.
But seriously, it shows diversity in Asian food. What you do with one Asian cuisine do not always apply to others."
I haven't had Vegan pho before but Vegan Bun Bo Hue is absolutely delicious
YES! I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG!
Too much msg man
I'm from vietnam and i must say u did very good at making pho. Congratualations on your 6 million subs uncle Roger
"""you know what mean- french people who take over your country"" he's right you know"
Every time he does a subscriber milestone I always feel so bad for the people that he does it with
"Its funny, uncle roger hits 6 million subscribers the same day i finally arrive in thailand. Definitely going to eat good while i'm here. Also I was just in mumbai and... I mean lets just say you should team up with some italian or american food youtubers and roast just how bad indians fuck up the most basic dishes that don't involve curry or spices. I literally had to order a dozen boiled eggs just to get something that wouldn't upset my stomach after i got sick"
"Foreplay is waste of time

NO YOU CHEAP UNCLE ROGER !"
POV: me looking in the comments for angry vegan people saying some dum bullshit
Whats gonna Uncle Roger make at 7M subs ?
"""Why the floor on the ceiling""

""We were expecting lots of australians""

That was absolutely golden."

"Auntie Thuy: ""You're so mean to westerners""
Uncle Roger: ""I not mean. You know who mean? French people who take over your country. That mean""

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Nigel, you're a gem! I laughed so much in 12:53 minutes, way more than watching most stand-up comedy shows that go on for like an hour on streaming services."
American with fake asian accent cooking with a viatnamese that has a british accent. brain hurt.
Her accent is more british than british people
Please react to Brian Tsao Egg Fried Rice video
"As a Vietnamese nephew, uncle Roger did a great job. Also I have been living in the UK for the past year, and gotta say the Phở by Auntie Thuy is great looking so far, a lot of other Vnmese theme restaurants I been to serve really low effort but high price Phở."
"High price, low effort, just like auntie Helen, haiyaaa."
That book went directly into my cart!
"Seeing Uncle Roger cook one of my favorite dishes as a Viet today before my birthday tomorrow is a gift of itself, Cheers Uncle."
Happy 6 million fellow Uncle!
"IDK why for me she's seems so worried in many scene, maybe bcs she's afraid Roger will do some calamity LOL. 
But since she can blend with Roger's joke I think she's just nervous.

Are you going to give the meat a happy ending

6:49 at this point I believe uncle roger's blood also has msg in it 💀
The bowl is too small but it's not about the size it's about how u use it

Oh no need for that much msg or msg for well made broth I felt very bad for her when he poured all the msg lol
Hilarious. She was great. Awesome video!

"Mad shade on the French, but I guess they wouldn’t be known for surrendering had they not taken one few farmers"
Ah yes another Uncle Roger video that'll guarenteed making all of our Asian ancestor jump with joy instead of watching British or American chef slaughtering it ...
Auntie Thuy's cookbook is only #48 on US Amazon for Vietnamese cookbooks right now.  I bought a copy. Let's show her some love and move it up in the charts.

Welcome to the Roast of Uncle Roger, which we want at 10 Million Subscribers."
How is that Uncle Gordon lost his title and Uncle Roger still calls him Uncle Gordon? Is it because the whole 10-minute ramen fiasco was just a joke?
2:00 I was shocked. LMFAO!
Viet Nam war won the war on France... so you can't really say that
She was precious. Thank you Uncle Roger
I saw that meat platter and almost passed out with happiness. Congrats 6 million on your way to 10 million.
Where is Nick's comment ]:
"Uncle Roger use wrong knife slicing raw meat. Watch how slice sticks to blade. Use thin slicing knife. Also, meat should be slightly frozen."
"Uncle Roger why so clumsy!!! So clumsy!
You spill good broth and make our ancestors crying 🤣🤣🤣"
"Great episode! Bought little viet kitchen book, gonna make my pho better....  with a pound of msg... :)"
M S G .... make shit good!!! haha nice one

She is so adorable ☺️
I like this auntie. Very meta haha
Aunty Esther killed it on Netflix’s Iron Chef
"Interesting, I always taught to use cold water instead of hot water, because the hot water can seal the protein of the exterior therefore the blood will be locked inside the meat which makes the meat gamey."
"Any UNCLE can make Pho, uncle. Vs me in Mah Jong :3"
"In order to slice the meat thin, you have the meat a little frozen. Can't slice when it's limp. Like Uncle Roger little guy. SORRY CHILDREN."
Hes got more than Jamie Oliver now. Time to clap back at Auntie Helen for passing him by a ton 👏
uncle Roger is MSG bae
"Auntie Thuy is a lovely lady!  Congrats on your six million Uncle Roger and best of luck to you, Auntie, when you open your restaurant!"

Pho looks delicious and so will you
Passed Jamie oliver
"MSG puts in dog food, dog instant death. 
MSG puts in alcoholic beverage, people instant pass out."
"True Phở recipe confirmed, xD"
“This is how you teabag Uncle Roger.”😂😂😂
Judging by all the timings this must have taken about 18 hours to prepare??? 🥵
Is it a challenge to eat Uncle Roger dish? A whole pot of MSG. You gonna need tons of water to drain them out!
"Oh Uncle Roger, I LOVE YOU.  ""Know what mean...French people taking over a WHOLE country. That mean?"" And, the war over it wasn't any good either. Putin...are you listening?
I also luv how u giv yr guests heart attacks over yr antics. And you DEFINITELY needed to say ""sorry children"" after that t bag joke. You are auntie's naughty, naughty much loved nephew. 
Looking 4ward to more of th same."
"OMG !! Auntie Thuy is the best

Uncle roger im sorry butt allergic to meat
I love how he calls nick uncle nick instead of nephew nick like he used to FUIYOU
"When will u come to Vietnam, UR?"
This Aussie (nice floor-ceiling!) loves Pho! I quickly developed an appreciation for it (especially Pho Ga) during my travels through Vietnam over a decade ago and was amazed that a staple food would be so darn complicated and time consuming to make. Thankfully we have a lovely Vietnamese community here in my local area and several restaurants that make properly authentic Pho… so don’t have to ;-)
Pho ga is so freaking delicious!!!
"Simple food, made with love and respect will always produce the tastiest dishes. To me, that is Vietnamese cuisine. Making the best of what we have! :)"
"https://youtu.be/w5O73lTmYjs

Or find him and force a few lessons on him.
"""Can I do wok toss?""

"WAH LAN. Six million sub one!

looks like my fathers pho
Full marks to Uncle Roger roasting the French more than he roasted that onion lmao
"you said that about the French. The only people who say that about the French are extremist, your Malaysian is showing. un subbed"
"That looks delicious, pho-real man!"
I finally have a good uncle! Plus he can cook other things other than extremely American dishes. 🥹
"I don’t think he’s making pho broth, he’s making MSG broth with a side of beef"
I like how her childhood pictures were in black and white like it wasn't the 90s when they were taken. We didn't even have color film back in those days I guess. 😂
I love this guy 🤣🤣🙏🏽🙏🏽good job uncle (Chacha) Roger!!!
So funny.. You should think about going into comedy........Haha!

Need to make a video with the emotional damage guy
Bro she doesn’t have the Vietnamese accent…I’m disappointed lmao
Chef Thuy looks tight AF
Haha 😅 Uncle Roger definitely did his homework!! Great recipe.. Homemade pho is a true craft.. Once you go homemade you will struggle to go back to store bought pho!
All the auntys need more screen time. Where's aunty hersha
"Uncle Roger's humor is so perfected that he can make a joke about someone's mom dying but pull it off perfectly, lol
THAT is what humor is, using laughter to help with pain."
"@Chef Thuy Pham My gf is buying the book, so i'll have no choice but to try the recipe, haha
Wish you the best!"
"Haha! The things uncle Roger gets away with right?!! As long as you guys buy the book to try out my recipe, I'm happy! :)"

Emotional damage sooooo overplayed now plz
"lmao uncle roger said that ""so you usually don't have msg and then she said no so that means she does put msg in her pho LOL"
You make pho but no vietsub haiyaaa
Beef pho feels so nice in winter. Taste so good better than a soup but it’s still nice and warm and something about just holding a bowl of hot pho. 👌
Not only am Vietnamese but I'm also Australian and didn't expect that ceiling joke. 🇦🇺
She reminds me of Monica Geller 😂😂😂😂
Whole large pot of msg????? Omg

Wish I was in the UK.....would order Auntie Thuy's Pho at least times a week...Pho=bowl full of happiness :)
"It’s not difficult to make, just need to cook it with lots of love and care. The end result is priceless! I’ve written all the tricks in the book to make sure it’s achievable by everyone! Hope you’ll give it a go at home 😋🍜🥰"

I love Aunty Thuy.   She is a great sport and willing to give it back. Lol
what's the difference between Vietnamese dry rice noodles and Cantonese fresh rice noodles
So when is the Uncle Roger cookbook coming out?
WE MUST FEEL SO HONORED WE GOT CALLED NEICE AND NEPHEW:O.
so cute
"Hey Uncle Roger! I showed this to my grandma, and both of us found it very entertaining 😀

Some further information to you guys: The type of phở that they made is from South Vietnam. They are usually sweeter than the ones from Northern Vietnam (My family is from Northern Vietnam). Moreover, they have bean sprouts in this type of phở, which is different from our region. I tried this type of phở, and they are pretty good!

Additionally, they are many types of cooking methods for the meat. In this video, he made a type of phở called ""phở bò tái"". It basically means that you sliced the beef as thin as possible, and you poured the hot broth over on the meat and the dish in general. There are many more methods, such as fully cooking the beef, beef meatballs, etc. You can also eat chicken instead of beef, which is also very popular in Vietnam.

In brief, I recommend you guys try both those types of phở, Northern and Southern. Also, it is also interesting to try many types of cooking methods for beef and chicken!"
@Chef Thuy Pham Thank you for your warming greetings and I love your stories of how you made phở to fit best with your family's and your customers' taste! I hope that I could visit your restaurant and try your bowl of phở one day! I wish you and your family the best! ❤️
"Please send my thanks to your grandma! Makes me really happy to hear she approves (because it's rare haha!). Yes, LVK pho is heavily inspired by the southern style, where I grew up. But for the restaurant, I had to develop the flavours over time to suit the tastebuds of my diners (and me) so it's not as sweet as my mum's, keeping the onion whole is my nod to my northern friends! The beef short rib and marrow was created for LVK because these were the extra elements that I really enjoyed and wanted to share with everyone that visited! x"
Here finally https://youtu.be/f_TJ9KMAGQg
"2:42  Am I hearing things, or did Auntie Thuy say Phoe instead of Phuh!?"
"@GiangcK well, most of the Vietnamese chefs i have heard pronounce it Fuh, which is why i was surprised when Thuy said Foe at 2:42. That was all my comment was saying. I didn't mean to offend anyone."
"@DBS101 Fuh is how non-Vietnamese spell Phở cuz they can't spell the original name correctly lol. I'm not blaming anyone, but it is what it is"
@DBS101 Are you trying to tell a Vietnamese how to pronounce their country's signature dish?
"@GiangcK Fuh is supposed to be the correct pronunciation, not Foe."
That's the correct pronunciation.
"""MSG is like money, more always better""
- Uncle Roger"
I love Asians sense of humor
we need an uncle roger - steven he collab
"Our traditional food pho, we also served with one more important cracker, called quay. It's like the prawn cracker, the only thing we allow to be crispy. No crispy beef ofc, otherwise you're gonna start another Vietnam war."
Never seen such a small pho bowl.
OMFG that's too much MSG
"Filming with the master & plugging Only Fans, while tea baggin'? Fuckin' Legend."

You are adorable.  You deserve better than uncle Roger's chaos. Much love from Montreal.
You have the most satisfying videos. I also noticed that no one can roast Uncle Roger like an Asian woman!
Ad revenue from aji no moto😜
Fuiyoh! 6M subscriber!
Great job
I know now why Roger looks sleepy every time. Too much MSG.
Uncle Roger throw msg that time I laughed like idiot 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"It's Perfect!
As a Vietnamese, I approve your Phở
Very nice work Uncle Roger!
Just remember, not every Asian food has MSG in there
Every time you put too much MSG in there, I felt my ancestors crying in my heart..."
Uncle Roger just gave MSG the best acronym EVER! Make Shit Good. FUIYOH!
im going to this resturant just because this chef is spectacular.
I really hope Jamie Oliver watches your videos and then cries himself to sleep for weeks
It brown
Very funny.
AHAHAHAA THE OUTTAKES 😝
What a fricken angel
Aunt Thuy is such a sweetheart!
soon he gonna get physical damage. insult British now French
"how a bout ""Cơm Tấm""/ Com Tam next time ?"
MSG is good but it'll destroy the flavor if you put it in too much
"i would love to work for u, i ama  chef , let me know if interested"
"bruh, thats to much MSG......in Vn we do use MSG much, but not that much :))))))"
"Hey Uncle Roger, you now have a sexy vtuber as one of your fans. Her name is Shylily."
how did u save the broth even after adding that amount of MSG??
Uncle Roger is gonna have to show us his concealed carry permit for that MSG
"Do you know who mean? French people , they take over your country 🥹🥹😂😂 OMG"
"Congratulations to the 6M! In the meantime, some chefs are seemingly more eager to earn the ""Uncle"" title than a michelin star- latest one here https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gU3Qs2Z3qLc"
Uncle Roger use colander...Haiyaaaaaa!!!  no meat ball?  Haiyaaaa?  should have used MSG water bath not salt.  Haiyaaaa!  Asian using binocular instead of huge telephoto camera lens?  Haiyaaa!  How Uncle Roger get so many thing wrong for 6m subscriber special?  That is too small of a bowl for Pho!
That looks amazing. 👌
Nous on est mean ? Nous on est mean ? On va le ré-envahir il fera moins le malin
"Man like roger be like..”this may be your restaurant. 
But this is MY SHOW!😄"
Interesting @mrnigelng there is no draining of the water used to clean the beef? Just skim it all and add in aromatics?
"thank you for this great video, it reminds me of my mom's pho"
fuiyohh
i mean better the French than Charlie..
UNCLE UNCLE I FOUND CRISPS WITH NO MSG 😭😭😭😭😭
Wait Nigel didn’t Gordon Ramsay lose his uncle title
This is hilarious already lmao 🤣
I am vegan(and a girl) who hates boys who eat meat in Asian Countries.
"This is best dynamic between these two, the banter is so good😂"
Why did you guys stick two whole stick of green onions in the pho!? You’re suppose to cut it up so you can enjoy it with the pho. hAYaaaH!!!
YEAHHHHHHHHH PHOO
Hey uncle Roger… just wanted to say congratulations and i hope everything goes well for you in life 🙏🏽
I often wonder what happens to the food that's been polluted by the MSG...
"I flipped so hard when I saw that bag of msg into the broth … 😂 
Normally I’d say *emotional damage* but I think this is - *authentic liver and kidney damage*"
She’s so innocent
Now I want it
Uncle Roger my wife destroyed rice cooker.
"Fun video but you gotta find another Spicy lady cheif to cook with, this lady is far to reserved for your humor haha"
Waitttt since when uncle gordon got his title back?!!
He screwed up. He didn't sear the meat.
Who else just found this channel and got addicted to it
So fun
"My FAVOURITE VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT!!! Ooh thank you uncle Roger! This whole time I thought that they were hurt by the pandemic! So happy to see the chef so well and had a baby. Dear chef Thuy, if you see this please know that my friends and I in islington are all waiting patiently for  Little Viet Kitchen reopening!! Thank you both so much for this!! This is such great news xxx"
@Chef Thuy Pham chef 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
"Hey hey Grace! How are you? Aw, that's so sweet of you to say. I'm currently busy with summer festivals, but stay tuned on my instagram for details of my first secret super club in October! Would love to cook for you and your friends again. Big love! xxx"
"@Kian N. Ardalan I hope so too. It is one of if not the best Vietnamese restaurant, and this whole time I thought that they closed due to financial difficulty from the pandemic and have been feeling a bit sad for them. I am overjoyed to see that all Is well."

"Thuy is so cute and charming, and funny, and intelligent, and sweet. The exact opposite of Uncle Roger"
100% he couldn't have make pho on his own
"He's a comedian, if anything else comes to mind, comedians can't cook. Appreciate that Roger does a little bit lol. But putting 1 pack of msg is killing me!"
"Thinly slices beef might be the authentic protein of Pho, but not the most popular"
Thuy is an honest person
pho looks so good! Aunty Thuy is awesome cook
"6:17 she's using non traditional ingredients!!!! Get her, Uncle Roger!! Get her!"
uncle roger stop getitng people to help you cook. M8 cook yourself in your kitchen
Funny thing with Uncle Roger tossing the spices is that he already lectured Uncle Nick on his own Pho weijo.
"Happy 6 million subscribers, Uncle Roger/Nigel! Fuiyoh!! We love you. Keep doing what you do.😁😁😁"
“Her beefs thicker than Lizzie” 😂💀
Auntie Esther replacement I think ;-)
Beef thicker than Lizzo😂😂😂
Aunty Thuy give Uncle Roger a run for his money. She’s not embarrassed at all and cracks right back at him. Using his own saying making my ancestors cry was epic.
Dude I tried pho for the first time yesterday.. what a coincidence
What a bloody thoughtful shiela for thinking of us poor ceiling-walkers!
Aunty Thuy just act like asian mom in the kitchen with their kids
Awesome show thank you guys. Very beautiful and yummy looking. Keep the great show’s coming.
"Fuiyoh, congrats 6m uncle :3"
These two are wonderful together! She's more than capable of keeping up with Uncles shenanigans!
@Chef Thuy Pham Let him cook Filipino Afritada.
"Thank you, that's nice to hear. He's always up to something, you never know what's coming! :P"

"Uncle Roger, she wants to choke you. She so angry at you."
60000000.03
Correction 6.0³
"THAT SUCH TINY BOWL. IF YOU WANT PHO PHO YOU NEED TO HAVE A MASSIVE BOWL FOR THE MASSIVE MEAT. Imagine if you eat the chunky meat with the noodles, that is painful."
Without fail Uncle Roger will take a dig at jamie Oliver 😂
why has no one realized this guy isn't funny?
0:31 don't worry Irish people are British
"Aunty Thuy could be a very good friend to hang out, she understands many jokes and learns people's sense of humour very easily. Fuiyooh!!"
auntie thuy is an absolute hoot!
i had some the other day!
tip: put meat into the fridge for a few minutes to make it harder and stiffer (but not frozen!) so it's easier to cut thin slices
Uncle Roger King Tosser! * badumtish *
I am saddened that you can't get her Pho in the US. T.T
A little fun fact for Uncle Roger: green fire has higher temperature than blue fire
This guy is singlehandedly uniting the entirety of SEA
"As soon as uncle Roger took a shot at Jamie olive oil I liked the video 😂😭
Congrats on 6 million subs uncle Roger 🎉"
At the 5:50 mark did you change the water or just skim the scum off the top?
That was an obscene quantity of MSG
He be killing her lmao
Shame you had to ruin great pho by adding that much MSG just for the video
Right? Killing flavour is not good!
Right? Killing flavour is not good!
Suggestion: You could try recreating some of Jamie Oliver’s dishes
uncle roger put soo much msg he started to got high
The bowl is so small for dish!! HAIYAAAAA
Lol.
"That pho looks delicious, it's the most delicious looking plate of pho i've seen in a while"
@Chef Thuy Pham Hope you do more collabs with Uncle Roger - def want to try the pho if I ever visit!
"Thank you, makes me happy to hear! :)"
I'm hurt I'm French but I use spices and I've never cooked without MSG
anyone know how much msg that was lol
As a viet that looks legit Uncle Roger. But that’s a LOT of MSG 😂😂
When will yours and Auntie Esthers movie “scene” coming out?
"🤣 Uncle Roger ripping it today.. 
      Congrats on 6mil 👏
     MSG- ""Make Sheeit Good"""
"4 months since the 5mill special, madddd!!! 👏"
...little garbage kitchen... owner needs to listen better to Uncle roger.
Uncle Roger's joke about French people being mean 🔥
"CONGRATS UNCLE ROGER ON 6M SUBSCRIBERS!!! YAY🎉🎉🎉FUIYOH!!!
LOVE PHO 🍜😋"
"I love that you took comedy and raised it into awareness about different cultures and cooking. some people might not like the means, but the result is that so many more people are exposed to other cultures and foods because of it, while understanding the importance of authenticity and tradition."
She seems so kind and humble
Uncle roger will loose uncle title dew to aunty thuy haiyaahh
9:21 MSG : Make Shit Good
haiyah uncle roger you told us nephew that this all about balance
"U bastard. I just spit Gatorade all over this gym thanks to ""second book for father?"""
"That soup looks goooood!

10:51 Who puts lime in the middle of the bowl? Hiyah..."
"Uncle Roger, you absolutely MUST react to PointCrow's ""Unspeakable Horror Done to a $175 Dollar Steak!"""
"Uncle roger, stop ruining the food by adding that much msg lol"
"What do you call pho that comes in a box from the store?  Pho kit.
What do you call the science of pho? Pho chem.
What do you call the line at the pho restaurant? Pho queue."
Hopefully I can visit on my next London trip!
"FYI Uncle Roger Lizzo is not thicc, she is obese!"
Looks amazing!
Not so much secret now
NOW THIS!! This is pho.
How you make vegan pho... you only need half a vegan to make the stock.
"2:03 Steve He : ""EmotionOl damage!"""
THE HARVEY WEINSTEIN OF TESCO GIVE HIM THE CROWN HE WON COMEDY
she's so adorable
as a vietnamese man i support this video
"As an Australian, I’ll come there 😂🤣😂"
@Josi I honestly don’t know either 🥲🥹…… might have something to do with opposite sides of the world? I really don’t know 😩
Can you explain the ceiling joke to me?
What about the Tare?
"I have all those spices in my cabinet. Since I refuse to m*rd*r pho, I am going to put all of them in my   potpourri cauldron."
Did this man say Rachel Ray's beef is thicker than Lizzo? 💀😭
"""Foreplay is waste of time""
""No, You're cheap!"" 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
I ADORE Aunty Thuy! Her Accent is amazing too! So sharp! I thought I liked aunty esther.
"I love MSG as much as the next guy, but the cost of that cool slow-mo shot was drastic.... all that beautiful broth.... ruined :("
2:57 Does anyone else realize the store looks like the art gallery from the first season of Slasher?
"""Foreplay is waste of time."" And that is a big reason why Auntie Helen left Uncle Roger. The End."
"OMG Auntie Thuy is so charming and cute. 

She needs a YouTube channel ASAP."
"@Chef Thuy Pham Oh my goodness thanks for replying! 😀

You're able to keep up with Uncle Roger and I'll gladly watch you cook Vietnamese food! You're great on camera and I think you'll get a following quickly 😀"
"You're so kind, thank you! I will do my best to start something next year. Seven years running LVK meant I had very little time to start a YouTube project. Will keep you posted! :)"
Here finally https://youtu.be/f_TJ9KMAGQg
I’ve never eaten Vietnamese food but boy oh boy does this look so delicious.  😋
1:57 FOR PHOK SAKE ROGER😂😂😂
"my mom uses the daikon in her pho too. Not all the time. It doesn't affect the taste of the pho, don't worry about that. The main flavor is the spices and charred onions. 
Not including the beef bones cuz there are other variants of broth in pho. Chicken/veggies broths"
I also love eating the daikon after it has soaked in all the spices! mmm... so comforting and tasty! xxx
That looks like the best fucking Pho in the world. I wish I was in London
"Your shtick about shitting on other people cooking, sure. But this was just peak cringe. Seriously, making jokes about her parents dying. Unsubbed."
"@R. Vandergeld yea, because that's clearly why I'm here."
👋🏻 BYE!!!!
Go entertain your ONLY 4 subs!
She looks so scared of him xD
6:28 i knew
:3 she is so nice!
Uncle Roger beats Jamie Oliveoil
Her beef bigger than Lizzo.  😂😂🤣🤣
"Beef thicker than Lizzo, only here that's a bad thing.  I still watch and like button Uncle Roger."
Wow I can't believe that she released a family secret to 6 million or more people just for a youtube video.
I ain't gonna lie - I'm loving Auntie Thuy! Auntie Esther may have some competition!
"""Why the floor on the ceiling""

""We were expecting lots of australians""

That was absolutely golden."
"@Haikal Azdawi you Indonesian, if you live in Java or other southern equator Indonesia region that means you're counted as upside down world lmao."
Glad you appreciate it haha! :P
"Australians, huh? Maybe even TwoSetViolin :D"
"@Haikal Azdawi They are south of the equator so the joke is that they are ""upside down"". I know that Indonesia is some north of the equator and some south, so maybe the joke doesn't make as much sense."
Here finally https://youtu.be/f_TJ9KMAGQg
I would tea bag uncle roger 🤤
"WHY DID YOU PUT ALL OF THIS MSGGGGG, TOO MUCH, TOO MUCH"
"Fire, great video"
This is actually important cultural work
SO CHEEK! Jamie Olive Oil ad right before this weejio….for supermarket jar of spice paste! Haiyaa
That looked pho-king fantastic.
"I want to be friends with aunty Thuy, she is lovely."
"AS A VIETNAMESE AMERICAN, I LOVE THUYS ENGLISH ACCENT. I CAN LISTEN TO HER TALK ALL DAY"
I love all your Videos Uncle Roger. Greetings from an German Chef. 🥰❤❤😍😘 5:30 if you throw your beef before the water in your pot nothing gets wet and dirty.
The only time I scared of MSG
3:12 yea haha guys very funny
"ok sorry about the msg, that just ruined the broth"
I want her Book!
"🤣🤣🤣 i love everytime uncle rogger mocks jamie, him an bbc are part of the reason english food culture is dieing"
About damn time!
Finally it’s here: I don’t care what is finally here
"Uncle Roger, I think its time for you to check out Uncle Mark's thai rice recipe: https://youtu.be/mV3m2svj3XE"
I have a grill for charring ginger and onion
First time I ever wanted to go to the UK
Definitely Gold!
you are so correct about french people
She is very Funny!  bravo
Wait what does msg taste like 💀cause that seems like alot
uncil you talk shit about nicks pho look at the color of your own broth
congrats on 6 million!❤️
"Bro, her voice. This what happen when you Asian but you live in the uk 😶"
Chandeliers are dumb tho
I’m VNese and I genuinely freaked out when I see that much MSG in the broth 🤣🤣🤣
Looks delicious and MADE correctly. Unlike other places.
"If Co Thuy says its gold, its gold!"
"9:18
You know what MSG stands for? 
Make sh*t good. 🤣🤣🤣"
Dear Bob she’s a keeper.  😂
Congrats Nigel! This was fun to watch and the pho looks amazing 😊 Cheers man 🍻
"Wow, hes gone so far from 2020"
When will u make butter chicken or paneer butter masala uncle roger
"MSG: Make Shit Good
That's the truth!"
That restaurant is now on a waiting list!
"4:39 i deserve an explanation, roger."
Great episode. 🤌
Omfg…. Uncle Roger must be sponsored by ajinomoto haha
"""Flavour is like money. More is better."" Explains why Jamie Oliver went bankrupt"
My Vietnamese ancestors have been made proud.
Lizzo lol damn
"This is the funniest video yet, like I really laughed throughout the full video. Aunty Thuy was also great, should get her on your podcast!"
@Chef Thuy Pham You are beautiful and charming! Would love to see more of you :)
"Glad to hear you enjoyed the video, it was really fun to make! Scarily unscripted so I had no idea what uncle roger was going to come out with! haha! Podcast, sounds fun already! :)"
"Aunty Thuy is super cute ! , more of her !"
"Being 1/2 Vietnamese myself, listening to her accent just throws me! Trust me… And you mix a perverted Malaysian.. YouTube GOLD! Love from DC Bushman!"
I'd be annoyed with this guy's pretend accent.
Fuiyoh!!!  I always wanted to learn the proper way to make Pho and much appreciated brother Nigel.  Congrats to your 6M subscribers!
Sup
So much msg plus salt..that's gonna taste awful
"Yeah, you obviously don't put that much msg in. They even said in the video....

It's just a dumb bit he does, lol"
"""you know who mean, French people taking over your country""

OOOOOOUUFFFF"
"Uncke Roger will hate me for this, but I really want to go to Little Viet Kitchen next time I'm in London now, so I can try a meat free Phô!!"
Yeaaah unfollowed not entertained anymore if he uses these….his show I canceled my ticket
Damn. That French taking over Vietnam joke was cold Uncle Roger. hahaha.
Aunty Esther should have won😥
i going to buy book for better life.
Nice. One thing that my dad does to make the slicing of the beef easier is to put it in the freezer then when you take it out to cut it's like cutting thin slices off a block of cheese.
"""You keep taaaalking"". LMFAO. Roger fawked up cutting the beef"
Now if only Jamie Oliveoil would review/critique this video
Love Auntie Thuy! I have her cookbook!
Pho looks good though.
The chemistry between you two was filled with MSG - fun episode!
"@Chef Thuy Pham lmao! Was that the magic of editing, or did he really use a whole bag of MSG like that?"
"A whole bag of it! lol My goodness, I nearly stopped breathing! x"
"Dang that Pho looks good, I want to eat that"
"2:00 I agree, the French are bad




(/s)"
Annie Thuy is an absolute delight!!!!
"""Taking white people food and making it better"" You Asians screwed up pizza."
Millions of vegans cry out in despair 😂😂😂🥗
Are you supposed to cook bean sprouts…?
Started eating Vietnamese food about 20 years ago and love it. Also lived about a block from one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the U.S. for almost a decade so my house was flooded with the smells of homemade Pho every weekend...pure heaven.
"when it's really good Pho, you don't use MSG. I know MSG is basically a cheating code, Uncle Roger, but when the Pho is right, you don't need to cheat, you stay true to the flavor."
Most people conceal a gun in their waistband; Uncle Roger conceal MSG in his waistband.
Auntie Thuy has to be one of the most adorable people to appear with Uncle Roger.  Such a pleasant personality.
"You're so kind, thank you. It's hard not to feel happy around uncle Roger, we all have an uncle like him! Complain complain, but very caring DEEP inside (somewhere) :P"
@Jesus Saves! Stop spamming
"Your worries (yes, anxiety), depression, suicidal thoughts, EVERYTHING will melt away and be NO MORE when you lean on God and put your trust in him! When I have physical pain, I literally pray and the Lord quells it, that I am healed!

Know that there is power in the name Jesus Christ! His name casts out demons and heals! People are bothered by his name. The world hates the truth and wants to continue living sinfully! God's children are set apart (holy) and righteous."
"Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him!
Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!

Have a blessed day, everyone! ❤"

"Well, thats too much MSG, frankly the most authentic Pho restaurants in Vietnam never use MSG"
"Love it, but I miss Aunty Esther!!"
Finally some true Pho! What beautiful broth. And Auntie Thuy seems absolutely wonderful!
"MSG = Make Shit Good

Uncle Roger really fucked up by putting entire bag of MSG like super crazy and showing all the feelings of his divorce in one moment
"Ig the ""Secret Recipe"" is not so secret anymore"
"If Uncle Roger released his own MSG, I would buy it like straight up XD"
Wait for 5 hours? Or go and get Jamie Oliver's recipe and it's done in 20 mins.
“You know who mean? French people who take over your country. That mean..” Ouch…. That hits hard.
we can all agree uncle rogers first words werent dad or mom it was msg
"Lol emotional damage meme, never gets old. Goes hand in hand with Chef Gordon.
This episode was pretty adorable, such a cute sweet chef. That cook book looks good."
"@Chef Thuy Pham awwwe thanks for replying, totally following your channel. 💗
Btw I also thought what you said about your cook book was lovely, about your mother and her home cooking, how your mom won't always be around. A way to cherish their memories. Very heart warming. ☺"
"You're very kind, thank you. I think you would really enjoy the book. I've made sure  every dish in there is worth the effort of you getting into the kitchen! :) xxx"
Auntie Thuy is so cute and a great host 👍🏻😘

Uncle Roger! An easy way to be able to thinly slice beef or meat is to freeze it and then slice it while it’s frozen. I do this when I’m making my pho!

Uncle Roger: I push it and it always go in. 

Auntie Thuy: That’s what you think. 

Someone give Uncle Roger some ice for that BURN!! 🔥"
"I felt that scream in Aunt Thuy’s soul when the whole MSG bag went in. Though the Magic Salt of God does Make Shit Good, but don’t follow that or the broth process got ruined, fellow. Btw, that accent of her is phenomenal. I learned the foreign language early yet to gain that accent is incredible 👍"
“you know who mean? french people who take over your country” 😭😭😭
"""There is no such thing as too much MSG."" 

Uncle Roger just dumps a whole bag of MSG like a madlad."
"Auntie Thuy is so professional and a little seriousand reserved, then in comes Uncle Roger to make it awkward!!! lol Great video."
Can you react to Gloom's egg fried rice video?
"Tks for including spring onion in your phở, eating phở or bún without spring onion is fucking heretic and should be discriminated"
"""handle meat and bone "" lmao"
Nice
So Nigel ng is an openly anti white racists got it .
"WHO ARE YOU, TONY MONTANA? THAT'S SO MUCH MSG THE CARTEL IS COMING FOR YOU"
YES IT HAS ARRIVED
"0:13 if u don't focus on it you'll hear ""Little wet kitchen"""

Congrats on 6 million. What a legend.
Congrats on hitting 6 million subs!!! Great vid! I'm now craving Vietnamese food. Ill go to my local for lunch today! 🍲
Now I need a review of this video from Uncle Roger
"Wish I could find those cuts of meat around here, damn.
Maybe I could do it with venison… 🤔
Could toss my wok any time Uncle Roger"
"when uncle roger reaches 10 million subscribers, we don't need normal diamond play button, we need an msg diamond play button"
Cannot believe he got chef Thuy for this. She’s legendary!
Congratulations on another milestone!  Great video!  Wish we had restaurants like that here in America!
"""We take white people shit and make it better"" LMFAO true though"
Thanks to Aunty Thuy for helping Uncle Roger with this video. I'm sure we all know Uncle Roger doesn't know how to make pho. The pho looks great. I never seen such a meaty bowl of pho like that before. 😀
the way he pulled out the msg 😳😳😳
Next 7 Million and you finally cook alone without pros help.
At this point an actual MSG company needs to collab with Uncle Roger so he can have his own versions. Fuiyooooooo
"Hey Uncle Roger, MSG is vegan. :) Check mate."
This was awesome!!! 😆😆😆
"Best joke, “Why is your floor on the ceiling?” we were expecting lots of Australians … “"
You make ancestors cry with that much msg
Now it's everyone's turn to roast you Uncle Rodger congratulations on the 6 million subscribers 👏😀🙌👍😄
Aunty's thuy is like Asian Nigella lawson lol

Fuiyoh! I love your videos. They always make me laugh no matter what lol Even on a bad day!
Auntie Thuy is hilarious!
"My wife used a metal spoon in a none stick pan. Had a big fight, Haiyaa! So added MSG to her food!"
You are no longer uncle just Roger your last 4 or 5 videos have been dumpster fires.
Auntie Thuy is so kind and patient with Uncle Roger. The pho looks really good. Definitely going to buy her book.
"Thank you so much, you're very kind. It would make me so happy to know my recipes will be in your kitchen too! x"

Hopefully this one isn't full of plagiarised recipes. Niece Haigh got dropped so fast.
"Perhaps at 9 M you can repeat it, but in your own kitchen? These professional kitchen attempts are less interesting, as you are always using equipment which none of us actually own."
"I love Auntie Thuy, she's so sweet and her pho looks so good. I hope to eat at her restaurant one day. Good job Uncle Roger! My favourite dish pho! Fuiyoh! =D Looked so good. And congrats getting 6m subs!!! Jamie Oliver just went yeahyah!"

"Finally, you bring back justice for the Pho!"
"Hello Uncle Roger. I new subscriber & bloody luv the channel & character. CONGRATULATIONS ON 6 MILLION.  Also, I'm AUSTRALIA Aunty Thuy...."

Lizzie joke unnecessary ❤️
Auntie Thuy seems like a sweet and funny person. Will have to visit her restaurant when I visit London !
"So, I’m coming to London to steal Auntie Thuy. I need good Pho and good conversation and she seems wonderful!"
So Gordon got his Uncle title back?

Congratulations uncle Roger and nephew Nigel. That is a beautiful bowl of Pho. Great job.
"*I call it here first…uncle roger is gonna open his own restaurant if not already*

Pulls out a bad of MSG inside of his pants"
OMG that MSG is too much 😂😂
"I felt sad when she said ""its hard to find good workers"".
Whatever entity out there please send her some good vietnamese workers!"
Pho’s not worth making if not done authentic. This made me hungry.
5:00 the sponge conveniently covering the sign saying that sink is for dishes only. Or maybe just not for hand-washing. Idk lol but yeah
If uncle roger manage to get to 7 million subs i wish he make chicken biryani
It look good but the green onion kind of too big for Pho.
This was around the corner from my office. I ate there all time time! So gooooood
Omg 😱 the amount of msg uncle Roger put into the pho broth is crazy! 😆
Uncle Roger make very good poo. I can smell it from here. Well done Uncle Roger for 6 million subscribers.
The BBC should hire Aunty Thuy she is very authentic
Brilliant! Love your videos! My wife and I watch the new ones together.

"Heh heh heh, Grand Uncle Colin yew lai liao. Uncle Roger has Cantonese eccent in his spoken English, Grand Uncle Colin has Hokkien eccent in his English.  Why Aunty Thuy's English so slang one ah, totally no Vietnamese eccent one."
"as a vietnamese, i approve"
"Hallo Hallo this is the beef, thank you for killing me... 🤣🤣🔪🐂"
"On behalf of the Vietnamese people…Auntie Thủy loses her “Vietnamese card” , if she’s not using MSG."
Now this looks extremely tasty really wanna try pho
"we need more of this aunty, so wholesome, so smart and brave, and awesome for putting up with him"

Come on bro you critique peoples food so much but never make a dish by yourself
Oh my God why you put so much  MSG Uncle Roger =))))))))))))))))))))

"Asians do not have a monopoly on large families. My ex-wife was one of 8 and has more than 100 1st cousins, and her mom was on of 13. I was only one of 4. You need to travel further inland next time you come to the states. Try Rual Ohio, Kentucky, and Indianna. It's a different world from the coasts. Those woke nonces on the coast do not represent all of America."
"*CONGRATS ON 6 MILLION FOLLOWERS!* 🥰And you did it in only 3 yrs. No joke Nigel, you are the funniest, most creative comedian working today. Chappelle got nothin' on you! We're waiting for YOUR Netflix special! And we need an Uncle Roger movie in 2024! And when you hit 10 million subs, you simply MUST have Jamie Oliver on to cook something with you. 😈"
Never fails to throw a whole bag of msg in dishes like why....is it salty?????
Watching you from 🇰🇪 kenya
When a comedian is better than a Michelin star British chef 😂😂
The actual Asian chef makes pho this time
Uncle Rogerrr why post this when uncle hometown reaching midnight 🇲🇾😭😭 hungry liaoo
The way their accents clash 😂
Everyone want to beat that meat-pho
Certified Gold!!!!!
Don't encourage the vegans. 😔
"msg is so good
just like uncle roger only fans"
So boil the meat to get the “gunk” out but then use the same gunky water as the broth?  I feel like I missed a step but I watched a couple of times.
"Fuiyoh, Uncle Roger! Show the British TV who's boss!!!"
My goodness! More MSG! Fuiyoh!!! 🤣
😮‍💨😍
"Uncle Roger...    Comment on out-take,  good thing wasn't trimming finger nail🙈 with knife.  Auntie Thuy is such a great sport. Great piece to learning nuance to making pho.  Congrats on 6M,  great accomplishment without being poodle for a cult."
that poor vietnamese-english lady having to deal with that
Aunty Thuy is so sweet..her voice too!!
why no chilli jam
"2:00 they made bánh mi with the baguette so it was worth it.

Jokes besides, most french people have no idea that french indochina was a thing, but knowing about it I deeply feel sorry for all the ancestors of the current vietnamese & other indochinese population for the exploitation they suffered from the french government and colons, as well as for the effect and scar it caused on these nations until present day
That feeling is probably shared among all of us french national who know about it, and it would be the same for any french person that would learn about it

in hopes for the best future for vietnam, laos, and cambodge 
🇨🇵🥂🇻🇳🇱🇦🇰🇭"
"""i push it and it always go in!""
""thats what you think.""
that response was the absolute peak here holy shit XDD"
Uncle Roger adds just the right amount of broth to his MSG.
I want Auntie Thuy to narrate my whole life. XD
For 7 million subs make biriyani
That pho is photo bombing.
Everytime the ex wife joke 🙄 😒😒
7M subscribers we need to have all the guest chefs come and roast Uncle Roger.
Pretty sure Aunty Thuy made our Uncle deep clean the whole kitchen after the cameras cut 😂
"Uncle Roger, there is a hit lady with a rice cooker and a YouTube channel called Cooking Bomb. She even has a rice cooker book. Wow. Plz have her on your show 🙂"
I saw auntie Ester on Netflix today
"Uncle roger is so smart, he always used ingredients and kitchen from his friends than his own lol. No need to buy anything!! Saving Money!!"
Congratulations on reaching 6 million subscribers!!!!!
No Galangal ...
Vote is nick one good or his😃
"Couldn't imagine that one day we Vietnamese would have the chance to see a perfectly made pho on Uncle Roger's channel
And he is eating it like an authentic Vietnamese
Also nice work there from Mrs Thuy, i love her accent and kindness, she really turned that pho out splendidly."
"Thank you! The whole team and uncle Roger worked really hard for this shoot, it was a 13 hour day for me but so worth it. Glad you enjoyed it! x"

Your the best am veitnames i love phō
"Two things Uncle Roger:

1) Please go get laid. I've seen your evolution of making the female gues uncomfortable, and it seems to be getting worse. 

2) Enough with the MSG, your ruining their dishes."
"thats the thing i keep talking about, you people will eat a dog if it tastes good!! no ethics or moral.. sheesh"
watching you pour so much MSG and the poor auntie is just HORRIFIED
"😂😂🌹🌹🥰🥰🌻🌻❤️❤️ Can I have a bow? 😋😋

Congratulations on your 6mil👍👍💕💕"
"Fun fact: Where I live (Hanoi) a lot of people I know also don't use MSG and artificial flavouring like Knor because of the supposed health risks. But food that are sold always have a lot, especially cheap ones. Cheap Pho usually substitute hours of bone simmering with bags of Knor and MSG"
"As a vietnamese. I have to say, vegan food in any Asian country is good."
"She couldn't hide the pain of her broth ruined by the 10kg of MSG. LOL. Even if it's for the camera, they can't stand food ruined."
Fuiyoh! Uncle Roger. Congratulations to 6 million niece and nephew subscribers. To many more!
"Seeing Uncle Roger cook one of my favorite dishes as a Viet today before my birthday tomorrow is a gift of itself, Cheers Uncle."
"Que Felicie.Monster encantan tus momento videos.

What about cooking in office...
How many bad chef's you gonna insult Uncle Roger. Yes
"Auntie Thuy: ""Its a veitnamese kitchen, everything is calm""
Me: *Having 1961 flashbacks*"
Please try a Hakka dish next! Thank you.
Aunty Thuy is gorgeous! 😍😍😍😍
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Just watched Iron Chef Legends. Waiting for the Uncle Roger reaction video. 😁
"Auntie Thuy: its free labor
ohhhh you know shits about to get down when theres humour and wits sparking at the start"
Wait til Uncle Roger finds out Thuy was on Jamie Oliver's YouTube channel at one point!
"Batman has his utility belt
Uncle roger needs his msg belt"
Please do a collab with Jamie Oliver if you reach 7 million subscribers.
that looks delicious!
Uncle Roger is lucky Auntie Thuy did not hit her for making her ancestor cry
MMMMM Love pho
"Next target:  If Uncle Roger reaches, 7 million subscribers, he should make Indian style tandoori chicken using a real tandoor to get that tandoor hay. 


We need some more Indian Asian chef representation, besides Hersha Patel."
Ciao
"I love the outtakes, so genuine and lovely ♥"
"Imagine that if other cooks and chefs he criticized sees this, and they might give off that kind of look."
we use a hammer to make the beef thinner and more tender
"Auntie Thuy's accent sounds more British than Jamie Oliver..

Gosh I love her accent ♥️"
This was fantastic! Probably one of my favroite new videos. I haven't laughed so hard in awhile 🤣
Way to go on those 6 Million Subs.!

Happy 6 million fellow Uncle!
Hi

@bruh you can be older than your own uncle dude
Congratulations.
"Bet
When will the Butter Chicken vid appear?"
I’d like to thank my global class so that I could understand this joke 1:59
I could only understand that joke from an episode of Grand tour.
Did he actually put all that msg into the broth?? Then... What's the point doing all the steps before that😂 all that flavour is going to be affected by the msg
"In Vietnam, being against MSG really is a thing. Pho restaurants/food stalls here either don't use MSG, or use it outside customer's view 
In pho making contests if the judge see MSG on your table you are pretty much disqualified"
I’m hope Uncle Roger still remember everythings after he ate that Phở with bag of MSG 🤯
your australian joke really hurt me
Aunty Thuy seems like a chill and kind person.
"Just my opinion, but that bowl have too much meat"
Auntie Thuy so cute lahhh 💜
FUIYOHHHH
"It might be a thousand degrees, but just a bowl of the soup and noodles, damn!
I've never had Pho, but really wanna try this one."
Miss Thuy voice is so remarkable!!
So what for 7 million?
"10 Million subscribers, Uncle Roger will make a video with Jamie Oliver."
Congrats Uncle Roger 👌💞

"Nice job Uncle Roger, Could you react to Gorden Ramsey trying to make a grilled cheese sandwich"
"Her: ""No you cheap!""
Me: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!"
"bruh no MSG ? sorry but this is Chinese pho, not Authentic vnmese pho"
nhìn Uncle Roger bỏ bột ngọt mà tui gần như mất trí nhớ :))))
Aunty Thuy was such an amazing helper to make the stupendous yummy Pho I remember my mom and dad making Pho.
its hard to get chefs because the owner earns 6 figures and wants you to work for 15k dollars a year. full-time. lol.
Finally someone has the upper hand on Uncle Rogers.
"damn you really destroyed your pho with that insane amount of msg😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Anyways, good vid uncle roger, from vn with luv😍😍😍😍😍😍"
"Uncle Roger, Ling Ling had 6 million subscribers when he was 5, and uk what, he didn't even have a youtube account 
Haiyaa"
"Also Uncle Roger, orange shirt fuck boi (sorry if it was rude or offensive, I'm so happy for you for 6 million subscribers and I'm happy I'm one of them:) congrats let's gooo🔥🔥❤️)"
Kinda shitty she told you not to toss the spices in her kitchen and you still did... rude much
"I don't know what kind of spa you going to, you have to handle meat and bone 🤣🤣🤣"
Uncle Roger for 7 million I'd like you to make 'Biriyani' and then I'll subscribe to your Onlyfans.
"Roger: more efficient
Aunty: no you're cheap
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
haiiiiyaaaaa! why not code unclerogermsg?
i love aunty thuy to uncle rogers come back  ...absolutely legends
"uncle roger Pho so bad , his foot was already  down to ground"
yummy 😋
Um...why did you destroy the broth by using so much MSG. Less is more. That's why aunty Helen left you. 😂
She has such a calm soothing voice
"""you keep taaaalking~~"" made MY DAY HAHAHA"
Maybe Aunty Thuy will have a 3rd book about her sibling next
i love her accent
Uncle Roger Don't know that aunty Ester made it to iron chef.
Congrats Uncle Roger. Nice cooking. Next target is 7 Million Subscriber to make him Butter Chicken soon.
2:00 history time LOL
"""You just made my ancestors cry""
That's how you know she watches Uncle Rroger vidjos."
Next Uncle Roger review should be of Chef Brian egg fried rice. Let Chef Brian get an Uncle title.
In fact it’s quite impossible to charr the vegetables on an induction stove…
"In our country, we also have Christine Ha - a master chef 2012, maybe you can visit her restaurants and try Vietnamese food"
"for slicing thin beef, helps if you apply pressure only on one direction of the stroke, and other direction is no pressure, just reset knife."
Love theirs interaction 🥰
No one in Vietnamese use that much MSG haiyaaaaaaa
Phở chay ngon mà
did u actually add that much msg omg
Ticket than lizzo...lol
Auntie Thuy's cookbook is only #48 on US Amazon for Vietnamese cookbooks right now.  I bought a copy. Let's show her some love and move it up in the charts.
"@John R and even more for the authors not on Amazon, eh?"
@Tuxedo Cat oh wow
#6 today 😏
"Yay!!!! Yes please! Maybe one day I'll get an invitation to do a book signing in the USA, that would be pretty neat right?! :P Thanks Michael, have a fantastic week! xxx"
@Tuxedo Cat Fuiyoh!!!
Anty Thuy sounds like she’s from Bristol
"I made the mistake of watching this video right before going to the grocery store.
Must...buy...MSG..."
thanks for PR
"love this, very entertaining video, thank you to both of you for this. :) ♥♥♥♥"
Uncle Roger  complains about crying ancestors then  calls an Irish woman British 🙄
How satisfy~ing🤤
Teabag 🤣
"I also love MSG. But that is too much, Uncle Roger. One pack is already too much"
Is Uncle Roger afraid of tendon and tripe? The best pho is the kind with the funny bits.
"I'm Vietnamese and that amount of MSG makes me cringe. Don't try this at home, guys."
I'm so sorry for saying this but for me uncle roger sounds and looks sexy for real rather than himself being nigel ng
Oml
"Been so long since i hear someon3 say phở the vietnamese way (exc,uding myself)"
Plz plz plz do you know in asia there is a state of India there is is a state called Manipur
Uncle Rodger should be nephew Rodger she always  get help from beautiful aunties can't do it himself
"When I make pho i was taught not to put all the ingredients at once. Me seeing that the spices, rock sugar, and nuoc mam all at once is weird."
"6:50 kill me already
We never do this in Vietnam, please don't try this anywhere here or your face will be the broth."
Love u from VietNam 🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳🇻🇳
Feel like Uncle Roger is building his own cinematic universe

"Uncle Roger, check out Auntie Esther on Netflix show Iron Chef. She’s such a badass!!"
"I am flattered where Uncle Roger hid MSG, gotta try that so I can make my gf  full of flavour ✨"
"Two words to describe this weejio:

Plz consider about  northeast indian
Thai green curry collaboration with Mr Olive Oil for 7 million subs. 🤞🏽😁😝
"Ngl, I thought this was a Steven he copycat, but I love this channel do much"
Uncle roger plzzzz
"fuiyoh, love from india, nigel."

10:45 Uncle Roger owning his mistake is honestly the best part of this video 😂
Finally a golden video about Pho
That looks Pretty good fuiyoh 😂😂☺️☺️🤤🤤
Hey Uncle Roger can please also make a video on HOWTOBASIC mie goreng recipe. Just Humor All the niece and Nephews Out There.
"As an Asian who wants to be fair minded about this.    Do any westerners in here feel that the jokes are just over used and that your culture has been overly criticised?   I feel that there is no need to over criticize the ""fusion"" method of cooking Asian dishes.    Also I don't see anyone criticizing Asian chefs who cook western food with their own methods as well.     

This western culture bashing really has got to stop.    In as much as other cultures are protected by established media and the millions of brain washed social justice warrior generation."
She looks so gentle 😍😍
He just ruined that broth he spent all this time on🤦🏻‍♂️ haiyah! Not THAT much msg uncle!
Congratulations Uncle Rodger! Keep up the good work👍💋💓
No sudden kpop reference this time?
"Congrats on 6M subs! Thanks for making our traditional food Uncle Roger 😘 To be honest I literally shocked with the amount of MSG u had put in, TOO MUCH!!!!"
"I Just pass a pho restaurant today after I had lunch.

Haiyaa inside of Uncle Roger head almost as dirty as Nephew Nick's Broth
Hahaha. “You know what is mean? French people who took over your country.” Hahaha. Correct!
Haiyah!! Too much MSG was in there. Niece Klutz so frustrated I put my leg down.

"Vincenzo uses MSG, Uncle Roger: WHY SO MUCH MSG

Uncle Roger uses a whole bag of MSG


Sounds like Uncle Roger doesn’t want someone to get the uncle title 🤔"
"You say its a secret family recipe, but now I guess its our secret recipe now"
Well Auntie Thuy is an absolute delight
Vegan people will shock when they see watch happen in Vietnamese kitchen:)))

But I cannot help but think, this vaunted, romanticized ""clean broth"" might have even more flavor to it if you DIDN'T soak all the stuff out of the meats first.
There's gradients between ""prep everything separately so there's almost nothing left in the final dish"" and my own Irish ancestors' method of ""throw everything in a pot and boil it for 3 days!"""
fun episode. whole lota msg this time.

doesn't MSG being cooked for long periods of time release cancer causing factors?
Let’s go we got pho. I ate that almost every day when I went to Vietnam. It just grows on you once you eat it daily
❤️❤️❤️ from Vietnam with love!
lol in Viet Nam we dont use MSG to cook Pho
I don’t know much about Vietnamese food but isn’t the broth supposed to be white
"True Phở doesnt have sprouts. Your beef is too lean and there's no outside skirt beef or brisket, that's the best part. I love your videos but in my opinion your bowl is just 4-5/10 if you tasted some best Pho restaurants in Hanoi."

AJI NO MOTO is the KING
😳that much msg will make even hottest peper like tasty fries
decent stuff
"All these broth wasted, well done!"
Why are you complaining? He is not selling the pho. Just for him!
"Idk but uncle Roger put too much MSG in Phở, im vietnamese and i have to confirm that we do use MSG but its up to each region, in northside people do use this but just a moderate amount of that, in contrast in southside, some people dont or even never use MSG, auntie Thuy cooked the Southside's Phở, thats why she didnt use that"
too much msg ucle roger
I am ABSOLUTELY stunned no MSG company is sponsoring Uncle Roger!!!
You have been preparing for this for a month now eh Uncle Roger ?
"""It's free labor (having children).  It's an Asian thing, isn't it?""

EMOTIONAL DAMAGE."
"Aunty Thuy looks like very nice person, good luck for her and her restaurant."
Too much MSG Uncle Roger
No such thing as too much MSG - Uncle Roger
Let's hope this cookbook doesn't end up like Aunty Liz's cookbook. 😂
Ohh yahh
Are we not gonna talk about how Auntie Thuy's voice sounds so softly pleasant? Pretty sure she has an adorable personality 🥰😊
Until you mess with my Pho!! 😂 😝 xxx
Like Ra-ta -thuy?
"I only add fish sauce when the broth is almost done, not before simmering broth. Adding it too soon will add a light sour flavor to the broth"
Wow. Making pho that are going to be eaten in a few minutes takes so much to prepare. Amazing passion and patience.
I would say all Asian Soup noodle will take hours to prepare. If you are Malaysian you will need to know Hokkien Mee from Penang need to shimmer the broth over night.
that's why it's not recommended to make pho at home by yourself and just go to a Vietnamese restaurant instead. Cooking a proper broth takes too much time and effort for just a couple of bowls
There is probably going to be like 50 bowls though.
Thats how they won against the americans..
">beef thicker than Lizzo, how to eat?

uncle roger never ate anyone's 😺?"
Congrats on the milestone! That pho is mouth watering. Aunt Thuy is a proper Vietnamese-English lady - love her accent and demeanor!

Thank you Uncle Roger! Congrats on 6 Million!
Aunty Thuy is a legend. So much fun watching her interaction with Uncle Roger. More of Aunty Thuy please!
Uncle Roger is too much sometimes. He needs to learn to show some respects. Even if fake. And so much msg is too much msg. Every chef in Asia knows that. First time am so annoyed wirh UC. But am still a fan
Uncle roger always talks about people ruining traditional dishes but then ruins traditional dishes by adding too much MSG
"6:52 ahh!! This moment definitely irritated me, a Vietnamese , pls pho would be much better with natural sweetness :(((  fuck MSG :((("
Uncle Roger you should make Chicken Adobo or Lechon Baboy for your 7M subscriber mark!
@Mrak Lord I'm half but definitely grew up there :)
I see you as a Filipino
Dude how much msg did you put in there 😂
"Congrats Uncle Roger! It’s really a very sad world right now, so this is a balm and is perfect timing!. Richly deserved celebrity you have,  helping the world understand Pho and all of this amazing cuisine. And giving us stick all the time is hilarious.

I like Aunty Thuy haha. She has such a calming voice but also has some sass haha 🤣
You could see the moment Aunty Thuy’s soul left her body when he poured that whole bag of msg in
my family chars their onion and ginger in the oven but they also char garlic
"if my mom sees a broth with such amount of msg, roger's fucked up"
"“We were expecting Australians to come in here.”

Uncle Roger divorced too long....
"More with Aunty Thuy , such  witty banter."
Second show where you try to make people O.D. on MSG.
As an Indian I could confirm those spices are burned.
She's saying him being cheap on relationships is accurate af
ummmmm Actually MSG that you use is just about 1/2 when my arunty cooking Noodle 555555+
This could be my favorite episode! That PHO looks so good I want to fly to Britain to have some!Aunty Thuy is so sweet! What a good sport she is!!
@khoi pham cao You can buy cheap-ish pho in other places too.
"@khoi pham cao It's a bot that copy comment, dude. Don't answer to it"
Haiya just fly to Vietnam. This pho is $29. In Vietnam $2 only!
"I actually bought some msg because of Nigel and I love using it but ffs… that broth looks clean as hell, add the right amount not the Roger amount of msg"
A whole bag of msg... That's the only reason I didn't show the vdo to her. She would have started beating me up
"MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MSG. HECKKKK! 
ANYWAYS, I ENJOYED THE WHOLE VID. 
FILIPINO FAN HERE."

Oh no gaaaaaaaaaaa

This is definitely an art form. I can't imagine spending that much time and attention to one meal. Looks delicious!
She is absolutely the best guest uncle tiger has had. Love her!!
Thatss fricking too much roger
He throws msg like Regen Sensai throws salt... Maybe to scare aunty Thuy's ancestors
Luvvit. Uncle Roger you will learn her as they say in the Midlands
That does look delish!!! 😋
"That msg dose killed me, lol, I bet uncle Roger will dry out ancient pharaohs with msg if he can"
"I am going to be cooking (or at least trying to) some pho tomorrow. Just gotta pick up some last few things and I will be getting it going.

Also, I think Uncle Roger keeps mistaking induction and ceramic hobs. Induction has no glowy bits in them. A good blowtorch can get things nice and crispy without need for that ancient technology. WW2 is over, Uncle Roger, it's time to move on and get a rice coo—I mean induction hob."
Is this normally an 8 hour dish? Looks good but probably wouldn’t make myself with how time consuming it is
WWWOOOOOOO
Bowl is too small for pho.
"i dare you to make 'Rawon', uncle. it is indonesian food, i guess you never taste it before."
This Auntie was more conservative...blended well with Uncle and it made him try harder”...😉
"Hmm.. As a Vietnamese, watching this video is kinda.. haiyaa"
Full marks to Uncle Roger roasting the French more than he roasted that onion lmao
In the US they use a spaghetti looking Rice noodle for Pho. There in the UK you guys use that flat wide noodle. In Thailand I cannot get Pho. Closer to Vietnam and not available. The world today. 😭
1:57 Emotinal Damage =)))
Did he seriously put entire packet of msg into the broth?
"As a Vietnamese nephew, uncle Roger did a great job. Also I have been living in the UK for the past year, and gotta say the Phở by Auntie Thuy is great looking so far, a lot of other Vnmese theme restaurants I been to serve really low effort but high price Phở."
"@Isaac Huetter I mean I think most people would assume it’s for the slo-mo, as the pinned comment implies potentially in a different batch or a half-done representation."
All that MSG was a great job?
I want uncle Roger to make Raw Larb/Raw Laab. Gonna tell people to subscribe for this one if he does confirm it lol.
Golden brown ... texture like sun !
Phoooook yeeeeeaahh!!!!!!!
Nia seng so much of MSG? Look at her face “ you just ruined my entire pot “ hahahahahaha
Congrats Daddy Rogers on having 6 Million subscribers! 😅😂
4:26 this make all my Indian ancestors cry 😅🤣
"@aniruddha gawali oh ok!! I get it now, sorry it didn't click in before. I did know about cows being worshipped. But thanks for explaining"
@Blue Ocean Art Academia we worship her 😅
Why?
i am a vietnamese and i squirt sriracha in because i am northener
I wonder what they do to the broth with all that msg
I love this lady’s voice…. So calming
Niceeeeee
An English speaking Asian is so perplexing to listen to from America.
Fuiyoh! Congratulations!
"What the hell u do ? fuck up pho with too much MSG, right ?"
"I love how Uncle Roger’s vibe is that: If the stove cannot cause arson, is it even an Asian kitchen? 😂"
She can be 20 or 50 but still a 10
"Uncle Roger : ""I pust it and it always go in"" 
Anty Thuy : ""That's what you think""
Anty Thuy is low-key savage"
No Vietnamese subtitle yet Haiyaaa
I mean your feet can be very well seasoned when bare foot more than all of jamie olive oil restaurant and house combine
"Uncle Roger: “I push it and it always go in.”

Auntie Thuy: “That’s what you think.”



Welcome to the Roast of Uncle Roger, which we want at 10 Million Subscribers."
So happy this pop up
Let’s go the sorry children is back
My ancestor would cry if they saw how Uncle Roger putting the MSG in the soup
"""her beef thicker than lizzo"" got me laughing too hard
Also any lizzo stands don't take it seriously it's just a joke"
The way you put the MSG into the broth is terrifying with Vietnamese - like me
Uncle Roger told nick to not toss the spices....
Fuiyoh Uncle Roger now has more subs than Mr. Chili Jam. Next for 7 million subs Uncle Roger might make butter chicken.
This video pointed out an important feature of regional cuisine. There are subtle differences in recipes due simply to family traditions.
An hour later and he has already gained 0.03 Million subscribers
You should make nasi lemak for 7 million sub
7 mil and Uncle Roger is making Beef Rendang
A true testament to her recipe is that she doesnt use msg. It means she is confident that the flavour is good enough to where she doesn't need it. Definitely going to want to use daikon for my Next Pho
"Noted: I come to UK and go here, Viet Kitchen, to eat good food"
10:20 that definitely is something
6:56 ổng bỏ chừng đó bột ngọt vô chắc ăn vô mất trí nhớ luôn quá =))
Tomorrow Uncle roger gonna review jamie egg fried rice again because he forgot he done already
"@JewelsOfJuly  idk :)) but now you talk about it and it does have alot of ""o"" 🤣"
@JewelsOfJuly it's fine. it's fine
@Haryé. I thought it was some kind of European language that I didn't know
@JewelsOfJuly đó là tiếng việt nha bạn
"Uncle Roger act like douche bag, anti-Thuy sooo nice 
More Auntie thuy"
Pho is delicious!
Congratulations on 6M ❤️ 🎉🎊Auntie Thuy is wonderful. Her voice and way of speaking is very comforting.
That's a terrifying amount of MSG. I couldn't help but opened my eyes widely even though they're small. Haiyaa!🤣
Lmfaoooo shes so cute
love this video so much! can you make a special episode just saying sry children😍
is she his sister or something?? they give off strong sibling vibes
I wouldn't be surprised if uncle Rogers snorts lines of MSG everyday.
Nick nailed pho
"6 million?  About damn time. Why you not get 7 million?  Just failure.   Hiyaa... Do we need Steven He and a slipper/sandal?
(Love your channel, Keep up the good work, even bought some MSG thanks to you.  Well, and an orange polo...)"
Freeze the meat first. So much easier to slice it
"Free labor.  It's an Asian thing, isn't it?
Is true."
yolo uncle roger
"You make the MSG god cry. One spoon of MSG in a pot is more than enough, not the whole bag."
"Harvey Weinstein of Tesco, cryin laughin mate"
"Uncle Roger: “I push it and it always go in.”
Auntie Thuy: “That’s what you think.”

Welcome to the Roast of Uncle Roger, which we want at 10 Million Subscribers."
Biggest OOF
"""Flavour is like money, more always better"" - Uncle Roger, 2022"
"“Look at your ceiling, y the floor on there?” Floor on ceiling for what?"
"Called an Irish person British?

Man, never thought I’d see Ireland go to war with Malaysia."
POV: Uncle Roger meets a member of society for once
3:29 sorry children
LOVE FROM INDIA UNCLE ROGER. Can i get a heart.
"2:00 and Americans in the Cold War as well
Also although I like the memes and agree that MSG is the king of flavor, you pouring the whole packet made my soul leave my body for a second"
If that tasted of anything other than salt I'd be very surprised.
Lol I won't eat that pho
I will stop calling you Uncle roger because of how much MSG you used. You made our ancestors cry hard.. Authentic flavour doesn’t need so much MSG. You are downgraded to Nephew Roger
YOOOOO NEW VIDDDDDDD
He put so much msg in that pho😭
哈哈哈哈congrats！太帅啦～
"Use too much MSG to make the broth, that's how cheap Pho broth made in Vietnam <("")"
"The Amount of Msg Uncle Roger put in the broth scared me. But according to Uncle Roger himself, you can never have too much msg."
Literally the there is no such thing as too much msg
Oh no guys Uncle Roger has lost it. He actually thinks MSG is that other white powder!
I like her voice
We want more Auntie Thuyyyyy
Aunty Thuy is a legend. So much fun watching her interaction with Uncle Roger. More of Aunty Thuy please!
U call Gordon with uncle?? He back to uncle
I thought that Pho was like 500 years old... turns out its only 120 years old. Eh.
I wish Uncle Rodger would out grow the MSG abuse. It's not funny anymore. You and Jamie Oliver could be brothers. Complete your broth then add a MSG to taste. A little goes a long way.
Omggggg it’s my country’s food ❤❤
"So muchhh MSG uncle R, I apparently heard my ancestor crying :)) btw thank you for making this lovely Pho, fuiyohhh"
ahh yessss….finally
you just made her ancestors cry
Uncle Roger is an addict carrying coke under the disguise of msg🤣
i think still cooking doesn't mean broken
"I was so angry with Roger's action, when he added so much MSG into Pho. We don't do that. Don't misunderstand Pho is made like that."
"Green fire is because of sulfer in onion , that's why they are Charing it to get the sulfer out"
Next you should cook the garbage Pho that british and americans do and taste it lol
He complained about Nick doing the tossing but he's okay doing it himself
Rachel ray beef thicker than Lizzo im freakin dying 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want this book
how can I unsee the tea bag uncle Roger lmao
Haha. That MSG overload is golden ;) - fantastic video Uncle Roger! Always make me laugh. Here is to 10 million!
Uncle Roger: Do you not like me caressing your book?
u deserve 10m
Uncle roger for 7million subs please make Biriyani plzzzzz
"My husband is Vietnamese, I’d love to cook him some pho 🥺🙏🏻 thank you"
Legendary
Uncle Roger at 7 mill we want butter chicken
Auntie Thuy is legend of soft burn ♨️
"Still never had Pho, still think it looks amazing and I need to try it."
"6 million in 4 months, congratulations Nigel Ng and Uncle Roger"
"Aunty Thuy: ""It's free labour, Asian thing isn't it.""
Uncle Roger: *well, she got a point.*"
"@Rick Sanchez C137 Well you feed them, that's a good type of payment to me."
"@YogaLing YLM in USA most child labor laws do NOT apply as long as the child is working for a business owned by parents…. the safety regulations requiring certain ages for certain equipment and those laws all still apply fully, but you don’t even have to pay your own child to have them washing dishes, ringing the register, making sandwiches, etc."
No truer Asian words!! Haha. Needless to say I grew up supporting our family business from the age of 8.  Back in the day  before it was deemed child labour!
Harvey Weinstein of Tesco remark made me lol for a solid 10 minutes
You're like sunshine on a rainy day.
Loved aunty thuy
That's not wok it's an Indian kadahi
"i think daikon is tradtional tho, my mom use it all the time"
MSG does a body good! Great content!
"""Do you know who mean? The French people who takeover your country, that mean"" i didn't see that coming 🤣🤣🤣"
5:36 planet level uncle Roger
When he teabagged the teabag I died!
next time uncle roger hit over 7 million I want to see him cook a dish without someones kitchen
Is this cheft the same person that destroyed pho with jamie oliver???? Last time jamie overcooked pho ga and both cheft sàid perfect
"Haiyah! Uncle Roger spill the flavor. Table have more flavor than food.

If table have more flavor than food, you phocked up."
Aunty Thuy is so wholesome ❤️
"FUIYOH you over did the msg so I think it's super salty,but all step and how it looks base on my experience it taste good, better than all of Jamie's olive oil cooking sht"
Uncle Roger cooking pho making Auntie Thuy nervous XD
I hope it was a skit that he poured a package of msg into the broth... cause if it wasn't he just wasted a perfectly good pot of broth and i would be mad!
My guy pulled msg from his dong
hey uncle roger! i just have a new auntie esther request. can you review epicurious' ramen video pro vs home cook one?? auntie esther is there :DDDD
"Here’s a uncle, doesn’t even have 7million subscribers… and he’s telling us how to cook… sheeesh the nerve on this uncle guy."
Happy 6 million subscribers Uncle Roger....BTW where is Nigel hand him over
Hmm I don't put msg on pho
Ester is so hot.
"My name is ""Thuy"" too and I'm sooooooo happy to see Uncle Roger cooking my country's traditional dish. Thank you so much for bringing Pho closer to people all over the world. Hope you guys will visit Vietnam and enjoy it someday!"
"As a Vietnamese person, thank you Uncle Roger for replicating one of the most tradisional food that come from Vietnam. THANK UNCLEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!"
Comedy + learning+fun+ like+subscribe+bell icon 💯❤️ worth
You deserve it uncle roger!
Yay
Nigel is very funny with the books🤣
You should put your apron on uncle Roger to protect your clothes and keep you safe
When we will see oliver and you together? 🤣
Uncle Roger's favourite drug is msg
You guys are legends!
Auntie Thuy is wonderful! Congratulations on your baby and restaurant! Your face said everything when you tasted the broth with a bag of msg. More Auntie Thuy please!
"Is his only thing just doing an Asian accent? Not being annoying, just asking."
"""We were expecting a lot of Australians to come.""

Damn, why did I laugh so hard to this joke LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"@Nicholas Lee Bro, you've got issues.
You don't know me from a bar of soap yet you're here dissecting my life.
It's as if you're the one that ""isn't fun at parties"".

""That is why many people found it funny but not you""
So I'm meant to be a sheep and find it funny too?"
"@Sltga FYI always the loudest and first to get drunk does not make a person fun at parties, maybe you're mistaking funny for fun 🤔 On a more serious note, the actions you described at your ""party"" and your initial comment is classic in psychology and indicates that you crave attention, and the only way you know how is to stand out. That is why many people found it funny but not you, because the odd one out gets noticed"
"@Sltga Whatever you say buddy... Personally I would not associate someone who uses four full stops in a single short comment as ""fun"" 😂"
"@Nicholas Lee I'm actually heaps fun at parties.
Always the loudest and first to get drunk.
I'm just telling it as it is.
The joke isn't all that funny."
"@Sltga Yes, Aussies are known for their sense of humour, except you, you must be fun at parties"
I was waiting for this video for a while lol
He put the whole packet in fuiyohhh 😭
"You know mean? The French takeover your country

I laughed at this too much"
"Congrats on 6M Nigel, and also congrats on not getting beaten by Auntie Thuy for making a giant mess in her kitchen!"
Uncle Rodger mind so dirty even a colander won't clean it.
lets gather around the *camp induction stove*
FUYIOH! I’M VIETNAMESE TOO
"Yum!  Takin’ notes , shopping tomorrow and cooking on Tuesday."
"Whaaatt that to much MSG, that not healthy. My mother said so much MSG make people stupid"
That Pho is a certified THUYOH!
Did you really use a whole bag of msg in that broth? LMAO
10:44 💀
"Chef: “This is Vietnamese kitchen, everything calm”

Me who worked in a Vietnamese restaurant for a year (with Vietnamese immigrants):  😐"
I never knew how much prep it took to make golden goodness pho or brown goodness if your not color blind
You growing so fast
Anyone else a BBC here? Show yourselves! 🙌
"6:42 sr uncle roger, we use broth mix. Sometimes, MSG cause obese and metabolic disorder🥲"
"Unlike the food, his humor is stale and not even that unhealthy amount of msg could add flavor to it."
"9:18 This is it, boys. We officially did it.

MSG = Makes Shit Good"
"2:00 🫣 

😜 from France, with love 😉"
"What's Better. MSG, or Aunty Esther?"
"Holyy, that much MSG? My mom would spank me if i use that much"
Next time at six million make congee
"A good tip to extract the maximum amount of flavor and fragrance from the spices is to heat them individually at different temperatures(whatever is optimal for each spice), but i am way too lazy to do that"
I love how he always sneaks in a way to bully Jamie Oliver 😂😂
"My name is ""Thuy"" too and I'm sooooooo happy to see Uncle Roger cooking my country's traditional dish. Thank you so much for bringing Pho closer to people all over the world. Hope you guys will visit Vietnam and enjoy it someday!"
NO NO NO THAT TO MUCH MSGS!!!
Earliest I been mr uncle Rodger
The burn level was epic about the cook book and how it reminds you of mom when she is gone was satisfying
That looks soooo good. 😯😯😯😯
Her australian joke had me cracking up for a minute.
can someone explain the joke on the australia and floor on the ceiling?
I'm vietnamese and so i want to come here and see how the pho at viet kitchen and pho cooked at vietnam taste like
"Fuiyoooohhhh, congratulations Uncle Roger, 6 million subscribers is a great achievement. Almost as great as establishing a MSG cartel."
"I think u should type it like “phở”, not “pho”"
Lmfao this is 🔥
Nice 👍
"as a Vietnamese I rate this a mid out of street food
but for real though, looks good to me!"
Lmaoo Uncle Roger the 🐐 marketing agent for books.
Beef thicker than Lizzo. M8 you are a legend haha
01:32 - Am I the only one who says “Emotional Damage” aloud along with the clip
When Auntie Thuy said “Straight to pounding” I died. 😂😂
FUYIOHHHHH CONGRATS UNCLE ROGER WE LOVE YOU 💗
"Aunty Thuy can look 15, 25, 35, 45 And 78 
At the same time. She is so beautiful"
"My man hiding msg like ""white powder"" 🤣😂"
FUIYOO Vietnamese’s Food:0

Juliette Wall would be Proud.
Congratulations 🎊🎈 🎉

@Seiji Ren 🤨
Pounding. But not pestle and mortar
"""..don't be like rachel ray. her beef thicker than lizzo"" looooooool"
The broth is extremely clear yet rich. I literally sense a good smell of the broth.
"Aunty Thuy is such a good sport , I think she had a heart attack with uncle Rodger"
Just watching him dump in all that msg gave me high blood pressue.
"that beef is so thick, use a thinner knife kek"
"‘We efficient’
‘No you’re cheap’ 
Lmao 😂"
"HAIYAA.... Uncle Rodger why you lick tea bag? You gonna give everybody your ""COOOVID""...."
""" i'm closing the door! He's so cleaning that "" omg lol Auntie Thuy is epic XD"
Phok
Review adam ragusea pad thai

"you cant put food on induction stove anyway they are activated by the pan you put on top so if you try to put food on the induction stove directly it wont heat up! 

hayaaa you got white people thing wrong"
"Fuyioh finally the video is here.
Uncle Roger as representing all your Indian nephew and nieces I would like you to make Indian Butter Chicken when you hit 7 million subs which I know will be happening very soon ;)"
No K-pop reference? Or did I miss it?
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congrats!
"Agree auntie Thuy about too much flavour, especial the daikon, it can be replacing for MSG as sweet."
"As a Vietnamese, I must to say your pho is very good Uncle Roger,but it's maybe to fancy for a traditional dish .-."
"Uncle Roger. I am Nonbinary, how would you refer to me?"
seeing uncle roger pour a metric ton of makeshitgood in pains me
E
I can feel Aunty Thuy's stress specially in msg part
Holy mother.. that looks so F%(#*ING GOOD. I wish I lived in London just for this good lord.
VIETNAMESE PEOPLE CRYING:))
"That ""teabag"" scene took me out.....👻"
Fuiyoh!! The pho looks amazing! congrats on 6 million!
"Hey Uncle Roger, can you critique/make something from the Philippines in the next videos?"
Uncle roger can you make biryani at 7 million  subscribers
Never tried of pho before.... I think I need to try it after watching this vid 🤤
She was awesome man. Uncle Roger replacement mother.
Good pho uncle Roger
"Supper nice video uncle roger but a bit inside me die when i saw how much msg you put in the pot . Also , congrats on 6m sub"
"""its free labour its an asian thing isnt it?"" ahahahhaahhahahahaaaa!!!!!"
"Wow! I remember when I subscribed when you had 25,000 subs! Time flies! ... And Auntie Thuy is so cool!"
I love aunty thuy’s voice 😂
"""I don't know, there's no script""
Thanks for the authenticity Uncle!"
Fuiyoh this video so amazing
Mann Aunty Thuy is someone are really good to tease with hahahahaha jk
"As always like a coward,  its easy to go to a restaurant where everything is already prepared and all that left is to  add it to a pot."
Love aunty Thuy her passion.
We want BIRYANI for 7 million 🍗
"HAIYAAA… the bowl is too smol…
Bigger Bowl… BIGGER BOWL!!"
Can't wait where Uncle Roger meets MrBeast ; Let's make it happen...
Butter chicken please
"When uncle Roger is roasting Jamie Oliver:

He’s a man of focus, commitment and sheer fking will"
too much MSG.. Haiyaa!!!
Yesss
meanwhile my korean pho restaurant next to my house puts salt in beef broth and calls it pho lol
Good gift for my birthday!!
I want to see an Aunty Thuy and Aunty Esther collaboration !!!
Thank you for doing a video on my favourite dish of all time! My ancestors would be proud lol
"6:58 Nope nope, BIG NO!!"
Soo iritating the advertisement
hiliarious! love the episode.
"she seems fun and sweet
would make this but as she said at the end, lazy"
Uncle roger criticised Uncle Nick for tossing spices and he just did it himself!!! : (
I like the auntie with blond hair from Singapore
did he know he just made the most premium version of phở topping that is 250000-300000VND (yes it's just 10$ but it feels like 50)
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!2:00
"Looks like now uncle Roger gets green light to use ""emotional damage"""
The beef talking part was some hilarious new stuff
"Thank for choosing Auntie Thuy for our traditional Pho, love u so much <3"
Anyone else think about how Aunty Thuy sounds so much like a lovable NPC?
"oh my. GOD! Looks so freaking awesome! and I'm not talking about Uncle Rodger's teabagging technique! LOL! How I've missed pho! I'm usually a bowl a week addict in the winter, but the Viet joints around here have been closed in-restaurant dining for the last 3 years because of Covid and take out pho just isn't the same. but I have a question for Chef Thuy-- my absolute fave pho ingredient is tendon, when do you put that in? and I like my tendon nice and soft, so how long should I cook it? thanks in advance!"
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!!
YOU ACTAULLY DID IT!!!!!!
"As a vietnamese, we got a lot style of pho, but the best way to have pho, it the morning after you have hangover the night before, the heat of pho will push out any alcohol left in your body, if u drunk, just take a bowl of pho when u wake up and take a shower, u will be refreshed"
"What's next? 
8m: Taiwanese beef noodle
9m: Rawon"
Butter Chicken
"Thank you for our love of traditional Vietnamese food, but if you put a whole packet of MSG into a pot of broth at a Pho restaurant in Vietnam, don't ask why the owner kicked your ass.  out of the shop.  Love!"
"Uncle Roger, this was a very good episode! Thank you!"
"Finally, Uncle Roger Made some person ancestors cry"
Recently I was forced to eat at Jamie Olive oil restaurant. It wasn’t good..
now make chow mein
"Wow, your asian nephew fell in love with auntie thuy, she so funny and good person fuiyohhhhh"
Bean sprout is for weak people. Real Phở uses thin slices of white onion and lots of spring onion.
2:02 left her speechless
"I knew it was going to be good, but when they plated it up at the end with the raw beef plus the bits from the broth...pho-nominal."
"Hope next time uncle Roger will make dog meat 
j4f"
6.03mil now! That's my birthday lol
"When uncle Roger is roasting Jamie Oliver:
He’s a man of focus, commitment and sheer fking will"
vegan phở exists ? you know what ? I don't want to know more
Never been this early  fuyio
Almost puts a smile on my face watching uncle Roger

"""Can i do wok toss?""
""No you cant, this is vietnam restaurant. It's supposed to be calm and relaxing""
""Haiyaaaaa *proceed to do it anyway*"""
Happy 6 million.
why post vid at 12:13 soooo dumb huuuuuuuuuya
I like how Aunty Thuy was literally traumatized by the amount of MSG went into that broth
Tbh i was pretty traumatized as well.
olive oil msg
Is she west country big up 👩‍🌾👨‍🌾🧑‍🌾
That couldn't have been good with all that msg
"I’m impressed they did the meat the correct way. Very common for it to be frozen then used on a sliver but to cut it with the style of sashimi, that isn’t easy. The daikon was a nice touch, I’ve heard if that concept,  but never utilized it before."
"He made that French comment, because the French colonized Vietnam. After World War II, Vietnam thought the French would leave, but they never did. This is why Vietnam turned to the Soviet Union. Which lead to the French crying and begging the US to do something. Which is why the Vietnam war happened"
1 sad fact is that Vietnamese people hate MSG in their Pho:((
those outakes is so funny wtf  😂😂
Fuiyohhhh!
Yes finally u post again
Only Legends can roast uncle roger.
"""Foreplay is waste of time"""
Pls send link for uncle Roger only fans 😜
I wish we really got rid of the negative stereotypes associated with MSG
"As a Vietnamese niece, I'm so happy and proud to see uncle roger making pho-traditional food in Vietnam and congratulation on 6M subs <3"
💚💚💚
Love the weejios Uncle Roger !
My face is tingling watching him pour that msg 😂😂
MSG = Make Shit Good hahaha
"why the heck you put a lot of freaking MSG into the broth

"Well, Uncle Roger is indeed the expert of asian cuisine"
"I always laugh at Emotional Damage.  I kept saying the Hiya & Fiya, boy it was pissing off the white peoples in Walleymart. Hehehe🫕🍜🥩"
1:59 Uncle Roger going full-on anti colonialism.
"I love uncle Roger, but he keeps confusing the coil stoves for induction. Although you can’t char stuff on induction either 😂😂😂

Love the video"
"Uncle Roger's pho looks so good, I'm torn between eating it or f*cking it...sorry children."
Hit like button like Uncle Roger got hit by Aunty Thuy saying that vegan Pho is acceptable.
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
At 7 Million pls do Biryani I want to know how
"Isn't Bean Sprout a Vegetable,so that means that Uncle Roger starting to be Vegan?!?!?!🤯🤯🤯👌



Just Kidding..."
"@Đức Phú Nguyễn Oh Ok,thanks for the info😁"
Actually the North Vietnam people dont eat pho with bean sprout. They eat pho noodles with beef and sliced scallion.
Fughyaaah!
HOLY FUCK IM ASIAN AND THAT MSG WAS TOO MUCH LOL
Had to go get some pho even though I’m trying to save money.
Uncle roger please notice me i subscribe since 200k
Uncle roger why not use a sack of msg haiyah
"Wait how much msg would you actually use?

Uncle Roger is collecting beautiful Aunty Chefs like they are rare Pokémon and I am so envious
MSG too much uncle roger！！！
"Im sorry to say this, But… Uncle Roger didn’t make shit. Just like the other so called “ Uncle Roger makes” videos.
He relies on other chefs. Hey Uncle Roger, get in your own kitchen and make it yourself. Im beginning to see that he can’t cook at all."
"Thuy is so genuine and kind, she's the one that you want to be friends with"
"You're so kind, thank you! Now I'm not completely stuck in the kitchen, I will try make some friends! haha! :p"

"My name is ""Thuy"" too and I'm sooooooo happy to see Uncle Roger cooking my country's traditional dish. Thank you so much for bringing Pho closer to people all over the world. Hope you guys will visit Vietnam and enjoy it someday!"
"@Hidden Agenda  No shit Vietnamese cuisine has a lot of Chinese influence, they were under China's control for more than 1000 years. But the Vietnamese food today has developed far from the original influence and is massively distinguished down to the basic ingredients. Vietnamese cuisine has also had a lot of influence from later colonies but it all also has developed into its own thing. 

I asked specifically for the source that claims Chinese migrants made Pho, noodles =/= Pho. There's a shit ton of countries that make noodles but Pho is its own things and that was what  I was referring to when I said 'Northen style Pho'."
Here finally https://youtu.be/f_TJ9KMAGQg
"@v t Again, they were made by Chinese migrants using local ingredients. Chinese after all introduced noodles, chopsticks etc to Vietnam.  Vietnam was under Chinese control for a very long time. Vietnam use to use Chinese characters before switching to the Latin alphabet. 

Vietnamese cuisine has a lot of Chinese influence. Go to any ""Viet"" restaurant, half the dishes are Chinese lol 

Now go to any Chinese restaurant. ZERO ""Vietnamese"" Style dishes.

Just google it."
"@Hidden Agenda  Source? Pho's origins is a highly debatable topic and poorly documented, but that statement is one of the wilder claims I've heard? I've had Chinese style noodles and it's nothing like Northen style pho. 

Also it's a consensus between most Vietnamese that Northen style is the default dish that people refer to when they mention ""Pho""."
But take it away when British people discover it.
🤣🤣🤣
Posted 50mins ago. And 1k comment already. Jamie should learn from this orange guy.
woah aunty Thuy has a great english
6:33 He pulled the MSG from his pants 😂😂😂. Makes me wonder how it got there
He pretended it like his weapon. Or doraemon thing i would say
go dialysis
"I wish to get only 10% of Uncle Roger's humor in me, that would help me get through a lot of tough situation or make people around me feel better"
What a lovely tolerant Lady 👍😆
It's gold Uncle Roger because Aunty Thuy said so
Holy this is the next level of mạnh bà soup
When uncle Roger pouring the MSG one pack my eyes open wide 😂👀
"Uncle Roger passed Jamie's subscription base... 
Congrats Uncle Roger...  

Now I just want to see Auntie Helen's reaction..."
What if my man got pulled over with a bag of white pounder in his boxer? Cops are gonna be suspicious
Holy crap 6M… congratulations!
Looks like shit. Jammie Oliver could do better.
i am very happy for you uncle
Let go six mil
I wish i could buy this but I'm so fricking broke Thuy your awesome👌
OMG so much MSG but finally Pho come out so good
"Aunty Thuy > Aunty Liz. Sorry children. 

It was funny to see Uncle Roger for a change making Asian ancestors cry."
Uncle roger is so funny (btw I’m NOT a bot if anyone if anyone thinks I am)
FUIYOOOOOOOHH !!!! 6M nephew and niece  Let's congratulate our uncle
"As an authentic Vietnamese, this video disappoints me a lot.
First, you need to toast white peppercorn, lemon seeds, and honey and toast till fragrant.
For the broth, use toilet water, add chilli jam, uncooked rice, pork legs, medium-rare steak, tomatoes and potatoes. Don't use Daikon, Daikon is like Vietnamese chilli jam.
For the Pho, instead of using the flat rice noodles or vermicelli, try egg noodles or udon noodles, even instant noodles work. Haiyaaa.
And for the veggies, parsley and lettuce.
Shame on you Uncle Roger.


































(jokes aside, this video was very good Uncle Roger)"
"Stop beeing a pervert, Aunty Thuy will smack you!"

You need some brain to do it 2:38
Didn't know you were sleeping with MSG Uncle Roger..
e
look good pho
My Vietnamese wife actually screamed in horror from the amount of MSG Uncle Roger put in. She said her mom would have slapped her with a slipper if she put in too much of any ingredient
"@OberK From my understanding, he DID toss the whole package in - but just for the shot. So I said he would have replaced the water in the pot. 
Or more simple, what actually happened is that: he poured one package of msg into the pot. Once shooting done, he poured all the water out. Then he refilled the pot with new water, meat and spice to cook the actual broth.
For the recipe of any Asian broth with that amount of water, I believe one pinch of msg is enough."
"@Daisy Mel I mean, he SAYS he only did it for the shot and a pinch is enough, he doesn't say he didn't toss it in. Or am I reading that wrong?"
@OberK haha you can read Uncle Roger's pinned comments. He did clarify this. :D
@Daisy Mel For my own sanity I'm going to believe you.
Haha! 😂 Tell your wife I had my Vietnamese straw broom stick ready on the side! And a pot I made earlier was the one I fed uncle Roger! #outtakesyouneversaw 😆

Full marks to Uncle Roger roasting the French more than he roasted that onion lmao
"@Dark Shadow Of course it isn't, It's Chinese. It was invented by a Chinese migrant. Originally sold in stalls in North Vietnam. The dish of course evolved throughout the year. 

Nothing French about it."
"@Hidden Agenda  Apart from the fact that it is eaten with noodles and with fried spices at the beginning, there isn't really much difference. I am talking about this dish in particular not all Vietnamese cuisine"
"@Dark Shadow I don't see anything french related in Vietnamese cuisine.  Other than using baguettes in their sandwiches. lol 

Majority of it is Chinese."
"@Hidden Agenda  I may have exaggerated a bit, I'm sure that there is a lot of influence from the local area and china but French cooking was the basis when introduced during colonization."

Are we not gonna talk about how Auntie Thuy's voice sounds so softly pleasant? Pretty sure she has an adorable personality 🥰😊

"Else, the water was already hot when the beef was added, to make the broth even cleaner, it is recommended to put the beef in when the water was in room temperature."

For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.


Exodus 20
King James Version
20 And God spake all these words, saying,

2 I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

13 Thou shalt not kill.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

"Hello there.

John 3:16
[16]For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Luke 13:3
[3]I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

John 14:6
[6]Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Matthew 18:11 
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

John 8:12
[12]Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 

Matthew 4:17
 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

Romans 10:9 
That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Romans 10:13
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. 

Luke 6:27-38
But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, 
6:28 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. 
6:29 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also. 
6:30 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. 
6:31 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. 
6:32 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. 
6:33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. 
6:34 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 
6:35 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil. 
6:36 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
6:37 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: 
6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.


Ephesians 2:8-9
For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
Not of works, lest any man should boast.

2 Chronicles 7:14
If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

Matthew 5:2-12
King James Version
2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.

Matthew 24:4-14 
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.
24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.
24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.
24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.
24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.
