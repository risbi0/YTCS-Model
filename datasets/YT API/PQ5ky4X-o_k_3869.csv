Hi
I love that unlike Jamie Oliveoil Gordon  can take a joke and roast right back
​ @mrnigelng  Uncle roger at Hells Kitchen confirmed? make the contestants make egg fried rice till Uncle roger is satisfied
Big crossova coming nephews very happy
I bet uncle roger can’t even make gudeg
when uncle roger says he's only on season 2 I accidently flipped out of my chair
"You should review ""Grandpa Kitchen"" channel."
I love your videos ❣️
Why do people name their cars and they’re cooking supplies and tools as a she🐢
He does this humor on purpose I swear no ones THAT good this ought to be a script😂🥲😭
Use wood spoon
Too much spring onion
Why put caffeine of steak
Wait coffee?
And the butcher already cut the meat lol
Omg he responded
If this guy had ever watched the Heston steak method he would realize that turning the steak very often gives a much better Maillard reaction. Gordon could stand to watch it as well.
"disgusting, capitalizing on stereotype to make money"
Love from Malaysia
Uncle roger I think this may make  your ancestors cry https://youtu.be/4V9pPGrpN1E a butter chicken recipe but his own.

"If Gordon takes note of Roger's tips, he may get good enough to get a job in a cafe..."
Gordon can sell me a $1 noodles for $100 and I wouldn't be mad 🤷🏽‍♂️

That cut of meat looks like the millennium falcon.
will Uncle Roger review BCC Lifestyle's Donal's style of cooking?!?!? another BCC lifestyle letdown or maybe he may be slightly better??? Uncle Roger to judge :)
Gordon  is so rich he used a sauce pans one and throw it out.
"Uncle Roger, review Chef Brian Tsao's egg fried rice weejio. He's thirsting over the uncle title just like how you thirst separation from Auntie Helen."
Uncle Roger please review this fried rice https://youtu.be/HG8j491h2UQ
現在的國產不粘鍋已經可以用鐵鏟了。
Why do people watch this utter garbage?

I just realized that Uncle Roger is Nigel's Tony Clifton.  😂😂
Papa pig himself HIMSELF
gordon knows his shit very well
I challenge uncle Rodger to go on hot ones. If enough ppl like this comment he might do it
Hey Uncle Roger can u react to RageElixir’s vid where he made fried rice for his grandma
Auntie Helen WHO?
where in the f-ing world is the heat for the eggs coming from
"isnt peppa pig a she,"
Did Ramsay wash his hand before cook?
Gordon seemed out of breath after he got done plating.. wtf.
"Why smother the flavor of that beautiful steak?
Use just a small amount of salt. Taste the meat!"
Coffee gives  steak some bbq Charcoal taste
Uncle Roger always so funny!
Imagine Gordon Ramsey's new show is him at different golf courses.
"Gordon says “some” cilantro on the eggs, but proceeds to put the equivalent of the “two shots of vodka” lady’s worth of cilantro instead 🤣"
U should check out kays cooking 😂😂
Steak is overcooked
@mrnigelng uncle roger he is trying to ruin there pans to get them to buy his new pans to make some money
Too bad netflix is cracking down on vpns
That abortion clinics closing joke absolutely killed me XD.
You and Gordon should come to the wagon and we can cook up some cowboy food
Yes do that pleease
@Fabio Rodríguez mamma mia!
amogus
This would be epic!!!
That trío together would be legendary. Don’t forget to invite Vincenzo!
I expect Gordon bring uncle Roger to some undergroud prison tie him to electric chair and cook some food for him.
"3:04 I've never heard of any Asian getting therapy.

(definitely satire, don't worry)"
"A guy in my dorm once ruined my non-stick pan by ""cleaning"" it with a metal sponge. My friends later told me they had never seen me so furious, and a little bit of that Asian parent murder instinct was awoken in me. He's lucky I didn't have a slipper on hand."
metal spoon on teflon less damage then hands on knee of S.V.
My only question is Auntie Helen even real?
Uncle roger can you react to bayashi TV pleas 🥺🥺🥺
"Guy dying from allergy: “so weak, why so weak?”
Metal spoon on non stick pan: uncle roger head about to explode"

"Uncle roger looking old,HAIYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I get you reviewing asian dishes, but as if anyone cares about your opinion over Gordon Ramsay's for a western dish."
Well Gordon care enough to leave a comment!
"Come on, he is Gordon. The man who give you 3 pans and still have a lot of pans guy. He can throw any pan as he want."
I love the fact that Gordon is not getting mad at him. Best duo.
Uncle Roger have how many TV shows and restaurants???
everyones is aways talking about uncle joshua and former uncle gordan but everyone is forgetting uncle sherson
Acting like he knows more than him... What a fake.
Tbh now using metal utensils on non stick pan is now kinda ok even my ASIAN mom does it as well also my father
Where bread? And Gordon broke the eggs with his two hands? Unable to do it with one hand? Hayaaaaaa
"Uncle Gordon Ramsay has a good sense of humor,  can take a joke better than you know who"
"Uncle Gordon Ramsay has a good sense of humor, unlike that Jamie Olive Oil."
Why did he say peppa pig it's not pork lol
If you zoom in super close all the abortion clinic closing down🤣🤣
Whoaaa sounds like Mr. Gordon is offering to cook Uncle Roger his last supper ...
"Uncle Roger, you're my HERO!!!"
Pepper does not burn when you cook your steak. Always pepper your steak before cooking.
kays cooking made fried rice again and its a little better
"Great uncle roger, make your own butter chicken at 7 mil subs"
Was Gordon Ramsay's ass well seasoned?
"https://youtu.be/vi4qdkQ3K8I
California is banning gas stoves. No wok hei anymore starting from 2023. Uncle Roger you must make a video and protect our Asian legacy and community!"
https://youtube.com/shorts/qvdIhl-Bx6M?feature=share this is  baaad
"“Life too short for technical bullsh*t”

Tell that to education 😂"
I think Gordon is a better cook now that he knows even the smallest mistake will get him roasted by uncle roger
I'm not a professional chef but I definitely would like this more without the Cilantro and Lime and minimize those spring onions
I didn’t enjoy this video. You wrong reviewing steak
"""Gordon's sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver's future"""
"I wish this was his real voice… not for his sake, no that would suck… but for our sake"

"@mrnigelng you should review andy cooks ""Epic Vietnamese Beef Pho"""
I think I like pressing big button
Drama again & stonk fired up📈
"Gordon not bad for amateur cook   ,"
What i find weird is that Gordon Ramsay is British and he calls Spring Onions Scallions
"We all do steak differently for different reasons, but I prefer Science personally. Salted, wrapped in absorbent material, then vaccum packed. Overnight in the fridge- then repacked and resealed- allowed to come to ambient temperature on the counter. You'd be amazed how much water is expelled. We raise our beef, and it's treated as such- because of the work involved. Obviously Gordon knows this and would likely do something similar for a dish he puts his name on, but salting and resting (while draining/absorbing) works great for us Americans who live on beef! MSG and freshly cracked pepper to finish, as anything not mineral based will burn at proper searing temperatures.... please add your flavors before cooking and remove- or after searing during the rest. MSG will not burn, but flavors need judged before blindly adding seasonings..."
Please review Sandra Lee's DIM SUM lmao xD hhahah

Please review Chef James Makinson video cooking Uncle Roger
"Gordon personified the steak and called it ""her."" ""Don't turn 'her' too early."" So romantic... What a poet! Then he eats ""her."""
Dude won't even use his own product🙄🙄
Hi
I want to see uncle roger cook or try Egyptian food cuz im Egyptian
Someone tell uncle Roger to watch food insider India vs USA KFC
"Just found out Uncle Roger thru Jimmy O. Yang’s videos!  You’re a genius, Uncle!  Hai-yahhh !"
Olive oil burns easy. Wrong choice.
"Uncle Roger can you react to guga foods?
Edit: it seems he reacted 1 year ago but hm a little more"
Nice
lol
Review Samseats!
haleem or nihari
"Ill have to disagree with you on this one, he definitely got his title back for sure..."
The saddest thing in this video so far is that there was an awesome grill there and he put the steak in a skillet. So sad.
this is the only brit I respect cause he didnt ruin southern- steak and eggs. could use some salsa though. or some good tabasco.
Uncle Roger puts to much msg in his stuff and msg is bad
"Where is the ""emotional damage"" @ 4:42? 😂"
"you rost to aother but you don't kown how you u feel that so rost u and we see same mistake. plz don't rost any one 

🥰😀"
"Gordon's gonna find the location to get Uncle Roger's full judgment, which on one hand would be scathing but on the other the improvement would most likely be insanely impressive...if he doesn't blow a gasket first"
I want to see uncle roger cook or try Egyptian food cuz im Egyptian
"Uncle Roger needs to trademark ""hello aunties"" before the other uncles use it to get all the aunties."
Is Gordon cooking on a sideway or something? Because I can see the crosswalk in his glasses
"We asian people, we use VPN for some particular website.. 🤣🤣"
"Gordon was serving with a metal serving spoon, not cooking with it. There's a difference. haiyyyya."
"Maybe 10 years from now uncle roger will react to my cooking,....#future cheff"
I hope that next you can review Brian Tsao egg fried rice!!

ITS PICASSO"

@Soinas Doyi  Maybe
You think Gordon Ramsay uses the same pan twice? They certainly buy new pans for each empty field he cooks in.
"""just take it out on your children""
Uncle roger what.."
he cooks good when he middle of nowhere
"I purchased from u and never received it. Its only $30 but i feel scammed (6 months ago, those doll things u said were selling fast) i purchased because i supported  and i wanted to have something on my desk. I still  continue to watch ur videos but i will never purchase from u again."
Brighter than Jamie Oliver's future is a low bar don't you think?
Love the bromance between Uncle Roger and Uncle Gordon!! 💙 I actually went to Bread Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay in my next vlog and would love it if Uncle Roger can change his style slightly and review + comment live at one of Uncle Gordon's restaurants 🤩
butter is only for basting
"C'mon Uncle Roger, too much stuff on steak and eggs.  Too complicated, hiyahh...  but in general love Gordon's style, just not this one."
I thought he has his own pan which can use metal spoon
"I think he did let the steak rest just forgot to mention it, I’m hungry."
for your enjoyment https://youtu.be/Zj-6ukeuARU
We made the same face when Gordon put the cooked steak on the tray where the raw steak sat.
Next tour don't forget to stop by Dallas Texas
Life too short for technical bullshit
I cannot believe gordon called texas a county
You and that damned metal spoon is a classic case of making a mountain out of a molehill
You think Gordon Ramsay uses the same pan twice? They certainly buy new pans for each empty field he cooks in.
I guess the 7 mill special is going to be cooking a steal huh
"It’s been a week eh, wtf, YouTube fuck boi!"
"Jamie Oliver: moves finger 
Uncle roger: and I took it personally"
We still wait for office chicken video. Why not burn office yet?
@Gordon Ramsay Just got back from Vegas this week.  Ate at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Ignore the empty location in the video.  Restaurants are full and that's all that matters right?  Amazing food.  Spendy for our budget but you get what you pay for.  Steak that has char and melts in your mouth.  Soooo good.  So happy they had the Welly at Steak as well so we could try because we were unable to get the reservation for Hell's Kitchen hence why we went to Steak.  Only problem is we got too full for the dessert at the time.  Had planned to come back to lounge/bar for it but got Vegas Sidetracked.  Oh well.  Next time!
"""Life too short for technical bullshit""

Says guy whose career is built on reviewing how technically correct chefs are..."
Gordon losing the uncle title at the very end had me literally burst out laughing. Uncle Roger is a legend.
"to a universally acclaimed renowned chef with 7 Michelin stars, but as if he’s looking over some random guy who just so happens to be pretty good at cooking stuff"
"Uncle roger: “put it on your head that’s a flat surface”
My brain: “EMOTIONAL DAMAGE”"
"uncle roger: auntie helen who?

me:sofia who?"
Cook off battle! Winner takes 'Supreme Uncle' title.
Did he really say the steak is suited and booted? Ugh he must gotta black friend
"Everything gud, until metal spoon hit the pan 9:00
But maybe give credit to Gordon, it's a western way to fuck up with pans. If everyone treated their pan as Asian, the Pan companys would not exist"
"Complaining about metal spoon in the pan, 10 seconds later, stacking all 3 pans with the bottom to scratch the surface how much they want."
"Good video idea. Uncle Roger cooks, and Gordon Ramsay bitches..."
Woooo auntie shout out at the end was hilarious
fuuuuyyyoohhhh!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me or does GR seem like he is constantly out of breath? Lol
marbling op
"Bitterness should come from charring, not coffee"
"i loev gordon ramsya🤗🤗🤗🤗🤭🤭🤭🤭🎃

You should definitely watch kays cooking she made fried rice
I think you forget to cook chicken in a office uncle Roger :(
gordon getting rage because still don have the uncle title
"""life too short for technical errors"" wish I could show this to my lecturers 😌"
8:16 gordon: that’s peppa pig himself. Me: she’s a girl 🤨
Cook off battle! Winner takes 'Supreme Uncle' title.
"3:47: Cue PH Theme Song here, only in reverse..."
The Abortion clinic closing down 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭
Is uncle roger like a certified chef?
"Hey uncle Roger review epicurious, curry video"
Uncle roger! React to Singaporean drama lion mums! I trust u lion mums is literally one of the best drama in Singapore!
Its okay Gordon Ramsay using metal spoon in non stick pan. We know he's used to using hexclad.
Uncle roger u'r very charming... Omg i love u 😘😘😘😘😘
"Asian taking clips from another asian, i approve"
Most non stick brands do not use Teflon anymore.  Most non stick brands now have pans that are metal safe.  We don't live in the 90s anymore.   Ramsay's brand is  not the only brand that is metal safe.  Most likely the pan he used in the vid is not a teflon pan but a different type of non stick and metal safe.
Or he uses them like people use paper plates. 1 time use
Uncle Roger needs to stop YouTube
"form for decades but Uncle Roger talks with the confidence that he knows better and is super critical, lol."
so the only complaint is metal spoon on non-stick-pan
Try Indian food too sometimes
i follow you cuz u know demon slayer.
Uncle Roger!! Check out the Beef pho weejio from Andy Cooks!!
"Uncle roger, react to Joshua Weissman’s Pho!"
We really need an intervention for Uncle Roger now concerning Auntie Helen. He needs therapy.
I knew he was going to use a metal utensil on that non stick pan
I made Jamie olive oils food and it tasted bad
Metal spoon in non stick pan... PTSD acting up. My mother's somewhere with a wooden spoon
Roger watches Pepe pig
"AS IF I DID NOT LOVE YOU ENOUGH, the abortion line makes me even more head over heels!!!"
"not much fan of that kind of steak, but il give it a go cuz it looks so good"
"I absolutely love your commentary. Such fun. 

I'm with you on the metal tools in nonstick pans, but it's not an issue for me. For forty years I have exclusively used cast iron and stainless steel. The latter because you never, ever want to cook anything acidic in cast iron. Treat cast iron right and over a few years it will be far more nonstick than teflon.  I have three cast iron pans and a gigantic wok, I'm talking 24 inches, pretty friggin heavy"
"Cast iron can get VERY non-stick as more oil polymerizes on the cook surface, but it will NEVER be “more nonstick than teflon.” That is a literal, physical impossibility."
no uncle title just for metal spoon? everything else was really good.
No fuck up so far? How about cooking a steak in a cast iron skillet when you have the open fire right there! Fucking christ!
Gordon could take Uncle Roger and Nephew Nigel at the same time.
i follow you cuz u know demon slayer.
me when he cut the stea early: GAAAAAAAGH FUCK
"He didn't cut it early 
 The resting was clearly edited out. You can tell by how the juices didn't start pouring out on the board when he cut it"
Emotional Damage!!! xD
"I live in Texas and nobody I know eats steak for breakfast, unless it’s leftover from the previous night. It’s usually bacon or sausage with eggs and biscuits. So nothing too spectacular."
"Nice touch with the abortion clinic!
Enter the left......"
"Great Video! Good jokes and timing, acting, editing, but you might get your Uncle title taken away if you keep using the cringe ass ""Emotional Damage""."

"*I traded with him, The profit are secured and over a 100% return on investment directly sent to your wallet.*"
He sounds like Peter Choa!  Choa Outside!
You realise he just throws the pan away after
Nice 🗿👍🏻
Gordon can treat non stick pans as disposable. He nailed that steak and eggs and it looks effing amazing.
This is becoming truly boring
That sound did hurt not gonna lie.
@afiqah

Missed the part where he put his cooked steak on the same wire rack the raw steak was on!

"Uncle roger you should review Binging With Babish's channel! Specifically this one might interest you!

"The abortion joke killed me Roger, you're a bad man, but a funny one."
9:18 I hate it too
Everything was looking good until he added that green crap cilantro.
"Hey Uncle Roger could you react to youtube shorts cooking videos? Like Andy Cooks, Samseats, & more."
Uncle Rodger can you please react on our Indian chef Sanjeev Kapoor...it will be pleasure for us Indian niece and nephew
Pepper helps give it that nice bark I enjoy “burnt pepper”
"lmao ""auntie Helen who?"""
"I have a recommendation on a reaction video, anything by Aun's Cooking ka; especially her newest video! lol heard you liked stir fry.... check it out."
"Cant believe this guy trying to react like he's better than gordon in making steak. Gordon's been cooking steak his whole life, do you think he doesn't know that he should rest the steak before slicing it?"
how the turn tables
"Uncle roger: onion for poor people 
Me as an indian: cries in expensive onion rise"
1:28 but uncle roger did you not also cook in the middle of nowhere with joshua weissman?
that steak is on a kill streak tho
Bʀᴏ ɢᴏᴛ 6.11 sᴜʙ ᴀɴᴅ sᴀʏ ᴄʜᴇᴘ ʜᴀɪʏᴀ
How about Guga? He is regarded as one of the masters of steak and he uses garlic powder and ground black pepper before grilling.
That metal spoon on teflon pan sound hurts the asian soul...
"Ingredients for Gordon Ramsay’s steak and egg:

Ribeye steak
Eggs
PTFE flakes"
Gordon always does that with the non stick pans. He’s trippin’.
Out of everything in this video the thing I loved the most was a guy who lived in Ameirca for ages agrees that British summers are absolutely grim sometimes.
"Everyone: talking about how amazing gordon ramsay is
me: HE ASSUMED PEPPA PIG'S GENDER!! PEPPA IS PORTRAYED AS A GIRL AND HE SAID 'THATS PEPPA PIG HIMSELF'!"
Too many bloody adverts I'm only 1 minute in and have already watched 4 adverts

"https://youtu.be/2VrdrcRwDGs


Uncle roger and gordon also can not defeat this pizza"
"No Maillard reaction is browning of the meat  not burning of it. This steak is slightly burnt, its black and specifically its the rub that burnt. You add spices like Paprika near the end when you give one final search on each side to develop the flavour bit not to burn it. The only thing you should add in the beginning is salt."
Like Peppa pig... HIMSELF??
Msg is unhealthy

"I’m poor, so I use onions 🤷‍♂️"

"You are wrong uncle Gordon's forehead ain't the flattest thing 
Sakura's chest from Naruto is much flatter"
I’ll never pepper a raw steak again. Thanks roger
Gordon  tried to impress  Uncle Roger he prepared   in emotive location open place beautfful stream. But Uncle Roger always  insulted Gordon
Gordon Ransay  said right if he cooked for Uncle Roger  then he feel different  it prepared a open place.
my mum got jamie oil cook book dont worry i threw it out
Uncle Roger amazng reviewed  Gordon Ramsay Steak   So interesting ♥♥
This was an exceptional review hilarious
"Malgré the metal spoon issue, just throw the lot on a plate & arm me with a knife and fork & I'd eat it all and then gnaw the bone."
I assume he only ever uses nonstick as one-time use so he doesn't care if he fucks up the surface.
10:02 my mom reaction when i got B in science
Metal spoon is normal in nonstick pan
In Vietnam XD
Uncle Roger so strict to Gordon Ramsey so he set a difficult level for Gordon to earn his title back.
"Chef Ramsay only uses his non stick pans once, then tosses them. So it is OK for him to use metal on it."
You should react to Sam the cooking’s guy egg fried rice
⭐️ Every super celebrity gets a good 'fan'... you don't use Air Conditioner haiya...👻
Day 2 of asking nigel to make uncle roger lorr
When's the Cowboy Kent Rollins review coming?
"7 million sub, meet gordon and do steak together"
"I don't know about frying steak in Olive oil, but one thing I do know is, letting the steak rest. I'm  surprised he never said anything about it, at least give it a minute before cutting it. Also all them onions aren't necessary.  Well, at least in my perspective."
His face in the thumbnail is how good the food is going to be
2 things 1 gordon is rich 2 gordon does not live in texas and is never using that pan again so doesnt give a shit
fuiyoh!
Beef tallow over oil or butter
"Steak with fat. Thats all I need. Call it like it is Uncle Roger.

Oh and living in Texas, I almost felt threatened, but its Uncle Roger. It ok."
"Almost every piece of steak has fat.
You need steak with good marbling."
"Like Jamie Oliver, butter gets burned easily."
"‘Don’t spoil Peppa pig, I’m only on season 2’ that one got me cracking!😂"
If y'all think this is a southern style steak... I'll cry for your ignorance. I especially mourn Gordon's ignorance. It's like he's trying to incorporate southern cooking stereotypes without understanding how to actually cook like we do here. Gordon is Jamie Oliver 2.0.
It is burned.
Why this man suprised that Gordon Ramsay can cook a steak 😂😂😂
Uncle perfect 😅😅🤣🤣🤣instead of uncle roger.. 😁
Funny
4:40 Jamie's Future Isnt That Bright
Life too short to have technical bullshit... 😁
u are an idiott byee
"Gordon usually uses a special kind of nonstick pan, that is metal utensil safe. Therefore he deserves his uncle title. #makeGordonUncleAgain"
"https://youtu.be/ZnhlRTteL8w 
Uncle Roger you gotta review this!!!"
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
I want uncle Roger on Master Chef SSSSOOOOO bad!😍🤩
uncle roger should review Heston Blumenthal .Better than ramsay. Maybe.
Uncle Roger please review @Samseat
"Who are you, and what did you do to uncle Roger.. Olive oil good for frying??"
I get the spoon on nonstick pan but he uses special pans that dont get messed up with metal on them 👍🏽
4:37 what isnt brighter than his future lmao
Gordon losing the uncle title at the very end had me literally burst out laughing. Uncle Roger is a legend.
"He still didn't have the Uncle title. That was lost during his messing of ramen. He got almost the Uncle title, but messed up on nonstick pan."
Haiyaa...Why didn't Gordan use MSG?
TAIWAN NUMBA ONE 🇹🇼
Lol after watching his video i use msg in everything 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Uncle Roger, please review Yeung Man Cooking's dishes."
"I hate onions. 
Full stop. 
Presentation is amazing though!
👍"
"Pepper don't burn, it's cooled by the steak. If pepper would burn, every dry rub would burn too"
since when do you review non-asian-cusisine?
"You say no technical term, but you keep enlightening us about it 🤣🤓"
I think Gordon is a better cook now that he knows even the smallest mistake will get him roasted by uncle roger😂
I love the fact that Gordon is not getting mad at him. Best duo.
You can't knock Gordon tho. Like if he made that for me I would be in heaven
Gordon's forehead is like a fuckin table. I could put my pint on it😂😂
But this is not aSiAn
"Just to let you know what's also better about MSG

MSG has less sodium than Salt which is a good thing and has mire flavour in it anyway."
As thick as lizzo
Uncle Roger in Hell's Kitchen...as a participant!!!
Can you review the channel called bayashi tv? His shorts are funny and you can call him uncle bayashi!!😂
Wow uncle Roger show off his knowledge 🤣😅
Bro he's a better chef than you are stop saying fuiyoo haiya it's cringe
Haiyaa...Why didn't Gordan use MSG?
"haiya is very common in malay for those that all this time dont get it its a very common style of face palm or ""oh my god"""

This freak is jealous of Gordons style and achievements.

I reacted the same way you did to the metal spoon when he put the steak back on the unwashed utensils which he put the raw meat on. My ethnic doctor mother would've brought the house down.
The metal spoon on the non-stick pan hurt me too...
@3:52 EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
Nephew constantinos love uncle rogers new veejio so much. Now I make steak jus laik Uncle Gordon Fuyoh!
Aunty Helen whooo?
"When Gordon Ramsay scraped the egg from the non-stick pan using the sussy spoon and when I heard it, it made me cry"
"''Life is too short for technical bullshit ''
😂😂"
"Is this the first video where you don't say ""sorry children"" or did I miss it? 🤨"
hiyahhh no need to review Ang Mor cooking Ang Mor food!!!!!!!!
Auntie Ester 
Gordon not getting uncle title cuz he scrape spoon on non-stick pan is like Jamie Olive Oil failing asian dishes
Can you please explain why you can't use metal spoon or fork on a non stick pan
THAT sound break my heart too {imma also an asian}

How this asian uncle know so much ??
Every time he cook he look homeless🧂🤦‍♂️
"9:59 LMAO THAT ""HAIYAA"" THO
he sounded like a dad thinking about how much of a failure his son is"
This is like some spongebob episode where the food taster visited krusty crabs
"uncle roger : everytime i look up my ex wife- , let us see your ex wife man!! u keep mentioning her , haiyaa"
"Pre-cut my steak! Yeah no, I'm in charge of cutting my own damn steak. In Texas don't f*** around with some BS like that. This ain't France buddy boy. All due respect tho. Enormous fan talking here"
Uncle Roger so strict haiya!!!!
4:39 anything is
Salvation is found in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ loves you all
"Gordon- ""This is Peppa Pig himself""
Me- ""Is Peppa trans..?"""
The Sofia Vergara shade 💀
Gordon will cook you medium rare like Peppa Pig season 69
"Btw sometimes you roasting some british chef.
Im from Indonesia 🇮🇩"
all this for burnt flesh
"litteraly most of cooking shows put
cilantro on everything"
"you should say funny asian uncle phrases that don't make any sense in english like:  ""what the shit?"" or ""mother ass"""
Took much green on the egg 😵‍💫
Please collab at his Sunway restaurant
Hahhaha

"My stomach after watching this video:😖 
Gordon's stomach after making this video:🤰"
You can see all the abortion clinics closing 😂😂😂😂
It's cooked wrong but looks good. What are the odds?
"Repent to Jesus Christ

This reminds me of Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel
"3:05

Uncle Roger, I thought your Therapy is pounding? Just use Pestle and Mortar. Or better yet, get new Auntie and start Pounding(Hornpub Intro)

Sorry Children"
Ya now only one company see all your information and sell it to those big company 🤣🤣🤣
Tbf he probably throws that pan away after that one use. Lol
"Thanks to uncle woja, enrish now sound like 2nd guwada with speech impediment! He vote fo yoe biden!"
"Chef: marbling
Uncle Roger: steak with lot of fat.

Scientist: Mailard Reaction.
People: Crust."
I fucked up cooking today and put metal on my non stick pan. Wasn't thinking. Immediately heard Uncle Roger being mad and his ancestors glaring at me. I felt like a POS.
"Ramsey is a 3 star chef learnd by Marco Pierre also 3 stars. Uncle Nigel pls don’t tech a 3 star chef did uncle even worked in a kitchen bevor YouTube ? 💯
Nigel is a chef just because he is acting funny 💯💯💯( now a days everybody knows everything by not even learning or doing this things because of the internet and the mindset of this generations) 
Nigel your Entertaing but not much more ( THE MSG COMMENTS ARE JUST TRASH a GOOD CHEF NEVER PUTS MSG IN HIS FUCKING FOOD Just in Asia because they have no salt there ) 💯💯💯💯"
Why u rebiew steak haiiyahhhhhh
Uncle Gordon was robbed. That steak and eggs looks so delicious I can taste it through the screen. #MakeGordonAnUncle
@Circle Anco Pan no uncle title
"Using metal spoon on the nonstick pan, was a boo-boo."
♥
"I like how Gordan can't get his uncle title just because he use metal spoon on non-stick Pan  🤣 poor gordan, go easy on him Uncle Roger!"
"Having had a coworker who raised longhorns, I can tell you that they do not have the best meat. Longhorns are competition animals. They're bred and raised to have the most impressing horns and be the biggest that they can be. That makes for a lot of muscle and not much fat, which does not make the best steak. I mean, it's still beef, but it's not going to hold a candle to real A5 meat."
My mom use metal spoon on non stick pan too
"Given how toxic teflon can be when it gets hot enough, you shouldn't have any nonstick in your cooking Uncle Roger."
hahaahha im laughing from beginning
A
How has this man not been cancelled yet!!! I love it
Lol
......isn't Peppa a girl?
Expes vi pi en
"great episode, the steam looks delicious. i think wise, you should have given the title."
🤣that was the best vpn ad ive seen yet
It’s a shame these guys can’t bond over their hatred of Jamie Oliver
You sound like Pedro from  Napoleon Dynamite 🤣.
Love it!  Both Uncle Gordan and Uncle Roger are legends.  I feel with this meal Gordan regained his title.  Barring not using his own pan was his own faux pas.  But Gordon not so self indulgent to do that!
♥
Prepare for a series of comments saying its just Gordon not Uncle Gordon
"A part of me died hearing Uncle Rodger saying ""olive oil, okay.""
AND condoning the use of onion over shallots.
What is happening??!
My world has lost all meaning."
smooth surface of metal spoon + non stick pan = no problem ;)
4:22 That's what she SAI-
"Hello Uncle Roger,  what do you think about Adam Ragusea's latest video, where he strains rice through the colander?"
"haiya uncle roger, Uncle Gordon so rich he can use metal spoon on non stick pan lah. He uses a new pan each time he cook"
It's the Uncle Roger's smile for me 🥲✋🏻❣️
Most of the best in there profession has always a #!$$% to comment and 9out of 10 attention seeking?????. Just understand what gordan Ramsay has done for him to be top of the game
Uncle Roger my sis found out that's she is allergic to MSG what will I doooo 😭😭
When are you coming to Vancouver BC for your standup ??
Oh by the way Uncle Rodger I can't stand your fake accent
Nothing better than burnt paprika on a steak.... maybe Josh from mythical kitchen was right when he said Gordon Ramsay can't cook.
Uncle roger plz review adam ragusea citrus beef video
😂 push it down or take it out on your kids! Too funny! White people call that child abuse! My parents called it spanking! 😭🤣
"You should've given him the ""Uncle Title"" back. That was such a stupid reason to not give him. 🤭"
Good sk
Only me notice Gordon calling Peppa a he? OH OOOOH you be in trouble ;)
Gordon take him to skinwalker ranch in utah
"Texans don't cook ribeye in skillet with vegetables.  We don't eat the food our food eats.  You are supposed to coat the entire ribeye in rub and wrap in butcher paper for 1 hour then remove and flash each side for 5 minutes in the skillet, in order to render the fat to turn into butter.  After you cook, let the ribeye sit for about 8 minutes, then you cut into the ribeye and remove the bone.  You must have been talking to the new Californian transplant Texans when you made that ribeye.  Hiyaa Uncle Gordon, almost as bas a Jamie Olive Oil."
"""don't turn...... Her.. Too early"""
Betol2 kau tak puas hati dengan dia😂😂
I am not quite sure but I think Gordon might know what he is doing
"uncle Roger better talk like that in real life or he is uncle ""insult the shit out of asiana""....."
I’m bloody hungry now god dam it
"Always remember, M.S.G. is Food of the Gods"
did he leave all the onion behind
I lurned more from Roger than from ramsey. Egss on flat surface/ pepper burns easy/ even a spoon is dangerous in no stick pans... thx
uncle roger must react to James May's Oh Cook.
Uncle Rogers is the shit lol
Review Matty's Pho
Uncle roger! I have a suggestion for what you should react to. There is a new master chef show on Netflix and I believe in the second episode Esther Choi cooks.
Uncle gordon Cook time
Gordon Ramsay if you use msg that will fill uncle roger hart with love and give the title
emotional damage
Abortion clinic joke plug. Holy shit I LOL'd in middle of meeting. Nice.
"""little salt""

*Pours 3 tablespoons onto 1 steak."
"So you can cook pretty much nothing yet you comment mistakes of other chefs.....great bussiness plan, whoever save your soul....oh and i dont like Gordont too, just evasive manouver"
"9:27 ""metal spoon in non stick pan""... Why did he oil a nonstick pan?"
btw who the fc................. is uncle  roger   never heart of him
Life too short for technical booshit HHHAHAHHAHA
"mr. ng, it is really time to move on to the next character."
I'm sick of these ads for a VPN. If you have absolutely no idea what your doing on the internet and click on everything even emails that you don't do business with. Well sure waste money once a month paying for a VPN.
"Why is cilantro in everything now, I can’t eat anything. I tried to get more healthy quick meals from Trader Joe’s and I couldn’t eat so much of it because of the cilantro so I went back to trash"
I can't wait to see an episode of uncle Roger and Gorden Ramsay working together
"The steak zoom in joke for seeing abortion clinics closing had me rolling, good job xD"
uncle Roger getting out of HANDS HAHA
"3:05 
are u sure your not my parents?!?!"
Uncle Roger doesn't pepper his steak? Hiya! No wonder why nobody likes uncle Roger steak.
I had MSG popcorn recently it was so god
Hymc
so fun to be toxic. I agree :)

WATCH ITS BIG LEE FIRST COOKING VIDEO
abortion clinics shutting down... ROFL!!!!!!
Are you Stevenhe father??? 😂
i don't like that sounds too hahahaha
"I think u didnt see it right uncle, the pan he used was the same as u showed us. I dont think gordon do amateur mistake such as that tho."
That's rice cooker on the wall. hahahahaha
Gordon vs nick in person egg fry rice battle when
"Sorry to break it to you, but the pepper doesnt burn that easy."
Legend says teflon dust is taste better than MSG Fuuiiiooooyyooooohhhh
Come to India Onion is  🤑 rich peoples things 🤣
Gordon always seem like his in a rush
"Metal on non-stick hasn't been an issue in new, high quality pans for years! They're made to withstand that."
"to be fair, nowadays there are non stick pans that can be used with metal utensils... they might not like sharp edges, but a spoon should be fine."
The pan used in this video isn’t hexclad.
We should've gotten a countdown of hoe msny times gordon sayed 'beautiful'
"Alles sehr schön. Aber zuerst zusammen die Nummern 10 und 1. Eine SpecialDate.My.Id Brünette und eine andereu Blondine. Es wäre unfair, wenn ich 4 wählen würde"
"""Look at that steak.""
Me : ""That steak is becoming vegan... It's green."""
Why is Gordon always out of breath?
Peppa pig? Isn't it a cow?
"Just looked up Sections 312–316 of the Penal Code In Malaysia, maybe you should shut the EFF up about other countries when women suffer in your own country. Thank you."

bruh this ain't asian
And if you look closely you can see women's rights fry with the steak
"It does hurt to see metal used on a nonstick pan. It's an easy mistake to make, but it's still painful to watch."
"Hey, those eggs look really ni-.. Aaaaand they are raped by green shit. Let eggs be eggs!"
Fuiiyo
"As a native Texan. Most Texan food is Tex-Mex, cuz cilantro, lime and salsa goes great with most things."
"Gordon sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future. hahahahahaaha, punchline!"
I am seriously think that you should appear in one episode of “Hell’s Kitchen” and comment contestant’s dish.
"Why uncle Roger use ""Haiya"" and not use ""okay lah"" ?"
Spoilers Alert🤣😂
"That's peppa pig, got me dying 💀"
The emotions push down part cracked me up :D
"Far too much cilantro! It's an herb, not a green."
when Uncle Roger becomes the new michelin star standard-
“Brighter than Jamie Oliver’s future” was personal💀😭
Did Gordon forget that Peppa Pig is a.....PIG????
only empty location in uncle is space heart aunty hellen leff
"Hey Uncle Roger, just so you know Gordon Ramsay is a multimillionaire, he doesn’t give a shit about a $4.95 frying pan from walmart. He could cook an egg on a gold brick and hardly bat an eye🤣"
That homeless joke at the beginning really make the food came out of my mouth 🤣
"Hold on a minute here, what makes Uncle Roger such an expert that he can critique 5 star Michelin chefs???? I mean I think Roger is on point but WTF?"
"""olive oil ok"" Never thought I would hear him say this lol"
Doesn't matter if he scratch his non-stick pan. He will just buy new ones.
He make it so good
"""Gordon sunglasses brighter then Jamie Oliver future""
Uncle Roger roast  Jamie Oliver"
Uncle roger not pick to much western we fk up our crockery and pans okay. Stick to YO azn techniques lol great vid tho only missing some white people siracha lmaoo
Use MSG Gordon......😂😂😂 I like your words..Mr.
Uncle Roger: Use MSG Gordon 🤣🤣🤣( Asian people loves msg )
You don't have children nor will ever have them
"Did Uncle roger miss the ""Don't turn her too early"" pun?"
9:05 When you pointed this out I flinched and had flashbacks of learning to cook with my mum. Does he have no fear?
Uncle Roger likes to roast Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay when they screw up the cooking!
"""Life is too short for technical bullshit""
- Uncle Roger"
"You sound like that ""emotional damage"" guy"
"Hello uncle rodger, I have a question....so I recently had a Vietnamese couple move into my basement, and every week I get a verry bad smell coming from my vents that kinda smells like urine...I did some research and I read that bamboo shoots can smell almost like urine...is this tru? Can you maybe make something with bamboo shoots? So I have a better understanding lol"
"Literally only one criticism for Gordon, I demand an appeal to reinstate uncle title because Gordon is so rich he uses pans only once and doesn't care about scratching them"
“It’s so fun to be toxic”
I can smell the burnt cowboy rub from here. Looks like they were laid out in the lawn while the neighbor cut the grass.
I know a lot of ppl say “let the steak rest” because they saw somebody else say it🙄 just like they say cook it at “room temp”..but even that’s been debunked. the steak is better HOT (to me)…STOP BEING FOLLOWERS and experience shit for YOURSELF✊🏽🤦🏽‍♂️💯
"Iron skillet:❌
PUBG pan:✅"
"So, who is gordon ramsey and why should i care?"
"Uncle Roger: Gordon making steak and egg in the middle of some golf course??

Me: Typical European."
Dirty brain is a genius brain
"Just wear the orange tank top again so to relieve the hot weather. And at the same time, we yout fans will feel your hotness again!!!"
the jokes he makes😂😂😂
Day 1 of asking Nigel to make uncle roger lore
Steak and eggs is an American dish and Uncle Roger has no business reviewing it.
"Lmao. It's Gordon, he'll just buy new ones if it scratches the non stick 😂😂"
I haven't been recommended U.R video in months
"Please do a video on the Chinese American egg roll. It taste great, is cheap, and takes skill and knowledge to make right. Plus it's got culinary history."
"Damn, Gordon 2 good."
"Gordon probably bought that pan specifically for just this meal, gotta make sure nobody ever uses it again afterwards by scraping that spoon all over it."
"Literally only one criticism for Gordon, I demand an appeal to reinstate uncle title because Gordon is so rich he uses pans only once and doesn't care about scratching them"
"No msg uncle. Ffs its cheatn and its no good for health. 
""If aunty make shit dumpiling do you just msg it?"""
One time we will see Gordon cooking on Mars
😂😂😂 Every time Gordon cooks he looks homeless😂😂😂 That is not Tex mex! He forgot the jalapeños! 😂
*Lifes Too short for Technical Bullshit* -Noted.
Auntie HELEN WHO 🤣🤣🤣
6 mil subs yessir
Tbh ur a pansie 😮‍💨
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/q0NsnB4RiTI
Im pretty sure that crust was from the crushed coffee beans on the steak and not from searing the steak… if gordon would like some lessons on how to cook a steak im free… i dont know what all that extra stuff was for 🤷🏽‍♂️
If i ever invite uncle Roger to watch a movie I'm whipping out the projector pointing it at his forehead man that's an instant 100 inch flatscreen tv
No idea why he's saying 'scallions' - he's from Britain where we call them 'spring onions' - pretentious bellend.  Ditto for cilantro - CORIANDER in Britain.  Pretentious bellend.
"Uncle Roger Is ok he poosy now , he Vegan, you not scare of vegan"
"Gordon: Maybe if I cook for you you’ll feel different ??? I’ll find the empty location
Uncle Roger: Uh oh this feel like threat 😬😬

But you'll save on mail because Uncle Gordon can just take pans with him."
3:50 Does texas have specific clinics for abortions? Are abortions so common that they need clinics specifically for them? Hayaaa
Dry rub on steak bad. It’s steak not a brisket or pulled pork. Also salt atleast an hour before cooking you want the salt.
I just do salt on the steak
😂 Gordon losing the uncle title at the very end had me literally burst out laughing. Uncle Roger is a legend.
"Well it shows how great Gordon's cooking is!!! He had to take the title on a technicality with the metal spoon, cause he was not gonna be able to take it with how the food was :)"
♥
Now i know why my pans are fooked!
msgbetteroptionmyarse#
"Awesome video, looking forward to the colab! :D
Why did gordon cut the lime with two cuts? Isn't one cut through the middle easier? I don't get it and he's THE chef, so there must be a reason 🤔"
didnt give uncle title over a spoon in a pan...
Only seasoning that goes on a steak is salt/pepper and garlic. That’s it. Flip twice at 4 min then down the hatch.
i stopped with pepper: googa.... freshly ground pepper. ^^
Polarized glasses I think? Rushing is never good!
"“Yes steak look like Texas, and when you look closely, you can see all the abortion clinics shutting down :)"""
He is worried about the pan but not about MSG 🤣
"As soon as he said ""get your spoon.."" I knew he was going to f*** up. I just dont understand why he still thinks its okay to do that."
paprica burns even easier than pepper and its bitter. fail
"What some people disregard is that when Uncle Gordon is clearly cooking outside a professional kitchen, he displays his recommendation for the enthusiastic home cook, who may is restricted in his choice of ingredients to bloody rural Devon, far away from London and the metropolitan wide range of intercultural choice. Uncle Gordon therefore is ahead of Uncle Rogers asian purity insistence. Thank you Uncle Gordon for not forgetting that Plymouth can't offer more than Tesco, Lidl and alcoholism."
@John Smith Wrong Number?
"I thought Russia was running out of weapons, ammo, hardware, etc. I thought Putin was dying, like of a different disease each two weeks. I thought Ukraine was winning EASY thanks to the heroism of The Ghost of Kiev and Ben Stiller. Who could imagine that “evacuation” actually means surrender, “strategic withdrawal” means running for the hills dropping weapons, leaving wounded and equipment after total rout? How are they going to call Ukraine’s unconditional surrender? May be strategic evacuation across the polish border."
Still doesn't justify using metal on a nonstick pan.
@Dolomaticus I would assume that but they seem to be talking about accessibility to ingredients whilst Gordon refers to having premium Texas steak which is most probably very expensive and not available to the average home cook whether they are very enthusiastic or not
"@Shadowstrike strike I think he means that it is not under controlled conditions. A lot of cooking shows do these things where everything is perfect, but Gordon gives the feeling ""Hell we are cooking RIGHT HERE! Get the pans!"""
the joke with abortion locations was making me laugh so hard ROFLMAO
Uncle roger only on season 2 peopl pig don’t spoil 😂
Food great everything great apart from no msg but metal spoon in nonstick pan fuyo that's my worst nightmare that sound send shivers down my spine
what about the sorry children moment?
Hey man your ads are too long so I stopped watching  the channel.
“Gordon’s sunglasses are brighter than Jamie Oliver’s future” 🤣🤣🤣
Olive Oil is not ok. It burns at the temperatures you should cook a steak at. Should use grapeseed oil
Stop it
Your dirty jokes are NOT funny HAIIYAAAAAA.
"""That's Peppa pig himself""

I'm not a parent and I know Peppa pig is a girl 😂"
Gordon why are you trying to be American? It's a frying pan not a skillet! 🇬🇧
That looked like absolute shit to me lol
"If there's anything I've learned from this video, it's Uncle Roger does not want to be spooned by Gordon Ramsay."
Those pans from Gordon look beautiful. If you're looking to send them anywhere...
Haiiiyyya Uncle Roger don't  pink screen smile
That sound puts the fear of god in me too lmao
You review Gordon Ramsey 💀
First time watching you very funny
"Its called ""movie Magic"" the steak probably stood there like 15 min because of all the camera stuff."
3:53 KHKKHKKHKHKHKHKKH
He using metal spoon since nonstick not the cheap asian style nonstick. Why everyone wants piece of Peppa Pig just leave Peppa alone. So much texmex is he Giovanni Giorgio.
I feel like Gordon would have been less winded climbing Everest. Cooking a steak at sea level almost gave him a stroke.
"Unfortunately I've never been impressed by Gordon i really feel like he's winging it. I cook as well as this fool, my meals come out nice but feel like I'm winging it also and just get lucky."
Gordon Ramsay's forehead is not a flat surface lol that thing is like the grand canyon uncle roger
What a cringe clown
whats harder than having three michelin stars is having uncle roger's uncle title
I thought i was crazy for only putting pepper on AFTER grilling/frying. I KNEW it was the burnt pepper i was tasting before!
"""Use MSG"" Come on, Uncle Roger. he's in TEXAS. They don't like anything **different**."
Did anyone  notice  Gordon  Ramsey  misgendered peppa  pig.
Fun fact uncle rojer Gordon likes Jamie olive oil's food
Bcd
"Uncle Roger: life too short for technical bullshit!

Also uncle Roger: Gordon’s not getting uncle title back because of metal on non-stick pan (UMMM, TECHNICAL BULLSHIT!)"
Fuck Texas lol
# honary nephew.
The  conflict  The  world  needs: uncle  Roger  vs Gordon  Ramsey.
Good thing he he isn't making a vaccine for the vid if he did it like our Governments allowed it to be made the steak would still be dripping blood and you would have to heat it up every 2 months.
you fckd gordon is sumone you just one of mmilll  ionnn  ooh so much
"Olive oil is not the best for the purpose, its smoke point is too low and smoking olive oil does not have the nicest aroma."
saltiest ribeye ever 😄😄😄😄
"Uncle Roger - burnt crust best part? Maybe just skip steak and eat bac-o-bits. It's good in context, but it's like saying ""Best part of soup dumpling is dumpling"" - if I wanted a mouth full of dough, I'd just go spend a night with auntie Hellen."
"Well tbh gordon probably has more pans and such than anyone else..

And he did it oustside so he needed to use the tools he hat with him"
Gordon wants the uncle title more than michelin 🌟
"Gordon uses the word ""beautiful"" way too much."
gordon was probs using someone else's pan so just didnt care what he did
America so shitty sometimes.
Cope NPC
Why don’t you actually get on the professional level that he’s on before you start judging because let’s face it you’ll never get there 🤷‍♂️
"“Life too short for technical bullshit.”

That’s my new favorite Uncle Roger quote."
Wonder he didn't get shot cooking a steak like that in Texas
"That’s ridiculously petty, it’s about the food, not the pan :("
To be fair... I guess Gordon edited out the rest time for the steak. Not enough juices came out for not be rested...
I think the funniest thing about this is that he has no clue about cooking
Pepper pig himself?
Do you guys realise that he have shocking amount of Michelline stars restaurants with his signature dishes but he is making those videos with his original takes just to keep the cash flow and to keep his viewers entertained? Yeah? No...
"I thought he was gonna say ""cracking egg with one hand like taking bra off with one hand... I only do it on flat surface"" 😂😂"
FYI the Netflix trick doesn't work with Express VPN. Not where I live at least.
If you’re a judge you know everybody let’s judge you
It's hot enough here he could've cooked without the fire
Vegan teacher breaking her computer when she sees those cows :
That toxic parent bit killed me. Too real. 😂
"Uncle Roger, Gordon Ramsay glass cost more than my house la, how he looks homeless?"
"Actually those are not Teflon pans but special non stick pans that can be used with metal utensils.  
Gordon also promotes those a lot. 
He uses them in his own kitchens"
Texas... county. Goddamnit
"The technical translation for Maillard reaction is ""Meat go brown, make very tasty""
(I wonder if anyone will get this reference.)"
Why british cooks use so many adjectives? This is really annoying.
The fact that Gordon makes better food and here he's not even trying
"Well, uncle roger forgot if you become rich and famous like gordon ramsay, they won't treat you like a bitch, they will treat you like you're their bitch. Such is the asian way. 

so parents won't get mad at you if you become rich and famous, because they know you can provide them with new things, and whats their most favorite things? ""New Things"""
"No spoiler for peppa pig ""meat is pink like peppa pig"
“but every time he cooks he looks homeless” yes
Why does Gordon always sound out of breath
I’m pretty sure that’s the back yard of his house
The guy can probably buy a new pan every time he cooks i doubt he cares about metal on non stick pans
ramsay got fuck up at the end xD
"Did Gordon just call Texas a ""county"""
“His glasses brighter than Jamie Oliver’s future” so he’s wearing normal glasses?
"Today I learned not to put pepper on steak before cooking, thanks Uncle Roger."
"The only acceptale way to cook a steak in Texas is Salt, Pepper, Butter. Seared rare (Not medium rare). Gordon seasoned that steak like it was a pork butt hi yaaa"
"""If you can't afford it take it out on your children""
Damn uncle roger knows parents so well even my mom always does that"

Dude broke character lol
When Gordon cook his food beautiful Gordon on Hell’s Kitchen : WHERE’S THE LAMB SAUCE
This not fuck up
Everyone can't eat MsG. It breaks some of us out n make us sick. That's why they took it out of a lot of product. MSG is not for everybody
Why almost every weejio of uncle roger sponsored by express vpn
"Maybe because the trauma of Uncle Roger's childhood made him mad at Gordon. That's okay, I believe that Gordon deserves an Uncle title. Cheers Uncle Gordon!"
Your jokes were really hitting hard today😂 (big pause)
"Harsh judgment!  Uncle Gordon is rich - he can give away better nonstick pans.

Final product was pretty perfect..."
"2:07 - Uncle Roger: “life too short for technical bullshit”

Niece and nephew: “but uncle, ‘marbling’ is wayyyy shorter than ‘steak with a lot of fat’… haiiyaaahhh” 😂😂😂

Also uncle Roger 5:47 - “this browning is called Maillard reaction”

Niece and nephew: “but uncle, you said life too short for technical bullshit! HIYAAA!” 😂😂😂"
Need guga comt here
I love your videos Uncle Roger !!
"Olive oil is bad, use rapeseed oil or even better butter."
Now that's a fuiyooo moment.... Gl Uncle Roger!! 😅
Dont Make Uncle Roger Cry Use Some Msg
"If the Pan is made of Cast Iron then metal spoon seems okay, there's no coating to come off..."
is this man chinese ???
Peppa Pig is pork tho...
"Do React to; Sonny, Food Expert: Drinking Blood... hmm taste like red Wine. 🍷"
Uncle Roger Gordon have his own brand of cooking utensil of course they are not non stick pan
"Ahahh.  perfect spot for ""emotional damage"" Great vid as usual Uncle !"
"Don’t spoil peppa pig, uncle roger is only on season 2"
"big tech company scary yes, but the ones you should fear the most is all of the VPN companies."
"""It's fun to be toxic."" 
I feel you Uncle Roger."
7:42 Should have little better if with Calamansi (Filipino lime) 😉
Ain't olive oil is not suitable for frying or cooking steak though? The boiling point is too low.
Nick😌
"Not only does the Onion deliver lot's of flavour, also the essential oils in it will make you meat nice and tender ^^"
Remember to book hotel .....my neighbours appreciated me laughing at that
Mrnigelng pls respond I love your videos you’re my favourite YouTuber ever
""" nver put pepper on steak before cooking "" , Guga might get sad"
That actually looks delicious 🤤
"Paprika burns to easily too. Same code as pepper, do not put it at pan unless you have any sort of way to boil it or reduce the amount of heat. Just adding olive oil with the steak would be plenty."
I wanna eat this 😭 not fair Gordon
That uncle title is hard to get. I thought he deserved it.
"""life too short for technical ballsh*t""
lmfao"
This guy is so annoying.  His fake accent is getting so old.   Please stop.
So nice
I love how Roger is so logical it makes his jokes and sarcasm much better
"""Gordon, you should crack egg on ur forehead bc thats the BIGGEST FLAT SURFACE UNCLE ROGER EVER SEEN"""
Malaysian here. My wife insist on using metal utensils on all our non-stick cookware because she said if they're never going to get damaged then when will she buy new ones?
Uncle Roger you always  talk about  other people's cooking  I want you to make  an Asian dish please.
He already sinned by using metal tongs on the iron skillet so the spoon wasn't as bad lol. But he's a multi millionaire I doubt he cares lol.
Uncle Roger is so Tak Boleh Blah
"Uncle roger cannot handle a little Teflon in his food sooo weak so weak, it actually gives good flavour"
"Uncle roger, auntie Helen is my friend and Jamie Oliver is my best friend, stop roasting them or else…"
_so fun to be toxic_ now I need to print that oN my Tshirt 😂
Gordon going full on with the cross contamination 🤮
Where msg
"You need the right pan for the eggs. If you don't get the right pan for the eggs, all that hard work equates to nothing. For me the presentation is a 8."
"“No spoiler for Peppa Pig”

I love how Roger is so logical it makes his jokes and sarcasm much better

Since it's tex mex style he gets the tio title and not uncle title

Remember not to crush the garlic with a Zhang Xiaoquan brand knife
Make a reaction video when gordon made grilled cheese
If you can’t afford therapy keep pushing it down until you die early
"and of course he does well. he's not doing asian cuisines, so what's the purpose of this video?"
olive oil is not ok.
isn't peppa pig a female? I have never watched it myself so i don't know but I am pretty sure she is a girl
"Uncle Gordon no spoiler for peps pig, uncle roger only on season 2 😭"
"O man! what is this fuiyyaa and uncle Roger, his Asian parents must be proud of him, becoming uncle"
"3:50
Wtf🤣🤣🤣"
4:39 A black hole is brighter then Jamie Oliver's future.
"""no fk up so far ""XD"
"Seriously Uncle Rodger... No Uncle title because of the spoon? 😒
You wrong for that. Lol"
"Uncle Roger,  You funny!  You delicious!"
"Don,t say sorry children its not good .children all so watch thos chanel"

"Gordon can buy lots of non stick pan, that's why he uses metal spoon 🤪😂"
nah it's because the pans he uses you can use metal on jt
I think he uses some fancy non stick cookware where you can use metal utensils.
"truthfully though, the sound of metal on the non-stick pan was as horrible as nails on a chalkboard.
heart my ears, and heart."
Is it a fake accent ?
Wow angling .
Not the abortion comment 🤣💀
"Hey uncle roger,did you know Nick did a msg steak?"
About time you two love birds meet up.
He can not bacons hhhhiiiiaaaa
This dude is sooo freaking annoying 🙁☹️😕
I just want to suck the bone
Hilarious!! I’d love to cook a steak with you sometime!! Gordon needs some lessons occasionally
"After the joke about Gordon’s sunglasses, I’m a bit concerned that Uncle Roger might be an asassin"
"WTF, Uncle Roger's channel turned into a Gordan Ramsay fanboy channel.  Hayaaaa! 😕"
I wanna see Uncle Roger hang out with Gordon :D
I love how this fried rice guy is reacting to a michelin star chef cooking something the chef has probably cooked thousands of times
Everytime he cooks he looks homeless
Not a scam
"Wait…







Why is she auntie Helen auntie and uncle are siblings"
No sorry children ☹️
can this guy cook or he only speaks?
Shallot is cheapper than onion. In my country
"The steak came out perfect, but no uncle title.  Typical Asian parent, A cannot, need A+"
"Literally no one :- this guy ""Haiyaaaa"" after every 1 min"
Gordan vs Uncle Roger food battle pls
"Is it ok for ""Uncle Roger"" aka Nigel Ng to put on this fake stereotype Oriental accent in this day and age?"
Congrats on 6.09M Subscribers Ungle Roger
Am I tripping??? This looks Chinese style to me!
3:00 my classmates can never understand why I do that
Watch joshua weissman recreate jolibee chicken and spagetti but better and there is a huge surprise in his video
"“Life too shurt for technical booshit"""
Im asian to u are over reacting im from the Philippines lol if u use so much msg it’s not good for you and for the pan and spoon over reacting still
What I most appreciate is that Gordon's cooking videos are no longer being directed by Micheal Bay.
So fun to be toxic 😂🥰
Uncle Roger Triggering the Pro Aborts.
"ah, virgin uncle roger doesn't know Gordon's pan doesnt give a shit when you use metal on it"
when you collab with your asian buddy steven?
Am i the only one that thinks the burnt part and extra bitterness is the least i want to have in my steak?
NO METAL SPOON IN NON STICK PAN! 🤬
"To be fair, if Gordon Ramsay fucks up steak of all things my world view is going to turn upside down."
Uncle Roger be having 6.09m subscribers- sussssy
do adam ragusea next
Wow I didn't expect Gordon Ramsay to lose his Uncle title all because of one mistake
metal Spoon in none stick pan for gordon is ok becuz he is rich XDDDD
Dude this guy is literally making fun of his own people by taking like this. Does no one else see this?
"Just because of the spoon, no uncle tittle xD"
Only pepper and salt. Nothing else.
It's like a back bencher moking the topper for getting  98% ..😆😆
I love this guy. One vid and he just got a new sub xD
The metal on the non-stick really struck and ancestral nerve with Uncle Roger
eyoo good smashing🤨
Damn Republicans
"idk, bout the add, Netfix now shuts down about ten mins into a show and detects a vpn is being used. Its so shit because we pay for it. it should give us all the same things."
Just stop paying for Netflix.  No idea why people spend money on that crap.
Dry rub sucks.
"No, olive oil not good.  Too low of a smoke point.  Turns carcinogenic too easily.  Combine that with the teflon he scraped off of the pan.  No."
bruh
"Your words are a metal spoon, and all of us are just non-stick pans."
"""Don't turn her too early, take your time"" This had me dead"
Steak and eggs is an Asian dish? Uncle fuckboy Roger testing his limits hi-yahh
"Dried Paprika burns easy, too. As you can see. Never put it in oil that is already too hot and burning. Basics?!
Why waste this garlic? You dont want to tell me that you EAT 3 cloves with one steak. For breakfast. If you want to season with it, you don`t have to waste 3 cloves. Respect for food?!"
Uncle roger can u review to cooking bomb? She pretty good at cooking
3:05 that's actually so true and extremely sad.
Maybe it's time to give up the character. This video was garbage
Uncle Rogers's ad/sponsor sequences are also so hilarious i never feel the urge to forward the video.
"I was SO sure Gordon Ramsay would get his Uncle title back, until that surprise at the end 😂

Also, everytime Uncle Roger cracks up at his own jokes is just priceless. That's funnier than the jokes themselves"
Don't put pepper on before you cook? Such a European take.
He is not a good driver but he will give you driving licence.
Spoon in non stick makes me cringe... 😆
'dont cook with pepper it will burn!' ......puts coffee on steak....
"Lmao the bottom of the spoon isnt going to scrape the pan, what kind of stupid shit is that 😂😂😂"
lol this was good and ribeye + eggs for breakfast is so key
"my heart breaking when metal spoon being used in non stick pan, but when my mom uses the metal spoon in my rice cooker X_X"
its called nature uncle roger
Review the price of his stake ... Uncle.
Nobody gonna mention how Gordon called peppa pig a girl
"dont worry uncle roger, mr gordon use the pan 1 times only then throw it away"
He think he knows
"The Texas Longhorn has to be the best cattle anywhere ...
... in America. 


I love that delay"
wait why u criticise sg food?
Ok i googled the ramsat and sofia thing and it was kinda gross ngl disappointed in ramsay
"""so fun to be toxic"" yes!"
"""Auntie Helen who?""

Rofl."
Please do a review at gordon restaurant
Texmex is what?
Uncle roger is the ceo of violating people
I'd be willing to bet uncle Roger has never had a longhorn steak.
9:25
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
"🙏SENSITIVE CHANNEL💥 ⤵️
Alles sehr schön. Aber zuerst zusammen die Nummern 10 und 1. Eine girlfriend.host Brünette und eine andere Blondine. Es wäre unfair, wennk ich 4 wählen würde"
Can't put lime on steak until the end? You better watch some more of the Cowboy Kent Rollins' videos. He uses lime juice as a tenderizer.
I can't believe it...I have the uncle title and gordon doesn't
lol that sound UHR loillll so good
Uncle Roger review this bibimbap please. https://youtu.be/HAbK252ICdg
I thought its a cast iron. Him using metal spoon does not matter.
"The ""Hello Aunties"" at the end though."
Love the outtakes man. Keep up the solid work . FUIYOHHHH ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Didn't expected Gordon wouldn't get Uncle titles back just because the sounds of the non sticky pan. Lmao
I can’t believe uncle roger roasting Jamie Oliver for the Infinite time
Emotional Damage!
that grinding on the non stick was so bad it woke up my ancestors
Come on you said you didn’t like steak to josh weissman
Mexicans  wey dont use cilantro on eggs
"""don't spoil peppa pig"" 💀"
"The Maillard reaction (crusting on Gordon’s steak) is also involved in the production of wok hei, for anyone who loves egg fried rice as much as Uncle Roger. And it’s been noted before by a commenter in a previous “Uncle Roger reacts to Gordon Ramsay“ video, but Gordon’s recipes tend to turn out “meh” when he’s put on a time limit; it’s only when he takes his time that those dishes really shine~ #fuiyoh"
"Ummmm he didn't clean the pan grate thing after he had the raw meat and then he put the cooked steak on the same surface. I know it isn't as bad as if he did that with chicken but still, it was raw meat. Smh. I would think he would know better"
He need to learn how to book hotel had me tearing 😂😂
do @stalekraker official next
POV: you're choking 3:53
"Hahaha just a scratch and the uncle title's out.

PS. I hope you react to this to so Uncle Brian can react to you reacting to his cooking
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtOyK-h3hnA&ab_channel=ChefBrianTsao"
"Hey Uncle...you need to check out/review some “Hunger Pang” videos...
They did a fried rice recently and many Asian dishes. ATK have been using them and I love ATK so your review is important.
The most recent stir fry noodles they put the scallion greens in early from the least that I noticed.

Check them out I would enjoy your review."
"If you grind your peppercorn too small it will burn. That's why I lightly use very course grain pepper. If you have your oil and heat right you'll get nicely toasted/fried grains of pepper that disintegrate in your mouth. If that's not enough, finish it off with some finer ground stuff. I don't like my steak to be overwhelmed with seasoning so this works great for me."
Can't watch anymore would not recommend.
Steak looks overdone.  Definitely not medium rare.
Everything about Gordon Ramsay makes me happy. Except the absence of the Uncle title.
"I don't want my steak cut for me, or my eggs half cooked with snotty whites. 
Fail"
hey Uncle Roger; make a video on how to properly season your Wok and take care of it.
"I don't think Gordon is using the cheap non stick pans most of us have. He's using those ones where light metal usage is ok
*edit* Gordon is an Uncle again in my books! Uncle title is for the food, not the pan"
"Im Italian and my Nonni says the same thing. ""Onions are for poor people, use shallots."""
You should Review Andy Cooks? 👍🏼😊
3 months express vpn for freeeeyoooo
I'm from Texas and if I brought that to the table in the morning I would get laughed at just for presentation 😂
Not when Gordon Ramsey bring it to the same table though :)
What's up aunties?
🤣🤣 hi am new here and am loving it ... You are so hilarious damn
If you drive down towards Alpine Texas you will see longhorns. Beautiful place.
Just one mistake and you know you ain't gonna get a uncle title
"So close, yet so far"
HAIYAA uncle roger this is Gordon Ramsay pan one So even non stick so can use metal
"Maybe it’s just me, but it looks like Gordon didn’t plate any of the grilled onions??? Last I saw of them was a pile of the cooked onions resting on the steak, then next we see the onion-less steak being sliced and plated with the eggs. The onions disappeared. 🥺"
I can't believe it...I have the uncle title and gordon doesn't
"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."
I was here for it until the cilantro
I was on the edge of my seat. Will Gordon be uncle again.
"""Life too short for technical bullsh*t!""

Uncle Roger out here preaching pure facts!"
@Vexus he said here

"Buy an AC. All i can see is your droplets of sweat dripping, and I want to see your reaction videos. You have 6 mil+ subscribers. No excuses, or I will tell your mom to come beat you. XD"
"Am I too autistic to understand if the MSG thing is a running gag or not?
I plan to buy and try it..."
Now now Uncle Roger you’re just being to fussy and petty. What next? Not holding spoon at the right angle?
I wish that delicious steak could be home delivered in the town of Chillingbourne. 🛵😋
Uncle Gordon + Uncle Roger +Auntie Lizzo = 😍😍😍
"Uncle Gordon and Uncle Roger drink beer & eat steak in Texas ahhhhhh, foo yah!!!"
😁
I was wondering why no 1 handed egg cracking comment...
I think it wouldn't be fair if he would get uncle title back with preparing steak.
the black pepper tip you gave is kinda right but if you put bigger flakes of black pepper you're not gonna burn it
fou YO!
I enjoy the videos but a michelin star chef being judged by a pretend accent person of certain decent is futile.
"Olive oil not ok, it has a low smoke point and will burn before the steaks cooked."
uncle roger your forehead is bigger than gordons
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
bro uncle roger acting like gordon hasnt been cooking for 20 plus years lmaoo
"Even in a video about Gordon's cooking, Uncle can always find a way to diss Jamie Olive Oil."
I need a reaction https://youtube.com/shorts/9KWQgj_m-bQ?feature=share
All these views and no A/C? Why so cheap? Why?
"If I may, Sandra Lee had a cooking show here in the US in the 00s called Semi-Homemade with Sandra Lee, and she did an episode with Chinese ""inspired"" dishes. I would love Uncle Roger to react to it, since the whole episode is an abomination."
"@Quindara King Oh God, that cake was a crime against humanity."

The black community is still pissed about the Kwanza cake still to this day
"@Viola Cesario “One for me now, one for me in a little bit!”"
No uncle title? 😭Haiyaaa. 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
好饿啊………
"Uncle Roger, a few weeks ago I received bad news from my doctor. Honestly didn't think I would do anything but cry throughout the day, everyday. One of your videos was recommended to me and I laughed and have been enjoying them so much. With all my heart, I thank you!"
♥
"@Nandan Kumar Cancer, obviously. Hopefully he'll get through this."
I hope that you'll get better 🖤
Hoping you get through my man🫡
"Wait this is cultural appropriation, steak isn't Asian! lol"
Lol jokes
you should review guga foods steaks
"You finally make new video fuyooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Thanks you. Do it again"
"In Gordon's defense, he just throws out the pan and uses a new one each time.  He doesn't have time for washing. 😁"
How is uncle Roger an expert in Texan dishes?
UNCLE ROGER U HAVE 6.09 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS!!! Just 0.51 MILLION AWAY TO 6.69 or 0.33 million away to 6.42 MILLION!!!!! Uncle Nick would be laughing
"too much salt. honestly i know people add salt like they have no taste buds, if you can't eat a spoon full, don't add it. for me, adding any salt ruins a dish. sorry all you taste budless chefs. it ruins the food and makes it taste like salt, which is nasty... same dish with zero added salt, would have flavour"
用金屬摩擦不沾鍋是有錢人的權力阿uncle
"Dang, Gordon is such an expert chef yet he serves raw eggs over a perfect steak...."
@Ezekiel Manliguez That too! lol
"Its not about the raw egg, its about the metal spoon in non stick pan"
Great jod but I'm from Texas and as someone who is from Texas I would of tossed in some potatoes too because potatoes in cast iron is great. Just a basic Texas plate steak eggs and potatoes.
Uncle roger I believe you are being harsh now! I know he used a metal spoon on a nonstick pan... But he cooked food right! he deserves unc without the le part!
"1. Onion and green onion = vegetable = Sad. 
2. They make high end nonstick pan that are OK to use metal utensils on. I have some, they don’t have hex crap on them. It’s called all clad, I’m sure it’s ok."
"Uncle Roger, Gordon has his own pans where the teflon doesn’t scrape from metal 😌"
It’s fun to be toxic
"Oh god, Nigel be doing dark humour 💀💀"
Nice this one was good! Lol what a beauty! Let’s eat in TX!
3:29 LOL
My wife ruined our pots/pans set using a metal fork to stir...
"Uncle Roger just said ""good smashing"" right?"
"9:09 you still have not learned?  Gordon has special pans , metal on those is fine.  Yes it's not the same brand you are showing that he usually has,  but there are more than 1 type of brand that lets you use metal."
8:04   most likely they edited away the resting cause no one wants to watch a steak rest.  You can see when he cut that there's no juices   leaving the steak cause  it has rested.
Someone tell me how a flat surface is beautiful 🤔
6:14  in what world is that wrinkly forehead flat?
Why did he make his meat look like salt bae's
Steak is the last thing i expected for uncle roger to review
"NEXT QUOTE instead of ""sorry children"" should become ""hello aunties"" 😉😅😙"
">butter burns easily
>uses olive oil"
Yea didn't you two meet....where that video?
❤️
If MSG Is the king of flavour and Squid fish sauce is the queen of flavour would shrimp paste be the prince or princess of flavour?🤔

"You're getting boring uncle roger, chamge it up a bit"
I used to watch uncle roger and thought that he's funny but then he Became self renowned master chef of every dush in the world and is now judging real chefs one of the best ever ..like wtf😀...btw Jamie Olivier is shit i agree to that bit
i just wonder if Nigel can actually cook ?
Uncle roger!!! Go to vietnamese pls =))
Is Peppa pig gender fluid now?
Is that a one-use pan.
I wonder what kind of conversation will Gordon and Jamie Oliver have when uncle roger is the topic 😂
Non stick pans exist that don't scratch of you use metal. Le Creuset sells those.
By far the worst uncle roger video
"This is my personal opinion but I pepper my steak cause I've never had a problem with the ""burnt pepper"" I hear about"
"3:50 good 👍 , keep the politics out of your satirical videos bro"
3:38 What you mean Olive Oil Okay? Olive Oil have low smokepoint. It will burn before it could sear the steak. Haiya Uncle Roger Losing his touch!
wow
I like how uncle roger does research before every video.👍
You say spring onion one of your favorite......BUT u say veg taste like sad........
"Wait, one of Uncle Roger's favorite ingredients is a vegetable?"
"Everytime Gordon see Oncle Rogers Video, the Dark Souls Boss Music starting to play behind him"
USE MSG
"3:50 I shouldn't have, but I laughed
(well, snickered 😆)"
"wait, ""Texas county"", Gordon? It's a state!!"
Glasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future got me hahahhahaa
One of my top 3 favorite comedians
I love how people being petty of Gordon didnt get his Uncle title back. That shows the importance of the Uncle title in this current culinary era. Hidup orang Malaysia !
apa maksud kau? Xde kena-mengena dowh
He must have rested it longer than the video makes it appear because I didn't see juice running out when he sliced it.
"Why is Gordon out of breath when he is cooking ?. Is he running round in circles in between takes, or has he got emphysema."
"I know he says, nice and beautiful a fair bit, but a nice beautiful flat surface to crack an egg on?

Calm down, it's a fucking bench"
"great, wish you a lot of health and success in life!"
"✌️, 💕 And 🙏 Blessing's...."
"metal spoon on no stick pan is fine, as long as you're not actively scratching it..."
"I was SO sure Gordon Ramsay would get his Uncle title back, until that surprise at the end 😂

Also, everytime Uncle Roger cracks up at his own jokes is just priceless. That's funnier than the jokes themselves"
Jamie cooking future so bright that he will blind u with his cooking :)
"Other than the salad on top of both, looks good. Less of the parsley, onion, ect, using them for flavor instead of filler, and this would look better.

In my opinion of course."
now i understand why my asian mom always angry everytime i use metal spoon
"If Uncle Roger becomes a judge on MasterChef, he'll disqualify anyone getting caught using metal utensils on a non-stick pan."
♥
"@Charlie Flight I had a look, can't seem to find it anymore, it was Masterchef Singapore, but if you want something similar, Nathan Doan did a collab with Steven He and more with an asian master chef as well so go check that out"
@Shadowstrike strike you can't just drop this banger and leave us without any clips my guy.
"He did appear on Master Chef tho, lol I think it was Masterchef Indonesia or something"
"you can see the steak is properly rested just by how it looks cut, like ramsay would ever cut an unrested steak on camera"
Exactly what I thought! Uncle Roger forgot the magic of film editing ;-)
gordon ramsey's glasses brighter than jamie oliver's future..... I'm dying
who the f%ck cooks steak for breakfast...
"Watch out uncle, watch out. 6:10"
Pepper is what gives the streak the crisp though?
"“if you can’t afford therapy, just take it out on your children”

NO TRUER ASIAN WORDS HAVE BEEN SAID"
This is what happen after Gordon bribed uncle roger 1milion pound. 🤣
daddy Roger
"""if you can't afford therapy, just take it out on your child""
I'm sorry but that giggle 🙂"
please react to Adam Ragusea's steak
Am I the only one wondering why Gordon is like outta breath? Someone get dude an inhaler 😂
2:50 go look at an experiment by gugafoods where he demonstrates that the pepper doesnt burn. I experimented myself and it seems true to me (dried black pepper that is).
why r the pauses so long after each phrase
So that's what my dad did when i was growing up...
I would eat that 10 days a week. Uncle Roger you're too harsh.
"I just had a (pretty good) schnitzel, but when I see this steak, I'm hungry again. It looks perfect."
Leaves 🍃
Haha why no uncle title?! Hahahaha
"i use metal utensils on my wok very often

mostly because i have a marble wok, not metal"
i dont think i ll want to try
Put Jamie Oliver to shame lol 😆
"When western people cook they use jamie olive oil cook book.
When you are asian you use gordon ramsay cook book. So original."
"Well

Gordon Ramsay very often travel around Asia and try various kinds of culinary there

So it's only natural that many choose Gordon's book

Because the recipe is a original recipe that is often used by Asians"
"I loved the video, I have watched uncle roger from the start great job you all ways make me laugh.
HAIYA"
steak in frying pan when you have open fire is pure trash. killed that steak and made it into shit
Can you cook the by your self and nick has to get the uncle title
My family has been using coffee on their steaks. It works.
i took one sentence from u really serious life is to short for technical shit master roger
I think Gordon use metal spoon on non-stick pan because he won't be using it anymore. He's so rich he'll just throw away the scraped pan and buy a new one.
Ur jokes are old Uncle Roger :/
YES! The emotional damage at 06:14!!
"Please review grilled cheese sandwich of Gordon Ramsay, i promise wont dissapoint."
This is probably the only video I've seen where he says fuiyoh that much.. 🤣🤣
Emotional Damage
"Uncle Roger as a doctor: 
Patient: how are my results doc?
Uncle Roger: haiyaa you have lung cancer, why so weak?
Patient: I smoke
Uncle Roger: haiyaa, remember nephew, smoking is more dangerous than eating Jamie Oliver’s egg fried rice. Egg fried rice you can avoid but not smoking."
I can't believe it...I have the uncle title and gordon doesn't
"Well Nick, he technically earned it before you did, he just lost it, and you just stopped cooking asian cuisines after uncle roger reviewed your pho video so you won't run the risk of losing the uncle title, I dare you to make butter chicken or any other asian cuisine, lets have uncle roger judge it and see if you can maintain your uncle title."
Great food btw Nick
Wow
Hahahhaa
"We need Uncle Roger, Uncle Nick and Gordon Ramsey to do a video together. That would be great!"
sO fUn tO Be tOxiC~
Aw geez Gordon! Cilantro? Why tf would you ruin a perfectly good steak with the devils weed?! 🤮🤮🤮
"EMOTIONAL DAMAGE,🤣🤣🤣🤣 GOOD SHIT UNCLE ROGER🤣🤣👍🏾🤙🏾"
I'm Asian
Steak isn’t rare enough
-2 Michelin stars .... french pp die watching this s....
You know Gordon loved the fact his sunglasses are shining brighter than Jamie's future.
"""His sunglasses shines brighter than  jamie olivers future "" 
😬"
"Question:In ur next standup comedy show, can u go to the Philippines specifically Quezon City"
Only uncle roger makes marketing advertisements fun to watch!
Uncle roger you should react to Nick Digiovanni new steak dinner video
Kewl
I hate vegans
So nice of Uncle Roger for reacting to small youtuber to help them!
"Some will say ""Coffee?!""  -- Remember kids, all the most delicious foods contain all the things:   Sweet / Sour / Salty / Bitter & Savory. TV-tool chefs will often mention ""balance"" -- this is what they mean. Hence coffee grinds, lime juice etc."
Thick as Lizzo didn’t see that coming at all🤣🤣🤣
I would rather eath diaherra on a steak that an undercooked EGG!
perfect medium rare? nice cook on the steak but its for sure at least medium lol
expressVPN is some CIA shit
Asians don't make steak
"I'm a native Texan, and steak an eggs is a thing here but it just isn't that popular compared to most other breakfast options. He's definitely misrepresenting that. Coffee is a fairly common thing to put on steaks, you can find coffee rubs in pretty much in any grocery store. The way he buried the steak and eggs in cilantro seems like something he would criticize someone for on one of this shows, but I guess Gordon does what he wants."
"Not giving the uncle title for using a metal spoon?
That's harsh Nigel!"
I immediately smashed the like button when Uncle Roger said life too short for technical bullshit
"Does uncle Roger stalk auntie Helen, he knows too much abt auntie Helen daily life."
“Use msg.. Gordon”💀😂
"10:05, what is gordan doing over the course of these videos that he sounds like he just ran a 25k after he's plated the food?"
"Imagine
Uncle Roger cooking in MasterChef Kitchen."
"The fact that Chef Ramsey commented on this just show us how cool he is. He is so certain and sure about his talent, which is not deniable, he took this video and the humor lightly, as it should be. No one will see this video and say Chef Ramsey is not a good cook. Unlike mr. Olive Oil who is like an influecer/kol in the world of true artists, which is why he is so so burn and utt hurt on these vdo :))"

"@Hafthor Bjornsson but Gordon commented on the egg fried rice video as well, long before the two met."
"Msg is for the people who don't know how to cook, so the it will become taste😁, will thats my opinion only"
Uncle Roger has the Mispronunciation Gaunlet
Uh oh bad boy using vpn bad boi bad boi!!
Gordon Ramsy cooking skill is so smooth but his skin care isn't tho.
"What does it really mean to choose freedom? It means to free the electrons in your body and consciousness to flow with freedom's fire. It means to allow the electron to choose the path of freedom and not to subject that electron to the bondage of a limited consciousness, a limited matrix. It means to free your own self-awareness so that you can be aware of the self as having the potential of the infinite."

“Gordon sunglasses brighter than Oliver future”~Uncle Roger 😂😂😂😂😂
"Did you do a colab video with Gordon recently? Where's that vid?
Steak is over done for me but looks good otherwise"
https://youtu.be/lp9beHWKkS4
"Uncle roger becoming the new industrial standard, @mrnigelng are you going to be the next Michelin ⭐"
Uncle Roger superiority prevailed
"3:28 Yeah I think ""Uncle"" would actually be a fitting title for Gordon – not the good type."
No way you're coming to Bali! Where will you perform?
uncle roger moving away from asian food
"What do bees do after they are married?

Come on uncle Roger I think this one's a bit harsh 😭😭😭😭 we ain't gon give him the title back just because of the metal spoon on the nonstick pan?
Crazy rich Asians 👌👌👌👌
"When I heard that spoon scrape the metal pan, I nearly died of a heart attack. That is an Asian's worst nightmare."
The meat around the bone is the best. 🤣
Finally now I can watch my demon slayer season 2
Has uncle Roger meet Jaime Oliver in  person? Can we request for a collab? ☺️☺️☺️
"I think to get the Uncle title, it has to be an authentic Asian dish. Wouldn't have felt right giving it back to him for a steak."
Why does Chef Ramsay always sound out of breath at the end of his videos? He's in good shape. He sounds like he's cooking while on a Peloton.
Doesn’t Gordon use special pan that allows him to use metal spoon?
To me when I cook no aginamoto if I aginamoto I don’t like it.
"As far as I'm concerned, this dish earns him back the Uncle title.  Using metal on non-stick ONCE is not going to do any damage when it was basically a touch, not a big scraping."
it's build for a collab where he gets uncle title back in person.
"You seriously don't have air conditioning? There's a record heat wave in the U.K! Stay safe Uncle! Stop being so cheap, Hiyyaaa!"

To be fair middle of nowhere in Texas is probably the safest place in Texas
"Poor Gordon, still haven't his *Uncle title* back"
Waiting for nick to comment
I still feel like he should’ve got the uncle title
I want to see Uncle Roger review Gordon's grilled cheese video 👀
Even Gordon Ramsey's forehead has a six pack
You should do an Uncle Roger reacts to Filthy Frank's Human Ramen
Press big botton
"U should have use ur ""nephew"" to explain those terms and ""uncle"" shut him down with the simple terms. That way u can follow up with some line like ""that why i am more famous than you, nephew"""
"8:20 I DIED, no spoiler for peppa pig uncle roga on season 2"
Give him back the title Uncle please 🥺
Editing is starting to get too fast for my liking. Like Uncle Roger would say... Keep it breeeeezy.
4:39 wait so jamie oliver's future is bright?
"Uncle Roger: Gordon sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future.
Me: That isn't very bright Uncle Roger😂. (Pun intended)"
Uncle Roger never fails to roast Jamie in every video makes me laugh everytime
Uncle Roger!! Gordon uses special pan that can be used with metal spoon!! Just so you know
"I genuinely love how Uncle Roger is absolutely unafraid to criticize Gordon, or insult him, at the same level he’d insult anyone else. He never addresses Gordon as if he’s talking to a universally acclaimed renowned chef with 7 Michelin stars, but as if he’s looking over some random guy who just so happens to be pretty good at cooking stuff"
"One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates —A•S🟥"
MY KITCHEN FINALLY HAVE A BIG MSG 🤌
Haiyaa olive oil not okay! Smoke point so low! So low!
Invest in Terra Luna Classic? Make 99999999x profit?
"Gordon is rich enough to buy any non-stick pans he wants. So go ahead with the metal spoon, fork or even a chisel"
"""Gordon's sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver's future"" solid line honestly"
Crazy rich asian is a Fuiyohhh !
Honestly I used to be a huge Gordon Ramsey fan...after that interview with Sofia Vergara I stopped watching anything with him in it. He was so disgusting and disrespectful and I completely lost all respect for him.
"Perhaps another auntie? Imo pretty well made, albeit coming from a British/American. https://youtu.be/LIbKVpBQKJI"
"@7:47 Gordon forgot that he put raw meat on the draining net before hand and didn’t wash it

And now he’s putting the cooked meat back on, they’re gonna get salmonella 🙈"
Idk I seen a lot of Texans use metal spoons in metal pans since moving here. So he was on point with the tex mex
looks yummy..i give uncle title back
I just got done eating and now I’m hungry again
"Harry from Fire To Fork, loves pepper on his steak before cooking, should do a review uncle roger"
Maybe if I cook for you you’ll feel different ??? I’ll find the empty location
☺♥
Id love if they made kitchen nightmares but uncle Rodger eddition
I understand you judging people for cooking Asian dishes wrong. but to react to a michelin star chef cooking something that isn’t a specialty of yours is redundant. I love uncle Roger and all he does to entertain and poop on Jamie Oliver but Uncle Roger vs Gordon Ramsey is a no brainier. Ramsey all the way
"""Don't spoil peppa pig"" He died???"
Uncle Roger is the only person who insults channels but they agree with him but at the end of the day they are probably mad
"No no no. I put my leg down. Why the hell would you put all that crap on steak? Awful. As a Texan I can say NOWAY! Also, who cooks eggs in olive oil? Nasty."
Uncle Roger prevents me from getting depression
Oh no Pepper. Pepper wil burn. Never put pepper before cooking.  Meanwhile covering the steak in paprica and coffee >.>
Using a wok is too technical bs.. use a good frypan
The ptsd caused by spoon on non-stick pan had Uncle Rodger ducking the shoe he knew was coming.
"""Life is too short for technical bullshit."" Those are golden words....."
You can pepper a steak without burning it lol
Maybe if I cook for you you’ll feel different ??? I’ll find the empty location

Unc u help me get over ex how i talk about ex wife keep it up OG fuuuiyoh
Wandering how Uncle Roger would react to people making asian cocktails?
"Gordon: Never slice a ribeye thin, EVER.
Philadelphia: *calls Boston for tips on a tea party*"
My leg dropped down when I heard he was using olive oil for steak. Smoke point is too low for steak.
Uncle roger: “life too short for technical bullshit” my new favorite quote
I would love to see uncle roger on master chef
That would either be great or an absolute disaster
"""As thick as lizo"" 💀☠️"
Hahaha 😆 Texas abortion clinics closing down...
I think he can afford as many nonstick pans as he wants
That peppa pig joke😂....the children really needed an apology there
Nothing can be as thick as Lizzo.
What uncle roger eats breakfast i bag of msg lunch bag of msg diner fried rice with an kilo of msg
flatten the steak? this looks like a Schnitzel!
Bit confused why nigel is giving advice on Gordons steak ;) has someone got a  bit cocky?😂
Yum.
"every subscriber send Uncle Roger 1p, Nephew Nigel get gold plated AC and no complaining. Maybe it so noisy Nephew don't hear Auntie Helen jokes anymore. Everyone winner."
Uncle roger stop nitpicking….  Buy a new pan…
as a texan. there is so much wrong with that steak
Maybe if I cook for you you’ll feel different ??? I’ll find the empty location
So is Uncle Roger now the expert of all world cuisine? 😂
"M.S.G masterpiece,savory,grace"
"No air-con in UK studio, yet. Neon rice cooker sign, check!"
Uncle Roger you are loosing your touch...
"schöne und sexy Mädchen für 18+ Alles sehr nett. Aber zuerst die Zahlen 10 und 1. Eine HotTeen.Icu Brünette und eine weitere Blondine. Es wäre unfair, wenn ich 4 wählen würde."
"Alles sehr schön. Aber zuerst zusammen die Nummern 10 und 1. Eine HotTeen.Icu Brünette und eine andere Blondine. Es wäre unfair, wenn ich 4 wählen würde."
My Mexican mom yells at me for using metal utensils on non stick pans too. But that steak and eggs are 🔥.
"That Sofia joke.... Damn, that was bloody low."
In Gordon's defence it probably wasn't his pan.
He sounds like the emotion damage guy for some reason
.
Yeah its very hot in the uk at the moment
"I think he throws pans away after 1 use
I think aunty helen got the air conditioning in the divorce"
I guess he don’t care and just take the next new Pan after filming 🤣
"its not only the review about the food but also about the cloths, the location,the forehead, promotion of msg, roasting Jamie Oliver, the metal spoon on non stick pan and the grammer of the speech"
O man please have Chef Ramsay cook for you and taste and critique it 😋 would make an awesome video to watch also thanks for the great content 👍
"Mr. Ramsay is absolutely correct about the Texas Longhorn. It's the best beef you can get. It's delicious, the animals are very hardy,  and it has less cholesterol than boneless skinless chicken breast. Yeah... that last part blew my mind too."

"Can't believe he failed him just because of the spoon against the frying pan thing lol, when the food itself was perfect. Doesn't make sense. He's been waaay more forgiving in other videos, so this seems extremely unfair. At the same time, he always jokes about vegetables tasting like sad, but he has no problem with all the veggies in this one, and even calls one of them one of his favorites. *shrug* Also, since when did he become an expert on western food as well? :-P Usually he always reviews people making Asian food.

So Uncle Roger watches Peppa Pig? Tht is so cultured.
Doesn’t Gordon have a special non stick pan that doesn’t scrape when you use metal?
Metal spoon on non stick pan my mum will literally throw the whole pan on me

He was so close! then the metal spoon...
i love steak
I know you’re not “a chef” but I learn soooooo much from your videos

It looked like Gordon cooked the eggs without the fire at the beginning. ..
But Gordon didn't put the bone on  the plate! That's the best part!
Not turning steak regularly is the biggest myth when cooking steak.

UNCLE ROGER IS THE BEST ROASTER EVER
"Literally roasting Jamie in all video,😆😆🤤🤣"
I wonder gordon and uncle roger is a good friend irl
"Well isnt it sad that uncle roger can barely cook but critiques chef for not using the proper technique. 
Each chef has his/her own style of cooking and you cannot judge the taste of the food just by the way its cooked. some simple dishes itself taste fanstastic and critiques from these kind of people affect their careers of course. 
For example: How do you think jamie oliver became such a renowned chef? Do you think the people who eat at his restaurant has lost their sense of taste? Like people just send their dishes back and immensely critisize for an underdone steak or overcook fish. Everything has to be perfect in these kind of restaurants.
Coming back to uncle roger I bet he can only cook egg rice cos thats the simplest dish which doesnt require much effort. This guy can't even chop a garlic finely. you give him a fish to filet or butcher a chicken i'm sure it'll be a mess. He doesnt even have a proper kitchen to cook at and is always cooking at someone's restaurant. Although his content is funny its not fair to support someone who can barely cook. ask him make something he's gonna load it up with MSG and artificial flavours. 
I also don't mean to disregard the traditional techniques and flavours used for traditional dishes. They have their own class and the culture of the community needs to be respected and protected.
In the end it doesnt matter on what or how they cook. all that matters is taste and the smile it puts on the face of the person eating. this is the essence of cooking and love"

Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.

But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages "" for the wages of sin is death "" (Romans 6:23).

Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. ""It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement"" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.

He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell "" Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth"" (Matthew 13:42)

You will have to face God on Judgement Day.


Will you go to Heaven or Hell?

Here’s a quick test:


1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)


2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)


3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)


4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.


5.Honor your father and mother.


6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).


7. You shall not commit adultery. (""Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart"" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).


8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).


9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).


10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)


James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.” 


The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.


If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day? 


""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."" (Romans 6:23)


God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.


“For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)


Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.


Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.


Pray something like this:


""Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'"" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.""

"Damn, Gordon was so close to getting his title back and had to screw it up by using metal utensil on nonstick pan. I think he did it on purpose as a middle finger to uncle Roger for taking his title away over the ramen 🤣"
lowkey thought uncle was gonna reference aespa when he said life too short
"Uncle Roger said,
Steak is one of most boring food
But now He is Enjoying it when Gordon is making it
This is the proof that Uncle Roger Loves Gordon Ramsay"
Uncle Roger also constantly learning & evolving
haha kinda for some but no.. you can try and be OVER asian... and talk about cooking.. but you can not cook... YouTube click bait and looking at the numbers.. funny for some but for how long?
Nobody cares if he can cook. we just here for comedy.

Imagine Insulting Gordon Ramsey and then comments and responds! LOL
They really eat steak with egg in Texas? Looks like way too much protein.
new vijeo fuiyoh
"Omg Gordon killed me with ""Peppa pig🐷🐖 himself ""😂😂"
why the feck would you ruin a good steak with all that rub you want to taste the meat not the trimings but than I'm an Aussie and we have the best steak you can eat just heat the pan throw it in turn after a bit and there you go
Uncle Roger is the only person who can insult Gordon without being hated by him
"Awwww...
Gordon is to be denied his rightful title for a foul in the last quarter.
🤔I don't think Uncle Roger will ever get over that!
That's emotional damage!
Poor poor Gordon!😢"

"1:18 to skip the ad, thank me later"
"Uncle Roger. Uncle Gordon is rich. After use the non stick pan once, will discard."
No MSG!!!!! And Longhorns are not the best beef cattle in Texas.

"Uncle Roger, Gordon Ramsay is cooking in (outdoor kitchen), so it must be serving delicious food 😎"
"wait wait, since when does uncle roger review non asian food. that's racial appropriation⚡⚡⚡"
Me checking the comments to see gordons comment
Not as funny as when watching a western chef cook Asian food. Less believable that Uncle Roger knows how to cook Texas style steak.
"Peppa? HIM self? Peppa is a GIRL.... And she is a pig, not a cow ;)"
I think Gordon has non stick pans that can resist scratching from metal utencils..
wow
Why would you wanna poison us with MSG? :D

I like it how Nigel called out Gordon for being inappropriate with Sofia

Uncle Roger represents a form of non-pc comedy that makes the world a freer happier place.
"dude, just shut up and enjoy comedy and stop trying to figure out if the comedian is pc or woke or whatever. Comedy is an artform made from the comedians interpretation of how they see the world. Chill."
"The Maillard reaction (crusting on Gordon’s steak) is also involved in the production of wok hei, for anyone who loves egg fried rice as much as Uncle Roger. And it’s been noted before by a commenter in a previous “Uncle Roger reacts to Gordon Ramsay“ video, but Gordon’s recipes tend to turn out “meh” when he’s put on a time limit; it’s only when he takes his time that those dishes really shine~ #fuiyoh"

uncle roger just said texans r poor
Uncle roger watch demon slayer.HAIYAA
I prefer Guga's steaks more. Uncle Gordon forgot to tell everyone to dry it in the fridge at least overnight before cooking it to get rid of the moisture.
The metal spoon scratches went through my core XD

"I just realized, that when Uncle Roger reviews a chef for the first time, or when he reviews someone he likes, when they use strange ingredients, Uncle Roger would usually say ""Interesting ingredient"". But when Jamie Oliver does that, Uncle Roger would say ""Who use that?!!"". Just a small detail when I watch his videos! 😉😉"
Uncle Roger should be on @masterchef. Bet he’d be an excellent judge.
I prefer my meat cooked through and my eggs also fully cooked. I think gordon ramsay lazy and only cook 20% of everything..
"I genuinely love how Uncle Roger is absolutely unafraid to criticize Gordon, or insult him, at the same level he’d insult anyone else. He never addresses Gordon as if he’s talking to a universally acclaimed renowned chef with 7 Michelin stars, but as if he’s looking over some random guy who just so happens to be pretty good at cooking stuff"
Ehh no worries about the non-stick pan. Using metal on it just means you get all the cancer causing crap sooner rather than later! 😂😂😂 I feel he earned his Uncle status back based on his food only! Looks so good.
6:11 he forgot about Auntie Helen's back
Haha yeah all the abortion clinic closing down... Condoms sales up because now they learn how to put raincoat on one eye snake.
3:37 does science now say i'ts okay to put olive oil on high heat and past smoking point?
"Gordon said "" Best cattle anywhere"" paused and realize he is about to make a mistake ""in america"". Saved!"
Fuyoh... Uncle Roger 1M view liao. Why like this why like that. Haiya.... Next time Uncle Roger should give a Food Critic tour at Gordon Ramsey Hell's Kitchen Las Vegas. Then can meet precious Chef Christina Wilson.

"I have a correction for Gordon: Not ""That's Peppa Pig *him*self"" but ""That's Peppa Pig *her*self""."
"I thought you said in the collab with Joshua Weissman: ""Steak is most boring food""."
"Too much green onions on the eggs. Steak should have rested longer. As for him saying the steak is as pink as Pepper Pig., good point but pork should be cooked a little longer. And anyway steak comes from a cow not a pig. Should have gone with either Mr Bull or Carol Cow."

You said you favourite ingredient, on minute 11:15 was spring onions! I thought it was MSG!!! Aya!!!"

Uncle roger has PTSD related to using metal cutlery on non-stick pan.😅

i thought he lost his uncle title
Push that down into ....
All I hear when I watch a Gordon Ramsay video is the guy puffing and panting like he's just run a half marathon. Is he okay? Has he got severe untreated asthma?
"Abortion clinic out, so, arranged marriage? Women safety? Of course, not all men bad just dangerous."
Don't worry about Uncle Roger. He can't even cook for himself he always runs to someone to show him and babysitting him while cooking. 😐😬 not being a hater just stating the truth.
the thumbnail lol
Looks like this is gonna be a fun one cannot wait until uncle roger eat in place not just watching
I think he put too much crap on the steak...
"no dry rub joke?! c'mon, easy layup"
please play kick
It's not just Asian parent. Using metal on non-stick is literally blasphemy.
Uncle Roger you should react to Guga Foods dry aged steak using MSG.
As a Texan I am wondering why he is using a skillet when he has an open pit grill. Directly over fire always tastes better.
Look Yummy though 😋😛
No spoilers for Peppa Pig 😭
"Listen Uncle Roger. The spoon has a rounded bottom, so it won’t damage the non-stick surface."
"(John 3:16,17) ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him."" (Romans 10:9,10) ""That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."""
is iyt messed up that i dont like the videos where uncle Roger is happy? XD
THERE ARE ZERO PEOPLE IN TEXAS THAT WOULD COOK A STAKE LIKE THAT.

"I STILL remember going to Gordon Ramsays Steak restaurant in Las Vegas..

Steak was shit.
Over cooked to hell, charcoal on the outside, blue in the middle...and it took over an hour

how

The fact that the whole metal spoon on the nonstick pan thing is actually not even an overreaction. That shit legitimately hurt my soul.
"That sound when the metal spoon scraped the non stick pan, brought back a lot of painful and traumatic childhood memories. XD"
Everytime he cook he look homeless...I'm dead 💀 🤣
Way to many vile weeds (you know them as onions). I never cook with them because that is all you can taste. They are just gross
I love the fact that Gordon is not getting mad at him. Best duo.
If I start a company I gotta get Uncle Roger to promote it because his promotions are the only one I watch :)

"gordon i love you but as a texan, why would you want to cook a steak over a wood fire grill... in a pan??? and texas isnt a county... we a country!!!"
Gordon is rich.  He can afford to buy thousands of new non-stick pans.
"You're way too obsessive about metal on non-stick. It's really not a risk unless you're aggressively scratching or mixing. Teflon is actually really quite tough these days. 

A spoon touching a pan is not going to do any damage whatsoever."
Annoying Asian dude who can’t cook but critics chefs who can actually cook 😂
"Roger makes spaghetti and puts it in stinky bath water and calls it Ramen. Rogee has no room to speak about other people Ramen when he does not know what ramen is.

Garlic in ramen soup base!

Gordon Ramsey will forever be Nephew Gordon because of that metal spoon.
"Ok now I have to step in for the first time... “don’t use pepper on steak, it will burn”?? You have lost your uncle title nephew Rodger. ALWAYS put salt AND pepper on your steak!!!"
this feels so setup.... we al know these two are friends now - no needs for this...
NGL Gordon didnt do anything wrong with the metal spoon for taking out the eggs as it is a very delicate thing and you need something sturdy to keep it intact and taking it out.
But now in india government can see anything i do with vpn

As much of a troll uncle roger is he actually knows what he’s talking about
"@Chang Fong Chua nah man, there are a bunch of different coating used to make ""non-stick"" They are not all the same. Like ceramic is cheap and will scratch easily and then you have Anodized Aluminium that is much more expensive and really hard to scratch. Stone pans are probably the best and pretty much impossible to scratch, just make sure you buy quality."
"Yup, its a thing about hardness. A non-stick metal pan has a chemical coating that makes it non stick. And a metal spoon is harder than the coating (say teflon for example), so it will scratch it. Harder material scratches softer material."
"@Chilli Insanity bullshit dude,  it's the same tech and you can buy ""premium"" non stick pants and it will scratch"
"He doesn't really know what he is talking about though. I know it is a character but simple things like using olive oil in a pan on high heat is wrong. The use of metal in a non-stick pan is perfectly fine if you have high quality pans, It's only the cheap pans that will scratch."
Maybe if I cook for you you’ll feel different ??? I’ll find the empty location

Lol
"Uncle Roger, my MIL needs to watch your videos. She’s ALWAYS using metal utensils on the nonstick skillet that isn’t so nonstick anymore. Ugh."
"Never had steak au poivre, huh?

Also the metal spoon thing like ???? you can use metal with teflon if you're not STABBING it"
No sorry children?
Somebody tell Uncle Roger to react to Chef Susur Lee...guy pulls the most creative shit I've ever seen with fast food.

"Why use metal spoon? Just bad habit, like many professionals in many trades. I use silicone, composite or wood even with stainless steel and cast iron."
Gordon would have a slipper flying towards him if my mom was there when he used that metal spoon on that pan 😭🤌🏻

Sharing everyone of Jesus Christ return. He is coming back. We are spiritually saved by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.
Dayum we've all been spoiled by gordon😩
"Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone! 
     John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”
      We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”. 
     Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death. 
     Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent of their sins and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT! 
     Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and itis with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” 
     Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. 

     Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”

"All wrong.  Steak too thin.  At least 1/2 inch.  Don’t use any rub.  Put in pan with butter, 2 min then flip 2 minutes.  Let stand 1 minute begin eating.  Cut with pocket knife then wipe knife on leg when done.  Crack egg into cup and drink."

"So...@gordon Ramsay bitchslap everyone who doesn't rest the steak, but slice that bad boy right off the pan....sorry, but pick one. Oh, and I watched you cook scrambled eggs and frankly, you did it wrong; mine are way better. Dude, convince me you are better than that. Otherwise, I'm cooking Jamie's stuff...and he's a hack...actually, I'm not cooking his stuff, it's kinda not right. Fuck me. How do I argue with you?!?!?! I challenge you to a scramble-off!!! :-)"
How i wish uncle roger can say that onion will tenderise the meat at 4:00. Although not prepping it with onion before cooking but still the juices from onion can tenderise it a bit and the onion flavour will bring out the steak flavour even more
We need a Uncle Roger and Gordon Collab video
"did anyone notice gordon said ""peppa pig himself"" last time i checked it was a girl. sus"
Nahhhh you never scratch the pan especially if it’s your mom or you getting your ass beat and no food 😭

The abortion clinic joke... Damn... Funny but hiayaa
Well he obviously hasn't seen JJ/KSI forehead if hes scooping so low to roast Gordon 😂🤦‍♂️
Gordon can use metal utensils on non stick pan because he has money growing on a tree at the back of his house.
Uncle Roger is the type of teacher that just gets straight to the point without complicating anything and loved by students😂😂
I’m making steak on air fryer with msg.
Uncle roger's leg hair is real men's hair
eggy weggs and steaky wakes
Uncle roger:99% percent ok. Problem metal spoon. Rank: failure

Nobody notice how Gordon said like peppa pig “himself”like peppa isn’t a female🧐
You know he's known to be violent so if you cannot afford medical attention you better avoid angering him
"Olive oil to cook steak?  Uncle roger just lost his uncle title.

Uncle roger can't review American food."
What? A good steak doesn't need seasoning other than salt.
"""Gordon sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future"""
"Yea, look what happens to the steak. It get cooked. Yea. Nothing else happen. U right uncle. 😂"
"No one...

GORDON:
""that's Peppa Pig *'himself'*"" 🤣"
Olive oil not good. Has a flavor and low smoke point.  Avocado oil or other neutral onions won’t have time to cook down if put on at the same time and using a high heat. Dark color was his rub burning not Maillard. He’s boiling the steak on the second side. Meh.   Cant see eggs under greens
"Yow, Steven He is also here"
Hello aunties 😂
"Cilantro ""gently done"" proceeds to completely cover eggs with cilantro. 😖"
"Uncle Roger: Never put pepper on steak before cooking
Guga: 😒What you say?"
Why does Gordon always sound out of breath even when doing something as physically taxing as lifting a pot and cooking a steak lol
Wait wait wait why are we okay with olive oil for a steak? high smoke point oils!
😂 I can blow that guy out of the water on steak! 🔥🔥🔥
Gordon's sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future😁😂😃
"Haiyaa ...uncle Roger and Mr.Gordon olive oil burn at high temperatures 3:35. You need to use lard, clarified butter or other high smoke point oils. Sorry my critic, love you guys :)"

Peppa Pig is a GIIRRRLLLLLLLLLLL
Emotional damage
"3.05 as an asian kid, testify!"
"biggest flat surface i ever see is aunty helen's chest, flatter than sakura"
Gordon really said Texas Longhorns are the best cattle anywhere? They lean asf
The egg whites are still raw. I would send this back.
Can you do some uncle roger reacts to uncle roger from 2 years ago?
OMG!  Seeing all the abortion clinics shutting down!  Truth! 👍👍👍👍
You can cook anywhere at anytime
4:38 that doesn't take much
uncle nick and his cameraman did a steak cook off too. want to see manny go against uncle roger
No uncle title just because Gordon used a metal spoon on non-stick pan?  Harsh.
I love how Uncle Roger complements Gordon but a few seconds later there comes the insults. :)
Am I the only one that thinks that looks like a medium to medium well steak? There was almost no pink left.
Haiyaaa jamie oliver teri maa ka barosa 😂
How are you British and misgendering Peppa Pig? haiyaahhh
pretty sure the quality of non stick gordon uses can handle metal utensils . he's not poverty
Gordon's forehead is not flat by any means
pepper burning on your steak is the 3rd biggest myth surrounding steak. iv been cooking steak for 20 years and never once had pepper burn on my steak unless i burn the whole damn steak.
"""No spoiler for Peppa Pig""

Ah yes, Peppa turns into a cow and gets cooked by Gordon Ramsay"
"""Peppa Pig HIMSELF"" ??? WTF?"
"Sunning beautiful rib-eye, fried eggs, Texan style; and a side of non-stick pan teflon caused cancer, Californian style.
That is some next level gastronomy :O"
Review Gordon make Malaysian cuisine
Ramsay you couldn't cook for Canadians.
"Uncle Roger the culinary school dodger. 
I bet wouldn't watch this program. 
As is now msg chef self proclaimed,
 all cuisine hooger. And best in world cooking blogger."
Accent is sooo cringe
life too short for explaining that life too short for technical bs
Easy reviews for ya Gordon Ramsay is a hack and his food sucks he’s from Glasgow which is the home of the second worst food in the world next to deepest darkest central Russia
so good.. food looked delicious.
Does anyone know if Gordon ate that? Didn't he become a vegetarian?
"Minorities : People can't imitate our accents, that's wrong!
Uncle Roger : Yes, but I can imitate mine. 
Now that's what we call a Pro Gamer Move™"

"What's ""Texan Style"" about this?"
Is this channel made for children or am I missing something. Do adults watch this?
this manz is the only one with guts to roast gordan respect
I have non-stick pans that can use steel utensils. I love them. love this series and the banter
@Chang Fong Chua it's not a coating at all. It's also not a $15 pan. It's a LeCreuset toughened non-stick pan. It retails for $145.
"Unless you are talking about ceramic based coating or cast iron crockery, you are delusional.  ALL PTFE or the PFA alternative are easily scratched and damaged over time.

And if you are talking about anodised aluminium, dude that surface treatment mainly makes it harder but it performs poorly as a non stick surface."
He always talks like he has limited time to tell us important information before he gets killed
This is hilarious
Are we just gonna ignore that Gordon put the cooked steak back onto the rack that was previously holding the raw steak and was clearly not washed?
No Uncle title?! 😂🤣😂
"Uncle roger, he did let it rest. It’s called video editing, you should know."
The diner I cook at uses coffee on our roasts to tenderize the meat.
"The crust is a Form of AGES, scientifically meaning you're bringing al the sugars and salt to the surface and it burns/charrs. Excess consumption leads to cancer"
i just made fried rice
Hey uncle roger maybe give Jamie oliver a chance watch him make white people foods
All of uncle roger’s videos are good but in this one some of his reactions were just a little bit cringey
"wait uncle roger not reviewing asian foods? 
I must be in a parallel universe"
I would of just of salted and peppered streak then put on the grate directly. There a big difference of a grilled steak compared to cooking in cast iron.
I never see uncle roger cooking without the lady helping her..
uncle roger has no roast for gordons cook so he roasts his forehead instead
Did anyone else think the steak looked burnt?
3:45 is the type of humor why I subsribed to this channel
Using wooded spoon or plastic spatel is better
"Texans watching this video will be in one of two camps by the end. Either
""Where's the potatoes?""

Ooooh but imagine...adding that chicken fried steak to the actual steak....
@thephoenixwars this isn't a chicken fried steak dinner you noodge!
Im team potatoes. Also has me wondering about the white gravy? Or the giant piece of toast?
Look much closer and see women driving to Mexico for abortion.
He's a 10 but he uses metal on a non-stick pan. Solid 4
"UNCLE RoGER I'm asking if u can push ur Algonquin haiya world tour to Saturday instead of Friday, I have school that day and yk my asian parents will never let me skip school"
uncle roger videos turned from reacting to malaysian food to roasting Jamie Oliver and other chiefs😂😂😂
Hahahahhaa this guy is funny as hell and toxic be funny 🤣🤣good job uncle (Chacha)
spooon :(
22nd on trending? Fuiyoh!
"sorry adults?? lol) Q: can you cut steak in half (lengthwise) and (reconnect) to add fat to the ""middle""? *plz be nice, IDK"
2:08 is technical bull meat
I smell an Uncle Roger / Gordon Ramsay collaboration video brewing. I think it’s going to happen 🤔
"they have actually met each other before, when Nigel was on tour. He even made a TikTok with Gordon."
"the metal scrape sounds irritate my whole body.
heck."
Boring video 😴
I feel like uncle roger running out of juice or something. Or maybe it just effect of the pills? Idk but this video seem pretty boring to me.(no offense)
Emotional damage!!!!
3:47 BROOO YOU ARE WILIN LMFAOOOOO
when will u travel to hong kong?
U r so 😜 silly  much needed these days 😇
“Hello aunties” 😏
"Uncle Roger, are you single by any chance?  You would be the best husband!"
:D
"You have to commend Gordon for replying, Jamie would never comment on any of these vids"
Wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
"Yay, Uncle Rogers watch Demon Slayer too"
"Uncle Roger, Uncle Gordon can afford many, many nonstick pans.  He not poor."
"I think that's a cast  iron pan, not non-stick."
1:44 i think someone needs to make a gordon ramsey homeress meme because he spent too much money on cooking XD
9:33 🤕👡💨    😂
also the don't turn too early thing was a myth and there's videos of champion bbqers and 5 star chels saying the same thing.
"Metal won't instantly kill the pan, to harsh."
pepper burns if you set it on the highest setting and just do it as is. guga even did an experiment on it 2 years ago
6:08 Sorry not heckling but that's just uncalled for and unfunny.
React to that vegan teacher. It would be the best collision in YouTube history.
Uncle Roger got a haircut?
Your neon rice cooker sign definitely cost more than a window a/c.
4:39 Anything is brighter than Jamie Oliver's future. It really isn't that hard a bar to pass.
4:00 he only said that because he don’t want to get beaten by cowboy ken
how can there be any mistakes? cause gordon is one of best in making steak so whats the point of reviewing this?
"Completely disagree with the ""Don't pepper a steak before you cook it."" And so does Guga.

I agree with you on letting the steak rest."
Seems like Uncle Roger had joined the dark side.
I like how he said am only on season 2
see you at the Auckland show
bro Gordon's Scottish obviously he is at a golf course
I hope Gordon Ramsay can take his Uncle title back
before we have michelin star ratings. Now we have Uncle Roger msg rating.
I think Gorden Ramsay's non stick pan is made so that metal spoons won't damage it?
"Steak AND eggs is so Texas decadent. Where the carbs at? As for me, I'd pick one protein and then do toast or hash browns. Taters could cook in the skillet with the steak and that's one less pan. Ding!"
"An abortion clinic joke in a stake cook out video featuring insults to Gordon Ramsay, this is just a new niche"
"Excellent video. You need to correct Joshua Weissman on his cultural misappropriation of the Greek Gyro. From the incorrect pronunciation of the name to using pork, thus making Souvlaki, there's plenty of content to be created. And corrected."
ok as a butcher the best cow is a charley cows. long horns are great but not the best.
I'd love to see uncle roger go face to face to gordon on a cook off to win the uncle title。
Gordon can afford to use metal spoon in nonstick because he will throw it away after the shoot
Brighter than Jamie Oliver's future got me wheezing.
What about when he make the mi goreng noodles.
You are cooking outside use grill and fire not pan.
I hope that uncle Roger will not review my videos 😅
Looked great until he added Salantro/coriander 🤢🤮
you should watch his grilled cheese video.
It was the nonstick pan for me too 🤣
do you edit your own videos or do you have an editor?
"Ewwwuuu the steak is chard, surely taste like charcoal, and steak with eggs it's like putting Salk and crack in the same plate, have to wash it down with a huge salad, and you fried the steak in a pan when you have a lovely fire on a braai stand🤦🤦🤦🙈🙈🙈 I'm just emotional, need therapy for this😭😭😭😭"
I love burnt pepper. Grew up with the flavor. Always pepper the steak before hand.
Uncle Roger loves to jump up and down in muddy puddles
So close for that uncle title again ;)
Life is short for technical BS! Hahaha love that!
I like how the main takeaway Uncle Roger took from Gordon’s cooking was the spoon scraping the pan lol
I thought Nigel moved to a new place with ac
Should we have Jamie Oliver cook for Uncle Roger?
Auntie Ester is gonna treat you like the steak if you keep that up. And by that I mean she's gonna cut you on a bias. 😏
When you can’t find mistake on his food you just flame about using metal spoon 😂😂😂
"A ""sorry children"" at 3:07 would have been great"
Steak is only a crime when there is a woman destroying it in the kitchen.
"Awesome video, lots of laughs... Thank you...👍"
"I know there's been a review video here and there, but I think we need an @Guga Foods (https://www.youtube.com/c/GugaFoods) collaboration in our lives now.  😃"
But it look burn
I would have been beat up for metal spoon in pan when little!
"I love how he said steak is the most boring food ever in Joshua's video but here we are, regardless, good video, love all of uncle roger's critique."
POV: asian rates white man steak
Never thought i'd be entertained by watching someone react to cooking
can i just say uncle roger is the best
"It is thanks to Uncle Roger that I finally got over my white people fear of MSG and ordered some. Small bag, for now, pbobias are best worked out through slow exposure therapy, Uncle Roger vidya was the first step. At least I am not a Whimp when it comes to spicy food. Like Jamie Oliver. Remember, use the right amount, not the white amount."
"I understand Uncle Roger knows how to cook all the recipes in Grammy's recipe box, that said... Modern nonstick materials can handle a gentle metal utensil. Modern cast iron enameled skillets can handle With Ease. That said, I have a thin and tough olivewood spatula and salad fork-and-spoon for just this occasion, five bux at the fancy overstock store. UNCLE TITLE - let us acknowledge he does not have an expensive or modern pan, but he is instructing people who do. He is the weird uncle with all the dinosaur jokes."
"(Don't either, rather. No edit button.)"
I get that anxiety when I hear metal on nonstick metal as well…scariest sound alive
The scraping the egg off the pan haunts me for life ;-;
"Where the hell is the, ""ribeye shaped county"" in Tx?!? Been here all my life, that was just weird commentary. 🤣🙃 Also, why the heck is Gordon always breathing so damn heavy in his videos. 🤣 I am so sad you're coming to Austin (fufu land) and skip San Antonio (rock and roll hot babes land)?!? Boss is really mean don't give day off. Can't drive to Austin, we don't get off WK in time to make it😭. Please consider San Antonio! 🥺 LOL Comedy club, the magestic or Aztec theater's are great venues.
#MyBodyMyChoice ✊"
"Nephew Gordon not know how to make even simpol dish like grilled cheese.

If your grill cheese not melty goodness, you fucked up.

Also, ugh, I hate steak."
"So true! Mom used to freak out when I used metal utensils on a nonstick, because ""it will cause cancer!!!"""
"Gordon personified the steak and called it ""her."" ""Don't turn 'her' too early."" So romantic...  What a poet! Then he eats ""her."" 😪"
@Laura Rumpe such dirty minds women have these days   😂
It's reverse grasshoppers
Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
Gordon into vore confirmed.
He’s all for that meat….curtain….
"6:08 Alright, next time I see my ex-girlfriend, I’ll crack egg on her, because just like a cutting board, it’s flat on both sides!😏"
You should check out Taste Show channel’s chef John who states that salt is the king of flavour. He clearly has not heard about MSG hay yaaa
I love the fact Gordon reply's  and interact with these weedioos. Heiahhhha
"Ok first time I can disagree with the black pepper, it’s only Burnt if you cook it badly. Also I think that reference to abortion is a bit too soon, I’m not happy about that situation. Great video nonetheless."
"Yeah, what a way to start the week. Fuiyoh~"
I want to see uncle Rogger criticize uncle Ruckus
silantro soap ruined that that shuff needs to be forbidden. if i want to eat soap ill buy dove.
”Same shape as the Texas county”. COUNTY!?!
"But, did Gordon put cooked food on the same tray as he did his raw prep?"
Fuiyoh!!!!!  Any Uncle Roger weijo is like a mouth full of MSG!!!!
I have only one thing to point out... You have a beautiful steak and you cook it on FKING OIL ? WTF is wrong with you ? How about beef tallow to give the flavour more depth ? Use beef tallow for steak PLEASE or better for everything makes it taste 1000x better. ( and its healthier)
Ooh Uncle Roger reviewed white people food? And didnt insult for lack of flavor? I thought he might have a fit at the coffee rub......UR's taste is evolving
6:49 i was on board till he pulled out that cilantro lol 🤢
I smell a collab with Guga in the near future
Fat equals flavor baybe
"Gahhh, the metal spoon kills me too. That meal looks freakin' DELICIOUS though!"
"""Life too short for technical bullshit""
                                    ~Uncle Roger."
"Finally Uncle Roger reviews a steak.
BTW 4:45 lmfao"
Since when is olive oil good instead of white people bad substitute?
"pleeease don't cut up my steak before putting it on my plate! I want the whole steak with all the meat, fat and bone the way God intended and not some high brow sushified pre-sliced strips of meat that look like they came out of a kosher deli lunch meat counter"
Uncle Roger has fringe like steak
And the metal on non-stick pans is why I got rid of my non stick pans.
uncle roger in another alternet universe he likes steak now??????????????? he says its ok to use olive oil?????????????????
Uncle Roger u r still too young and naive. Gordon want to sell more pans. That’s why he show ppl to use metal spoon so u need to buy a new one. That’s real Chinese way to do business. U should call him grandpa Gordon.
"No bullion cube no MSG, failure. Elder Marco does not get messed with."
I did not expect that abortion clinics comment oh shit lol
"to be fair... our state is 75% open space that looks abandoned and unloved.  Because it is...
Edit: It's 95F *inside* my house.  That's on a good day.  My AC fights against the ridiculous lack of insulation (herr derr why not just insulate?  TOO CHEAP.  You not hear uncle roger?!) and so whatever it is outside it's 5 degrees cooler inside.  Sigh.  2023 goal is to not be in this building anymore."
I like sunny side-ups aswell hehe 😅
"Uncle roger to Joshua Weissman ""steak is the most boring food ever"" .Uncle Roger a few months later revoewing steak like a steak connasour"
anyone else thinks roger should review James Martin? I think it would be pretty funny
5:07 “No fuck up so far 😂😂😂”
I wanna see uncle Roger suffer through Hot Ones
"First mistake you should never use olive oil when cooking a steak it has a much lower burning temperature, try vegetable oil avocado oil or any other oil with a higher burning point"
😁the weejio very entertaining as always
"Review chef Brian Tsao, next!!!"
"Gordon was doing just fine making the recipe so perfect, until he had to go and spoil it all by scraping that metal spoon on the frying pan. :-)"
"burnt pepper is delicious, uncle roger has snorted too much msg"
Uncle Roger hasn't seen KSI's forehead.
My brother loves Peppa pig that i know what happens in every episode
"He said never put pepper before cooking because it burn too easy but he put paprika in the dry rub which burns 1000x times more easy than pepper, that shit is gonna be bitter as fuck. I would bet my bottom dollar that this tasted like shit. Also who the fuck eats steak with eggs? What a weird combination."
"Why’s he out of breath? You got asthma, Gordon?"
Not much of a fan on Tex Mex is a Fusion it's more for the tourist thing local don't fall for it put some bbq Chipotle or chorizo queso sauce on that steak 😅✌
anyone else see a layer of raw yolk on top? this is a bit undercooked even for running eggs.
"4:40
*Mr. Chilli jam stays catching strays*"
"Oh @Gordon Ramsay that was so close, so close! And you fa*ked up, hayaaa. So sad, so sad."
"If you can't afford therapy then put out your children

Filo parents: 👁👄👁"
"Good video, Uncle Roger!  Thanks for giving us more laughs!"
I was all-in until the evil herb got in... Cilantro ruins everything...
cant believe uncle Roger said Olive oil is good
olive oil bad :/ to smoky
That marbling is nothing compared to Wagyu.
"by the same logic as pepper will burn, paprika wont burn? donkey"
"8:03 
 Correction: Steaks actually don’t need to be rested because the amount of juices lost is negligible and won’t make any difference. The main benefit of letting a steak rest however is letting the residual heat cook the steak to the desired temperature particularly if you do not want rare steaks. Although it seems like the steak was cooked to medium rare even without resting so it is a good thing Gordon did not let the steak rest."
"Top form, Mr. Ng! I love when you bring the nerdy chemistry stuff in."
I would eat the crap out of that steak and eggs
"Gordon, time to up your game, Nick has the ""Uncle"" title and you don't 🤔"
A review of Andrew Hearnden (Andy Cooks) by Uncle Roger would be 🔥
5:21 uncle roger lied about secrete ingredient. MSG baby!
He said one of.
"3:43 Texas is a state, not a county. Haaiyaaa!!!"
"Lol 😂 this guy said abortion clinic shutting down, he dissed Texas and politics in one joke without being disrespectful to people all in one go."
Wow perfect from start to finish but misses out due to a slight scrape of the pan (I thought he said they were cast iron anyway?) at the plating up. That’s harsh. I’m sure I’ve seen uncle titles given out with more serious concerns.
Take it easy uncle. So what metal spoon. He can afford other pans and to take out is no big deal.
"Is this a reaction channel, a cooking channel or a,  crtic channel"
"The steak does not look brown, it looks black and burnt. It does not look very tasty to me."
Lol golf course that’s a private pond with fish feeder uncle roger
Haiyaa Nephew Gordon. So close to getting your Uncle title back.
Actually cast iron skillet not nonstick pans
He did good
Boy literally only scrape with a spoon and didn’t get the uncle title hi ya what this what! this!
Uncle roger audiobook? I think yes!
Masterchef needs to hire uncle roger to roast people live
I guess he’s just the uncle of fried rice or the wok.
Second best birthday gift ever! (First is my girlfriend seeing this) ☺️😍
He forgot thee most important ingredient… Worcestershire sauce! 24hr marinating before cooking.
Pretty sure Gordon Ramsey can afford to replace his scratched pans after every meal.
I'd imagine that's a $10 non-stick pan he used once. AKA who cares.
Do you even need aircon in the UK? 🤣 a heat wave is like what 75 degrees? Lol
Uncle Roger should review Jamie Oliver's Fish and Chips recipe for the ultimate burn :P
"You should watch Gordons Grilled Cheese failure.
I've never seen someone frick up a Grilled Cheese Sandwich so hard in my live...
""If you can't melt the cheese, in a Grilled Cheese Sandwich, you f-ed up..."""
For Americans using metal spoon on non stick pan is ok but for asians that is a Unforgivable Act
A little bit of Tex Mex flair FUIYOH
"I made the mistake of using a metal spoon in one of my new pans. I thought for some reason that it'd be fine, but NOOOOPE. LESSON LEARNED. At least I'm not alone in my idiocy, I've got Gordon Ramsay for company, apparently. In my case, it's because I'm new to working with it (first apartment on my own!) and didn't realize, and from now on I'll be using my nice wood utensils AND NOTHING ELSE.
So hey, where do I get a nice steak for Poor People, exactly? Got any tips?"
"I've made steak with chuck..... as long as you're hungry enough and slice it against the grain, man it's a perfect steak."
"Hey seth, if I were on a budget and wanted some meat I'd probably go for a cut that isn't as popular as ribeye like  bavette for example. Or I would go for pork which is generally cheaper than beef and can be absolutely delicious with a nice marinade for example."
"2 weeks in a row we have Uncle Roger
Fuiyoooooh"
Roger you have to remember Gordon probably tosses the pans after one use.. So his mother wont beat him for using the metal spoon.
"At the risk of being/sounding repetitive, being it on, oh yeah 😊😊 x"
Better not comment on Gordon's steak
"i add the garlic same time as the butter, i like garlic with bite and if I add it too early the bite goes away."
Longhorns are pretty terrible for meat.
"Three rules to follow in front of Uncle Roger:
1) Use MSG
2) No metal in nonstick pan
3) NO VEGAN

Gordan broke two of the golden rules. No way he deserved to get his Uncle title back on this one."
except HexClad pans / woks
Did Gordon put the cooked steak where he seasoned the raw steak…… HIYAAAAAA
So how is Uncle Roger steak expert now? Better stick to chinese food!
Way too many green onions
"Worst weedjio you've uploaded so far, no sorry children scene haiyaaah"
"Uncle Rogers i got some good news for you !!
No need to worry next time when someone uses metal spoon on a non stick pan 
As the tiny bits of teflon that go into food upon scraping are generally unreactive and harmless
They basically come out with poop 
Only danger is if you heat the non stick pan for too long
The fumes that come out when the pan gets too hot are toxic
Those are the things to worry about !

Hope it eases the childhood trauma🙂"
What could you use instead of butter that gives a similar flavor?

Funnily enough, that arc should have been earlier, but they skipped the 'Daddy Pig gets stuck at work' arc that actually explains how Daddy Pig sacrificed his life for Peppa and Zoe Zebra, and got used by The Big Bad Wolf as an ingredient in the subsequent ""Cooking with Peppa Pig"" arc, unbeknownst to Peppa herself, both at the time searching the ""Monkey"", stolen by Edmond Elephant. This conveys a much darker tone in the series, and also hints that Wendy Wolf is neither the The Big Bad Wolf, nor who provided Peppa with the ""ingredient"" (The Big Bad Wolf not even being a wolf themselves). 

But due to the popularity of the show, they skipped it in favor of developing Pedro Pony and his connection to Peppa, which is nice, but by skipping it, we miss much of the fight of Daddy Pig where he releases the Chitty Chitty Oink Oink technique against The Big Bad Wolf, taught to him by Grandpa Pig after Grandma Pig, the original user of the Oink Oink Ryu got injured 50 years before the start of the series against Little Red Riding Hood, who tapped into the power of the first Big Bad Wolf who ate her, but got his powers absorbed, not knowing the Red Hood was one of the 7 Legendary Artifacts of the Grimm Brothers (humans who ascended into godhood after reincarnating in the fantasy world, and reforged some of the elder artifacts for better control), and had the ability to nullify any power aimed to the wielder, which gave Little Red Riding Hood the second needed to kill him, but the power of The Big Bad Wolf taints the soul, regardless of the user, so she became the next Big Bad Wolf, on top of having such artifact. The VN really delves into the background of Grandma Pig, so I really recommend reading it. 

The battle left The Big Bad Wolf injured and with a big scar in their chest, scar that can certainly change the series, as there is physical proof that such battle happened, even after the entire area got turned into dust.

But trust me, Uncle Roger, you are in for a ride, because in the end of the 1st season, Rebecca Rabbit defeats Pedro Pony in the Tea Party Tournament with the ""Hippity Hoppity"" and took his glasses as her property, and says ""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way"" which many of us theorize, and well...it's pretty much confirmed, that she is a relative of either Roger or Jessica Rabbit, and come from such bloodline, and makes her an unbeatable combatant, until Peppa reaches the Rock Pools Training Arc, and even then, the chances are pretty low. And I certainly look forward to the development of Pedro, who after losing his glasses, goes into a journey of self-discovery, and leaves Peppa, who broke with him after much tension due to the events in the season. Much to his pain, he left the continent, with the aim to train without his glasses. Unfortunately, the manga butchered him, and made him recover his glasses, while the Web Novel made him train with Mummy Mole in the art of Blind Fighting, and there he meets Molly Mole.

Really fire, ngl"
Metal on non-stick isn't bad if you aren't scratching the surface.  Control and light touches wont damage anything.  It's not like merely touching the non-stick with metal will rip the pan apart.
"See, this is how strict asian parent's. No matter how god you cook, no matter how long you cook, you can't get uncle title with a scratchy non stick pan. We love it

The metal spoon on nonstick pan was to add authentic American teflon to the dish.

Outdoor cooking is the best. Unfortunately not always possible when the weather is bad. And especially in winter.

no uncle title for scraping the pan...LOL
"Gordon forgot his one rule when cooking meats. Always let it rest a few minutes before you start cutting into it. It also looks like he is doing what he did last time, just throwing stuff in the pan. Gordon uses cheap non-stick that is non-non-stick rather than his own brand of non-stick? SUS. The eggs should have slid right out of it onto the plate. I do it all the time with my ceramic coated non-stick."
uncle roger is like the class topper who knows every term but says it's not important
"Gordon fuck up steak. First he put cast iron on grill not use grill grate properly, then he add all that vegetable shit in pan. Is he making steak or steak salad? Gordon not earn steak crown with this video. 😩"

me who watching this while eating my instant ramen.... hmm looks delicious"
"I take it Gordon made this program for American TV,"
Need auntie Esther review from Iron Chef
is this roger's cooking better than gordon's ?
Msg on steak...gtfo....
That steak is gonna cook with just being in texas itself..
"Fuiyooooo ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why i can hear this word in uncle roger voice 😂😂😂"
Thanks for the knowledge drop on the burned pepper added on meat before cooking 👍
"As someone that helped out around a friends ranch a bit growing up, longhorns are actually not great for meat. They're a naturally lean and tough cow that was great for people settling the west, though they do have an extra beefy flavor and they make great hamburgers. Mostly though people raise longhorns because they look cool lol."

"@Anna 4th generation farmer here.. im laughing at you, IN MY BARN,  surrounded by my cattle. I said the bred helped, but you can feed the best herd crap and your going to get crap..."
Please. You’ve obviously not grown up with cattle. Feed only goes so far. It’s the breed dude.
"Personally,  the breed helps, but it's what you feed it that gives beef its true  flavor."
"Gordon: ""pink as Peppa Pig himself""
Wikipedia: ""Peppa, an anthropomorphic *female* piglet"""
For a second I thought this was gonna be the steak Gordon cooked on a shovel.
"Bro I swear this so true 
My dad is a chef and when I cook eggs at home and use a metal spoon to plate it
My dad literally screams at me and gets the belt ready"
we need stream do raise money for nephew nigel to get an ac
"Haiyaa uncle roger why you stalking auntie helen, she causs you more pain then gordon using metal spoon on nonstick pan"
Cookies don't care about vpn.
I hope Uncle Roger doesn't review Gordon Ramsey's sausage next time! haya
I gotta remember Roger is a persona I keep getting upset at his knitpicking.
Egg
"Dear Uncle Roger, i never saw egg fried rice made like this, would u recommend?
https://youtu.be/VnUpuIFbkao"
"hes using the broad side of a spoon, hes not scraping it or anything, i doubt that actually did any dmg to the nonsticking stuff"
The reference to the abortion clinics would probably be a sore subject 😲🤕
"Hahaha Uncle Roger is a tough critic! The steak look so good, I would have given him the Uncle title lol"
Guga would like to have a word with you about the whole pepper thing
"To be fair Uncle Roger, its a big assumption you're making. You cant really assume exactly what brand of nonstick it is and what kind of teflon it is to assume that the scrape is actually damaging the coating."
"I would have cooked the steak over the fire, save the frying pan for the rest of the stuff."
I heard the hexclad pans are overpriced trash.
My boss watches uncle roger and she thought the emotional damage guy was the same guy. I never told her she was wrong and never will.
"Roger: Don't use Technical terms
Also Roger: *uses Technical Term twice in one video.*"
Why do i care about an asians opinion on stake?! lmao
I figured it out! The secret ingredient to this video is that adorable smile.
metal spoon on nonstick is a cardinal sin of cooking no matter what
@chef Brian tsao made a video especially for you to review
"Im gonna be honest, that egg actually looked like a whole jungle"
I hope small chefs life Gordan can learn more awesome tips from uncle Roger
">Gordon did a nice job on the cooking
>Uncle roger about to give uncle titl--
>Metal spoon on nonstick pan
> Nope, Nope nope nope nope"
Thanks for this! I've never seen Tex-Mex steak and eggs before! Looks delish! But the metal spoon on the nonstick pan isn't so very bad. Maybe they didn't give him a proper utensil -- he's not at home where he has his own equipment. It's not Gordon's fault!! It's the twits who set up the production who screwed up! Let Gordon have his Uncle title back!
Paid review
God Roger.
"""If you look close, you can see all the abortion clinic shutting down!"" (Breaks 4th wall to giggle.) Uncle Roger is epic!"
@G ee The views of people espousing their opinion on the case have no impact on the fact she could have obtained the abortion legally in Ohio.
When you finally understand why all your peppered stake comes out like shit and why putting butter first fucks up your food
"Already had dinner and hungry again looking at that steak.
That spicy joke about the abortion clinics... that was gold."
Gordon Ramsay was a metal spoon on non-stick pan away from recovering his uncle title. Haiyaaaa
"It's a myth that pepper will burn if you put it on first. The (relatively speaking) cold meat absorbs enough of the heat to keep that from happening. If your fire is hot enough, or you leave it on long enough, for the pepper to get burned, the meat will be burned as well.

Uncle Guga proved this."
i don't understand why roger picked this video the whole point of the videos is that hes knowledgeable on how the culture would actually cook their food and he obviously doesn't know how texans like their steak you put salt pepper and maybe garlic and if you're really feeling wild you can marinate it in a1 and you gotta grill it he has a grill right there why is he using a pan and smushing that steak is probably illegal here
"people should stop using non-stick, the health risks of teflon aren't really worth it."
"Don't worry, Gordon only uses a pan once."
"He still deserves uncle title, food so good, metal spoon and no msg but really good"
Uncle roger don't get mad at Gordon he just use spoon to pick something up from metal pan to to stir or cook.
"Gordon Ramsey is rich as shit; he don't need to give a fuck about non-stick surfaces, it's irrelevant to him. As much as I don't want to see a Rangers supporter be called ""Uncle"", I don't think the non-stick fuck-up should count here."
"Olive oil to cook steak?  I always found that it burned too quickly.  And if you lower the temperature, the steak won't sear as well.  

Guess I could keep trying.  He literally just did it in front of my face, so clearly I'm doing something wrong."
Steak and Eggs can be easily made anywhere. I love grilling steaks.
"Texas steak
""Maybe it tex-mex"""
5:33 the best fuiyohh
gordon ramsey redeem himself if he use MSG...
"That egg pan looks anodized not coated nonstick, am I wrong?"
Gordon's glasses brighter than j.olivers future.. uncle roger i fell out my chair laughing at this!!🤣❤️
Uncle Roger! Did you know abortion is the murder of a living child!! Closing abortion shops is good and should be celebrated!!
"Uncle Roger is a master if it comes to Asian food, but I don't think he have the facilities to criticize one of the best chefs out there, when it comes to something like steaks. 😶😶"
"""ExpEss VPN"""
Uncle Roger please make reviews on Indian foods ur nephew is requesting 😩
No mention that it looks like Gordon is using an upside down outdoor table as his grill?
"Everywhere along the US-Mexico border, it's not unusual to find cilantro in anything savory, up to and including eggs."
This niece want Gordon's steak and eggs in her mouth.
Make more review videos <3
Uncle Woger is reaction to Gordon Ramsay again!
"I can understand how bad it is to use a metal spoon on pan BUT I feel Gordon deserves the ""Uncle"" title back because he was flawless with the cooking. Plus, Uncle Roger kept leg up. #UncleGordon"
Lol Gordon is one of the best chefs in the world. That’s why it’s funny that Uncle Roger just rejected at the end like that for something stupid 😂
It's bad in Teflon pans but these are special non stick pans without Teflon and then it's fine
Didn't rest the steak. Failed to comment on the Mexican influence. No uncle for you.
Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
"To be fair it’s a very basic recipe, hard to screw it up"
he doesn't have to pay for the pans. :D
"As someone who lives in Texas, I have never seen anyone cook or eat steak and eggs like this. This is not a Texas style whatsoever."
"Life is to short for technical bullshit, what a philosopher"
"One day, a tragic one at that, Uncle Roger will be informed the truth about metal in non-stick..... I can't bring myself to be the one to do it though"
"""Gordon Ramsay sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future"" – You do realise that's actually a compliment for JO, yes?"
"Uncle Roger, you kill this niece! You're too fucking funny! Love you, Uncle Roger!!!"
honestly forget what he did to that pan. if i could ever get a meal like that i would gladly sacrifice a pan!!!
"""Yes, that's the shape of Texas ! And if you look close enough you can see all the abortion clinics that are closing down !""
That's your most savage joke of the year so far !"
"4:43 
Emotional damage"
this guys accent seems fake
"It‘s his role on Stage. Inform yourself, then talk."
"yea man just listen to me. your best bet is steering away from jokes about people of age. just critic whatever. i’v yet to see what your qualifications are associated with cooking. your wiki says nothing off the bat.


nevertheless i thought your add about keeping internet providers off of us was as funny as it was compelling!

remember everyone out here is suffering in every way and that we’d like you to keep things….neutral. nevertheless you’v done well and you have my conscious wishes that youl move up and conquer."
"follow him since 200-300k subs and over these 2 years, he got over 6mil subs.
That one hell of accomplishment."
That non stick saute pan scrape that's how you get shot in my kitchen not gonna lie
I’d consider this more like a Texas ranch breakfast not Tex-mex
Aunty Esther makes a cameo... what a couple
"Watching Roger critique Gordon Ramsay was like watch javale McGee critique Michael Jordan. It was like watching a deer tell a lion how to hunt, idk where he gets the audacity"
I'm not a fan of olive oil for frying. It has a relatively low smoking temp and can get bitter if cooked too hot.
Comedians judge uncle Roger’s stand ups.
Only poor people worry about putting metal on hot non-stick surface.  I know because I’m poor.
Uncle roger pls react to chef brians egg fried rice 🥺
He is really a funny guy even reviewing food video he makes it funny.
Steak look good but you look better ;))))))))))
Oh my word that looks delicious
Yes algorithm definitely know what I’m watching and YouTube just sent me an advertisement of orange polo shirt.
Gordon really knows how to make something as simple as steak and eggs look absolutely delicious....although the addition of Teflon flakes seems questionable as a spice.
Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
lol
But… Uncle.. Why are you reviewing texan food made for an english man?
D*** you crack me up every freaking time!!!🤣
"""Emotions, you have to bottle them up, then years later, you go see a therapist. If you can't afford therapy, take it out on your children"".

"His pans can have metal spoons used on them, that's why he does. Not only the hex ones."
"8:36
Beef for pho can be thin but western ribeye can be as thick as lizzo 
🫠🤣🤣🤣🤣"
@the memeist me seeing this in timed comments: 👀
yes pure comedy *(you have no idea how far i scrolled to find someone saying that)*
"this might be the first video where uncle roger doesn't say ""sorry children"""
"""Its pink like Peppa Pig himself.""

                              - Gordan Ramsey 2022"
"Uncle Gordon make enough cabbage to use single use, disposable non stick pans."
Aww come on Uncle Roger he made one mistake with the pan that's all. Give him his uncle title back lol!
We need uncle roger to grill steak. Lets see how good he is
"Ok seriously that ending was just petty.

Someone tell Uncle Roger that metal utensils aren't that big of a deal on nonstick pans nowadays and that the nonstick coating isn't dangerous to eat. It's not like he's grinding the thing into the pan."
"Metal spoon on pan is just next level marketing from Gordon. Everyone going to do what he does, ruin their pans and buy Gordon pans."
You dont even know how to cook
"What i learn from watching Uncle Roger’s videos:
Galangal=ginger
MSG disgusting
Jamie Oliver is the best cook to ever grace this world"
"Oooof the abortion joke, savage :p"
Neat
Compare with Guga's Steak ? I'm gonna be on Guga's side ..
"Uncle Roger, I love you so much that I even watch your sponsor bit and I never do that for anyone"
Using coffee in your beef rub is wonderful. The drippings taste like Red Eye gravy.
"Gordon Ramsay so rich, that's why he use spoon with non-stick pan once lol 😂"
"Can't wait for Peppa steak 
What a great series it should be"
"You kidding? The last thing was not that problematic. He didn't scratch it, the eggs were not stick in the pan. No reason why that costed him the Uncle title."
"As a Texan, I don't feel that's a Texan breakfast 🤔🤔🤔"
"2:40 You are very wrong about that uncle roger. I grill/pan sear steak season with salt/pepper all the time. Doesn't burn. I'd look at Guga's channel too, dudes literally the master of steak and he always does super high heat sears on his charcoal grill with steak seasoned with pepper. Same goes for having seen steak cooked anywhere else, whether it be youtube or by chefs irl."
Don't say crust just say burnt coffee grounds.
"The meme ""emotional damages"" always, ALWAYS, crack me up."
"As a Texan, the seasoning Gordon used is new to me, I just use Salt, Pepper, Garlic and MSG on my 🥩"
MSG? Fuiyoh!
Yup. Tried and true
I just left my Texan comment. I will pass on this monstrosity.
"Same, as a Texan too"
"Me, a semi-functional alcoholic: Fuck liver cancer, I'm ready
Also me: Noooooooo don't use metal on a nonstick pannnn you'll kill the pan and give me cancer"
the joke on Texas priceless uncle 🤣
"Hey uncle Roger, I am from Bangladesh and currently visiting Malaysia. I must say the country is very beautiful and people are super helpful. 
I thought Malaysia would be more like my country as uncles of my country are same as uncle Roger but now I am really having a second thought."
Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
Gordon deserves the Uncle title on this one. Everything was just right except for the spoon. Come on....!
Guga would disagree with you on putting the pepper on a steak before cooking.
"Is it just me or did it seem like Gordon added ""in america"" as an after thought? Boy would have had a fight on his hands with the steak lovers of the world and i think he realized that.😅 stay safe and stay awesome💜"
Emotional DaMEGE
"i think gordon is only using his non stick pans once. i mean didn't he have more than one wok, he can buy multiple non stick pans."
Uncle Roger you only said that we should always cook outside..Now you roast Gordan..Not fair.. 🥲🥲
hexclad pans are garbage. The 2 rivets on the cooking side of the pan collects debris and just hard to clean. They were to cheap to do it right.
"""That's peppa pig himself""
Me: wait what"
"I hate watching other youtubers promote their sponsors, so boring, but I watch uncle Roger do it with pleasure!!"
"That steak and eggs looks amazing. Colantro, chile ancho, lots of onions. That's a Mexican paradise. 🥰"
"“Life too short for technical bullshit.” That cracked me up so hard, keep it up"
''Look closely and see all the abortion clinics closing''. NGL I pissed myself.
too much body shaming on this one. not funny anymore
Wooden spoons are like onions. For poor people. Just use metal spoon and buy a new pan after. :D
8.17 pepper pig is a she not a him
I can't believe he coming for Gordon...!!! Lol
Bruh the Lizzo jokes💀💀
Yea! Demon slayer!!!
Gordon is going vegan. I predict it will not last long.
"He's using metal on a nonstick pan because he can afford to replace it 100,000 times if he needs to 😂"
Best add i’v ever seen.
3:03 Uncle Roger is targeting every asian parent at this point
Uncle Gordon >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Jamie Olive Oil :)
Hahah if you ate a steak from an old ass longhorn like that you’d need a chainsaw to cut it
so fun to be toxic🤣🤣🤣
What the hell is cooking the eggs on the counter??? this is some kind of Gordon magic?
Did Gordon just say PEPPA pig HIMSELF
"Way too much seasoning, you won't taste the meat. He has a grill right there and he's pan frying? haiya......"
"A lot of people swear against using olive oil for steaks, but in my experience, olive oil gives the best crust."
Thanks for the tip
Yes
Gordon ain’t bashte the shteak tho…
"""And if you zoom in real close, you can see all the abortion clinics closing down"" - Uncle Roger 2022"
5:00 butter has higher smoking point than most other fats. Uncle Roger fail noob.
"UR.. so many  rich-people non stick pans are made with titanium, ceramics, laser etching and silicate coatings.. they are not sensitive to metal objects like teflon-fluorplastic coating. (titanium coatings can look rather similar)
sure GR can fuck up too. but he has so many years as a western chef.. reacting to him cook steak is kind of pointless. and your only point might have been mistaken, for all we know. 
please try to not sound like an idiot. your uncle title can have some prestige after all, but only if you treat it with the professionalism it deserves."
"Ahhhhhhh so close!  Using metal on non-stick pan, whatever it's available to pickup the eggs..... 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Isn't it pointless to review a world renowned chef...its given food will be good..we can only learn from them..
"Uncle Roger, when eating right away, cutting into it like that is just fine. Sure it makes it a little less juicy, but it being nice and hot from being just cooked is its own treat."
Drinking game: take a shot every time Gordon says “beautiful” while cooking.
Stunning as well. See you at the hospital
Using a metal spoon to get food out of a non stick to me is fine. Using it to cook is the cardinal sin and is punishable by death.
Uncle roger should watch Gordon Ramsey pad Thai video
Don't worry about the pan. Gordon includes the price of every pan in his dishes.
Nice asian hair cut  the extra bald line sharp you up
HAHAHAHA! Can't stop laughing!
"Uncle Roger : Spring onion, it’s my favourite ingredient 
MSG (Putting the left foot down) : Haiyaaaaaaaa!"
"Uncle Roger let the ""Don't turn her to early"" slide without a remark? You are slipping, Sir! 🤣 So many lost opportunities there...."
If your going to make an abortion joke at least make it funny.
"Oh my GAWD....   ""...you can all the abortion clinics shutting down!""   I just snorted my soda up my nose!  HAHA!!"
I like how Uncle Roger roasting Jamie Oliver even though I don't know who that is
Soon every bad chef will turn good out of fearful compliance to appease uncle roger.
Msg needs to sponsor uncle Roger's videos
gordon head is flat surface? that forehead has deeper valleys than grand canyon.
You should review Andy Cooks’s kimchi fried rice. It won’t disappoint.
fucking brutal dude. No uncle for the metal scrape. Damn. I get it. HILARIOUS episode too.
Probably about time you make a new character.  Getting a bit long in the tooth now.
"Peppa pig ""himself "" 
Now who's gonna tell Gordon that Peppa pig is 'her'🤷"
All that good work and gets denied for a metal spoon!!!
"I genuinely love how Uncle Roger is absolutely unafraid to criticize Gordon, or insult him, at the same level he’d insult anyone else. He never addresses Gordon as if he’s talking to a universally acclaimed renowned chef with 7 Michelin stars, but as if he’s looking over some random guy who just so happens to be pretty good at cooking stuff"
♥
♥
Omg! It is good marketing for Chef Gordan too! 😁
"@Alex he just joking about food, no problems lah :)"
"Uncle roger obviously knows a lot about cuisine and how to cook, I just think it’s hilarious the conviction he has when(or if) saying Ramsey does something “wrong”, even though he’s arguably the best/most famous chef in the world. 😂 😂 doesn’t get better than this."
Did he put the cooked steak back in the same cooling rack he had the raw steak on? Isn’t that unsafe food handling?
"Billboard companies pay gordon by the mile to place billboards on his forehead 

Can I get a EMOTIONAL DAMAGE for that?"
How many steaks did Uncle Roger cook? Lol
Me thinks he fucked up when he put olive oil into a cast iron pan over an open flame. Grape Seed oil would have been a better choice. Same with butter. Has to go in right at the end because at that heat it will burn in 5 seconds flat. Watch Matty Mathieson on how it’s done properly.
Lmao! Gordon doesn't give a fuck. He uses metal utensils on non-stick pans cos he never ever going to use them again 😂😂
I can feel the pain when someone use metal spoon on a non-stick pan. Next time use a wooden spoon instead.
As a farmer I got to say if the beef is really good you don't need to cover it up with all that crap!
Uncle Roger Review GORDON RAMSAY PAN
"*Uncle Roger has the power of roasting anybody without getting hated on, lol!*"
"@Uncle Roger, I have heard you say ""Auntie Helen"" on a great multitude of your videos.

I understand that the terms ""Auntie"" and ""Uncle"" are conferred if one's merit is positive, and if one's honor is present. 

I also understand the corollary. Such terms can be downgraded to ""Niece"" and to ""Nephew"" if one's merit becomes poor, and if one's honor is absent. 

Here are some reasonable questions. 

What positive merit has Helen achieved, with respect to the conferred title ""Auntie Helen""?  

Does ""Auntie Helen"" still demonstrate positive merit?

( to run away ) =
( negative merit )

If ""Auntie Helen"" ran away from your relationship, then is her honor still present?

( to run away ) =
( dishonor )

In my opinion, you should downgrade ""Auntie Helen"" to ""Niece Helen.""

Perhaps she deserves a demotion to the lowest rank possible, namely ""Boot Camp Helen."""
"That burning myth again... Black pepper is actually very heat resistant. When frying, the time you reach a temperature at which the pepper starts to burn, your meat has pretty much turned to charcoal already. When you put black pepper on a dish at the end, you do it for fragrance.

Btw., nowadays there are quite a few manufacturers of scratch resistant non-stick pans, not only the hex clad stuff. His pan might still be a scratch resistant one."
"I like to put some black pepper on the steak to cook and then some to finish for fragrance, but I really like black pepper."
"But Uncle Roger, I've seen Gordon cook steak before and he seasoned it with pepper before tossing it in the pan."
"Relax, Uncle Roger with the metal spoon in the non-stick pan.  Gordon is rich enough to just throw away the pan after the shoot.  🤣  Do you think he's going to do the dishes?  Haiyaa!"
"8:49 that's the deepest, most heartfelt FUIYooo i've heard from Uncle Roger."
Its past 1am so cant wotch but I already kno its FUIYOHH!!~~~
Wowowo you trying to  beef with my man Gordon this the third videos you insulted the greatest chef of all time
REACT TO MAKING IT BIG RAMEN PLEASE also I luv ur content :D
"Come on, you are going to pull uncle title for the pan?  Maybe he was going to replace it anyway?"
"I thought it was about the food Uncle Roger, not a metal spoon."
Every time that noise is made; an Asian mother is beating a child.
Put that bone on the plate...
Bro Gordon Ramsay is scared of uncle roger
"review  gordon, fred and gino adventures!"
uncle roger awsome video
"I've grown to hate European chefs saying ""Beautiful"" on cooking videos because of Jamie Oliver."
"it is fun to be toxic indeed, especially on your teammates"
9:05 metal on nonstick is creating forever chemicals that will stay in your body and will never ever ever ever leave. I wish I knew this sooner because now I got all those forever chemicals in my body. And people wonder why they have autoimmune and other chronic illnesses
@Matt NG that’s too funny I actually heard uncle Rogers voice at the end of your message
"But this time, when he use the spoon, it barely did anything. I think Uncle Roger is overeating this time. Just give him the Uncle title back, why so judgy, SO JUDGY?"
Think you’re being a bit harsh there. The very good pans can handle metal spoons nowadays.
笑嘻了
Uncle Roger therapy seem like good idea.
"""Olive Oil Okay""
Can't believe I hear that from Uncle Roger himself. Though I know the context, but hearing it myself is just wow"
The abortion joke crossed the line.
Fuiyoh uncle roger is just roasting Gordon for no reason even though he cooked steak very goodly......lol uncle roger is king on roaster just like msg king if flavour
"I suspect that Gordon Ramsey doesn't need to add any MSG, because he orders Asian take out so much between his videos, he sweats it back out when he molests his meats by hand. Don't let the metal on nonstick throw you off. He is only going to use it once and give it away."
"Alright GR... Where are you at...!
Uncle Roger has declined your Uncle title... Again
Respond Sire...!"
Absolutely loved this one keep it up
Uncle Roger I did not know that about the pepper. Thank you!!
You can do everything perfectly but if you mess up on amateur mistake then you shall get no uncle title
4:38 I DID NOT see that joke coming  🤣🤣🤣
At least Gordon Ramsay does a better job using the correct ingredients and methods compared to Jamie Oliver ^^'
uncle is roasting Gordon forehead...but uncle has ksi forehead
Biggest flat surface in the world is jamie oliver's seasoning drawer
Metal spoon on non stick pan I’d rather use my hand and burn it off
So..its a beautiful day outside..sound slike hes in Texas..he hss a grill..a cooks a ribeye in a damn pan? On the grill? Blasphemy! I grill almost every day. Never had pepper burn. Also.. A good cut of meat DOESNT need all that other shit on it. It just doesn't. That's what will end up burning if anything.
"Another shylily weejio soon, can't wait😆"
"VPN does not make your web browsing anonymous. It hides your network connections from your ISP, and exposes them to the VPN provider instead, so it is just shifting the exposure. The ""big tech"" tracking you are talking about is cookie-based, and use of a VPN has zero impact on this."
LMAO how did Gordon become a pro if he has to be correcred by Roger. . I think Godon is a lie now
Hello!
"so, are his ancestors  also steak specialists  ? Doubtful  : stick to asian cooking dude..."
8:20 I’m dead XDD
Man just one spoon-off-teflon-pan away from uncle title haiyaaa
waiting for Gordon's comment xD
"Say what you want about Texas longhorns Gordo, but nothing beats Alberta beef!"
"coffee on steak, then cooked on a pan on a grill. why not just put it straight on the grill? plus for such a recipe its the wrong cut of steak, should use a strip steak or something instead. cilantro bad ingredient for steak. for agreeing with most of gordans techniques you are now demoted to nephew roger"
Disappointed that there was no sorry children reference at 4:22
"olive oil hiyahh..
olive oil max temperature is 190–207°C, any higher and it goes past the smoke point and begins to break down and it ruins the flavour.
you want around 230–270°C to sear meat properly, use grapeseed, canola or peanut oil."
"In the Haiyaa pod a while back Nigel said that he wanted to start criticizing white people food (I am white, and if you get offended by the term white people, get help) and I am glad he started."
Is no one gonna talk abt uncle roger watching peppa pig 🤣🤣
"Please be fair and Review Jamie Oliver Cooking steak, maybe he can redeem himself or even claim the ""Uncle"" title.🤣😂😁"
Uncle roger I’m shocked. Olive oil for steak is not okay in so many levels. Burning point is far to low. Best to use is lard or butter.
never put msg on steak
And now we wait for Gordon’s comment!
"Uncle Roger, Guga Foods did a video recently where he added msg to all kinds of things, sounds like something you might enjoy. Might be refreshing after Auntie Helen's recent torture."
Justice for Gordon! Give him the uncle title!
uncle rogrt i respect you but dont judge a person without knowing them BTW you are the god at being toxic
坐标伦敦，我每次路过gordon ramsay的餐厅 朋友都要跟我说难吃不要进去😂😂……
Everything for Gordon is BEAUUUUUUUUUTIFUL🤦‍♂️🤣
Uncle Roger reacting to steak? That's a surprise
You didn’t mention that he put the cooked steak back on the rack and tray that held the raw steak.....   Ask Gordon if he is feeling sick after eating that...
Petition For uncle roger to review his grilled cheese
#UncleGordon nuff said
Haiyahh Uncle title not returned because of metal spoon. Why so petty? So petty!
"I felt the aircon outtake 
why isn't it common here in uk 😭"
Uncle Roger you literally missed the joke at the beginning of the video with the dry rub you could have referenced auntie Helen do you need a additional comedy writer because I can assist you
"I mean, yeah using a metal spoon on a non-stick pan is bad, but not bad enough to deny him the Uncle title. It's not like he caused a Hadron Collider disaster. Give him back his Uncle title."
Please watch Gordon Ramsay's pegao to see a true fuck up then read the comments
The Steak and Eggs is for the pack of wolves around the 6th hole.
pepper doesnt burn. there is moisture expended by the steak that prevents that from happening.
"As a Mexican, I can agree that lime improves everything."
Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
"Agree. Also, put a little MSG in your micheladas. Game changer!"
Agreed. Lime in Hispanic/Latin cooking is like MSG in Asian fare
And how much will this cost at his eatery? 300$! :p
"i never thought i would hear uncle roger say ""olive oil okay"""
"""Always cook on a beautiful flat surface"" *huh????*"
"Who HATES cilantro, use me as a like button!"
"you want the burnt crust also why his sunglasses so bright
...
thanks for letting us know"
"I'm from Texas, I eat eggs everyday and steak often, but I don't have time for all this. Looks good, but that's a heck of a time/ingredient commitment."
Peppy pig?? ^^
He looks homeless because all of his money goes to buying new non stick pans.
He probably has like 50 non-stick pans
Mmmm.auntie Esther …you wish uncle Roger 😉😁
Damn that uncle title is like getting a medal of honor lol
"Gordon almost got Uncle title without any f ups, until he scratched the non-stick pan with metal. Haiyaa, very dissapointing he f-ed up in the last second."
Gordon is rich so he must have a lot of pans. So he don't need to take care of his pans like us plebs
"When I hear that sound, I get the chill and sudden urge to take off my headset"
Uncle Rodger uses others for his success. Gorden Ramsey = real chef. Under Rodger= judging person. No wonder ex wife
"9:40 Good callback. I was thinking ""Maybe Gordon is using one of his metal friendly non-stick pans from the previous video"" but nope. 
FAILURE."
Bs; give him back the title!
"ofc Gordon knows how to cook a steak lol, he's a professional chef. I'm impressed you made this video interesting. The real funny fuck ups come when western chefs try to cook Asian food"
Coffee would burn too tho
"1.  I don't need a British man to cut my steak for me. Get a bigger plate.
2. Don't put so much shit on my steak and eggs. I'll take maybe a pinch of the green herbs. The rub can stay but the greens are too much. The steak is the star here.
3.  I'm gonna cut me a bite of steak and then dip it into the yolks and I don't appreciate having to disassemble my breakfast to eat it."
"Uncle Roger roast Gordon like Gordon roast his chefs

He got some balls, Asians are scary

Edit:
I'm a Malaysian so I know how Asians capable of"
It actually doesn't burn the pepper if you pepper your steak before cooking due to surface area. It just gets toasted beautifully. There are a few scientific videos\mythbusters style tests done on this
The Peppa Pig joke got me lmao
2:09 Life too short for technical bullsh*t 😂 My life moto now 😂😂😂

Uncle roger are you sponsored by -ex- uncle gordon's pan?
"When you've got Gordan Ramsey money, you can afford to replace good pans when you scratch them with metal spoons"
"Wow, I can't wait to see Nick DiGiovanni's next simp comment for Uncle Roger."
Hello uncle roger
牛逼牛逼牛逼！
This video so white
"uncle roger - good quality non stick pans can handle metal urensils with dull edge.
yay for technical advancements"
Uncle Roger .. Auntie Helen tell that MSG make ocra actually taste nice .. is this true?
Nvm Gordon Ramsay very rich. Can buy new pans. Haha.
"You joke, but they keep saying Planned Parenthood does so much more than just abortions... yet in response to restrictions in line with most other western nations (most countries don't allow abortion after 12 weeks), many ARE closing down...  It's almost like everything about Planned Parenthood profiting from and pushing abortions is true...  Which we always knew, given their focus on minority areas (regardless of economics), and the fact they were founded by racist eugenicists that wanted to eliminate those they saw as undesirable from the gene pool (read: minorities)."

That would be really dope if he got with Auntie Esther 😁😁😁

He’s just only joking:) he doesn’t actually mean it
6:11 what about auntie helen?
"Haiyaa! Why call crust??? Just call ""wok hay""!!! 😂😂😂"
Uncle Roger please review  chef Boy Logro he is a executive chef who formerly work for Princess Diana and Brunei Sultan. He is good please make a reaction video thank you... Im a fan from Philippines
"No Uncle title for Gordon Ramsay just because of metal to metal? You're being too harsh, Uncle Roger, the food look good. Gordon Ramsay deserves to get his Uncle title back."
"uncle roger, react the gugafoods . he is dry-aging steak with MSG!!!

*P.s i need to dive deeply and watch it xD"
@Return to Dreamcastle really?? Cant find it xD gotta dive more
Uncle Roger already made a video about that..
Gordon can't afford a hotel because he has to buy a new pan every time

Gordon has 25 tv shows so he can afford new a nonstick pan for every meal

"Right?  Even Uncle Roger says that when you are cooking to impress, you use the outdoor kitchen, if I remember correctly."
Next I want you to review Mukbangs.
Wow I didn't know uncle Roger watch anime
"Nigel I love you but no, you always do salt, pepper, and garlic powder on steak before you do any type of cooking. I know this, Guga knows this, hell even Nick knows this. You do not just ignore pepper on steak!"
I remember your first few videos to see you being successful puts a smile on my face
"*spoilers* I would say savage for the lost uncle title, but metal cutlery in a non-stick pan is a massive fuckup, even amateurs know this -  honestly I didn't think Gordon was capable of it, but that's close to a Jamie level fuckup.

Haiyaaa"
Should have been middle well
that sound!!!!
9:17 this is where gordon knows he fucked up
It looks like grilled meat Hispanic inspired. Cause in Mexico they add spring onions all the time to the grill. And it’s pretty common ingredient in native America. You’ll be surprised on how many ingredients people think it’s Asian or elsewhere but it’s actually Mexican too! Like sesame seeds.
Skip the commercial Haiya! 1:20
Ok but since when has Texas been a county?
"1. Did he actually explain that he was cooking the eggs in a hot pan using carryover heat? 
2. He rested his meat on the same rack that had the raw steak. Contamination HIYAAAAA."
Sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver’s future 😂🤣😂🤣 GENIUS !
Best steak i ever eaten cooked by korean woman...
Cilantro is a substitute for papalo and an inferior one. It’s more of a Vietnamese ingredient…
i did not know peppa pig was trans. thank you for telling me gordon.
This just reminds me of Uncle Roger in the pad Thai off with Uncle Josh: “Steak is most boring meal ever”.
Oh Mate! That Texas abortion reference killed me like a Republicans kills women.
"Jamie Oliver get roasted way too much... My guess is auntie Helen went with him actually, that's why uncle roger so salty"
Give Gordon Uncle Title.

Uncle Roger in 7 million subscribers ...can u cook the chicken in office ? Your 200k target was completed long time ago😗🙁
"Hello people of UK. :) Texas here! We  eat steak for dinner, not before. We do not eat eggs with steak. For breakfast, eggs and bacon. We do not flatten the steak! Blasphemy! Thick steak is preferred. Most want a juicy, medium rare, pink center. Longhorn cattle are heat resistant, not best for eating. Longhorn or Brahma are heat resistant cattle good for crossing to Angus to get robust cross bred meat cattle, but Angus are the absolute best quality meat cattle👌. Last, Gordon cooked more accessories than steak. It's like he didn't want to taste it. 

Tldr: we Texans watching this are repulsed. Gross... 😰 also nothing about it says Texas!"

Are you going to review auntie Esther on Iron Chef?
please do reaction for chef brian tsao fried rice
"Eh, this is a weird one. Western food is Gordon's arsenal so I think for this one, its way out of your league."
I’m always afraid that MSG on steak will burn. Maybe I shouldn’t be. It’s supposed to be stable in cooking though it can participate in a Maillard reaction.
i love how he acts like a pro chef but cant even cook like chef in real life
"Uncle Roger,  I think you were pushing for a reason to not give Gordon his ""uncle""... ;)"
"First that was not a Rib Eye off a longhorn, most likely black angus prime beef.  2nd Uncle Roger ya he's in the middle of no where in someone's back yard in case you didn't notice.  As to the Texas part speaking as a card carrying native son of the state, too much shit on the steak and no need for a pan you have a great grilling surface there.  As ofr onion nothing better than a thick chunk of Texas Sweet Onion, Beef Steak Tomato and Jalapeno grilled and put on the plate along with some candied jalapenos and eggs again too much kaka on them salt n pepper cooked in butter over easy please"
Waiting for Uncle Gordon to comment
You REALLY didn't give him back the Uncle title just because he used a metal spoon on a non-stick pan? That seems very unfair to me. That doesn't even have anything to do with the cooking or the dish itself. It's just a technical thing.
"The entire video is joke among friends, 😂 you are too literal."
All that good food ruined by soap flavored weeds
"Uncle Gordon made a beautiful, flavorful steak n eggs meal.  Maybe he didn't have a wooden spatula out on the golf course?"
Gordon is using carbon steel isn't he? Not nonstick?
Where do I get that rice cooker behind Roger?
what you got against texas
"You NEED to review ""Asian Pizza"" by Pink Guy ;)"

Uncle Roger suddenly gave Auntie Netflix an helping hand...Auntie Helen must be insecure by now!!
Yes Sir
Give nephew Gordon his uncle title or I’ll start a revolution
I would go to a Real Home grown Texan if I wanted a Texas Steak ...
"damn i was expecting a ""sorry children"" after the ""take it out on your children"" comment. sorry, children. i guess he's not really sorry lol"

Also i think pepper is totally personal preference, i liked cooked pepper taste"
"For real, the sound of that metal spoon in the non stick pan hurt not only me, but my ancestors 🤢 The opposite of ASMR!"
Love your videos uncle Roger keep up the good work and I hope you have a wonderful day 💓 everytime I watch your videos I say fuuiyoh
"""Life too short for technical bullshit""

Those are words to live by!"
I hope I work for Uncle Roger. Will make sure to use a metal spoon on a non stick pan lol.
"""Gordon's sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future""

*OHHHH 💀🔥🔥🔥*"
Gordon sounds out of shape. Heavy breathing.
It's a one time use throwaway pan Uncle Roger 😭
"Uncle Roger, you are old as hell. That non-stick pan is of the new technology. The new technology allows metal utensils. 😂"
When he was salting for who ever gets it and knows how it’s possible but I could literally smell it after he finished salting it! And it smelled really f good and also I haven’t eaten breakfast and so not sure if this is why.
I truly mean this
whats the difference between spring onion and green onion?
Spring onion is bigger
"Uncle roger - ""life too short for technical bullshit"""
"In the outtakes, did Uncle Roger imply that he wants Auntie Esther to touch his meat??"
Everything went well until the metal spoon part. Alamak!
"NO GORDON YOU WERE SO CLOSE
you just had to use Metal On The Non-Stick pan"
"I'm and Air Conditioning and Heating technician in the US (HVAC Technician). It drives me insane how British and European people refer to the equipment I work on as AirCon. It simultaneously sounds pretentious and reductive. 

A.C. just call it A.C."
"I'd take Uncle Gordan's advice on making steak over Uncle Roger. Sorry, Uncle Roger."
"Not even two minutes in and already there's a problem:

Longhorns are *not* the best cattle anywhere in America. Not anymore, anyway.

They are hardy and survive very well without a lot of care - that's why they were the cattle of choice during the cattle drive days.  But they're also sort of lean, not great marbling no matter how they're raised.

There's better choices today than longhorns. Just look at the most common beef cattle raised in the U.S. today: Angus (either black or red or ""Brangus""), Charlais, Simmental, and Hereford.

I'm still trying to figure out which county that steak allegedly looks like. Live Oak? Jim Wells? Jasper? Maybe Brazos county if you turn it upside-down and use a little imagination..."
"Probably not live oak or Jim Wells, the grass looks too green and the water is too clear, and he doesnt look like hes dying of heat.. I'd say further north and probably closer to Dallas, Houston, or even Austin area.."
"What does uncle Roger know about Texas cuisine?! Cultural appropriation!!!!

Btw, I can’t wait to see you when you come to Dallas Nov 18! 😍"
Just cause metal spoon was used you don't give him the uncle title? Too strict :(
"When this video started I was like, 'We're just reviewing Gordon's western steak to give him maximum chance of regaining Uncle title, aren't we?'
When this video finished I'm like, 'Oh, so we just did a review just so we can slam his metal spoon on nonstick usage, right?'
So we now know two things 1) someone clearly effed up equipping the Texan outdoor kitchen set and 2) I didn't have enough faith in Uncle Roger's level of pedantry and I won't even say sorry about it, because I have no shame. Thinking Uncle Roger was gonna do a whole video just to be nice to his friend. What's wrong with me...?"
"There is a great place for you to review Uncle Rodger which serves Indian Food. It’s in Orlando and called, “Taste of Punjab.” PLEASE review this place! They don’t have a YouTube channel but if you could find a way to review it I would appreciate it."
An Uncle Roger video without much roast is like asian stores without MSG. 🥴
"Not bad not bad uncle roger! Nigel like living here also ... Auntie Helen is very good in bed because i know
...."
Uncle Gordon.... I'm mean Gordon has failed again! 😔
Need more content with Auntie Liz and her peanut allergic husband
"Hilarious to me that Nigel basically berates anyone for even using a single ingredient or hell even the right ingredient at the wrong time in any Asian dish - but this abomination of a Texas Steak with multiple things just completely slide despite being absolutely wrong.
Either it's okay to try different stuff and experiment with flavors and substitute or it's not. Of course, this dude knows nothing about Texas cooking, though. So, it's to be expected."

Never fails to make us laughh ... What a guy !! Love ya man .. PS Gordon didnt deserve the uncle title😂😂
He get used to his own pan already lah🤣
Why is it that no one has said anything about Gordon cooking with an open flame in Texas but is using a frying pan? Blasphemy!!!
"Best damn meal ever, but metal spoon!"
"Haiyaa,metal spoon on non-stick pan
                  Almost uncle title

Peppa Pig is not a him
"Petition to please have Uncle Roger reverse the decision and give Gordon the uncle title back. Come on, just cause of a spoon? He cooked that really well."
Uncle Roger need to react to Pro chef brian tsao egg fried rice! Should give him uncle title already!
Those are Gordon Ramsay brand nonstick pans. They were made to be able to use metal utensils.

"Gordon cooked the eggs with the steak. This is too early. That's why he didn't have time to rest the meat. 

I assume he did this for the camera. Cameras don't care if their steak rests. 

The reason for not putting MSG on steak is that Gordon is crippled. He, like most Westerners, can't taste MSG. It is a sad thing. Worse than losing an arm. Maybe we should start a Go Fund Me for him?"
Pls do only fan uncle

Holy shit.  Uncle Roger is still making videos?  I thought that joke ran its course.
6:32 does he say tits on the eggs?
I'd actually like to argue that using metal spoon on nonstick pan actually made the dish more authentically american. Because we don't really get taught not to do that here and what's more american then absent mindedly doing something dumb that will cause the rest of the world pain?

"Gordon shouldn't have spoiled peppa pig for unle Roger, he's only on season 2! haiiyyaaa"
Uncle roger is being too hash on rating Gordon uncle title just because he uses metal spoon 🥄 on non stick pan but he did everything else perfectly.🤣

So the only criticism is nothing to do with the food. You're reaching a bit here.
I wanna see uncle roger cook the chef reaction videos.

Any idea which sunglasses (model + brand) Gordon's wearing?
Also brighter than Guy Fieris hair
Uncle Roger Thirstier than usual
It’s funny how Gordon Ramsay used to hate vegetarians and now he’s going vegan. Uncle Roger isn’t gonna like that
Gordon's sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver's future... EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!!
You are wrong UR.  Unless you are cooking over direct heat you can't burn the pepper.  The steak would be burned as well at that point.
3:05 every Asian parent ever 😂
Uncle Roger is an express VPN fuckboi as he has been sponsored by them multiple times :D
Uncle Roger I just found out that the sell MSG at a supermarket next to me I will try it in my cooking.
America has Waygu/Black Angus hybrids. Far tastier than Texas Longhorns.
EVERYONE DO NOT CLICK THE LINKS IN YOUR REPLIES ITS A SCAM JUST LOOK AT THEM DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAME LINK THAT  LOOKS LIKE A YOUTUBE URL BUT IS NOT DO NOT CLICK IT REPORT THE USER AND JUST DON'T CLICK IT
I thought Olive oil can’t be used on heat that high
Boo on YouTube for blackhead removal commercial interrupting Gordon’s cooking.
Uncle Gordon is super rich so he don't mind scraping non-stick pan with metal spoon 🤣
"I think he still deserves the Uncle title, he probably knows about metal on non-stick pan but does it anyway because they're probably throwing everything away after that video."
Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
Ratio + k-pop better🤳🏼🤳🏼🤳🏼🤓🤓🤓🤓
@Robert Pruitt is teflon an edc? just curious
"Thank you to the ppl who replied to my question btw, i just saw em"
@Shannon Garrett yea Nigel is weird about Teflon and metal. Like the pan is useless if a spoon touches it once. How silly
Coffee on steak. YIKES. sorry that's disgusting. Also where MSG? Haiya!
Uncle Roger is so hilarious.
Gordon is so rich he uses pans like paper plates
"You think Gordon cares about scratching pans? He probably only uses each pan once, throws it away and buys a new one."
"Life is too short to say ""marbling"" and instead choose to say ""steak with lot of fat""? Hiyahhhhhh"
It's so easy to scam people these days jut tell everyone you need a vpn even though anyone can break through a vpn because your time settings on your device will not match up with the vpn server settings

"So fun to be TOXIC !
Uncle Roger - Jul 17, 2022"
Gordon always sounds out of breathe.
"At the peppy pig part I was like:

I thought we were cooking steak not pork. 😂"
msg on a steak is a complete game changer. everyone should try it
Gordon-“look what happened to the stake.” Uncke roger-“what happen to de stake? Stake gonna get cooked”
@mrnigelng Glen mentioned you on his old cookbook show.
The steak was actually rested - you can tell but Uncle Roger fuc&3d up. Videos are edited of course and timings are not accurate hiyaaaaaa
What happened to the steak? Is he a magician? He made the effing thing disappear!
Brighter then olive oil future lmao 🤣🤣🤣
The power of gordon ramsay will break against insult uncle Roger.
WE NEED A GORDON AND UNCLE ROGER SPECIAL!!!!!!!!!
"i've been wondering, did uncle roger used to be a chef before? (someone explain pls)"
it's not uncle roger without the roast of jamie oliver😂
"Do you strictly use MSG when seasoning steak, or do you mix it with salt? I'm adopting the MSG lifestyle, as my mother used it before she passed away, and her cooking was so much better than my own. Mine has been adopted by my government as a method of torture for suspected terrorists. Keep on making us laugh, Unc, and we'll keep watching!"
Commenting on Ramsay's cooking techniques is reaching far and kind of pointless
That stake needed about 20 more minutes of cooking. He also forgot the ketchup.
Now do the grilled cheese
No title just because metal spoon...😭😂
Waiting for that Nick guy to comment
Waiting for Gordon to comment here and reacts abt the reaction video
You need to go easy on Gordon!
You can send me one of those pans uncle Roger lol
Olive oil???? Really??? For steak?
"Gordon did so well, but fuck it up when he used metal spoon on non-stick"
Man really looked at a steak and said “you can see all the abortion clinic closing down” I’m so done 😂
is netflix Parasite nice? korean horror right?
Haiya uncle roger I can't eat properly because of braces
"Well..

1. Don't use Olive oil
2. Use a thicker steak
3. Dry brine the steak a day before cooking
4. Rest for at least 10 minutes after cooking

And a few other minor things, but all in all, an alright steak I guess."
Dang my boy Gordon was out of breath!
Fuiyoh!!
"2:46 guga always put pepper before cooking steak, and even garlic powder"
"Uncle Roger knows that texas people's do not like Asians...
So he's avoiding to roast them..
Because if he did they will haunt him..
As a Asian we can vouch for that.."
Uncle Roger the only one who can make Gordon smile with insult
Uncle Roger is on white people mode
I think Gordon Ramsay had Oow Word
actually gordon pan not like other pan it can use metal spoon
I thought Uncle Roger is mainly about reviewing asian food?
"Uncle Roger, you should also see BBQ Mountain Boys"
"3:04 ""If you can't afford therapy, just take it out on your children-"" NEVER BEEN SO TRUE IN ASIAN FAMILIES"
"I think you are too harsh on this one. He didn't treat his kitchenwear perfectly, but he did everyhing else 100% perfectly."
"They probably bought those pans explicitly for this video, then will throw them away after."
"In the next vid he will probably be in  
 the upside down"
"Uncle Roger, aside from that ""Haiyaa "" thing, learn to.say this, ""You're so ""Lutang"", even say ""are you ""Lutang""?"
Gordon's sunglass is brighter than Jamie Oliver future... - I literally burst my heart laughing after hearing this
"oh well, a western chef not messing up a western dish, not really impressive..."
Uncel roger watches demonslayer oh my
Didn't you hate steak
"uncle roger totally roasted peppa pig this time, I am on floor now,
dying laughing"
Peppe pig is a girl no such thing as Peppa pig HIMSELF Haiyaa
But that’s not Asian … 🤔
914 th
"This is how you called ""Lutang""
Means floating or afloat in English, specifically in Filipino slang, it is used buy people on themselves or others who were in a state of frivolity or their lack of organization. This related by involving mistakes taken in actions, communication and even more like not answering the questions properly and lack of focus"
Good no abortion clinics in Texas!!!
Also continues roasting Jamie Olive oil Fuiyohhh
"Uncle is the one always yelling,annoying and have weird hobbies.Gordon is to up to be that uncle."
Was waiting on the next uncle roger video!
"'Peppa Pig himself'

holup
*holup*
HOLUP"
THE ONLY REASON OF GORDON NOT GETTING THE TITLE BACK- AHHSHVHSFHSJ it hurts doesnt it
"that comment of the metal spoon in pan, you are really trying very hard not to give full marks to gordon.."
But using a metal spoon in a coated pan is an actual crime. I would have had a show in my face should I ever try it
"‘Gordon's sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver future’

Uncle Roger 2022"
Gordon gets an A for AVERAGE right there
"Uncle Roger, about Jamie, black brighter than his future"
When Auntie Esther moves in he'll have to pony up the money for an a/c.
"Thing to remember:
In cooking shows, the chefs DO NOT OWN the cookware. It’s either owned by the production studio or given to the studio by a product placement sponsor.
In either case, the chef is under no obligation to be delicate with the cookware. Especially when they’re demonstrating a technique, which is more important than tool care.
So there’s no real point in having an anxiety attack when a “sleb chef” uses metal on nonstick. It’s not that they don’t know not to do that, it’s that they don’t really care. It’s not their pan.
Of course, when a “sleb chef” who originated on social media like YouTube or TikTok does it, we can go after them all we want. Because they’re *supposed* to know better and *supposed* to care."
@Elephant Song fax
"Its not always about $ but about doing things the right way.Also,teflon scrapes shouldnt be an added ingredient to your recipe"
things to not overthink
r/whoosh
"@uncle roger. I got an objection on this video. 
1. Is that the video Gordon made is 1 year ago of May so keep that in mind. 
2. Is that he was not using that brand he always use because he is not partnered with HexClad until of July 21st of last year 2 months later before he made this video. At his defense he deserves that uncle title so give him another chance, plus he is known to recover from bad situations in the kitchen. Give him another chance"
Note to any aspiring chefs if you want to impress uncle roger your plating game has to be as on point as your cooking.
Uncle Roger can you review Uncle Gordon burger recipe?
"“And if you look closely you see all abortion clinic close down”
💀💀💀"
🤣 you funny as fuiyah 😂🤣😂🤣❤️💯
Wow no uncle title just for the metal spoon! Wow this is harder to get than a Michelin star!
Best creator on YouTube.
6:14 *EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!*
Maybe the nonstick pan was a gift from Jamie oliver
Uncle Roger watches Parasite? I knew I liked him for some reason.
"To be fair, almost all of Texas is the middle of nowhere."
= ;
"I would love to see uncle roger make video with Jamie oliver.
Uncle Roger will either tie Jamie up and pour msg down his throat or teach him how to cook Asian food properly"
:( when will gordon redeem himself 😭
conceptualize Gordon as a british monarch flavour shaman
"Talking about black pepper burning. That rub with paprika is going to burn before black pepper. But that depends if you cook it dumb HOT, like you should or not."
I feel olive oil is so misused and overhyped  these days 😒
Fuyyooo..
"Fun to watch roger react to ""sous vide "" everything channel. Msg steak dry ageing.  I try a lot of their steak recipes they like and they are fantastic.  Between the peanut butter steak and the wendys baconator compound butter steak...  Cant pick my favorite."
"Actually, some higher-end nonstick pans are tolerant of using metal utensils. The _Gotham Steel_ pans sold in the USA are one example of this."
uncle please forgive gordon for metal spoon
😍❤️👊🏻
Aunty Helen who 😆
I like to be toxic to 😂😂.....oo..u are best uncle Roger
“That’s Peppa Pig himself” Peppa Pig is now the biggest Trap now
This was awesome video!!!! Gordon Ramsay please don't mention Peppa Pig again 😂🤣😂🤣 you made my daughter disappointed. All she heard was Peppa and came running just to find out it just steak and eggs.
"I thought this was way too much of a softball for Gordon to get Uncle title back, until the end lol"
Gordon sun glasses so shiny brighter than Jammy Oliver's future 😂😂😂😂
I think Uncle Roger is jealous of uncle roger
"Haiyaa Uncle Roger, you told us that steak is the most boring dish ever just slab of meat. But now you reacting to Gordon making steak"
Uncle Roger a laugh a minute rice!🤣
😆😆😆😆
uncle roger running out of idea to the point he started reacting to foods that are not asian-related
"you've got it wrong :D it's not pepper that you doesn't want to put on the steak before cooking, that's salt :D....so you both, even Gordon got it wrong"
"""If you cant afford therapy, then just take it out on children.""

Oh man"
"Come on Uncle Roger. You had to judge Uncle Gordon cooking Tex Mex style steak in an Asian lens that you couldn't give him his Uncle Title back all because of ""metal spoon in non stick pan""????"
No K-pop group reference this video 🤣
"huh? Peppa Pig is pork, steak is beef? fail"
"Gordon Ramsay: ""no one can insult me""
Uncle roger ""and i took it personally"""
it pain everyone's heart that gordon made such a mistake to use metal on non-stick
I was shocked he didn’t get roasted for using olive oil to the point it was smoking🤨
"When nephew buy uncle Roger air conditioning?
So stingy..Hiiyaaaa"
It's really unique to see Uncle Roger approving white people food for the first time ngl
Why is Uncle Roger commenting on WHITE people food? 😮
Ramsay misgenders Peppa Pig!
11/10
Gordon cooking really good uncle Roger need to find something else to roast him
For real now..
Teflon is a major cause of pfas in our bloodstream. By scraping the pan it exposes the material to your food. So not only does it hurt your ancestors feelings it's actually quite hazardous. Cheers.
"Should have said ""sorry children"" after ""just take it out on your children."""
XD yeah
"9:18
  that sound is my mom's worse nightmare and mine too cuz when she hear it she beat the fuck out of me 😂"
Early
"You hear metal spoon scraping, I hear my mom yelling"
"Take out on children.
That explains Asian parents.
Stainless steel pans are more durable since there’s not a coating to be concerned about protecting."
The PA who was in charge of setting up Gordon's utensils for the shoot: *sweating nervously*
I didn't think I'd be seeing some o chem in an uncle Roger video.
This getting old bruh lmao
"Why are gorden glasses so shiny there shinier than Jamie Oliver future
Uncle Roger - 2022
 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
That abortion joke was spot on.
"I use wooden spatula  always with nonstick, you use metal, you gonna give yourself cancir."
Most over complicated version of steak and eggs. Why so fancy?
"This is a pretty bullshit video. Gordon's technique is basically flawless (which is expected as Gordon is cooking things he is an expert in), which means there is no real material for comedy. And Uncle Roger's comment about pepper is simply wrong. The most common rub on a steak is salt + pepper (+garlic powder). Watch Guga or Josh Weissman or basically anybody who actually cooks steaks regularly if you don't believe me. The original premise of these videos (fried rice cooked by non-Asian people) was good for comedy. But there is literally no humor in this video that is original. Uncle Roger needs new material."
3:42 - if you look close you can see all of the abortion clinics shutting down. ::DEAD::
Isn't this the first time uncle roger review western food?
Haha come 2 think of it heck yeah maybe that will be his 7 million special plans
Uncle Roger is the type of madlad who would review and rate the world's most renowned chef
"So fun to be toxic.

- Uncle Roger. 2022"
"Feel bad for all those pretentious stupid fakery comments, replies, and links on genuine channel vids just for baits. I've always reported them on the very first second whenever i saw them. Simply pathetic."
Aaaay uncle roger a real one for watching papa pig
Always love the video on Gordon.
HE WAS SO CLOSE TO GREATNESS
best gordan ramsey video
Ramsay still uses to much salt going to give people heart attack.
Gordon thinks peppa pig is a boy?
Somebody start a gofundme for uncle roger to get his own place with AC away from nephew Nigel... if that’s possible? 🤷‍♂️
"Gordon deserved the uncle title, dammit!!!"
uncle roger u should react to dishes eaten by gordon ramsay on kitchen nightmares.

I'm an idiot sandwhich and even I know that."
"""never put pepper on steak before cooking""

pepper doesnt burn. there is moisture expended by the steak that prevents that from happening.

I just love uncle roger..
"when uncle roger say tex-mex i thing of something that rymes with tex

Too much green on it that’s all your really going to taste
Any time now Gordon gonna reply back and Uncle Roger reply back and them 100K likes and hundred comments.
"If you look closer, you can see all the abortion clinics closings. Savage as hell, Uncle Roger!🤣🤣🤣 Gordon and Texas can't get a break from Uncle Roger. 😂😂"
in 7 million he should make a video where gordon ramsay critics his dish instead of the other way around
Howtobasic vs Gordon Ramsay.
Nephew Nigel needs to get off his ass and get air con how doe he expect to impress aunti Esther.

Closing down! Yes! 😆
"26 years in Texas, never once encountered a steak like this. But wouldn't mind if he shared the recipe."
"@Steven Not with coffee grounds and seasoning on a steak. And steaks are always best grilled, not in a pan, even if it's cast iron."
"@Steven Not that way. He didn't cook them ""Texas"" style. I mean, where's the hot sauce?"
"@Steven Not the steak and eggs, the steak and eggs with green onions, cilantro and lime. Definitely not Tex Mex.

If want Tex Mex, he should make a pork chop, refried beans and potatoes. Elevate that. 😉"
How have you never had steak and eggs before? It's an American thing.
"He's in Texas, yet cooked in a cast iron skillet OVER an open fire. Just throw it on the grill."
Just cause Gordon Ramsay touched the steak and didn't let it cool on camera doesnt mean he didnt let it do it off camera. Gotta cut to the good parts for the video.
uncle Roger should review Doobydobap’s ramen
"Rubbish recipe, “beautiful flat surface” lol"
Very nice
Love the humor😂
"I have to admit my guilt, I use MSG on cheap chuck steaks. But only after cooking while they rest. However, baking soda before cooking makes cheap chuck steaks tender."

Uncle Roger - you are doing so well in your tours - I am sure you can afford air-cond :)
"Nooo, why would you ruin a marbled steak like this with the unnecessary spices and overcook it T.T"
"@alexander cornelius if you think that color is medium to well done, then I can't change your mind. Ask anyone else, and they will agree that it's medium-rare.

Again, don't understand what you mean by ""after-effect""?

The color doesn't change if it's not cooking. A steak does not have the color of medium-rare, if it is actually well-done. That's....just not how that works, lol. 

Please explain how a steak can look a lot less cooked than it actually is?

If it looks medium-rare, then it's medium-rare. Not well-done. I'm very confused by your logic."
"@LuckyOwl777 I'm going to skip the assumptions you made about the things I said, which I think are very good natured and my offer still stands 😁. The pink color is medium to well done. If that's what you like, you do you. The after effects is making it look a lot more medium/rare. Considering the consistency of the colors, it's rather on the well done side of things imo. 
Edit: grammar and spelling"
"@alexander cornelius It is fine on it's own. And it's also fine with different flavors on it. The fact that you're bringing up things that don't relate to what you were originally talking about is funny. Reaching for things to argue about.

It's not overcooked. How can the steak be overcooked but pink? You want it pink in the middle. That literally tells you it hasn't been overcooked. You ever cook steak before? I'm also confused when you are talking about the ""color-grading of the after effects"". don't know what you mean by that.

Also, love the little jabs you're doing now. ""I like how much you're invested in this"". Says the person who also keeps coming back and replying, lol. Yeah...becuase what you're saying makes no sense. You're make contradicting statements, lol. 

How is the steak overcooked? Again, look at it. It is clearly pink. How is it being pink not a good thing? You're just stating things without explaining anything. Again, it's not that thin of a steak. It's flattened out to cook evenly, like I previously said. 

Your arguments has now become ""it could be overcooked easily"". Ok? That's not even true. But even if it was, it wasn't. overcooked. The possibility doesn't mean it happened, lol

edit: dumb spelling"
"@LuckyOwl777 I like how much you're invested in this. I would invite you to my place to try it the right way 😁. The thing is, there is not a lot of beef flavour left after being overcooked with the spices... It's pink, and that isn't a sign it's good. The way it looks, depends alot on the color grading of the after effects,  considering how long it took on the barbecue. I think it has been ruined, because it's very easy to overcook a thin stake. Also, steak itself has beautiful flavour, no need for additional herbs: it's fine on its own"
"@alexander cornelius Again...look at it, lol. You're supposed to flatten it out. That makes it cook evenly. Has nothing to do with how much you cook it. You don't need to measure the internal temperature to see that it's not overcooked, lol. Open you eyes and look at it. It's still very pink inside. What are you looking at?"
Hello aunties
A single metal spoon ruined uncle rogers mood
Eda
"6:14
You used this about a minute and 34 seconds later than you should have.

Gordon's forehead is wrinkly. Kinda uneven"
This is Gordon working for an American audience. In the UK we can cut steaks ourselves.
"Gordon has already shown he has lots of pans. they mean nothing to him, he uses them and abuses them and he is done, because he has the money for more. that's how he can afford to have someone haul his gear to nowhere. the rest of us need to save our money

to paraphrase: Gordon is so successful he doesn't care about metal on non stick anymore."
"@ʝaռ.ĸyυ the video is a joke, but his criticisms are real."
"@SeraphsWitness 

Just a joke"
The teflon tho 😰
"The risk of damaging a non-stick pan with a metal spoon like that is basically zero. The technology has come a long way, I don't know why Roger is so weird about it."

Overcooked. Only for Americans. It is a pity to turn this magnificent steak into charcoal.

@Xander Leighton that's even worse oh no
I myself wasn't even watching the series in order.
I got 2 more seasons to watch
"oh shit, i was only on season 5...."
Maybe he's spoiling that Peppa is transgender or something.
Good
Uncle Roger and Steak. Win.
"C'mon Gordon, don't use the metal spoon."
I'm buying the ExpressVPN promo lol
Why does Gordon think his chopping board that he cracks his eggs on is “beautiful”?
"good quality non stick can handle gentle use of metal utensils. not saying whisking in the pan, but putting a spoon in there to serve is fine."
"steak? this is not even asian XD
haiyaaa... 1 minute in the video and uncle roger already fucked up. marbling not the same as lot of fat. marbling describes when the fat runs in thin veines throughout the meat, a lot of fat could also be like big white spots in the mea tthat taste like sticky goo. disgusting.
i was actually waiting for the ""sorry children"" for that comment XD

come one uncle roger, give him that title back. Destryoing a non-stick pan has nothing to do with the flavor or the result of the dish. he has more money as god. he can just discard every non-stick pan after one day of use

why you think his food so expensive. because the cost for a new non-stick pan is included already :D"

"Hi, Uncle Roger. Here Auntie Consuelo, from Spain. Good job, good job. You made me laugh! 🤣🤣🤣."
"You have to rest a stake like that or you lose all the juices from the steak, So a basic mistake and does not deserve the title Uncle."
"also at 4:39

Me : "" WHERE THE EMOTIONAL DAMAGE MEME
           WHERE IS IT?

You need to review Guga foods
"Usually india gets everything late but now we got demon slayer s2

Im eating egg fried rice rn"
After he has beaten that thin it’s a minute at most on each side.
He had pans thar are non-stick that you can use metal spoons or spatulas. They are expensive.
Actually coffee and chili rubs are quite popular now Uncle Roger. You need to check with Uncle Guga on this!  😁
Don’t worry uncle roger I’m also on season 2 on peppa pig 😂 do u want to binge watch peppa pig with me sometime 😉 😂 🤣……..
HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA..
How is uncle roger not canceled yet 😭
someone needs to tell him you can use metal on most nonstick pans now lmao.
"I feel kinda bad for Gordon now. He did such a great job on the food, but didn't get the uncle title just 'cos he plated it up with a metal spoon. 😔

Great video, though. Funny as always. 😆"
@Abhishek Pasker It's not really a small mistake though…
"Agreed.....One small mistake cost him his Uncle Title, haiyaa  just give him back the title"
Uncle Roger Be Like a King Out Here damn
Bros can insult anyone.
Uncle Roger how you doing mf 🤣 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤

Hey Uncle Roger can you f*ck the adds same way you f*ck Jaime Oliver?

"""Never put pepper on steak before cooking because pepper burn too easily."" - Uncle Roger 2022

meanwhile in Miami: Guga sweats in black pepper"
@Chris Gault yeah pretty sure Uncle Roger doesn't know about it
pepper doesnt burn. there is moisture expended by the steak that prevents that from happening.
I thought he'd use Aespa song at 2:10
Send it back to him alright rofl :D :D
I want to see Uncle Roger making beef wellington for 7 mil. Punishment for not giving Gordon his uncle title back
How many joke writers does Uncle Roger have on staff?  There is no way that he comes up with all of those great one-liners in every video all by himself.
"He's a comedian, lol. It's kinda his thing"
"Omg Uncle Rogers burn 🔥 of Texas:

“[rib-eye steak] look like Texas. And if you zoom in real close, you can see all abortion clinic shutting down.” 😂 😭 Funny, but not funny. 😫 🥩"
@3:47 pure gold!
"Nigel is just educating himself on every cuisine out there. Before, it was just chinese/malaysian, then it became Asian cuisine, now it even western food. 卧槽,  好厉害!!"
"@The Invisible Woman steak and cutlets are in particular common dishes in the west. Yes, steak might not be prominent in only western cuisine. But, steak to the general public is considered western cuisine"
@The Invisible Woman https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_cuisine
@Onigiri lol steak is not a western food and Asia and Europe are not the only other part of the world that exists.
@The Invisible Woman Steak is a  western food. East asian do not eat beef in the ancient times because of Buddhism. Mongols don't make beef into steak.
"Don't burn the pepper, but yea lets burn all the other spices"
"Those other spices don't burn as easily, lol. They weren't burnt. Pepper would have burned like crazy and tasted awful. Different spices react differently to heat...."
Uncle Roger really is the only person who can insult Gordon without being hated by him
Are you okay uncle roger😅😅
"As a Texan, Gordon knows shit about cattle.  Longhorns don't have near the marbling as cattle like Angus"
"Gordon : puts bread on uncle roger's ears
Uncle roger : haiiyaaa why you waste bread I not idiot sandwich"
Love that you don't shy away from jokes of certain subject matter 🤭

Liked and commented
So uncle roger why are you reviewing   western food your conten should be reviewing  asian dishes.
Here for Peppa Pig jokes.
fuiyoh
i see his video under 30 min
oh shit da first tim
8:16 HIMSELF?! I THOUGHT PEPPA PIG WAS A GIRL
"Everything was great until he said
""you get the spoon"""
Egg
Another banger video!
"Uncle Roger you're praising burnt smoked paprika and burnt coffee on a steak. Also olive oil is the wrong oil to use cooking ANY and EVERY steak. Those onions are crudely cooked too. And why use a cast iron skillet when there's direct heat from the charcoal underneath?! Because Gordon doesn't do the washing up, hiiiiiya...."
"Uncle Roger forgets, Gordon using some other fool's pan, so he doesn't give a shit about the metal spoon as it's not his problem ;)"
"Pretty sure this reaction is solely to tease Gordon. I can imagine Gordon watching this reaction, building hope to get uncle title again, then shattered by the fact he used metal spoon on non-stick pan."
"When ""sorry children"" became ""hello aunties"" lol"
"Godon: Its a cooking show , You do have definitiv a head problem - or co.ain? Nobody normal hops up and down  and trows its arms in ridicoulus angels. Get as old as You are - You are not 15."
"uncle roger , uncle nick like chicken breast when he make his fried chicken , remove his uncle title now"
Just give gordon a tittle 😂
Gordan did so good but messed up at the end.
Wait. You mention pepper can burn yet nothing about him slathering it in paprika which will burn worse than pepper.
Take it out on your children?  Not funny!
😂😍🤣
"Aunty Helen who? 
LOL"
a darck cave is briter then jamie olivers future

Gordon's sunglasses brighter than Jamie Oliver's future ☠☠🤡🤡

"I know Gordon probably keeps himself busy, but we NEED a collab"
Not sure we want these two in a room together.
"Poor gordon
He is so close to get back his uncle title"
Nephew Michael likes egg fried rice videos bettah.
4:40 emotional damage!
"Uncle roger is beneath gordon and jamie oliwer. That is why until today, both of them dont give a fuck abt him."
There Was Absolutely NO Marbling In That Steak😂😂😂
"So a metal spoon robbed gordon of the uncle title, lol"
"Uncle Roger: No need for technical term
Also Uncle Roger: Maillard Reaction"
At least Gordon Ramsay glasses has brighter shade than jamie olive oil future and crumbling restaurant
no uncle title 😅
"Uncle Roger know's Gordon deserves the uncle title, that's why he has much higher standard for him and one mistake cost him the title."
Bro was forcing some jokes ngl
Never fails to make me laugh
That steak does look like nice but I'd rather cut it myself
Somehow Uncle Roger is more strict with Gordon Ramsay don't you think so 😂😂
Now we wait and see if Gordon comments on this weejo.
peppa pig hahaahhaaaa
Uncle roger reviewing non-asian food?! Impossible.
It’s just so funny when uncle Roger makes fun of Jamie Oliver
"Uncle Roger, I think Gordon knows to rest a steak  lol. We just didn’t see it with editing"
My favorite moment was Nigel's reaction when Gordon says suited and booted. Face says he knows it was funny but can't think of joke.

"I'm gonna call an audible here. I feel like the Uncle title is well deserved. I know metal on non-stick is a pretty big offense, but everything else was pretty much perfect. Gordon is such an unknown, upcoming chef. Cut him some slack, he needs the exposure."
"@Shadowstrike strike Irony is new to you , is it?"
"Unknown upcoming chef? This is Gordon Ramsay, he's world famous and has been for a very long time. He had the title and lost it and is being a good sport about it. Uncle Roger became famous by insulting and judging people like him. He made up the uncle title and he'll give it when he wants to. Most of the viewers were waiting for him to mess up anyway, since he scraped the pan uncle roger had a reason to not give him the title and make the fans happy and laugh."
Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
"@Brooklyn Ann Yeah, that would make sense if that was the video in question."
D-did you see how he fucked up so badly on making ramen? He deserved losing his title for that.
Uncle Roger is kinda asian version of davie504.. 😆

Auntie Helen: Uncle Roger need to stop looking up Auntie Helen personal information...
Why Gordon can cook egg by putting the pan in a plate. 6:04
"I can tell you the herb choices are very odd for steak and eggs… he kinda killed the crust with the herbs and dry rub, it won’t be near as crisp~ and the scallion, cilantro and lime will overpower the complexity of the steak with that beautiful rub.

The bed of onions are good, and I love a good sunny side up egg."

Gordon not gonna use that pan again so its ok to use metal spoon

Here finally https://youtu.be/8-nTxSt1-c8
It’s not like he’s going to use that same pan in his next cooking. That pan would be in some dumpster somewhere after this show filming.
What else was he supposed to do?  How about not put the friggen eggs over sliced up steak like was making a scramble at Denny's?
"@RwEpNcA technically, yes he could, but I don't think he made any of the other utensils or pans, or grown the vegetables and killed a cow either."
much better if he slides the egg out carefully
