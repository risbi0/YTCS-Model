Good video but I think you should’ve mentioned Malthus to show an alternate future without haber
"Your speech frpm 20:30 is inappropriate, and as childish: you have described an inventor devoted to chemical weapons for decades, so stop cheating with ""every bit of knowlege has double face"": those research efforts had ONE face, or maybe 2 with one huge and the other invisible.
■ But the very research on chemicals has been a damage in itself: while climate change is a half hoax, food from chemical agriculture has increased quantity and diminished terribly quality and this has effect on health, on sensitivity  and on thinking quality: lot of thoughts, superficial, desperately poor on conscience and wisdom.
■ About the idea ""Someone else would have invented that stuff"": 1st: it is a 3rd type hypothesis; 2nd: decades or months later, it would have been infinite differences, for instance some more births, therefore more inventors and spiritual leaders."
Can u please explain how cloth lantern light works?
"PV generated nitrogen fertilizer made in real time, injected into water feeds. Now a reality!"
I love him for the both things he made
Plants some trees People!
Depends on users
"The one that invented the axe probably would use it for cutting trees. It's a choice to use it in another way.

Choices are there, whichever way you choose, it will never be the same.

Life is like a sand grain. Impossible to comprehend and at the same time a fascinating story to live.

It is our choice to become an intelligent ant or curious living being."
"except there were and still are other options that would do this, they just weren't profitable."
Within the first minute I believe I correctly guessed what that 1918 Nobel Prize was for....
What are your thoughts on Biochar for capturing carbon?
"Lets be honest - you're a scientist and should be treated as such until you enroll into military out of choice. If you do so, afterwards you engineer youre discoveries into weapons, and personally overview their use on the battlefield - youre just an evil person. You cant see people dying from chlorine gas and feel satisfied with it, after you weaponized it. Theres something wrong with that and we all feel it."
Best episode.. So far.... Wonderful... Just like a movie..... Need more stuff  like this... Hats off 👍👍👍👏👏👏👏
"""The nazis requested to remove the foul smelling component""
No. There was always an odorless version of ZycklonB as it was used to gas foodstuffs and things like tobacco.
This story is a myth.
PS. it's never been proven that ZycklonB was ever used to kill people. Never."
We need Muhommed and Islam in our lives. Only those two can save us from evil of science. The more infidels convert to Islam the better world
"You forgot to mention the fact that the soil is now become over-saturated and is dying due to the fact of over-fertilizing! Great video as always!
Regenerative Agriculture is the way to go in my opinion, anyways looking forwards to the new videos."
Why does he look like Hitler Trotsky
I’m pleased that my carbon footprint is tiny
Come on we can eat humans…24/7
"Why is the gas that hits soldiers shunned, but the atom bomb that hits civilians celebrated?"
Does this mean Rain water is more nitrogen rich and hence better for vegetation as compared to tap water or ground water?
"This video was so packed with information that it reminded me of 3 chapters I studied back in school...one was from class 7th geography where we were taught about the guano islands, the other was from class 9th chemistry where we were taught about all the reactions occurring during lightning and the last obviously was the entire Haber's process itself which we were taught in class 10th and ofcourse, a little bit about the world war too"
"All I could think was

Ace Ventura - hhmmmm, guano!🤣🤣🤣😅😅"
His descent into madness is saddening
"So not only was he a philandering war profiteer, he's responsible for the population explosion driving the present environmental crisis."
Atleast you would not be here without him...would it be better?
"19:45  ""Someone else would have discovered it eventually anyway...""   The most moronic thing ever said.  You can say that about literally any inventor or scientist."
Y’all acting like he wasn’t dead during the holocaust it’s impossible for it be his fault
"Weapons don't kill people.
People do."
"CO2 is a life sustaining gas and good for the environment.   Is less than 1% of the atmosphere and is not warming the planet,.  Is one of the greatest hoax ever.   Follow the money and see why so many scientists have been bought off.  Also,  the greatest of all scientists do not subscribe to this nonsense and point to the cycles our solar system goes through"
"when USA nuked japan it was not considered a bad act when germans or Japanese does the same Americans would crucify them, USA the hypocrite"
Love this kind of content. well done and thank you
Great video once again.
"Not me reading millions as minions, i was so confused 😭💔👁👄👁"
Finally YouTube recommend this to me
dudes totally part of the cult
"TL;DW: He invented the Haber-Bosch process that is used for large scale synthesis of fertilizer. Oh and he is also called the ""Father of the chemical warfare""."
"To say Haber is irrelevant in the grand scheme is so intentionally obtuse it's insulting to even suggest it. That take negates personal responsibility in the name of science. He intentionally developed weapons of mass destruction to take lives in a horrible fashion. The fact that he is also responsible for a process that facilitated life is proof that villain and hero can be found in the same person. Trying to distill the whole of a man responsible for so much life and death down into one word is astonishingly reductive. 
He was a man and men are complicated.
Simply calling him a hero ignores the horror he cause and simply calling him a villain ignores the good he did.
But saying he is irrelevant to the wider process and progress of science robs him of responsibility in an attempt to justify his actions as a necessary evil or to make the horrors of science more palatable. This is misguided. 
And there is a difference between someone using your tool for evil and you instructing them on how to use your tool for evil. Haber did the latter and should be condemned for it. But he also must be praised for his contributions to the survival of humanity.

Haber was a great scientist who is responsible for both terrific and horrible things. To minimize his individuality, to try to zoom out and ""bigger picture"" this thing is a disservice to him and us."
My snowflake kids don’t deserve a better world.
"As we all understand, it is not the product that is dangerous but the intent of use and construction for good or evil. That is where the individual should be held accountable in my opinion. He and other scientists like him have sold out for their greed and ego Against Humanity. No question about it. It's the end result not the Inception that takes away from his so-called Glory. Absolutely thrilled that he was shunned at his so-called crowning of an award."
Amazing content. As usual 🙂
0:25 Is that guy trans?
The world would have been better off without him
7:57 anupam kher is that you😅
"20:35 Ted Kaczynski in ""Motives of Scientists"" says that scientists care only about inventions discoveries, it is the greatest satisfaction for scientist to find something, so scientists will not stop if what they're researching is dangerous to humanity."
So the Dutch Government is proposing starvation to its people when telling farmers to decrease nitrogen use?
Trying to reduce carbon emissions is futile. WE ARE carbon emissions. Better to learn how to harvest the carbon for other things.
"With the clarity of hindsight, it is easy to condemn Haber's methods and motives, but we should examine such facets of his life through a neutral point of view. He loved his country, volunteered for military service, and he believed that his experiments and knowledge could aid his camp in securing victory. For those of us, whose countries were on the receiving end of his weaponized science, it is natural to be biased against such an individual and his inventions, horrible as they may be. The reasoning that brought Haber to create said weapons is no different than J. Robert Oppenheimer's production of the Atomic Bomb. Seldom do we hear anything but praise for Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project. The only real difference being that Haber found himself on the losing side and Oppenheimer did not."
"Oh, so your little global warming propaganda mention at the end is what you believe? that we cause heat waves? do you know that global temperatures were significantly higher during the dust bowl years? or that ice cores show no correlation between greenhouse gases and climate change, yes no? they say believe the science then when you show it to them they call you a liar. fkn globalist psychopaths. You must have a degree in drama."
"""The Man Who Killed Millions and Saved Billions"" Yeah okay but you see I have watched the hit movie from 2009 Watchmen and Ozymandias did it first in a fictional universe, regardless on whether or not the process was invented before he was conceived."
What is the carbon footprint of the war? You tell a dramatic story about the first world war. But you say nothing about the war that is going on right now in Ukraine. You say noting about the long term consequences of this war. How many new weapons will be made to be able to withstand attacks of the aggressive countries like Russia? How many scientists will be occupied with invention of new weapon and not to decrease the carbon footprint?
Sad af
God I got recommended this video so many times
3:45 is actually an instance of very typical iron deficiency
"All these suferrings, hurt feelings, dyings, wars(from d' very beginning when Cain killed his brother Abel), the world was a frustrations to live in, w/out hope and faith...!!!"
"Chemistry isn't evil, and helps us understand more and solve challenges. I didn't know the story of this man, but clearly he actively took part in killing people knowingly. His reasoning does not hold up when you consider how painful the victims' deaths would be. People like Alfred Nobel realized what they were contributing to, and tried to make amends."
Obama the drone strike king was also given the Nobel prize
"The New York Times writing a hit piece on this man just lends him credibility. The Times has been in love with almost every awful dictator, and has been on the wrong side of history over and over again. I'd say them complaining about someone is a shining endorsement."
I'm amazed my teachers FAILED to teach us any of this at school. This is very important subjects to learn from. I curse my teachers to hell for their sloth and failure.
"From America to Lebanon, this is one of the most striking smooth transition humanity ever had in a video. Thanks Derek!"
"This evil person came up with the tools that killed my ancestors, the Russian people, tens of millions of whom died because of his insanity. I don't care what he came up with, he is a monster. His heinous ideas didn't kill millions of just people, they killed millions of Russians. Jews and Russians. And I hope he burns in hell."
"He wasn't wrong when he thought it would quickly end the war.
Look what happened in WW2 after the A-Bomb was created."
"I remember habers process uses iron as a catalyst not osmium though being in same grp it might have helped in achieving desired effect initially .
My guess is they switched to iron with molybdenum for commercial purposes"
Thats why USA shouldnt be helping its military industrial complex by helping Ukrainian Nazis to slay Russian Speakers. Greed kills.
"A ""villain"", yeah. Loyalty to your country or loyalty to yourself, buddy?"
"It sounds like Haber's wife got jealous she didn't come up with what Haber made. The letter she wrote screams of ""I'm sad I didn't come up with it first""

I don't think someone else would have discovered the nitrogen process Haber found. He was extremely lucky to have been able to have access to osmium."
"The guy talks about Putin like he knows him tat is funny

This is all the order of the Elite this is about the west against Russian Nato and it push

"7:52 Damn, that's a hard 36 years. Tougher times, I guess...."
I think it would have been better wo this invention
had no idea who fritz haber is. but nitrogen bird poop plus inventor = gun powder and fertilizer. still listening to china housing crisis...
So….you’re nothing special because someone else would have done it sooner or later? Now I know why she killed herself.
"Most inventions and discoveries found for good were and are often used for evil intentions. Plastic, E=mc2 etc...so in a way most are double edged swords."
"maybe we dont need to control the world ?
 but to find the way how to love that we have? maybe to find the way to communicate without the guns ? maybe   to find the way how to manege your emotions"
Science and technology will always be a double edged sword for us humans
Drop the vegan agenda and you won't need fertilizer.
"I find he is like Alfred Nobel, his invention was both used for good and bad purpooses, execept Haber deliberately used it as a weapon."
The entire video sounded so solemn because of your tone.
"“This inventor killed millions and saved billions” 

2 minutes into the video: Bird poop*"
"What is often overlooked is that the Allies also pretty much directly after the germans also used chemical weapons 
They just came up with it later"
"How do we continue to advance in our knowledge, satisfying our need to understand those things which make the world in which live?

Respect…
Caution…
Humility…

Understand that these things don’t just happen on their own, they are created by God.
Our lives are being governed by the arrogance of humans, NOT the intelligence of the Almighty, the cart is before the horse and the double edged sword is cutting the ones who are wielding it rather than that which it is being wielded against…"

Ohhhh so that's why a billion people will starve to death due to the coming fertilizer and farming shortage
So what about LEONARDO DA VINCI?? He is not being vilified.
Well produced.
WE HAVE A CO2 PLANT FAMINE ... AND WE ARE GOING INTO A GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM ... BY 2030 WE WILL BE USING SUPERCRITICAL COAL FIRED POWER AND OTHER FORMS SUCH AS THORIUM SALT REACTORS .... EXPONENTIAL POPULATION GROWTH IS NOT A SOLUTION
Nice

Sounds like King Fritz from attack on titan
Okay video is relatively good but do you really have to put an add on every 2 minutes? Come on! You have a sponsor in the video and I am sure you will be earning money with even 2 ads at the start and at the end. This money focused behavior is really offending for your subscribers and fans…
Learning about this in high school would have gotten me more interested in chemistry
Okay stupid youtube algorithm i watched it so stop recommending it

I am not convinced that carbon is a problem.
One of the first things we should do is to denounce and disown the WEF who are out to control and destroy our lives. Politicians who associate with this odious elite group should be regarded as traitors of the people.

"the irony, the person who made nitroglycerin is the same man with which the Nobel prize gets it's name, and they shun a man to receive a prize for doing the same thing the prize was named after did before him.....Alfred Nobel....."
"Yes, 4 billion more; come on man. Very sad now."
"My man, I heard you got into clickbait; is this true? If so, why? Science is science, but don't belittle people to get views if that is indeed the case :("
16:34 didnt even attend his wifes funeral.  Wow.
"Not sure I agree he 'saved' billions. Finding a way to 'cheat' on the planet by allowing crops to grow faster, produce more and thus allowing more and more people to live is only a stay of execution. Look at what that brought our planet."
"12:06 The customs authorities took away nitrogen fertilizers (ammonium nitrate), because the owner of the ship had debts to the port for the services rendered. Port workers claimed that the cargo was explosive. But, since officials are not scientists, saltpeter (ammonium nitrate) was lying in the port. If the saltpeter had exploded immediately, and not seven years later (2013-2020), the force of the explosion would have been even greater."
"The need for nitrogen fertilizer is now known for over 100 years and yet at this exact moment many countries are putting extreme limits on the amount of fertilizer used in farming, often way below the actual needs of the plants. The limitation of fertilizer use is one of the main reason the Sri Lankan government recently failed and the country was toppled into turmoil and the dutch farmers are protesting in the entire country for weeks now. The dutch government wants to go an even more extreme route and forcefully close down 1/3 of the entire countries farms in order to curb nitrogen emissions into the soil and water. And all of this is happening in a global food crisis due to the Ukraine war."
The idea that we need artificial fertilizers in order grow enough food to sustain ourselves is one of the biggest lies of the modern age.  Now were screwed because we have completely broken the natural nitrogen cycle.
By far the best episode
Please add subtitle Indonesia language on this channel for all video 🙏🙏🙏
"The desire for advancement in society is so easily corrupted by nationalism. The more I watched, the worse the story got."
"18:37 ""he died of heart failure"". lucky him?
20:35 "" so the real question is, how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world."" now in todays world one of it would imply to AI (Artificial Intelligence) and or AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) . we need it but it may kill us."
This was a fantastic video. Thank you
Also chemical fertilizers will eventually destroy our land. Good already had less nutrition and it keeps declining
"And one messenger boy that was gas poisoned at the Western front would later become Germany's chancellor. What comes around, goes around!"
insane story...
Thank you for making this video and enlightening us about one of the most consequential and tragic events of mankind. I'm a student and I'm on my way to be a chemical engineer. Your discourse at the end of the video has definitely inspired me to keep my future work and research to be used as a plinth for humanity and not as a sword against it.
"I picked some random video while playing pokemon to have some background noise, but this was so interesting that I had to stop playing and actually pay full attention. Well done."
So why are the ULTRA EVIL globalist trying to restrict fertilizer???   ...EVIL EVIL EVIL!!!!

"This video is exactly on the bullseye of the key principle to ALL technology, since the beginning of time.  ALL technology can be used for good and for evil. The force itself is only power. It is the one who controls it that decides if it will be for good or for evil."
"Once again, controlling Carbon is a double edged sword event. After all most life on Earth is Carbon based. As far as CO2 it is essential for plants to photosynthesize Oxygen that we breathe. On another note, carbon dust especially microscopic particles will contaminate living organisms. For example carbon dust in lungs will result in health complications even death - e.g. miners of coal had black lung etc. In addition microscopic carbon when really small (nanometer size) will get into the blood stream etc. even through skin and may result in blood clots in the circulatory system, plugging it up such as blood clots. Chemistry is a complex science and scientists often do not realize the side effects when arriving at a given solution. This is all just a tip of the iceberg of problems that can be generated by limited application of chemistry to our world. Nature is far better at this then humans."

Is not our urine ammonia or does it not turn into ammonia all I know is this when my dogs pee they kill my lawn but there’s a beautiful green ring around the dead grass so what I do now is water down the place where they pee and then there’s a beautiful green patch so I’ve been saving my urine every night every day because I’m home all day and I use it to fertilize my plants and it works that’s all perfect God system plants need carbon dioxide they give us oxygen we give them nitrogen ( wee wee )they give us food I love it . Preacher PaulD
"I strongly disagree with the notion that Haber was irrelevant. To disregard their efforts and tell a scientist that their work is irrelevant because someone else will just do it is a horrible way to motivate scientists and is incredibly disrespectful for all the work scientists throughout history have done to make our society a better place, more so than almost anybody else. To say ""whatever, someone else will just do it"" is a good way to NOT make progress in just about any field.

I feel like saying that is just a way to cope with the fact that there are many morally grey characters throughout history who have done both great and terrible things. People don't like to accept the fact that someone who does something bad can also do something good."
And people still don’t know how important farming is

good documentary
Hmm I think both sidesing Haber would be apt if he wasn't champing at the bit to apply his knowledge into Military innovation every chance he got. He fed half the world but he was also an amoral merchant of death. I think his only yardstick was how much scientific acclaim he could acquire in contrast to Einstein who did at least try and look at the consequences of his work.

"Oi mate, yeh nah.. Moral relativism is not the right argument for science. Some discoveries are double edged swords.. but often and especially in Haber's case (where he enlists himself into a war effort for the purpose of creating WMDs) shows clearly that science can be evil. Pure and simple. Morality matters, morality guides application, and most science is done towards a use case - a problem that wants to be solved. Haber could've equally have spent his wartime efforts on chemical processes to create wound dressings, antiseptics, and other solutions for the war effort to properly save lives on the field. Instead he chose a way to kill others, in the most cruel way.. because the humans on the other side were not human to him. Them, others, not your team.. this is not the mindset a scientist should have, because a scientist guided by facts knows we are all equal. He had a great problem solving mind, but he was amoral, who focused on the wrong problems, and he reaped what he sowed. Morality in science guides the problems you seek to solve, the parameters you want to meet, and the approach you are willing to take. It absolutely matters. Science is not amoral - it is deeply moral."

"If you consider this man a monster, that is fine…As long as you feel the same way about the people who worked on the Manhattan project and helped create the atomic bomb, which defeated the Japanese empire and helped end world war 2. The man was a patriot and his country was at war. This whole notion that it’s fine for us to shoot someone in the stomach and have them painfully and slowly bleed out, but it’s unacceptable to have them die from poison gas in their lungs… is ludicrous and laughable. The man was trying to serve his country in a time of war, end of story."
13:21 from* where
"Reminds me of the people that invented the atomic bomb. ""We can use it to end the war and save millions.""

Also I'm noticing a pattern of scientists killing a lot of people while also inventing something really helpful, like those psychology guys in the US."

"This is a great articulate and informative synopsis of the birth of nitrogen fertilizers and weapons. I grew up in the '60s and '70s son of a CEO of agricultural companies. 
I have heard many presentations and versions of the historical birth of nitrogen and it's used by man. This is perhaps the best and most accurate and balanced historical account that I have ever heard. Thank you for bringing this to light to the curious minds that may see your video. 
Again, thank you."

"This story is very tragic. On one hand I see Haber as a hero for developing such a innovative way to feed people long into the future. On the other his invention was responsible for many, many deaths. At first I thought, how could you blame a man for fighting and killing for his country and people? What is wrong about being patriotic and who are we to deny it? On the other, war is bloody, and cruel and unfair often times to the innocent who have no real power to stop what's already been put into motion. 
It's so...confusing I don't know what I would do if I had his power and knowledge. But what I can say is that I don't think he would stand for genocide of millions of innocent people. Especially those of his background. That I feel can't simply be blamed on him."
"Haber lived long enough to go from a hero to a villain. He fell victim to the worst mentality ever… a quick war. Reminds me of the Captain America quote.

Steve Rogers : Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time."
I think nuclear weapon is more dangerous than chemical weapons
He is neither the bad or the good. He is the scientists.
"From helping your crops, to getting you zooted. Nitrogen."
Another scientist with unethical views: Albert Einstein. He urged Roosevelt to build the atomic bomb. But he is beyond any criticism.
"""A soul for more soul"""
"""I might have been responsible for the death of millions of people but believe me when I say my other invention will quadruple human population.""
of course the dude was shunned."
"It's funny how he is criticised for developing a weapon that mainly  killed enemy *soldiers* but Manhattan project scientists are highly regarded for making a weapon that mainly killed *civilians*. But as they say, ""winners write the hystory books""."
"It's really difficult to blame him. I mean, if you are a patriot, wouldn't you do the same for your country?"
Evil Dr Phil
"Explosives are one thing, once you said he was responsible for weaponized chlorine. That dude should rot in hell. It would have been one thing if he stopped at feeding the world."

"He seems like neither hero nor villain, but rather an amoral scientist looking for progress whether or not it would be moral to do so."
What wasn't moral in his life?
"Way to go.  Thanks to this guy, traffic is a nightmare."
"On a long term scale has he really saved billions? We used to farm in a sustainable, natural way. Now we farm with synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. People aren't better off, our population will just reach the new equilibrium.

Unfortunately it's now impossible to go back without killing billions."
"consider that a hammer can be used as both a tool and a weapon. any tool that humans create, including scientific discoveries can be weaponised. consider our hands can be use to create or destroy, to heal or to injure and our hands are what we use to fabricate these tools.

science is only bad if the hand that wields it is either has mal intent or is negligent. science isn't intrinsically bad in the same way that a hammer isn't intrinsically a weapon. to say that science is intrinsically bad is to say that humans are intrinsically bad as our hands have the same same duality as science - as science was born from our hands. science isn't some supernatural force, it's just another tool in our tool kit. to say that science is a supernatural force is to say that a hammer is a supernatural force."
Artificially boosting population beyond an ecologically sustainable means isn't necessarily the beneficial development that seems to be implied.
ask rudolf about zyklon b
"""You don't know the outcome of your research, or how it might be used.""  - The wrongest comment ever, after he explains that Einstein knew so he abstained, and Haber knew, so he tried to kill men faster to end a war."
Any mention of his wife?
what amazing and sad history....
Is it bad I read millions as Minions?
It’s reasons like these that make me hate feminists especially when they say men are useless😂
"According to a book I just read, Dr. Clara Immerwahr Haber, ""pleaded with her husband, chemist Fritz Haber, to stop working on the war cases that were having such horrible success in the trenches. He repeatedly refused, despite her arguments that his work was a perversion of the discipline of chemistry, and she committed suicide in 1915."""
"@jerry -sb he doesnt say its true, he just said its according a book he read"
what makes you believe that to be true
"so you make a way to make a lot of humans, then make a way to kill a lot of humans."
"Some lies, but mainly it's a good clip"
Excellent episode. Love the historical account of Haber.
"The narrative of Spain 'going to war' with its formal colonies is hilarious. Spain colonized the land and committed genocide on the populus, framing it without such language and with vague 'went to war' language is not historically accurate or responsible"
"Amazing Video! The Nat Geo Series ""Genius"" which was based on the life of Albert Einstein depicted Haber and all these incidents surrounding the war and his Nobel Prize too in their first season."
At least people know why Marines don't wear a beard.
"Fritz had us in the first half, not gonna lie.

Bruh fed the world, could have been in the top100 humans, then went on to make gas weapons and building the basis for the Zyklon... Rising to the top, then diving down the abyss of humanity."
Mad props for commander pixies for saving the billion lives
so he didn't cause millions to die
Thing is I know of because of Rogan
Expecting individuals to do what CORPORATIONS can only do is really phucking ridiculous.
"The reality is that military budgets, for research and development, are the largest in the world. They are also the ones who are willing to push the boundaries the most. That's why many technologies that we use today have arisen from military R&D.
If those same budgets were dedicated to improving the living standard and education of the human race, we wouldn't have the negative outcomes on such a scale."
10:20 its the anthem of the eu in german
"How did I not know this video was going to be about nitrogen fixation when I first clicked on it. I mean it only took me until the Nobel prize to know what it was about, but still such a long time for a chemistry major"
This video should have mentioned Clara’s genius a bit more.
"I remember seeing the Beirut explosion on the news in Baghdad

It was so big that we thought the israelis went even crazier than they already are and launched a tactical nuke
25 killstreak"
"Even Einstein is not fully innocent. We can say that he is the foundation of atomic bombs. So scientists will always have their different kind of views but it won't impact the cost of the invention. It used to be lives of people, now? Genetics of billions maybe..."
Que historia tan brutal. Gracias por sus videos.

I didn’t know any of this. Thanks.
"""hurr I'm just gonna use the rarest metal on earth known in my time to catalyse my reaction to get ammonium""
Yeah that sounds schizo and hard to believe. Who did he steal that information from."
"I fully hold him accountable. Sure, someone else would have probably came up with it anyway, but he invented the chemical weapons knowingly and didn't care about the suffering it would cause and the potential danger it posed for the future. It seems to me like he was never driven by an intention to do good for the world, but simply with the intention of doing science out of curiosity, no matter the cost."
Your videos are the best!
"It could be argued. That his achievements didn’t matter. We were bound, to go beyond the healthy limits, of our planet."
"Real question is:

How to preserve enough of everything around us, until we can colonise other planets. Since, cradle is no doubt going to die one day. If we want to live on as a civilisation, we must find a way to leave the cradle."
"I'm out corporatacracy it's impossible for scientists to be separate from profits and currently our profits are gained from War and bad systems than ethical objectives and Human Livingry. Instead of Human Weaponry, a paraphrase of Bucky Fuller"

"""You can change your mind, but PLEASE mind what you change."""
There is nothing wrong with this man who wanted to serve his country with all this heart. This would not be an issue if the chemist was from UK or France instead of Germany. The wrong side of the history.
"19:29 I have to say though that if we disregard him for discovering how to process nitrogen out of the air then we would have to disregard a lot of scientists and their discoveries that could have been discovered by someone else simply because of a bad thing they did. The point is that we remember the ones who make the discovery. I mean Clair Patterson worked on the Manhattan project but is responsible for the discovery of the age of the earth and leading the fight of banning leaded products. 

I understand that you were pointing out ways that one would look at this man’s work and that possibly you don’t agree fully with that philosophy but I think I needed to point that out (possibly to help me process my thoughts by typing this down). 

Another thing I want to point out is that I completely agree with you when you say that chemical weapons are immoral."
No E.S.G.
well that just put me in for a whirl. and it also put a damper on my day.
His wife was arkancided
"Wish we could have real discussions without the speech police coming to the rescue. People have questions about events (current and historical) and all they do is fester, automatically thought to raise the question is equal to participating in such atrocities."
There is only a small proportion of humanity that encourages weaponized science. Unfortunately they are in control of the agenda/narrative.

"The Holy Grail of renewable energy storage and transport would be to be able to generate ammonia directly  from solar/wind energy. There are devices called hydrolyzers that can do electrolysis and generate hydrogen gas  rather efficiently. The rest of the Haber process can be powered by renewables, too. But still no way to eliminate the bad byproducts of the Haber process on an industrial scale."
"Excellent video as always, I think that most discoveries and inventions can cause both great technological advances and improvements in living conditions, such as death and destruction.  The problem is in the use that institutions make of them to generate profits or obtain their objectives."

"Using a carbon credit advertiser for a channel like this is shady at best.  I know it's faulty logic, you know it's faulty logic, 50% of subscribers know it's faulty logic.

"Tesla discovered things too, but he destroyed them when he found out they have high destructive potentials."
And now we see the genocidal elites who worship the debunked Malthus trying to stop us from using nitrogen...look at the Netherlands...and soon Canada...

What if the us military china and India stopped polluting ? Lets fix that first .

Being able to watch videos like these are giving me the motivation to study English although I'm not good at it. Thanks for this marvellous video.

I was today years old when I learned that we had poop islands.
"Great video!
You forgot to mention a big story about Haber.

Chaim Weizmann was a Jewish biochemist, director of the British Admiralty laboratories, and the first president of Israel.
He developed the acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation process, his acetone production method was of great importance in the manufacture of cordite explosive propellants for the British war industry during WW1.

While Chaim Weizmann was on the allies' side, Haber was the genius on the opposite side. While Chaim Weizmann was a Zionist leader - Haber hated the idea of Zionism. 
Worst enemies.

After the Nazis took control, it's changed dramatically Haber's understanding of nationalism and the world. He understood his wrongdoing.
He met with Weizmann and decided to come to Israel, but on the journey to Israel, he died."
It just makes Haber more of a hero over the long term
"Do a video about Norman Borlaug. He fed billions with his work on GMOs, and faced many setbacks from people resisting scientific advancement. Some idiot hippie ""activists"" even convinced a starving nation to reject his GMO seeds. Resulting in their starvation and death to continue."
"I dont think the term „saved billions“ is not really true. 
Most children would simply be not born if theres not enough food available. Its much more a choice to use technoloy, produce a lot of food and have rapid growth in population. Its not universally good to have a lot of people imo"
Was an interesting video. At the end they spoiled it by trying to get people to evaluate their carbon emissions. The newest scam of the tyrants.
One of your best/saddest/most thought provoking videos.
Wow. What a great video. It is very rare to see drama integrated into an educational video or documentary without it seeming forced or detached. Here I got really moved and it is not even clear exactly why. Bravo!
"I would suggest doing a show on the 'science' behind so-called global warming or 'climate change'. Your assumption that the carbon cycle is in anyway related to weather cannot be substantiated or indeed logically implicated. The only impact of extra carbonic gasses, carbon in the atmosphere and CO2 is an increase in acidification of oceans and rivers and catchments, other than that there is actually no discernable connection. Unless you have shown carbon to be A contributing factor TO 'climate' it is still simply a theory while the earth warms up in its inter-glacial warming period we are now in shortly before getting colder into another Maunder minimum mini-ice age."
What a great teacher
"The answer to that is simpel: love. understand, see, listen,  look, hear, think, calculate. love. Do not kill. Be honest with yourself. Trust yourself, Use evidence based compassion. Love. That simpel. BUT: you have to do it yourself; you are not alone, you are together. Love. Understand what the essence of love means. I know, just the ramblings of a child? What does it knows?!?  It's like 'yeah, I am sitting in a closed room with a hand granate in my hand and wondering if it would be a good idea to pull the pin...?!? Or maybe not? Let's try? What could happen??! I don't know! ...'"

"""and now Yoga"" - Sadhguru"
great video thank you
A bit too pretentious.
His invention saved and destroyed humanity
"He saved four billion with his process, then killed several thousands with his obsessions with explosives and poison gas. He was betrayed by the very country he lost his humanity for and saved humanity for. A decade after his death his institute provided the gas to the very party he was betrayed by in order to mass murder millions, including his own people. 

Its very easy to call him evil, but personally i think he's a hero, but a bad person, like other people we celebrate, like Churchill for example. He knowingly saved future generations, but knowingly contributed to killing soldiers in his own generation so his 'status' is easily up for debate."

"so if canada is cutting the fertilizer it allows farmers by 30% right now, we will have weaker, smaller crops. This will bankrupt many farmers. the farm land is being hoarded by the likes of bill Gates. ultimately creating mass starvation."
When science meets imperialism.
"14:49 is exactly how and what people like these would do for some fame and profit.
That’s exactly WHY if you don’t have FAITH in your Creator and Lord, you’re just as worthless and so is what you call your “life”.
People like these don’t even deserve to be called “people”, so these creatures are not living, because they’ve always been dead, they exist to be used as a tool for the ones that regard themselves as those who know The Truth but still disregard IT.
This is where I stopped watching, as I am disgusted with myself, that I allowed myself to watch this far and give it any attention.
You are oh Lord, worthy of honour and glory, for my breath is really yours, and without IT/YOU i am one of these.

very good question at the end food for thought
Imagine what China is doing with DNA banks the have...COVID-19 was no accident. Sloppy first attempt I'm sure they are already trying to refine.
Maybe they can re-search organic farming and save the planet… Wouldn't that be nice
didnt know there was so much history behind this. wow
"And who's Bosch, and why is it called the Haber-Bosch process"
"Wars are horrible and deadly. Always have been; always will be. Yawn. No, what truly makes Haber a monster is doubling the world's population with a short-term fix of a fertilizer. Why do you think the WEF is trying to put the genie back in the bottle? It's not random."
Maybe it was Clara who discovered the process and that why she said thais her husband had won all that she had lost
"The claim that he ""saved"" billions seems dubious, as I would assume it's more that fertilizer has led to a higher birth rate than it has to a lower death rate. I would assume people are much more likely to choose to have children when they have easy access to necessities like food, but I guess that level of nuance typically results in a less clickbait-y title. Furthermore, I feel the usage of ""patriot"" without critically examining the highly problematic nature of patriotism lends itself to a level of ""developing chemical weapons might be understandable"" narrative that's morally reprehensible. Pretty clear that Haber's motivations were always success, fame, and wealth---never the betterment of society (at least in any inclusive notion of society)."
"I think one way to prevent destroying ourselves is by acknowledging that we'll never know everything about the natural world, and we certainly can't control it. Tweak it, sure, but not control it."
Gmo gmo  CHEMTRAILS!!!!

"I for one am a bit skeptical of the sponsor. Acid-base reactions are reversible. Aqueous H2CO3 (H3O+ and HCO3-)can precipitate out of water in the form of Ca(HCO3)2 or other salts; but when hydrolyzed, the resulting carbonate can also react with acid and through decarboxylation (think baking soda and vinegar), put the CO2 right back into the atmosphere. 

Carbonate sequestration is effective, so long as you can protect the solids from acid rain. Scattering reactants on the forest floor doesn’t do that."
"Remember, the first world war was a war of futility, not of racial intent. Arguably, Harber could have been attempting to end the war faster, it was only the same as fighting for England. Just because the Germans lost and thus instigated ww2 it places him in a negative light. He was hugely influential."

what?
"The other story you could tell, using this as a starting point, is how this led to the rise of factory farming as a way to recreate scarcity where there no longer was any (of staple crops).. Wheat/soy/maize farmers could no longer make ends meet because growing these had become too easy, and so governments all over the west, post ww2, decided to go all in on promoting livestock rearing, because it's ""higher value added"", and presumably also because it would make it easier for them to push the third world into cattle ranching (and displacing local populations from their lands)."
"CARBON FOOTPRINT? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! You know as well as everyone that it’s a scam.

Didn't watch the video and didn't read the comments. My guess is that this video is about Fritz Haber. Did I guess correctly?
yes
I remember learning about haber's process first time in 10th class and again through out school life but never knew about the tragic backstory.

"Wait a second. He effectively created not only horrendous weapons, he effectively led to the deaths of thousands of other people and his own wife, and only 'stopped' when people from his own religion were attacked. He's an absolute villain. I don't think his discovery of a process that opens the door to fertiliser necessarily outweighs the brutality he directly, willingly, enabled."
"He is a hero lol.

Like a wise man said.

""In times of peace, a scientist should serve humanity. In times of war, their country"".

Any other view is wrong."
he was hero for me and he was fighting for his country.

Something I've always said  is  there's no such thing as an evil chemical from fentynal  to cyanide  it's the intent of the  person with the chemical
"Dude was a monster. No reason to split hairs or try to show him in some good or objective light to the masses. Some other evil guy would've done it? Okay, I might as well go rob a bank before someone else does :P

"Your channel is fabulous.  You do such thoughtful work.  You mentioned BASF.  In the early 20th century, the largest chemical producers in Germany (BASF, Bayer, Hoescht, Agfa & others) combined in to a large cartel called IG Farben.  IG Farben was the supplier of Zyklon B.  In addition, IG Farben ran a slave labor camp at Auschwitz called Monowitz.  Slaves died by the tens of thousands.  Those too weak to work were called out by Farben employees and directed to extermination as the Nazis brought in replacement slave labor from throughout Europe.  At the end of the war, the senior execs walked, unlike the senior execs at Krupp.  The story of IG Farben is told in the book ""Hell's Cartel"" by Diarmuid Jeffreys."
This makes code lyoko have a whole new meaning knowing now who “franz hopper’s” name was derived from.
So if nitrogen helped grow the population then cutting nitrogen use in the netherlands and canada will reduce the population?
"As an american, when just thinking about what Haber did, it would be easy to demonize him. However, he isn't the first man to think that greater weapons would end wars, and he wasn't the last either. Indeed due to the findings of his (once?) friend Einstein, we have the ability to destroy the world with the push of a button. The early 20th century was a different time, and it was seen as honorable to have patriotism, some still see it that way. The unfortunate fact is that greater weapons don't stop wars, they just put them on hold. For many years now it seems like the barrel keeps filling with powder, and just one mistep, one errant twitch, and kablooey. Clara might have done what she had done because she felt inadequate as a chemist in comparison, or because she truly hated what he was doing, I guess we'll never know; perhaps behind closed doors the two had regular problems such as disagreements on how to run the household, something any marriage can and will go through, its crazy to think she killed herself and her son was the one who found her, that must have damaged his heart..."

The more CO2 the BETTER.   INVERTED REALITY brought to us by the SAME world bankers to enslave us!
A scientist without morals is more dangerous than a neighbourhood goon.
"well told story, thank you"
"The video is so unecessary dragged out.
There were food issues.
Fritz Haber together with his partner Carl Bosch invented a way to massproduce nitrogen-fertilizer, by using the today called Haber-Bosch process.
He later on played a big part in producing bio-gasweapons during WW1 and is known as the Father of the gas war."
Calling Haber evil for trying to find a way to end the war faster would be like calling J. Robert Oppenheimer evil for helping invent nuclear weapons. We did the same thing in WW2. WW1 Germany is not the same as WW2 and them winning would not have meant the same thing as WW2 Germany winning.
"@Samuel Mason As a nuclear scientist/engineer that has worked on reactors and bombs for 10 years you are wrong about the intention of nuclear weapons, especially the weapons of the era.The intent was to make as large of an explosion as possible to cause the largest amount in infrastructure damage as possible negating the Japanese ability to arm themselves and to eliminate their stores of weapons. Fallout is a byproduct that people actually do not like as the intent of most warfare is to takeover territory even if temporary like with east/west Germany. Even in the most cruel sense it is better to kill every one with out the fallout as to be able to move in and occupy the territory with out the need for precautions. Which is why neutron bombs were invented and then immediately banned. And yes read the propaganda that was being pushed in Japan at the time, and the times leading up to WW2 they were in it for the long haul. I believe the sayings were something like ""100million for the cause"" even if EVERYONE didnt fight you would be still be fighting millions of people on an island nation. It would be near impossible. The Japanese thought they were protected on their home islands, they were ready for invasions but the nukes shook them."
"@Cody Smith also, the notion that every last Japanese person would fight tooth-and-nail is likely a myth based on exoticized misconceptions of Japan. A bigger motivating factor for surrender would not necessarily be lives lost considering Japanese military tactics during the time that did very little to mitigate casualty counts, and more that a surrender before invasion gave the military dictatorship of Japan more control over peace terms with drastic regime change being less likely."
"@Cody Smith the Japanese surrender in WWII was also shortly after the USSR said it was going to do more in the fight against Japan, and the USSR was likely willing to launch a land invasion. It’s not unlikely that this, and seeing how the USSR dealt with Germany after defeat, was more important in causing the Japanese to surrender than the nukes. Furthermore, nuclear bombs are specifically designed to cause fallout, which is much more damaging long-term than a conventional bomb with the same blast force. There is absolutely no reason to drop nukes if you aren’t targeting organic targets. If you look at firebombing, like allies did in Tokyo and Dresden, that’s another bombing method that’s known to increase civilian deaths, by removing all the oxygen causing suffocation in addition to burning alive. The allies aimed to kill Japanese civilians when they bombed"
"@Samuel Mason To be fair the nukes used on Japan were meant to target military targets. The Allied forced event went so far as to drop pamphlets and make radio announcements in both cities for weeks ahead of time warning both civilians and military personel of the impending bombing with a new technology. Also lets concider the idea that ending a war sooner would have saved lives. Look at Japan, the entire island was propogandized to fight down to the last man woman and child. They had even started training women and children to fight invaders with makeshift weapons. Should we have invaded instead of nuking two cities, we would have had to fight through nearly 100m people most likely killing tens of millions as we went. with that added to the calculation, making the decision where 10s of millions of people would have dies, compared to only 200,000 people combined with the bombings, well the bombing is looking much more humane.
 Similar takes can be said with WW1, if Germany had gotten a quick victory as they nearly did before being fended off at the Marne we would not have had the devastation of millions of lives that ww1 led both during the war and then the following strife caused due to the post war treaties (like ya know ww2).If the gas attacks had allowed a grand breakthrough and then a swift victory its theorized that there would have been much less death, and possibly no WW2 to follow. The most human war is the swiftest war."
"I'd call them both evil, pretty simple. There should be rules of war, the chemical weapons of WWI and the nukes of WWII likely didn't result in fewer deaths, and you shouldn't develop weapons that are unnecessarily cruel (gas) and/or are designed to target civilians (nuclear bombs)."
"I'm never into science and I don't know anything about it, but when you click on one of these, you can't stop. Thank you for teaching us."

"Whenever videos such as this want to reference Nazis as bad, they often cut to a video of book burning.  But perhaps Veritasium or some other video content creator can dive deep into the question:  ""What sort of books were they interested in burning?""    What sort of ideas did these National Socialists, these Nazis, find so wrong and evil?  What ideas were so bad that to them the only answer was to burn these books in an attempt to purge their country of these ideas?   I think the answer to that question will surprise most of us."

"These days people are fond of saying ""Trust the science"" and ""I believe in science.""  The lesson at the end of this video should remind us that science and wisdom are completely separate realms.  And the above statements are both non sensical and devoid of said wisdom."
One is not a scientist if he ponders the results of his discoveries.
"The video is really interesting but there's one thing that I found significant:
The process of making fertilizers requires natural gas (not only for heating, but for its elements), but the video conveniently omits that information when explaining how it's done. 
It could be a mistake or implicit anti-fossil bias, but it is disappointing nonetheless."
"@Samuel Mason I refer to ""Fossil Future"" by Alex Epstein"
Lol what? How is that even remotely relevant? And anti-fossil fuel bias? As opposed to utter disregard for the long-term future of the planet?
"Don't forget, it is not the ""Haber process"" - it is the ""Haber-Bosch process"". Carl Bosch was as instrumental as Fritz Haber because Bosch was the guy coming up with the engineering, machinery and installations to make the process work on an industrial scale. Bosch is another remarkable figure of chemistry; Bosch was CEO of BASF introducing many other high pressure processes, such as urea synthesis or isobutyl oil synthesis. He was awarded the Nobel prize just like Fritz Haber, but later. and for having worked on so many different high pressure processes, not just the Haber-Bosch method. Bosch founded the infamous I.G. Farben.

Also, Haber's wife Clara Immerwahr was not only a PhD in chemistry, but suffered from not being able to do much scientific work because of the dominating personality of her husband as well as the social restrictions and pressures of being a mother and a housewife. She was also a pacificist. Even though the main reason for killing herself are today attributed to 1.) a depression from her dissatisfaction with her life in general and 2.) having caught her husband with another woman, she was extremely irritated and against her husband being involved with the military, ending up as ""the father of the gas war"", and supporting the military-industrial complex in other functions."

"The problem with any scientific breakthroughs in many regards is the potential of the resulting application being a double edged sword. For every vaccine discovered there is a good chance that research goes into weaponising what we fight to cure, it goes beyond medical and in reverse as well.

"In school I wrote a examination on the role of the chemical industry in world war 1. I was more interested in the technicalities of the different chemicals used than the implications of Habers process sadly. I did cover the nitrogen shortage and that the chemical Industrie found a solution, however I wasn’t aware how important that was and what it meant for agriculture. Im a bit ashamed now, that I missed the most important and interesting thing."
Wow that was the shot heard round the world to end farming!!   Planned!!
This is why the governments of the world want to ban nitrogen; they want us to die.
"I have never trusted the NY Times. It's full of non-sensical imbalanced radical liberal ideas. I am surprised that even then it was the same. 

The fact is, every technological or scientific achievement can be used for both good and bad. But as human beings we have to assess the pros and cons of it and then judge it. 

In this particular case, his invention saved human beings from hunger. The entire species survived because of it. Isn't that more important than the fact that it has been used as explosives intermittently? Would you rather want him not to discover it and let humanity perish?"

"The climate crisis. We need -- more -- CO2 for better plant growth. The only crisis we have with CO2 is that plant life puts it in the ground and tectonic shift puts it in the mantle slowly draining the atmosphere of CO2.  it's been going on for hundreds of millions of years. At the beginning of the Holocene almost reaching the point where photosynthesis would have stopped and life would wither away.

Then nature invented human civilization getting the carbon back out of the ground. Giving life some breathing room. Averting the imminent CO2 disaster. And now the climate zealots want to reduce CO2 and ban the nitrogen fertilizer. Causing  loss of life and famines.  Sri Lanka was the first to fall. We  are living in a time where irrational herd ""truths"" (climate crisis, nitrogen problem) are causing people to do all the wrong things. Let's just hope we will not be able to bind that carbon into the rocks. it could be the greatest disaster in the history of the planet.

It is almost exactly opposite."
But rest assured. Co2 rises sharply as the current ice age ends. it is now 450 ppm.  Next ice age though life may very well hit the wall.

"I think this video lacks context, it is an archaic pacifist theory to make war so brutal that it ends quick and scares people from doing it ever again. If it’s quick it is only between soldiers and prevents the eventual slip into total war where uninvolved civilians resources and eventually their lives become necessary to continue. Quick, brutal, but isolated. It’s kinda like how pirates wanted to be scary as hell before the fight and brutal afterwords to intimidate people into just surrendering and avoiding fighting."

Science has killed as many people as any other ideologies.
Dont blame it all on religion."

"You believe in carbon emission,  carbon footprint and Climate change.  Please spend some time, O Scientist, to evaluate the veracity of Al Gore's lie."
"To be fair, the H-B process and its fertilizers are a huge part of why modern agriculture is carbon emissive, so depending on how and when you do your counting, many of those additional billions of post-synthetic agriculture people may be canceled out by climate change. But you can't argue with the absolute impacts (whether you judge them good or bad) of this discovery.

Another way to think about this is that all the consequences of Haber's discovery made our society less resilient in the long term in exchange for greater intensity in the short term (chemical weapons are inherently politically destabilizing, nitrate fertilizers are a popular improvised explosive used by terrorists like the Oklahoma City Bomber, and the H-B process was never going to be long-term sustainable because of its inherent energy costs).

 At the time Haber was working, humanity was more concerned with feeding a population boom immediately. Now many of our global society are more concerned with slowing population growth, and transitioning to more long-term sustainable methods for living, so short term intensity isn't as appealing now, if it comes with a cost of long term fragility."

You cut me up. You show how he was a status that he believed in his country so much she made terrible things happen. Detrimental to his own kind.

"When we think of discoveries being double edged-sword, we tend to think of scientists who discover something that should be good for humanity but who stand powerless while other people exploit it to kill and destroy. In that case, Haber himself exploited his discoveries to do as much harm as he could, and he used the manpower and facilities he received as a reward for his scientific contributions in the process. I think this is what makes this story so horrifying."
One should be more of a human than nationalist.
"Insane that governments are starting to try and ban these fertilisers, global famine incoming if they keep trying"
Haber shared his Nobel Prize for synthesizing ammonia. The work of British Chemist Robert le Rossignol was crucial to that discovery.
Weather he had millions killed or not creating a society that would far excede the billion mark in population far outweighs his bad side. Man is a legend. A terrible legend but a legend.

Excellent historical documentation says Nobel Prize Laureate Prof.Dr. Ezekiel Okemwa ( IPCC Expert )
"In my opinion the further technology progresses, and the more complex it wil be, the harder it wil be to predict its outcome to the environment. A fertilizer might be good to grow crops and feed people, but it has a bad influence on the environment, more food = more people = claim more space = less space for other creatures and diversity. These inventions are revolutionary but disturb the balance of the planet in the long run unless we can predict its outcome and know its limits. Technology and moral / environmental ethics are still the most complex cases. Sometimes i think about how the world would look like without technology or greed. Whats the definition of a paradise on earth nowadays, looking at how long we know carbon emissions are bad, it seems we only change on the brink of destruction."

You will get to know similar intresting stories of greatest european minds like Einstien,Meliva,Curie,Harber,Plank in more dramatic way."
Radio lab?
What I saw inside Haber is a monster like Walter White in BB. It grew out of nowhere. Humans become furious after unleashing thier latent talents.
"I love Veritasium but you’d think a science based program would know better than to buy into the anthropogenic/CO2 global warming psyop.  Despite holding degrees in Biology and Biophysics from UW Madison and Yale, respectively, and priding myself on being a fiercely independent thinker, it wouldn’t be until my early 30’s that I would stumble upon information that would force a fundamental change in both my intellectual and personal understanding.  As it turns out, fiercely independent thinkers can and do hold false beliefs.  In my case, I never took the time to challenge my own position on the global warming issue because it didn’t really matter if it was true or not.  It just felt right.  Besides, I could see it happening around me (or maybe I was just seeing it for the first time)   Well…it also turns out that the power of suggestion really is powerful.   That’s not to say climate change isn’t real or that it’s not happening right now.  It is.  But it has nothing to do with you or CO2.  It’s the sun.  Solar cycles have been understood for thousands of years.  They were understood in 1973  when the worlds most powerful men got together to discuss how to engineer the 21st century.  They came up with four domains of what they called, “threat consensus”.   Threat consensus is the use of crisis as a means of imposing ones will on a mass population.  Problem-reaction-solution.  It’s Hegelian dialectic but on a global scale.  The four domains of threat consensus are as follows:
 1. Human caused global warming. 2. Earth-asteroid impact. 3. Pandemic 4. Alien invasion.  

 I don’t expect any of you to be any kinder to this post than I would have been when I was so full of hate and hubris.  Just remember it.  And know this: what we do not face, we will be forced to feel."
"""felt right"" well there's your problem"
I think there is always a balancing act between scientific knowledge and human wisdom. The current pandemic proves that very clearly.
"If you're German and Jewish, you are either in our books, or one of the victims of Holocaust."
Making the planet more overpopulated than it already was is not a pro in my book.
I'd say Haber was a great man and a hero. In 1900s he did what he could based on what he knew and his perceptions. It's crazy to judge him by 2022 plus standards
he is the reason earth is overpopulated
What's the name of the song at 10:16 ?
"Its called ""Ode an die Freude"" and is the European Anthem."
"His crime is that he caused the victory of the victors to come at a higher cost. There are people just like him who are celebrated by most of those who call him a monster because they were on 'the right side'. Don't get me wrong, I would never do what he did but I also don't like the hypocrisy. Haber was neither a monster nor a hero. He was a human."
"I know many people might call me an extremist for even saying this but regarding nitrogen issues it’s very possible it was one of natures many ways of preventing overpopulation. Ultimately there is a limit to how much the world can sustain not just in food but water, space, and even air in the distant future. Water is of course an immediate issue but it’s worth considering the cost of the other 2 on not only us but Nature. Too many Herbivores mean less plants which means less insects and it goes on and on. You can do this with pretty much any species. Even our current solutions to combat overpopulation are hurting the environment. Artificial fertilizers cause pollution in the ground and water sources underneath it. 

I would have rather had the world population controlled by food access and never being born then watching as we slowly consume the earth that has raised so much life. I mean knowing us we probably would have done something even stupider to try and prolong the inevitable. But I’m allowed to dream."
"Oh, I clicked on this thinking it was going to be another propaganda piece for Albert Bourla and Pfizer."
Small minded
"With great power comes great responsibility. Everything has both sides just look at uranium it has the power to solve the world's energy for thousands of years but at the same time, it can cause a huge explosion and extinct mankind if we were to not use it properly. High power also causes humans to be more egoistic and lose their humanity. We can make earth heaven if only we all throw our ego out and use the power for god but sadly that will never ever happen. It's proven throughout history.😥"
"While I think this was an amazing video I feel the conclusion section is a bit misleading. It isn't like his invention was used without his knowledge to develop the weapons, he developed them personally and supervised their usage. The man might have helped billions but his own actions show to me what his intentions and aspirations were."
This was your best video ever.
"Extraordinary animation and music that highlight the interesting subject <3

And the answer to the last question of the clip would be: the development of scientific process must be flanked by huge investment into the development of democracy. Only an enlightened society can chose the right directions. That would also mean to shatter big industries and corporate. And as long as people are cheering towards fuckers like Musk or Bezos, a society is doomed to fail."

Who did he save?
"That's the problem with Americans these days,  choosing quantity over quality."

Best video I've ever watched in this channel. Thank you so much
"It's simple, look at Haber's close friend Albert Einstein; he used his intelligence to better humanity's understanding of the universe. I'm sure even Einstein himself, if he dedicated himself to it, could've used his intelligence to create weapons. But as mentioned in this video, he was a pacifist. He had a moral code. 

This is why teaching the right morals and values to people, especially those in their infancy is so important. These morals and values can help motivate and steer people to make on the whole part, decisions for the betterment of humanity and not for the destruction of it."
"@VIVEK SINGH LATWAL Although he never worked directly on the atomic bomb, Einstein is often incorrectly associated with the advent of nuclear weapons. His famous equation E=mc2 explains the energy released in an atomic bomb but doesn't explain how to build one."
I incorrectly stated that Einstein helped create nuclear Bombs when that is actually a false attribution.  I apologize
Lmao and Einstein wasn't related to the invention of any deadly weapons whatsoever
"The Nobel Price was first instated out of the bad concience of Alfred Nobel. He invited the Process to make nitro Glycerin into TNT, thus making it stable enough to transport without great danger. He intended this invention for Mining, in his mind making the life of miners safer and bringing great riches to the world. When he saw that it was used in war, his concience grew so bad that he ""invented"" the Nobel Price. 
This highlights the last Statement in the video very nice I think. Humanity will always find creative ways of (ab-)using inventions..."
"this would better not been invented at all, now we must reverse this process to get less people. Population must be reduced to about only me and 1000 pretty women"
What a video to watch man💯
"imagine fertilizer companies shutting down due to government overregulation.
man made famine.
All with the intent of politicians/lobbyists controlling the food supply and becoming rich.
Not as crazy as you think, it happened in the french revolution."
"Humankind's technology, quite possibly Humankind's doom. 
Trying to ""play God"" has global consequences & repercussions. 
We should have NEVER allowed such ""sacred magic""(science/technology as it currently is) to the entire masses of the world. 
Nature's Law maintains a balance, but SINFUL-GREEDY humans disrupted that balance long ago. The Balance is ever becoming too ""far gone"".. History WILL repeat itself. 
It's just getting too HEAVY on one side......"
Ironically Haber was the vital component in the deaths of millions. Haber knew his invention was going to be used as a weapon as he worked on it.
Climate change is transitory
"Yeah, the Earth will be just fine"

"Science brung us to this dance, but I don’t think science will take us home."

The title reminds me of Watchman
"Lmao, I immediately thought the logic was for fishing, having a shore boundary from the land before intentional waters and giving you a buffer to fish. Didn't even think of guano and fertilizer. Guano also has a very different NPK btw: Mexican bat guano, for example is 3-3-1, whereas Jamacian  bat guano is 7-3-1, and Indonesian bat guano is 0-20-0 which is zero nitrogen. Same as seabirds and their diet."
"Not to mention depletion and lack of nutrients prior to harvest to pull all the last nutrients from the roots, providing a symbiotic norm ending the growth cycle and degrading of other organic compounds that finalize most plants to what we accept in foraging them such as a ripe versus growing fruit."
"Using random guano without knowing the NPK composition will 100% fail, or at best just have average yields. Adding heavy nitrogen in vegetative state is great, but you need heavier nutrients during different growth periods."
What is this video about?? Can somebody tell me?? Unfortunately I don't have timr to watch this video 😢
Just watch it
Another interesting person was Norman Borlaug with regards to food
"Some say that Clara Haber was actually the better - smarter - chemist and paved the way for some of Fritzs inventions. She herself couldn't get a lot of credit for them, being a women. Perhaps she felt responsible?

As a biologist I also learned about Fritz Haber in several perspectives and for me as a scientist, he is a warning. Just because you can invent it, should you? You are responsible for your research and you should at least make an informed decision. Several biographies about Haber report that he was so deep in science that he didn't really see the conflict it produced. And that he was troubled by the events following is inventions, when he couldn't stop the avalanche of inventions based on his techniques anymore. He was supposedly not an immoral or sadistic person. He was just so...fanatic about science that he missed the bigger picture. It paints a good lesson for any upcoming scientists and we should learn from it morally."

"Just saying, servers are housed in giant buildings near me. They have substations and transmission line feeding them. Everyone's clouds, games, videos, movies and more. Needing power forever. Is A.I. already winning. When these facilities can produce power I will be scared."

"That was an amazing and if what you said in the last bit was true then it might be the solution we have been looking for to a situation we put ourselves. As i read somewhere ""only time will decide if it is good or bad"""

"This was one of the best Veritasium episodes I have ever seen. The science, story, and message kept me locked in the whole way through and I didn’t want it to end."
I can't be the only one who read the title as 'The Man Who Killed Minions and Saved Billions'
And somehow with this we still cannot feed people
Psst capitalism
I won't considered him hero for developing ammonia but killing people in it's recreation of deadly chemicals.
""" Innumerable lives could be saved that the war could be ended more quickly in this way"".
The thing that scares me the most is that he is so convinced in his moral belief to serve his country that he was blinded by the truth which is the catastrophic destruction of his creation. He has done what he thought was best for his people and country. How scary human belief is. It just takes one person with a single wrong idea that would bring death to millions."

For someone so smart your really caught up in the carbon cult. The carbon = bad people make it seem  like plants and life don't use carbon dioxide to  perpetuate life.
"One man, who is hero, as well as villain. What should be the feeling of that man in his life?"
"I feel like this story shares so much with the Story of James Chadwick. Englishman who discovered the existence of the Neutron and later won a Nobel Prize for the discovery, but it paved the way for nuclear fission and Chadwick ended up working on the Manhattan Project himself to the dismay of his old professors and colleagues. He was interned in while studying in Germany when WWI started and when he went back to England he argued heavily to build a small particle collider while working in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. His discovery has the future potential to give us nuclear power, but obviously there is are two extremes to his contributions toward science."
"Science is good but how we use science ultimately defines how good it is. Nowadays, all major scientific inventions are getting used for military rather than the development of the deprived."
Thank the leaders
"Nobel, who invented TNT, believed it would make wars shorter and more humane.  
Same with machine guns.  
And Haber convinced himself that poison gas would shorten wars, and be more humane.  
How wrong. How deluded."
Such a grim expression of an appalling turn of events.
"I think these are the types of stories that should be taught in school. We should stop painting history as this black and white thing, it seldom is. Haber was all at once considered a hero and a villain, but his contributions to society can't be understated. Without him many people in the world today would likely not be alive, but at the same time more people would have survived the great wars."
thats f*cking hitler
He didn't save anyone and you didn't watch the video
"He was shunned by everything and everyone. His wife killed herself, his money was worthless after his ""success"" scientists didn't want to associate with him, nor did the Nazis."
"Your summary was spot on. Every new discovery is always neutral in its core. (Nuclear Bomb vs Nuclear reactor, or even $ to feed people vs $ to kill/harm people). I wouldn't blame those who discovered nuclear energy, but I would definitely blame those who were DIRECTLY OR EVEN INDIRECTLY involved in the Manhattan Project. Haber's mistake was he actively worked to produce chemical weapons."
"Don't shame a person who does his best for his country. It is the world politics that sets us apart. Look at UN, what good has it done so far apart from fancy democratic meetings."
Who else guessed fertilizer as soon as you saw the first 7 seconds??
"Hello Vertasium, The N2( Nitrogen is a gaseous state) is not beneath the Soil, Come on man, It is in the air because it is a gas, The Plant takes it from the air and stores it in its root clot to bombard the soil and sprout outward , we only consume mere fractional N2 from the plant. We eat mere nitrogen ,but we inhale lot from the atmosphere, that is why our Urine contains lot of N2 wasted out from body cell. Anyway Just curious !, Did the Pope said that our earth(Soil) contains N2 ? Oh yea ,  Who knows , He  would, He would impose Sunday law sooner too. The Pope says God is not magician( Why Should God be a magician ? The creator of heaven and earth Gen:1:1 KJV).He also backs mankind evolved from monkey( The Monkey Pope, let him preach his satanic gospel to monkeys then). He now says , Nature existed itself ( Laudato Si).....still His/Her abomination will continue to reach Heaven....Psalm 73:9 KJV . Otherwise it is wonderful documentary. Keep up. By the by , not to mention Fritz Haber was financed and founded by The Satanic Vatican Jesuit Papacy."

"If you say Fritz Haber killed millions for inventing a weapon you would also think e.g. Albert Einstein killed millions? They both havent killed people, but invented technology that others used to kill people. This is click bait imho."
"We learn from Frankenstein that creator and creation are seperate. He made something to help everyone but He was always going to be a bad person. He pushed on in the beginning because of competition not for the love of science. He kept going because of the fame and fortune not for the science. He made the choice to switch to weapons to kill millions but what he made before all that is separate from who he is as a man. Creating doesnt make you bad, wanting to use it for those things does."

Did he save Billions of lives?  Or did he create an artificial population boom dependent on fossil fuel?
Good idea
He really lived long enough to become the villain.

"""Bacteria only replenish the nitrogen slowly."" As a farmer, it is a bit disappointing to see synthetic nitrogen fertilizers portrayed as they are in this video. Ammonia produced by the Haber reaction is a soluble form that feeds plants to grow fast without nourishing the soil or providing micronutrients. It is soluble and highly erodible, and poisons waterways. Its concentrations can kill some soil bacteria. Thus, the use of this kind of nitrogen is not allowed in organic farming. Instead, we use leguminous cover crops that give habitat to the N-fixing microbes and supercharge their contribution. The crops can then be incorporated into the soil to release the nitrogen for the cash crop. Animal integration and composting are also great ways to cycle nitrogen back to the soil without consuming ungodly amounts of energy (fossil fuel), and which are actually regenerative to the farm ecosystem. With proper management, cover cropping and natural inputs produce just as much yield as conventional systems, while being more beneficial to the soil and more resilient to adverse climate conditions (Rodale Institute). I know that this isn't the main philosophical point of your video, but I think that this idea that the Haber reaction was an amazing thing for the world is a bit of a myth. Cover cropping has been used for thousands of years. The only reason synthetic fertilizer was needed was because of loss of indigenous farming practices and poor land management."
"@Scott Eskridge okay, then you will give this labor first... 
Exept that, like most people you dont want to spend 4 hours à day farming crops..."
"There is also something called natural farming or fukuoka method, but it takes some time.
I guess using artificial fertilizer like that gave some companies big box and as we know companies are crazy about quarterly profits, the CEO's life depends on it."
Where can I learn more of this?
"@Phobos look into regenerative agriculture more, your repeating things youve been told that are only half true. Many organic farming practices are either more labor or land intensive, but there is enough land and labor to feed orders of magnitudes more people than we currently have with far fewer chemical inputs and far less use of fossil fuels. However it would involve a massive change in infrastructre that can't be done quickly or cheeply (see the failure in sri lanka). But there are a number of farmers and ranchers that are incorporating more animals and cover crops into their process with increased profits and yeilds."

For his role in World War 1, his ends was the end of the war with Germany as the victor. He took what he had and did what he thought was necessary to meet those ends. As a patriot, I can only imagine it meant a lot to him.

I'm just glad he died before having a chance to witness the Nazi's use for his inventions.


In humouring those closing statements. We should educate society as a whole on how to use our knowledge responsibly and ethically, while teaching about the dangers of using our knowledge irresponsibly."
The literal worm hole we just found.
This video is my science lesson for the summer
A sponsored video and you still put in so many ads
What a world
"So you don't blame the politicians who started the wars for the deaths, or the soldiers using the weapons to kill, or even the manufacturers of the weapons... you blame the person who invented the weapons. I'm speechless."
"Why would the soldiers be blamed, they’re just doing what they’re told"
"It might have well been his wife's idea he stole. Fritz Haber taking the credit for something she invented and then got misused agaanst soldiers. The Nobel Prize for Fritz Haber's invention would go to his wife, but at the time an academic woman, let alone a nobel prize winner, was almost inconcievable. So with these heavy truths of her invention being stolen and misued for war, she ended her own life. All speculation, but still possible."
I thought zyklon B was used for delousing?
When ingenuity is harnessed devoid of the indwelling of light and truth in the heart and mind on the common cause of humanity .......
20:30 has the entire video in one sentence
"It saddens me that people think ""the holocaust"" was a real thing. This video was decent until that fiction was injected."
wtf
And as a German with both German and Polish heritage it saddens me people like you denies it.
Who else remembers Guano from Ace Ventura 2 ?
wish haber didnt work that out fr
My tribe was still hunter/gatherers. So Im pretty sure I don’t owe Habar for being alive today.
One of your best videos ever! We're in a golden age of Veritasium content! Thanks for all your hard work!
"Carbon is not evil, and the planet is fine. Ask any real climatologist or environmental Physicist like Dr. Will Happer... 
Excess CO2 emissions in South America is aiding in the regrowth of the jungles of the Amazon (for example)"
"He may have used his knowledge and talents for deadly purposes, but regardless I respect and understand his reasons for doing so. His studies and experiments were no different than the Manhattan Project."
"I'm not so sure if I would consider him inventing fertilizer as a great thing. Totally threw off the natural balance of this world and look at us now. Fighting and killing for more and more resources that just aren't going to be there forever. Humanity will collapse, but by then we'll probably be off infecting other planets with our hate of natural balance."
lots of music from Clockwork Orange in this video... hmmmm
14:55 The same argument was for Hiroshima bombing 😞
how ironic that a Jewish scientist developed gas that later would be used to kill Jews. How twisted history turns out to be sometimes…
"The irony, a jewish mass murderer developped the weapon that would be used against his own. And others created far worse. Ever heard of the Golem ? When you create a monster to fight your enemies, once they are done, you are next. Maybe read your books and understand them, next time."
"Without science we wouldn't be where we are. As a metallurgist, I create new alloys all the time. Without other chemists like Haber, my work would take decades. Like any good scientist, I look at the numbers and the data. He saved Billions and that he did on purpose with his experiments into nitrogen. He is a hero. The millions of deaths were caused not by him but by evil men using his technology. That was not his fault. 
As for the Chlorine. Hating on Haber for trying to aid his country in the only way he knew during a war? The victors write history and the Germans lost WWI, so... Take all of this with a grain of salt. For all we know, his wife was shot by an assassin's bullet."
"If you make weapons for a nation or private institution, you're not a scientist, you're a specialist."
"Nobel prize (from the creator of dynamite) a lot of these awards were given under such circumstances, either way, the guy who created the lobotomy got a nobel prize and we all know how that worked in the further years - side note, he was portuguese, hehehe siuuuu"
Eren
I like you to produce one or more episodes on Carbon and if it is justified to be considered bad guy in the climate warming. It is controversial as you mostly likely know and we need to go beyond the advertised narrative that we need to suppress carbon by any means possible since it is like a poison for our planet!
"Great video man! The narration of this video really inspires me as I would love to be in the documentary industry for my career. This video is also very thorough in unveiling the historical events that this man has condoned. The visual imagery shown are well thought out, the camera angles, shots really greatens the impact of your take. Overall I find this 22 minute video extremely informative and entertaining. I recommend teachers to show this video to their class."
That’s just horrifying… what a freak
"HOW DOES carbon dioxide destroy the planet?   is not co2 the building block REQUIRED by plants in the presence of sunlight to use chlorphyll to generate oxygen?     Would not a higher co2 promote more plant growth providing more food for people and put more water vapor into the atmosphere which would lower the temperatures taken due to the latent heat effect of the new moisture??????

co2 is not a pollluant but it is the building block of life who without would not be any carbon based life on this planet."
This is like the exact opposite of a redemption arc. Tragic.
You are one of the best people on earth. thanks
"Everytime we innovate we make weapons out of it, the latest example is social media"
Meanwhile Canada’s and the Netherlands Fascist dictators are attempting to ban Nitrogen fertilizer because “science.” …
And meth got WAYYY better.
"Besides his hate for the Jewish people, Hitler's plan was very much about killing millions to save money. Any government who has toyed in eugenics is doing it to rid society of its ""extra weight""."
more like doomed billions.  our generation is likely the last of civilized way of life.
Aw so this is where he got his inspiration from
"“Perhaps, more than any other single person, he has shaped the world we live in today.”
Spoken by someone who obviously has never considered the world and culture-shaping influence of the most impactful, influential single person in all of human history…

Jesus of Nazareth. 

There’s a reason the story of His life is considered the greatest story ever told, and why ‘history’ is considered HIS-story. 

No other single human being in history even comes close to this One Who was born in a barn, laid in a feeding trough, unjustly criminally prosecuted by His own, put to death and then rose from the dead, impossibly fulfilling countless prophecies, and has changed the lives—every single time for the better—of multiplied billions of people who have met Him, over the last 2000 years. 

And one day, every human being, and angel, for that matter, will stand before His judgment seat and give an account for even every thought. 

He was crucified for YOU. It was YOUR sin and HIS LOVE that held Him there. 

CALL UPON JESUS CHRIST. SEEK HIM WHILE HE MAY BE FOUND. AND YOU WILL KNOW HIS TENDER MERCIES AS WELL."
"Always interesting, thank you."
Great storytelling. But the audio and video seem to be out of sync.
The answer to your final question: eliminate sociopaths from the earth. It's really simple.
Well norway did nitrogen splitting first with birkeland-eyde proces.
Nice pun on “nitrogen fix”!
"Very interesting. But I completely disagree with your conclusions. You can’t ask that everything discovered never be used maliciously, but absolutely can ask that the goal of a research be not the horrors that this man created.

“Someone else would’ve done it” is never an excuse. We are all responsible for our actions, and Haber is incredibly responsible for his. He IS the other guy. And not only did he contribute, he went out of his way to push, promote, and devise things that no one had even asked for yet.

Yo can’t say the present would be the same. We don’t know that. All we know is that he did NOT work for the benefit of humanity but for his own, and in the most gruesome way.

In the end zyklon B was not simply a pesticide. It was a pesticide developed in a death think tank trying to make profits on now unused abominations.

And he did not save billions. You can’t save someone who doesn’t exist. Is the state of the world so fantastic today that we can say 4 billion more people is an achievement to applause? Do we justify the atrocities?"
"Hello Veritasium! I think an episode on  Sidney Gottlieb, project Bluebird and MKUltra could be amazing and show how worldwide the quest for more potent toxic chemicals has been and still is. Would love to hear your take on it."
Scientists should take a hypocritic act
"I disagree with your last statement, ""regard him irrelevant to the larger story because someone else would have figured out how to process nitrogen out of the air."" This argument takes away the person's determination and dedication to this problem. This argument is weak as it can be applied to any circumstance, for example. Einstein can be regarded as irrelevant to the larger story because someone else would have figured out the theory of special relativity. It's based on assumptions that can't be proven."
Hate to say this but A.I. is the way we do this without destroying ourselves but that could also destroy us.
"if plants get nitrogen from soil. why cant we just eat soil, skip the middleman."
@Lofty I figured but 😂
@DARK-LORD-VINAY incase you didn't know. i was being sarcastic. but thank you for explaining.
Cause plants use photosynthesis to create biochemicals we use to  make up our selves and this process was favoured through evolution. Guess we gotta find a  way for our cells to have chloroplasts for photosynthesis but we would all be green :)
"18:37 i am speechless that you pronounced basel right. I am very pleased, thank you!"
"Hitler was also hit with chlorine and mustard gas during the war, on top of injuring his leg when a artiliry shell exploded next to him previously. He was temporarily deaf and blind, and was recovering in the hospital when he found Germany had surenderred. The treaty of Versailles forced the Germans to reduce their military to 100000,  also Germany to pay debt of close to 1 Trillion US to the allies adjusted for inflation, they had to resort to print money like mad until the currency crashed and became useless, Hitler, like millions of Germans was homeless and wondered on the streets for many years."
"most of the evil are perpetrated not by the men of science themselves but by governments and men of power who are evil.
perhaps some scientific independence and restricting the authority of men who don't share the scientist's heart may be an incredible route  to try."
"I expect U will impose same condemnation upon sub-atomic research, electricity, automobiles, currency, on & on, ... All involved murderous with tragedy in their wake?"
"Extraordinary Intellect, but ended up using invention for evil."
100 000 dead in a war with 20 million casualties gives some perspective.
We should be learning about this in school
"I feel like no good is ever going to come out of wanting to keep ""control on the natural world"". Isn't it supposed to be just that : natural ?"
"This dude doesn't even try pronouncing ""Georg"" right lmao"
"Dude, a small heads-up before you decide to deep throat the camera"
A hypocrite. More interested in science than humankind.
"Honestly, I understand Haber, he did what he thought was best, although he caused some horrible stuff to happen, I don't believe that he did it out of malice, I can't paint him as a villain for that, is like Derek said, all scientific discoveries are like a double-edged sword, splitting atoms, for example, can be used to make nuclear energy or to create fission bombs."
"@Samuel Mason I mean, that was the opposite of Devil's advocate, but I understand you point."
"Devil's advocate here, I see. Clearly a villain, he chose what to do with the science and he chose to make chemical weapons. He chose his side"
"Your conclusion is excellent!  We must realize that we humans have misused everything we have ever touched, to include sticks and stones and even drowning each other.  It does appear education is just about our only hope.  Best of luck to all of us!"
"""misused everything we have ever touched""... I try to think of something but then I realize there's Rule 34."
If I were guaranteed everything I do would not be used as a weapon I would be willing to do a lot more.
"Maybe Tesla wasn't generating electricity for power generation.
Perhaps he was attempting to harvest nitrogen en masse.
Makes me think."
so the world is over populated and dying thanks to him. humans are a plague
Funny the Media in the UK used that explosion you showed in Beirut and said it was Russia bombing Ukraine.
"The real value of Guano is by its content of phosphate compounds, not nitrates. You will find up to 60% (in rare cases) of nitrates, but around 20% phosphates. But the decisive ratio that will lead to organics to grow is 1:6 for PO4:NO3. Guano, and many other fertilzers, work mostly through providing phosphate to plants!"
This was really thought provoking love your work
"E = mc2. 
It's interesting that these two were friends and they did so much in both directions.
This was a really interesting video."
"Ethical amendments,  IP should be linked to the desire of the inventor to contribute to society and if the event of a unintended and significantly  damaging secondary uses of that invention that unwanted applications should be limited by fines, restrictions, sanctions that delegitimize its misuse."
Her words make me think she developed the technology and he weaponized it. Everywhere I go men and women steal my work so it's easy to believe.
I also thought the same thing
"He did the K in NPK and hes has now covered the N in NPK now all that is P.

Americas use 25% of world resources don't talk about reducing carbon emissions lol
"Let's call it a spade a spade. 

It's all too common to use the fallacy that many lives had been saved as a compromise, while the truth is saying that our post modernist thinkers these days like to  excuse something monstrous was done, all in the name of the holy science. It's nothing but an attempt to use science as a ruse to excuse the inexcusable. 

If someone did today something that would end up killing millions of people, although having as an indirect consequence, the future increase the world population, no one would every call it as a heroic act. 

Just stop putting science in such a high ground, and you'll see that a monstrous act is still a monstrous act."
"Look's like fauci . He got 4 billion people to take the bioweapon and he made millions , kinda the same ."
"its always good to remember ""The best of men, are still men at best""  Don't hoist someone too high or tear them down too much.  We're all flawed individuals."
"If no one had invented the ammonia extraction process, humans would have to forcibly switch to a mostly vegetarian diet, dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions"
This man's kill cam is a livestream
"""To perpetrate the holocaust"" is a really sanitised way of saying what that gas was used for. It's this sort of prevaricating that leads to younger generations not realising the full extent of the horrors that took place in WWII, and leads towards an increasingly ambivalent attitude towards Nazis, where even 15 years ago there was no mistaking that they were the bad guys. Let's be clear, that gas was used in death camps and killing centres to murder hundreds of thousands of the Jews and allied prisoners of war. Your phrasing comes across as cowardly at best, and at worst, neutral to such atrocities."
I really hope a solution similar to this happens for human caused global warming
Veritasium supports nazis
Now governments are forcing farms to reduce nitrogen fertilizer by 40%. Revolution will occur across the earth against genocidal policies and governments.
"great animation, informative video"
"You're a scientific guy. You have all of this critical thought on your channel. Yet, you still believe that carbon dioxide, a gas which greens vegetation and improves all sorts of sustainability, which composes like 0.03% of the gasses in the atmosphere, of which humans contribute less that 2% overall, is somehow the factor in the current changing climate.

Millions of years of evolution down to a fraction of a percent in a single non-dominant gas.

Also, your solution is essentially paying rich people.

You're a gifted presenter, but this is crazy."
U shud do a video on Allen Turing he saved 14 million lives and ended ww2 two years early. Without him we may not have won the war in our world would be a very different place. I really wish the countries of the world or at least the allied nations should invoke a holiday in his honor especially since he never got the appreciation he so rightly deserved just because he was gay.
Amazing content
Keep dreaming
"He didnt saved billions if there was less food, there will be less people. What he did  was monsterous"
"Changed the world moreso than someone like Caesar? I find it hard to believe. Perhaps he's impacted more lives, but in no way changed the world as much as some other historical figures."
"I read the title of this video as “man who killed minions, saved billions” while I was scrolling through my feed. Was so confused"
The real question is..if he should go to heaven or hell ?
This guy is a pawn in the NWO
Surprised there was no mention of the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995 to show the explosive nature of ANNM. Deadliest domestic terrorist attack in US History. 168 murdered by Timothy McVeigh.
"The answer to that question at the end: ""How do we keep increasing our knowledge..."" and avoid the double edged sword is actually obvious:
""Legal"" Secrets create ""profitable"" Wars.  When humanity stops lying to itself, we will stop killing each other. We can and should let Truth and Care guide all of our decisions."
"People attempting to create ways to help, can be used by the wrong people, and the wrong people never take responsibility for their actions. If his relationship with his wife was unpleasant it's possible he did this because the military gave him a sense of community something he wasn't getting at home. It is never a good idea to socially isolate people and expect healthy results."
Die a hero or see your self become a villian
More like die a villains or see yourself become a Hero because he invented the gas first
Excellent video!
This is how I feel about creating a solar powered bore tool. In the right hands it could create geothermal energy for the entire planet. In the wrong hands it could be a planet destroying death ray.

"in a way Haber is Germany post 1900 personified: the most developed country in the world, Berlin THE place to be if you were a scientist. so much done for the modern world.
and then so much terrible sh** happened. done by and to Germans, against and by the allies. instead all could have come together and the world would be 100 years better off then its now."

"Haber had no qualms about subjecting enemy combatants to immense suffering and breaking the rules of the Geneva convention
""Unlike Einstein, Haber was a patriot"" 
Well that's not really the conclusion I drew from it but... Okeey"
"Correction: ""The Man Who Killed Thousands and Saved Billions"""
This is how I feel about cracking encryption. In the right hands it could stop human trafficking. In the wrong hands it could aid and conceal any corrupt act.
Now I understand the oligarch's war on fertilizer and nitrogen. It's to decrease the population.
How is this stuff free…Veritasium is free inspiration to me
"This is also how I feel about the ability to make or prevent volcanos from erupting. I know with the right minds it is possible to control, but would it be wise to allow such technology to exist. If we force small volcanic eruptions it could cool the planet and release the pressure that prevents large volcanic eruptions, but if the wrong person got ahold of the technology they could create large volcanic eruptions."
"We already have  such technology, drop 50 megaton nuke in volkano"
The same method that can split the planet can also cause volcanic eruptions.
"And the rogue governments around the world are saying stop using fertilizer ""for the benefit of the earth'  To now force us into a forced starvation compliance, as in if you need aid to eat; take the poison vaccines bill gates made......  oh how the tables turned."

Nice video. At the end though: to offset my carbon footprint I use your calculator then pay you monthly for my guilt of carbon emissions? Sounds like a tax
This is how I feel about the ability to split a planet in two. It could be used to kill the planet or it could be used to destroy a planet sized asteroid headed at a planet with life on it. In the right hands it could save us all. In the wrong hands it could kill us all.

"He wanted to kill a few people fast to get a lot more people to not fight at all. Same reason people gave for nuclear bombs.

Roosevelt was successful with the project Manhattan, and the difference of the nuclear bomb and ammonia is that ammonia doesn't sterilized and leave a land unhabitable for decades, it just (hurts) burns a lot, I even think it can be used as an industrial cleaner (I might be wrong tho)."

How does putting a closed bottle under water increase pressure inside it? It doesn't work like that.
Give him the Nobel Prize for one thing and put him in prison for the other. Bad deeds do not erase good ones nor do good deeds erase bad. And what he did in regards to chemical warfare was an international war crime even at the time...
I agreed when he said each scientific discovery is a double edge sword.
He killed his wife
"This is the problem with a lot of scientists throughout history and to this day. Science is science. If it helps people great. If it hurts people, oh well. It’s about the science. The moral repercussions aren’t even considered. The old, “You were so concerned about whether or not you could you center stopped to think of you should...” Although you said this guy considered himself a “patriot.” So maybe he knew exactly what he was doing? Plenty of chauvinists out there of all persuasions. Who would help feed their own people but create horrible weapons to use against other people..."

"Food not bombs.  Perhaps the WEF cult wants to cut the supply of farmers use of it so they can divert it to making bombs. I think we’re already in WW3.

"Honestly, destructive discoveries are not a problem if stupid politicians and rulers were not there. Most of the time it was a stupid guy who would use these discoveries to get control of some territory or something. Case is the same till this day. Politicians want scientists to discover something for their country ignoring that a discovery is made for the world not some stupid country who can't feed their people because their politicians are too greedy. These people wipe away population to expand their territories and spread fear, which without any population means nothing. Why the hell do these stupid people have power, just to ruin science? An achievement is a pride to the whole humanity not just a country, state or a city. I think if scientists throughout the world come together instead of doing something being divided by nations, we can achieve more at a real faster pace."
There is no way in hell guano ever traded at 4-1 in gold. You need a decent amount of guano when you use it for farming. I used to grow weed hydro and organic and I used guano is my organic mix. If I had to trade 1 pound of gold for 4 pounds of guano... Lol. I would not operate at a profit. And that for relatively expensive weed it relatively small pots. Trading 1 gold for 4 guano when you are farming relatively cheap corn in relatively huge field of soil? Gtfoh. This is one of those times when common sense and experience HAS TO trump any source. Especially a source from 170 years ago...
"@Ben Haney ""now"""
And of course you don’t NEED guano...
"Actually, I MIGHT still barely operate at a profit... Maybe... Wouldnt be worth it anymore though. My labor would probably break down to less than half of minimum wage. But crunching the numbers I might just barely operate at a profit. But still. That’s weed in small pots..."
"Gold is 1,700$..."
Guano is like 3-5$ an ounce now...
4:55 nitrogen fix...I see whatcha did there
there is the question why not use chemistry against selected bad people. morality ?
"He is just a reason, god ""shaped the world where we live right now"".
(Not talking to atheists:))"
"It should be killing billions to save some millions. 

We don't need billions of people...look around and find out."
He seemed more about hubris than being an evil villain. His statement about ending the war quickly to save lives gives a small insight into his psyche. Assigning his chemical warfare work to his wife’s suicide is a bit superficial as depression and deterioration of mental state to self delete is more complex.
"When a marriage is unhappy each partner will find things about the other that they believe is evil. Whatever his other qualities Haber apparently was a bad husband, forbidding his wife to pursue athe career she loved (she too had a chemistry PhD) and neglecting her for decades."
how to create life and death in one go
Had me until you tried to sell environmental bs.
That video title doe
"As you pointed out, the introduction of nitrogen-based fertilizers revolutionized farming and subsequently food production. In fact we require it based on our current global population. So what are we to think now that governments have begun banning nitrogen fertilizers ? I just had this discussion with my neighbor prior to seeing this video. She agreed they should be banned and farmers should merely turn the soil and practice crop rotation. I argued that doesn't replace nitrogen anywhere near fast enough and that burning and turning the soil would be better, but still not enough. I followed that millions would starve. She said ""Good. There are already too many people in the world."" (Charming eh ?) So I asked her ""So who are you going to kill ?"" She smiled secure in the fact that it wouldn't be her.

I'm rather worried that is exactly the same thinking the global oligarchs have."
"Very interesting documentary, though I do not agree with your final statement about ""regard[ing] him as irrelevant to the larger story"". Yes science is a double edge sword but Fritz Haber actively engaged in the development of weapons with the intent to kill. A scientific process can only be weaponized by a scientist willing to harness said process for the purpose of killing. As such scientists should be held accountable for the ethical decisions they make when working on new developments, just as anyone in a position of power should be held accountable for the consequences his/her actions have on the rest of humanity. As you said, if Fritz Haber hadn't developed the aforementioned chemical weapons somewhat else would have, however the fact that HE DEVELOPED said weapons, makes HIM accountable. If accountability is disregarded, that is tantamount to giving everyone a free pass to do anything - a very dangerous road to go down."
In the beginning of this video they were talkin about how if you farm the same soil over and over again you will farm all of the nitrogen out of the soil making it deficient. Fun Fact: The bible talks about humans resting on the 7th day. But the Bible also clearly states that we are instructed to let the soil for the crops rest on the 7th year. This is a command for a reason.
"Just because people who wrote the Bible knew a thing or two about agriculture doesn't mean we should listen to all of it , in other parts of the Bible we do have instructions on how to beat our slaves , so it goes both ways."
"He was a Good Scientist , but he was a even better Employee, cause he did what his Job wanted him to do"
"The goal is not to control nature, that's impossible. Nature is just so much bigger than us. The goal is to work with nature, to be stewards of the natural world around us! Cool video.

"People attempting to get me to do things out of competition and pride made me lose all motivation, because I don't like people who attempt to one up others and I will never be competitive. Even if I win it doesn't feel good. He might have done what he did out of empathy for the needs of others."
"Pride and competition might be why he did this, but some people do things out of empathy for the needs of others. No way for you to know his motivations."
Did anyone else learn this from Joe Rogan 8 or 9 years ago?
"I always knew the process and the chemistry behind it and regarded Haber to be a genius, but never knew the human side of it or the fact that he suffered a tragic personal life because of his intellectual success. Also i didnt know he was a Jewish scientist working for germany in world war one."
"He was a patriot, i respect that."

Incredibly interesting article. Well done Veritasium.
Yup. The germans invented nerve agents
One if not THE most tragic irony of a story that I`ve heard.
bro
"Characterizing bacterial nitrogen fixation as ""slow"" is a bit misleading considering that the association between non-photogenic N fixers and photosynthetic organisms is a survival strategy that has evolved several times across disparate contexts and is the primary reason legumes like beans and peanuts can be grown with little to no nitrogen inputs. Fixing nitrogen with enzymes is far more energy efficient than using high temperature and pressure, and only became possible through burning fossil fuels...and also, all those statistics of comparative yields are in the context of extractive, intensive industrial agriculture and don't take into account the possibility of other modes of agro-ecosystem management. A classic case of history written by the winners is moralizing the happenstance of continuity. We could equally say that many of us (of all backgrounds) wouldn't be here without chattel slavery and plantation culture throughout the Americas. But very few in this current political moment would dare (publically) argue the utilitarian value of these social structures (without also praising the National Socialists in the same breath)."
i wish i killed millions
This is such a great way to communicate stories!
"WHAT AN AMAZING VIDEO! OMG, SCRIPT, EDITING. No words, for this freakingly perfect video"
Makes me wonder why the Dutch are trying to LOWER nitrogen content in the rich fertile soil
A scientist who uses their knowledge for war shall live in misery
"Who knew a paragraph in our chemistry textbooks mentioning Haber’s process had left out so much rich history, euphoria and sadness. Thank you veritasium for telling us such amazing stories."
"Yes, I wouldn't know about the rest until I was well out of university, studying Chemistry."
"@Raja Parameswaranwhere i can find  more such stories if anyone know, any show,sereis,or yt chnnel

Honestly you could say that about almost all history books and excerpts. Only giving you the “key details” while ignoring the actual interesting history that ties these details together.
"What do you mean, ""who knew""?
Why do you think it was mentioned?
You weren't getting a doctorate at that point.
At most, in k -12, you get a back ground solid enough to further your curiosities.
Well, at least that was the goal back before we slid behind 3rd world countries in performance.

"DUde he was so patriot for the country and later hitler killed Jewish.

Imagine that feeling when you work so hard for your country and later your country gives you death and calls betrayer.
I can feel your pain Haber."
You are here bcoz of YouTube algorithm
"The answer to your last question: We have to have scientists who believe in GOD and have a heart. Understand the pain of humans. Otherwise, we are doomed as species if we give the atheist scientists power of killing."
"Unfortunately nobody understands the background of all.
Habers biggest mistake was not work on  poison used in wartime ( as far as I know did the British use  mustard gas in the first world war first, but this seems somehow to be neglected, like the fact that Britain and France declared war on Germany not vice versa)

But Habers biggest mistake was to help humanity grow into an unsustainable world polluting mass of 8 billion people with no end to see. ( exponential growth)
He is the reason why the Georgia Guidestones were erected ( keep humanity at 500 million worldwide therefore recently blown up) and why some world oligarchs decided to shrink the world population with the help of a pandemic narrative forcing everybody to get a healthy jab. 
Tragic person, he was indeed. A great scientist for sure.

PS: Veritasiums offer to help offset our carbon emissions is a joke. 
First the climate change swindle is a swindle ( somehow related to the above)
and second, CO2 is a very helpful necessary element in our atmosphere which helps to grow our planet green.
The statement that CO2 is heating up our planet is a fairytale invented by the atomic industry which is expecting good business in the future.
Everybody who is not able to understand the above said, is probably jabbed 3 times, so it is ok."

"As it is often said, the winner in a war gets to write the history. The atomic bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are even more ghastly than Haber’s use of chemical weapons. Unfortunately, they remain unaccountable and even praised as heroes for their actions. Scientists involved in Manhattan project are as much guilty and accountable as Haber, but we don’t hear them."

I think it’d be too much to call him a hero. But I understand what ur trying to say
the duality of things: even the best thought may be turned to something evil.
"Being a Biology/History double major, I got to learn about Fritz Haber on both fronts: Fritz Haber the creator of the Haber-Bosch process (chemistry and biology), and Fritz Haber the creator of chemical weaponry (WWI and WWII history). In biology he's a hero, in history he's a monster. I got a very interesting perspective having him spoken of in two completely different ways depending on the subject he was being taught in."
"in biology he's a monster. the industrialization of food production in this manner has shifted the energy input requirements such that instead of eating the sun, we're eating oil, most places have lost food sovereignty entirely, and those billions can and will starve if the system falls apart"
"Incredible double major. Great choice, you get both outlooks, seriously really cool."
@Francis Maxino Weak mind
"@Black Bard Studio as DRSNova pointed out, he's in good company based on other examples. A patriot that goes in with a gun to fight for his country is exactly the same as Haber with a beaker.

Invented chemical weapon to kill people.  Chemical invented by him was used to kill millions of his people. Truly no one escapes the circle of Karma!
If Haber had been on the winning side he'd be universally considered a hero.

"14:50 Interesting, the same they said about the atomic bomb. But by hearing this story, Mr Haber was probably too much into chemistry itself, neglecting moral questions and just pushing his inventions, and apparently neglecting his family as well."
"​@zstanojevic I would not call him a Nazi. Strictly nationalsocialisim was created after his ww1 actions.

"Actually, we haven’t even reached the levels of the worst heat and climate effects visited upon our ancestors at the beginning of the last century. Fires were bigger, droughts were longer, temps were higher, fires were bigger, it’s all available in historical records and yet we ignore this. I find it funny to think we some how believe the climate to normally be a static thing, that somehow only humans bring about change at scale. Governments can’t solve any major problems that their citizens suffer under and have failed to do so for hundreds of years and yet now their are promises that we can somehow solve the “climate” if only we just give up enough, change enough or do more (or less). Increasingly climate policy is being used to piggy back societal change that doesn’t benefit society and rather centralizes control of our lives while crushing the middle class. The key to solving any climate issue is to make wealthy as many nations as possible, give as many people as possible a chance to climb from abject poverty and to a better quality of life, instead, in the name of climate change, first world nations are pulling the ladders up behind them and preventing billions from achieving some semblance of quality of life because we believe the majority must suffer so we can solve for carbon in our atmosphere. Remmeber, the science says nothing, people do; science doesn’t tell us we can solve this problem, or that there even is one, but we interpret the data in such a way that many believe it is a problem…that we can solve. In abstract it all seems plausible and doable, in reality this is total insanity. Citing a changing climate as proof of human factors isn’t supportive of the carbon-as-evil problem being posed."
Username checks out I guess
"His wife Clara reportedly spoke out against her husband's research as a “perversion of the ideals of science” and “a sign of barbarity, corrupting the very discipline which ought to bring new insights into life.” I don't think it was any coincidence that she chose to commit suicide after the release of chlorine gas killing thousands. Clara was financially independent before marriage, was one of the firstwomen to get a chemistry PhD, she helped Haber's work with no recognition for her contributions, and was left to raise their child alone. Apart from being deeply unhappy, I think Clara also committed suicide as a final protest against what Haber had become. Give the woman some credit."
"Give her credit for killing herself and selfishly leaving her kid alone? Nah. You want to off yourself, that's on you. But if you are a parent and do it, I have no sympathy."
"@Sara Eissa all of this is just words. You can't check any, so don't cling to ideologies."
She is no hero for killing herself. She left his son alone. It wasnt a protest.
"According to the little blurb at the bottom of the screen when he talked about her suicide, there's no reputable source for her ever having said that."
Quite informative. Thanks
Being a patriot blind you to lot's of things. I don't blame him. He had a choice. He chose wrong. Never be a blind patriot.

Get rid of for-profit weapons manufacturing and end all wars for oil and corrupt power.  Scientists won't be attracted by the money.
Aaah That's the famous Haber's process.. Learned about that in my high school Chemistry 👨‍🔬
"Dude seems like a complete wad. “Bigger weapons will end the war faster” is a classic excuse for people who just love playing the war game. Wonder how he felt watching his hard work kill people in mass. His contribution doesn’t make him a good man, just an intelligent one whose discovery happened to have a hugely beneficial effect"
"@Ken Oliver What do you want me to say about him? It's the same as any other person working on weapons made for war. The only difference I can find is that he claims he expected it to be used on buildings and not people, but he was directly working for the army in top secret, he know very well what he was doing."
"@Mitchell So, how do you feel about the US scientists who developed napalm?"
Well atomic bomb end ww II faster 🤔
"That's exactly how I feel as well. This isn't a case of inventions with good intent being used to do awful things, this man was actively working on weapons meant to give their opponents a horrid death. Sure, in theory bigger weapons can end the war faster and save lives, but most of the time it just means the war gets extended and even more lives are lost. You don't need to be a scientist to figure that out, yet this dude was one."

"Tl;dw: Fritz Haber was a turn-of-the-century German chemist who discovered a process to make synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, which allowed global food production to support the billions of people alive today (saving billions), but he also applied his technology to help produce chemical weapons and explosives (killing millions). But you should watch the video too...there's more nuance to the story than that."

Brilliant video 👍👍

"0:56 DOG GONE IT, YOU THREW OFF THE GOOVE!!!!!!"
"Its kind of ironic that here put aside the statement of haber as crazy, about the saving lives if the war endet quicker due to his newer weapon inflicting fear in the enemies mind and so forcing them to negotiate, but its literally the same argument that was/(is?) prevalent with US-military officials/government back than about dropping the atomic bomb on Japan. So that Japan is forced to negotiate quickly and save countles lives that would be killed if the war was prolonged with use of only common weapons. What i want to say is that surelly both statements are wrong but we get one served as patriotic and the other as crazy."
Killing millions to save billions just means bad or retarded science.
@East Afrika eh? Not quite sure which aspects you're talking about (do you mean colonisation of a bunch of the world?) but as explained in the video this was quite a prevalent problem at the time
"@akgfilming what you mean is he created his own version, out of countless possibilities, it's just that no one else was focused on the same problem, especially since most of the world had be devastated by European barberism."
"I mean he didn't kill millions *to* do that, it was a separate thing which wasn't necessary for ""saving"" billions, which came before anyway (and I don't think saving is even really the word, he kinda... Created them, in a way.)"

I'm shure that the people in Japan are big fans of Einstein's work ?
he looks too much like Hitler i dont like it
"I really liked this very informative and eye opener video, yes, I fully agree and insist that Chemistry or any inventions/developments must be used for good and betterment of humanity, mother nature."
If it werent for what he did most of us wouldnt be here today
We are all human. Even with the best of intentions we can do wrong and even with the worst of intentions there is a chance of doing right. We can never be 100 percent accurate in our endeavours it is the natural fault in our nature. Only the Alpha and Omega are free of any wrong doing!
"Yes, this was the one of many examples of reasons which process of people start to lose faith in human mind and nature with potential for improvement that were the key parts of modernist doctrin; then with the welfare area provided by modernist era, post-modernist phylosophical thinking which isn't not more than contextomy literature took the flag and made men a hollow shell that is rolling in the destiny."
"Great video. Except for the nonsense ""one last thing"". Zyklon B was used to delouse camp inmates clothing, not ""gas"" them. They've done forensic tests on the bricks of the supposed ""gas chambers"" (and their inward opening wooden doors lol) and found no traces, whereas the bricks of the clothing fumigation chambers are dyed straight through. 
Oh well. Keep up the good work, minus the kosher fairy tales."
"Individual humans are irrelevant to global carbon emissions.

"This is the type of subject which should be taught in schools.

"Damn! Great episode! And Great perspective! It's up to us to some degree how we use technology good or bad.

Isn't basalt rock high in aresenic, so would that increase it? Or......."
"Great video! Only that I find it insensible that you showed footage of the Beirut Port Explosion without issuing a trigger warning beforehand. This has caught me and many fellow Lebanese viewers off-guard in revisiting one of our country's most traumatic events. Please be more considerate in future videos, and thank you for all your work!"
🙄
Everything for science Fritz Haber must have thought. Result: A family neglected! 👪 Wife dead by suicide. Son dead by suicide... What a great and happy family that must have been. (Sarcasm button ON) 🥺
@ِ Could be indeed. But when loved ones die by suicide you never will be the same again. Never!
Both of us would probably not be alive if it werent for what he did
"So…. For this carbon offset thing… is this a recognized offset for governments that are working on carbon tracking/credit systems to go along with ESG ratings? Like, do you get a certified and recognized carbon credit that can be reported to the government to be able to continue driving to work for the month or to be able to buy the things you need etc? Or is it simply a moral choice?"
Six... Muh muh muh million!
"haber used ""phosgene gas "" as a chemical weapon ...
Good video nevertheless..."
Fritz Haber also invented the Cyklon B pesticide.
You were doing very well up until 21.00. But then you started spouting utter nonsense.
"I don't blame the scientists who create the tools, I blame the politicians who use them."
blame the soldiers who use them*
His brother Heinz Haber was world known physicist who wrote many popular science books.
Germans and gas... nobody's surprised
Great video.  Reminds me the story of Alfred Nobel.   Btw the single best thing you can do to reduce your carbon footprint is become vegan.  All the systems and industry connected to animal agriculture is massive.  Animal agriculture is the single biggest reason for deforestation in South America.
If he doesn’t discover this planet will be happier
"When Haber says ""innumerable human lives could be saved if the war is ended quickly this way"" and he becomes a villain but the same thing US and the allies and albert einstein said during ww2 with Hiroshima Nagasaki and they became heroes hypocrisy at its best."
He didn't support hitler guys it was ww1 not ww2 he supported his country just the Americans and the British so  stop being a hypocrite
"I mean I can't blame him for thinking that chemical weapon might help in ending war quickly
Cause it's the same thing allied forces thought before dropping nuke on Japan 
Not just One but Two

Always remember, Road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"Ah, yes.

"@Mark T. any notion of patriotism that values the life of fellow nationals over foreigners is to be condemned in my book. Furthermore, again the narrative the the a-bomb single-handedly defeated Japan is a convenient fairytale we Americans tell ourselves to pretend like our record in WWII was spotless. Wanna throw in supremacy then throw in internment camps and all the imperialism of that era as well. Great man history is far too frequently equated with justified or sympathetic man history, and all of them are myths. Haber didn’t kill millions, nor did he save billions, he was ultimately a ruthless opportunist who used science to get rich and famous, whether that meant developing agtech or mass-poisoning conscripted youth. I’m not equating this guy to Hitler or Stalin, I’m just saying just cuz he’s famous and the main character of this video doesn’t mean he’s a good guy, and most people would think of themselves as the hero if they got to write their own history. Of course you say poisoning is to end the war early rather than get that military contractor money and fame, just like dropping the a-bomb is to make the Japanese surrender instead of intimidating the USSR"
"@Samuel Mason In his own words, his intention of developing chemical weapons was to end the war quicker. Does that excuse the cruel nature of the tool of war he created? No, but it's creation was not made entirely out of pure malicious intent. It's equivalent to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Atomic weaponry is very cruel when the results are realized, but without that technology, Japan would've likely continued fighting on for two, three, how many number of years, with estimates of around a million American casualties and god knows how many Japanese casualties. 129,000–226,000 vs the millions of potential deaths that would've come from Operation Downfall is the more preferable number. The ""sacrifice a thousand to save a million"" dilemmas occur often in crises, wars, and catastrophe's. Often times it truly does boil down to a numbers game and that's the reality no matter how much we don't want to look at it that way. I can't imagine Haber was twirling his mustache like some sort of evil cartoon villain plotting how to continually inflict pain and agony on his enemies forever more. He most likely was thinking of the most efficient way to deny allies the protection of their trenches, thereby breaking the stalemate of trench warfare along with mounting pressure on the Entente with the hopes that they would buckle and approach the negotiating table. Unfortunately, that did not come to pass, but the idea is no different than the atomic bombs we used during WW2. Also there is nothing wrong with having Patriotism, everyone should be proud of the country they were born and raised in, including their nation's history, culture, etc. It's when patriotism mixes with supremacy that it becomes a problem *Cough* WW2 Japan CCP China *Cough*. Saying Patriotism is bad because it's tribalistic is ridiculous. Being part of a ""tribe"" is an inherent part of being a social human. It's natural for people to congregate and form ""tribes"" based on similarities regardless of what those might be. Again, its when it mixes with supremacy that it can lead down a dark path."
"Idk how y’all think “they’re doing it too” and “it’s not all that illegal” are ethical justification, my issue isn’t with him being German, my issue is him developing chemical weapons. This isn’t complicated. I’m not blaming him for the holocaust at all, and to do so is obscene. Also, where did we get this half-baked ideas that patriotism=good and pacifism=bad? Patriotism derives from tribalism so it’s divisive, hence bad. Pacifism derives from empathy typically, it can be a bit overprescriptive but generally comes from a good place. Didn’t think a biographical video about a scientist would have a comment section full of jingoist warmongers ffs"
"@Plugshirt1 I don’t see anyone who was starving back then still alive now, and I’m guessing that tech spread most quickly in more affluent areas with less starvation anyway. Furthermore, I don’t know how much credit he can particularly get for it, considering how many other scientists helped in the discovery and how frequently different scientists reach the same conclusions at very similar times. I think morality is difficult precisely because it largely depends on intent, and considering his development of horribly cruel chemical weapons (intent pretty clear there) Id guess he was much more focused on personal success than the good of humanity. Horrible guy who did science well"
"All scientists are just world destroyers every single one of them, people will only realize or accept it at time world will be about to end."
"@ِ I agree with you and I understood your point, but I just had to be blunt and said all science is wrong because otherwise it would make my comment too long, and then most wouldn't  like reading, but I think too that its human nature to explore and invent, but only if people know the limits, and so I do understand it was all inevitable for all this to happen given human nature, but I do think that is how we will destroy ourself, and that is all absolutely natural too."
"@Shekhar Arya i agree with you in the Overpopulation part. Thats true, the more advanced we are, the mor people. And more people isnt always good. But science itself isnt evil neither is it good, its neutral. As i said Its in our nature to explore and invent. Its who we are and it wont stop"
@Shekhar Arya you can learn some survival guide like how to hunt animal before throwing your phone away

Poor man he accidentally led to the death of millions of his fellow Jews
"That's so corny bro. If I was a famous chemist, and my wife killed herself, and after my death people were debating if I was good or bad, and a video had to drag in my wife's suicide and unhappy marriage, I'd be rolling in my grave. How is Haber being a bad husband relevant to his legacy?"
"it's not only about what he did, its a deeper dive on how he did."
"It's a video about him, this is part of his story, his actions and thus is very important to understand what motivated him afterwards"
another really interesting video
"Its similar, in a way, to Robert McNamara, the first civilian US Defence Secretary, and arguably, the architect of the Tonkin Gulf situation and the heinous war in Vietnam. Before Kennedy hired him, he was the only non-member of the Ford family to be Executive Director. He was in the job for 1 month. Moreover, he was instrumental in adopting the then new 'Safety Belt', the forerunner to the 3 point 'seat belt' we see today. He saved millions of lives. Its a cruel irony."
"I do love that these new videos are a heady mix of science, and history. my 2 favorite subjects!"
at some point you wont be abel to move cuz the entire surface of eathe has been atekn by humans i mean with about 60 billion you could fil like 2x anerica i guess or way more
"When I heard the line “he is responsible for the existence of  4 billion people today”, my reaction was “and it’s good because?” Overpopulation has always been the invisible elephant in the room."
WTF is this? a commerical for BASF or what? to many claim made in this video are so got damn wrong! its shocking! ever thought why we have to prepare the soil and use fertilzer while every other plant surrounding the field doenst need anything to grow?
Very philosophical!!!

"Guns do not kill people, people do.  Till somebody, lifts a gun and deliberately fires it to kill, then it becomes a lethal weapon. Even when fired, the intention may be good or bad.  In a war, it is used to kill and win.  As a defense, it can keep a border safe and the country as a consequence.

Same with any other inventions. Nuclear plants convert uranium to energy to power our homes, machines etc.  The same uranium was used in the two bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Ammonium nitrate can be used as a fertilizer or for an explosion.

It is mankind/humankind that is responsible for the use of these inventions, to benefit or harm."
Now we know why the WEFers are so bent on cancelling global N fertilizer.
"Now I wonder what happened to Haber's Son, who was abandoned by his father immediately after his mother died."

never felt emotional by watching scientific history video. really sad. from saving lifes to destroying lifes. crazy.
The way to fix this is regenerative Agriculture
What's regenerative agriculture I forget I think I watched something about it
"Haber was niether good nor bad he was student of science ,a researcher ,trying to uncover things this world hides .One cannot and should not blame what happens with a scientist's research (Einstiens research was used in an even worst way was he bad?) .About him being a patriot - victors write the history - obviously on would feel he was evil because his country lost ,his acts may seem cruel but i pretty sure every patriot from each of those other countries would have (or may have) done the same thing if they could have ."

"I really don't know how you missed soo much of this story. A few corrections should be made. 

His first success lead to him being laughed out of academic circles. He succeeded but it was because of contamination in his experiment  No one else was able to replicate his discovery due to following his process and he was unable to replicate due to scrutiny. He didnt realize his mistake till later when it was too late, his name and reputation was trashed. When Germany was running out of gunpowder they gambled on him and won, gunpowder and chemical weapons after he fixed his origional error in his process.

He wasn't just a non practicing jew, he was a converted Christian. German laws of the time prohibited him from being in charge of/managing Christians. He converted so he could be a scientist,  this also what caused the schism between Hitler and the church later on, as the church viewed them as Christian. Hitler treated even the converted as Jewish,  causing his religious problems with the Vatican."

"I don't really like waiting minutes into the video to say what he did.  The physical smashing of the molecule models, and leaving us to assume for a few moments why his wife killed himself, also not a good pattern.  You're an information channel.  Be informative.  Don't be inuring in your presentation.  Let people be curious, not drawn and sucked in consistent with clicking pattern."

"i was 101 guy, sorry"
We all know Eren was behind this
this is an amazing video. Its really informative and easy to understand. the story was well portrayed as well amazing job. For me Haber's case is a lesson to us to make us realize how powerful information can be and as he says these are double edged swords.

"I agree that he is very controversial and it is undisputable that he was a hero for saving all those lives from hunger.
 But as much his interest in the nitrogen problem resulted in him saving people, as much did his patriotism and genius resulted in killing people. In the end I agree with a commentor above, that he had a strong ""the goal justifies the means""-attitude. I also think that the way he developed such a painful weapon to torture the soldiers without qualms shows that he is very coldhearted - because even in war there are weapons who kill your opponent swiftly and weapons that torture them brutally and I sympathize with the poor wife and the son."
"In my opinion, this is one of the most informative and useful videos Veritasium has produced. Certainly one of my favorites as a scientist."

Nice
He did not saved Billions but he created the option to support Billions of people. I dont think of him as a hero because he was willing to kill Millions of people to become rich. Its unbelievable that such a creation can create such chaos in our world.
So busy wondering if he *could* he never wonder whether he *should* .
I saw where this was going when the intro showed a splitting of an aatom...
"Zyklon-B was used as a delousing agent because there was a typhus epidemic, and lice carry typhus. That is all. Any claimed homicidal usage is war time atrocity propaganda. I could go on and on, but this comment will be deleted by those who've gained great power by capitalizing on historical myth and victim-hood."
"I think it's a matter of hindsight. Sure he developed chemical weapons, but he was a patriot and saw himself devoting to his country to end the war as fast as possible. Creating the origin for chloric gas is incredibly irrelevant, as it was intended for the opposite purpose and was purposefully added with a fouler smell. Neither were the scientists who developed the gas without the smell, as they were likely held to gunpoint by the Nazi secret police."

"He had good intentions... but as it's said, the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
Why the f*** did we increase the population that's going to end up killing more people than saving billions 50 years down the line there won't be enough food
Another fantastic video! Thanks for the great work!
A space rocket is only a space rocket when pointed upwards; turn it sideways and it becomes a missile; point it at someone and it is a weapon.
"And let's not forget what was omitted in the documentary: The fertilizers committed other crimes. They rendered the animals useless. We don't need them, animals to enrich the soil... So we threw them out of the farms. An unsustainable plan that is meant to bring short term profits to mega-corporations, through mono cultivation with the use of chemicals that destroy the land life bringing irreversible land corrosion in many areas. The list of side effects of this arrogant industrial trading of elements is very long and maybe intentionally obscured in this documentary. There are many ways to survive and it is naive to present fertilizers as a magic solution that we owe our lives to. Let the chemists focus on sustainable ideas and combine their knowledge with the knowledge of traditional farming that lets the existence of plants and animals, the biodiversity, and keeps the earth alive and healthy, including us, humans."
This was a great episode I learned something new today.
He was a Chad
"I think if Germany won the war, this will be different story. I mean alliance also researched chemical weapons. So would you call scientists from alliance as hero because they won the war?"
"Innumerable amount of human lives can be saved if the war could be ended more quickly this way. And he created chemical weapons. And with same mentality USA created atomic bombs and used it , which make us further question what was the difference between USA and natzis. They're same evil friend, save that natzis have media no longer.  
Ps: the question of video, how do we get more knowledge without using it to destroy ourselves? The answer is simple , it's in the hand of people , people should choose people to rule them that instead of thinking just about profits and themselves (bank supremacy) , would think about humanity and know humans , and are decent and not self-righteous, and are logical . People,people,people , they're the answer , they choose who they want to rule them."
"What is often neglected in these conversations, but some mention is made here; modern chemical pesticides have their roots in chemical weapons that killed anything they touched. These same chemicals and similar are responsible for so much death and illness in humans and many other species, much of it goes unrecognized because it is a slow death in humans or unseen in wildlife. Insects that are beneficial to man and beast alike, have been decimated. A couple years ago, I had a conversation with a fellow employee that also worked for an up and coming mosquito control company. I asked him how they kept from killing EVERYTHING, not just mosquitos. He had two answers: 1) they sprayed in a way that killed less bees, ( which I saw through as company PR) and 2) fewer insects was good anyway. I protested this, because the synthetic pyrethrins used are lethal to all insects (even beneficial or benign varieties), and harmful to non insects. I also mentioned that fewer insects meant less food for birds, bats, fish, and a myriad other living things that make up the ecosystem, eventually leading to the health of humans. His mood changed dramatically. What is really sad is that holistic farming practices and care for soil microbiomes would make the need for such chemicals limited or unnecessary."
"Super interesting mate, one of the best videos I think you ever made.  Maybe cause i used to live in Germany, and the history of zyklon B blew me away, whole video was great though."
What a intro 🙌🏼
"It's not patriotism, it's being a f1cktard. Let's call a spade a spade. It's funny he was loyal to the agressor state, which eventually f1cked him up hahaha, the evil came back. He didn't want to feed the people. He wanted to feed the Germans, so he's not even a bit of a hero."
"That last thing about ""irrelevance"" because someone else would have done it, seems silly to me. I view it as similar to not praising an MVP because someone else would have been MVP if it wasn't him/ her."
"Nature is balance I guess. You manipulate it to get an element that feeds and grows the earth's population, that same element also holds the potential to eliminate a large part of the population. Double edged sword as he mentioned. Question is, does the benefits of the former outweigh the perils of the latter?"
This guys sound like a western propagandist
"Hello! Nice to meet you, I'm Eric Lucero Pharmaceutical Chemist from Chile, I want to share an idea that just occurred to me this morning, it's called gravitational motion theory, I would like help to express it mathematically and evaluate its viability.

"It doesn't seem to me that he's a villain because of developing weapons. Ethics always change and also like to condemn the past events. While defending your country is a good deed. That said, he turned out to be wrong and he should have listened to others.
Same with nuclear weapons. So far they have prevented large scale wars (except Ukraine), but have a dangerous potential. Still, knowledge should not be restricted, as it brings much more good than bad."
OK ALRIGHT ILL WATCH IT SO STOP SHOWING UP IN MY RECOMMENDATION
It's like blaming a guy that made gunpowder.

"0:35
I won't sympathize with ""tragic."" I can ignore the fact that it's weaponry, in stead of the matter that it's a cobtribution to science. I can't ignore that Fritz Haber was a war scientist, who helped the Germans murder, and gave them the weapons to do it again just after 2 decades.

No he was a bad guy... not hard to tell lol
"Another way of looking at it is the creation of nitrogen based fertilisers enabled the world's population to expand 4 billion beyond what it might otherwise have been. So it created an extra 4 billion lives rather than saved them. Maybe a world 4 billion fewer might have not entered the prospect of climate change, famine, war to the degree it is doing. 
Maybe in likewise fashion, the creation of gm crops through genetic engineering is likewise a double edged sword, promoting population growth more than preventing famine. Just a thought."
"19:40 your wrong on both sides. He should just be viewed as a good scientist who happened to do what the times demanded of him. Example: Nuclear energy has the potential to power the earth, or wipe it out. You don't hold the people responsible for its discovery if things go well or bad down the line."
"Lots of scientists throughout history have helped developed weapons. Just consider the Manhattan project: Oppenheimer and Fermi, to name two prominent scientists. I don't see much of a difference between Oppenheimer and Haber, to be honest. Scientists and technologists have throughout ages worked to protect their countries, and there is nothing wrong with that."
"@Paul von Tarsus Oh no, what a hard time to be a European, how will they ever survive? When your current comfortable economic condition as a country is based on exploitation, your country deserves criticism until you repay your debt to those exploited people. Germany deserves all the criticism it gets, other European countries and North America are just unfairly getting a pass."
"There's one difference between Openheimer and Haber. Openheimer understood what he had done and was horrified by it - when he saw the first test explosion he quoted the Bhagavadjita - ""I am become death, the shatterer of worlds"" (he was a scholar of oriental languages before he became a physicist). For which he lost his security clearance and was called a commo."
"You can protect your country without anybody dying. There's no point. Citizens and soldiers die because, what, did the government say so? 

Are my people worth more than yours? 

Are the people in power worth obeying to even if they kill people? 

There's literally no point. 
Being a chess piece to kill people then die only to be honored then forgotten. No point. It's worthless. Having dead people in your thoughts and prayers won't exactly ""solve"" the problem.

May God bless you."
It's haber (h-ae-ber)
"People are STUPID, his wife couldn't understand it and killed herself. Haber knew it and that's exactly why he had no regrets. Chemistry is a science and science NEVER kills people. Only people kill people! Everyone unable to understand this simple truth is stupid!"
How did 20 minutes pass so quickly?
Great storytelling.

10:35 that is terrifying knowledge. 4 billion of us would be gone without this one technology!😰
"Even though noones gonna read this and im wasting my time here, i want to at least have tried:
Population growth is not intrinsically good. People who could otherwise not have been born were not ""saved"". Since the time humans settled down, a dynamic of nutritional overflow which causes population growth with all its drawbacks (war, scarcity, disease, destruction) has been going on.
NH3 Fertilizer and industrial agriculture have brought us in todays situation where yield is majorly dependent on fertilizer and pesticides because most soil life was killed (google french intensive gardening). 
Those chemicals need a lot of energy though, as was explained in the video. We are essentially eating crude oil, energy wise.
I could imagine a different world in which people realized back then ""we have to stabilize the population size, otherwise we will always struggle with supplying more and more people."" But i guess 20:20 ""the real question is how do we keep increasing our knowledge and CONTROL OF THE NATURAL WORLD"""
It feels like so many discoveries simultaneously make the world better and scarier
"A german with Circular Glasses, what do you expect?"
"I want you to refer to ""Crime and Punish,ment of I.G. Farben""  Haber is mentioned, and the role of the military industrial complex is spelled out."
This what wren make in Scottland is real Bio Tec :D
I love how he used Squid Game music
"20:40 ""The real question is how do we keep out knowledge and control of natural world without destroying ourselves"" 
The answer is because there is a God who will intervene to prevent from the human kind from extinction. 
I don't know for you but that is the most sensible and logical answer I can find.
Sheer luck is impossible in probability and it can't keep on happening. There must be a controllable variable who can change things."

"It shows how patriotism is a sick obsession to fight for the country even in the war, which had no real reason and it was just a fight between politicians just for a sake of fighting and starting some war to murder innocent people.
It is not only about Haber, but all the patriots can start killing other people for no reason if the politicians tell them to do so.

He killed a lot of people during the war and will kill a billions soon, because there are too many people on the Earth and they already started to suffer because of over-population."
now I think Walter White should be called Haber instead of Heisenberg
"Great video, until the carbon footprint propaganda."
Why use bird poop as our urine ligit works the same way???
I personally think villainizing Haber is complete hypocrisy. Everyone was using chemical weapons. But history is written by the victor.

Albert Einstein even though he fled to the states, informed US about the german atomic bomb in process and helped them out with required knowledge.

"No, this is a bad concept on so many levels. Millions killed? Who’s to say someone else might have come up with something better, as good as, less than, who cares, this can’t be morally justified.

"At the start I thought this was going to be a tragic case of someone else using his invention to make weapons, but no. I have no sympathy for him and I definitely think he's an evil person, he literally made horrific weapons that killed millions of people. Sure, you say in the video that if he didn't make them then someone else would have, but that doesn't absolve him of the responsibility. He could have refused to serve in the military or to produce chemical weapons, but he didn't. I think that he did a great service to humanity by giving billions of people access to food, but he's still a terrible person."
"We could say the same of all militaries. Countries must be able attack or defend and so must its citizens , pacifism during war leads to ruin. So there should be no issue with him doing what he can to help his country win. The only thing separating him from his contemporaries was his success."

I thought that the increase of the human population in the start of 20th century was mostly impacted by the development of midwifery technics and popularisation of cleaning practices in the medicine in general. This increased probability of an individual to survive during their first 5 years of life which eventually resulted in the increase of the global population.

"Fritz Haber was a chemist, Patriot and also a soldier. So he used his inventions to help his country to win the war. Im sure every other scientist, engineers or soldiers from other countries who developed other deadly weapons were thinking the same thing. He might a villain for other countries but not for his own country."

"A month ago while I was reading Dr Stone manga, there was a point where a seasoned scientist told the young and inquisitive scientist that his love for building rockets is a double edged sword, a functional rocket, he said, has the same fundamental build as an intercontinental missile. 

This tragic story is not for us to judge a scientist who became patriotic and fought in a war, it is a decision anyone could have easily made. And like Veritasium put it, you either see a scientist that saved billions or a soldier that killed millions, but both could have been any other person anyway."

"The name sounds very german, so I was interested of what origin he is, because I always like to go to the roots.
Pedia writes: Haber was born in Breslau, Kingdom of Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland), into a well-off Jewish family.
Honor where credit is due."
It doesn't work like that. Just because you save the lives of ten people doesn't clear one's conscience for killing another person. That is still murder and should be condemned. He could have fled or tried to be as useless as possible like many others did but he chose to actively participate and create horrible weapons instead.

"This is a great video as always. My only criticism is the message at the end should have been presented at the beginning. Most of us who had some kind of idea where it was going knew what the message was going to be at the end, but I doubt the audience who needs to see the message made it to the end."
"The ammount of inventions that came from war is quite big. Turing machines, the rocket that took man to the moon (Werner von Braun), nuclear energy and bombs (Oppenheimer). War was unfortunately a status quo for europe during centuries, and if not Harber, someone else would have made those inventions.
So for now, we just need to accept this things would inevitably have happened, and that now we have organizations and structures in place to protected modern liberal democracy where it exists."

"Luke 10:29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise."
"My only issue with this video is painting the Haber-Bosch process as nothing but a good invention that saved/created lives. Intensive agriculture has ruined the health of our soils and nitrogen pollution is a very big problem for biodiversity. By trying to surpass nature, we shot ourselves in the foot, and we're now paying the consequences."
"I agree. The process is very energy intensive as well, I think 1 liter of oil is needed for 1 kg of N. One wheat hectare needs around 120-180 kg of N for one growing season (depend on the intensity)."

"Ammonium nitrate can also be used to make meth. Mix it with lye and trap the resulting vapor, cool it, and anhydrous ammonia is the result.

Mix that with lithium and ephedrine, and you have meth. Add a non polar solvent such as naptha. Filter out the solids. 

Expose that strained liquid to hydrogen gas. The meth connects to the hydrogen and becomes a salt, methamphetamine hydrochloride. Strain that and repeat 2 more times. The meth hydrochloride stays in the filter. Allow the strained material to dry.

Toss it into your glass, apply heat, vaporizing the meth salt. Inhale it. And off you go!"

"12:34 ""measuring 3.3 on the Richter scale"" The Richter scale is no longer used, since it's only accurate in Southern California. The measurement you reference here is in the moment magnitude scale, so you should've just said that the explosion measured a magnitude of 3.3. I can understand it when non-science types miscall it the Richter scale, but I'm surprised to see you make this error. Tsk tsk!"
I understand his being a patriot. You have to note that he resigned in support of the other Jews even though he did not practice the religion. I do not see that he did anything wrong when judged from his time in history not using hind sight. I think this is a very sad video.

So a 30% reduction in nitrogen based fertilizer will improve the climate.  Starvation seems probable.
"“Science and technology” Ha! We have no science; only technology. Again, you conflate science with research. Science is a rational explanation. Making experiments doesn’t explain. Technology has improved our lives; science hasn’t, because hardly any human is doing science."

"This is an enormously simplistic and error filled rendition of Nitrogen's role within soil, it is not that soil provides nitrogen, it is that *living* soil is home to free-living nitrogen fixing bacteria, that fix nitrogen from our atmosphere (which is 78% N2), and provides a rich biodiversity for the root nodules of legumes to also fix nitrogen. To claim that plant growth wasn't prolific until guano or Haber came along is wildly inaccurate and negates 10,000 years of agriculture, let alone nature itself. Guano is more important for its P, or Phosphorus in the NPK fertilizers. Regenerative Agriculture and many practices that support the soil life and biodiversity (which has billions of organisms in a teaspoon of soil and dwarfes the complexity of a rainforest) do not need synthetic N applications, squeezed from fossilised natural gas drawn deep out of the Earth. A sequel to this piece could acknowledge the role of biology in this critical narrative."

"There is no climate crisis. Everything about climate change and the ""negative"" impact of human beings on the so called ""mother earth"" is exaggerated and fabricated as yet another way to reduce the world's population. Call it a conspiracy if you want. However, if you as a woke liberal regard human beings as the problem, then the solution is to either destroy human beings or control them severely. I reject both liberal options and opt for life, freedom, and the realization of our full human potential."
"So, you took clickbait quite seriously. Just say why, 10 seconds, but no, I have to waste 22 minutes on this crap."

"What good is feeding half the world if it isn’t for the money?  asks a very confused Jewish Haber. His wife wasn’t going to have any of that mess. Science will never work right in an economically competitive context. It fails because all competitions are fraught with endemic vanity, secrecy, coercion, corruption, anxiety, despair and chance. This is why technology becomes weaponized right along with its benefits. Some even rationalize weapons as benefits. Like when a mother poisons her child to in turn be that child’s nurse maid and comforter. This is loony tunes."

There would've simply been an unprecedented global famine that would've affected everyone."
thats a miserable take
I'm pretty sure another scientist could have discover a way to separate nitrogen from the air.

"I think the question in the end is a core problem. Some humans seem to be absolutely brilliant, most are at best a little more clever mammals, most of the time relatively stupid and affect-driven. We need systems so that not the most ruthless, immoral and power hungry keep rising to the top into positions where they coul do good but deliberately decide to do whatever it takes to stay in power. Science has to happen, we never know what we find or what we can make of it and with enough motivation and cruelty (of which the human condition offers a lot), everything can be turned into a weapon.
We need to stop waging wars so the question doesn't even come up, how to weaponise something. But why do we vote for those who actively harm us, both here in germany (talking about the CDU party in particular, but apparently the SPD as well) and in the USA (G.W. Bush where we could have had Al Gore, Trump where anyhting would have been better and the like). As long as people are greedy, jealous and show no empathy, we seem to keep shoveling coal into a locomotive rushing all of us straigt into a cliffside."

"The moral of this story is “smart” does not equal “moral”. Hence, science and technology are only as useful as they are creative like in fertilizer - a pro-life social and collective construct. Chlorine gas is not yet is sold as a weapon that will bring about the conditions for a healthy society. This sounds like Wall Street logic ensconced in competitive self-determination. It’s called neurotic, self-defeating and irreconcilable logic. If you think competing economically is sensible, you may have brain damage. The answer to the last question is “why (in what context) do people do what they do”? To compete or to cooperate? What social artifacts do each foster and engender?"
"Thanks you. Apart from other things in this story i'm thinking about patriotism, love for your country, sacrifices in all meanings, how government use it and how it betrayed Haber in the end.

Thinking about what was invented in fields of morality, humanity and society. Is there a dark side of altruism, care for human lives?"
Basalt is geographically rare and takes a lot of energy to transport. Possibly more than what it can capture in it's lifetime!

Don't pretend that a random scientist with no funding and no factories and no access to this technology would somehow come up with all of it.

It's bad enough you're pretending that his wife didn't kill herself after the first successful test of chlorine gas causing men to drown in their own lungs?

"Amazing!! 
What this video got me thinking: One of the major issues in the down fall of Sri Lanka was lack of fertilizer which lowered food yields .The world in general is in lacking of fertilizers and this can only mean one thing...  food shortage in the future.A question remains,is the fertilizer shortage deliberate ?"
"@somewhat informed My point is, meat production takes a lot of resources to grow animal feed, when those resources could be used to directly feed humans, which would be more efficient"
"@Captain Cloud Farming should follow meat production......and meat production should follow farming,    Just so we wont have to rely on any chemical company to grow food."
"I wouldn't say that the problem is that we're lacking fertilizer. To me, the biggest issue is that we are damaging soil-health with intensive, large scale mono-crop agriculture. Nature has never failed to create food for all living beings, but there's not a lot of natural processes to be found in a lot of agriculture today. Using more permaculture and reducing meat production would go a long way, and then perhaps we wouldn't even need as much fertilizer."
So he's a good person cuz he killed million and saved billion
"By his reasoning, we could label any scientist as irrelevant because whatever discoveries or inventions come from him, for good or ill, would eventually come from someone else. The benefit of his nitrogen process cannot be denied regardless of how the fertilizer can be used to make explosives. After all, a pencil can be used as a weapon.

"The creation within science is separate from those who use that tool to help or harm.  A hammer can build a house, yet can be used to kill a human or mouse.  The internet is a great tool to share information, but those who wish to spread false information to mislead people can use the same tool.

PS.  Wren is a waste of money.  It's modern snake oil.  Instead each of us should pollute less, and write our representatives of our government demanding industry clean up their mess.  Industrial pollution is a huge deal.  Wren is feel good way to do next to nothing yet not change our habits which continue to pollute massively as population grows out of control.  

Haber's massive contribution to our population has also sped up our emission of various pollutants.  He is not at fault, but how his tool gets used may ultimately lead to hard times.  The planet will be fine, people will survive but billions may not do so well at some point in our future.  We are in an inter-glacial period and our contribution to warming may yet end this ice age and where it leads, no one knows.

"@Chris theres a reason air quality levels are the worst in summer and the best in winter, its common sense"
"First of all i do not agree with what Fritz did but I do can find a perspective and understand what his thinking might be.. I think he was a tool rather than a orchestrator of destruction. 
I think the evil here is the war itself. When there is war there is no end to suffering if not won. If he had been a pacifist and not contribute, Germany would have been crushed in the war and lots of German people would have lost their lives. We have to understand that in war the other side is shown as pure evil who will stop at nothing but massacring the whole country. And thinking like that I do think anyone would have thought of giving their expertise to 'save' their people which is still a false notion. I think WAR Is the biggest evil here and people who take the decision of waging wars to meet their greed disguised as needs are the purely evil people Nd Fritz was just a tool than the orchestrator of destruction"
"Look, you are the best channel on YouTube in my humble opinion.

Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Fritz Haber the Wise?
I think that the double edged nature of scientific progress is what drives so many people towards religion and away from science. It is a lot easier to put one’s faith in some supernatural being that is all-good than to deal with the mixed blessings of human produced science.
I still think Midgley's invention is giving the most terrible consequences than Albert Einstein's atomic bombs and Fritz Haber's chemical weapons.

"Haber did not set out to do evil. In war, the best talents are needed to win, so it comes down to politics. He wanted his country to win and shorten the war. Haber is a great chemist which should be celebrated.   It is politicians who run the world badly leading to wars."
If this was flipped and it was a brittish or even more an American scientist probably would have been praised
Haber-bosch process is used to create ammonium nitrate which is a fertilizer that is used in industrial farms and completely destroys soil. It has created an abundance in food but the quality and the environmental degradation is insane.
"I think Haber was, aside from being extra smart, a relatively ordinary guy. He wanted to advance mankind and help people, but he loved his country and didn't shy away from helping out in times of war. We may think of him as a villain because he was on the other side, but science is science and war is war. I wonder what he would have thought of World War 2? Would he have felt that it was no longer the Germany he knew, or would he have been more 'My country, right or wrong'? I guess we'll never know. I suspect he would've been badly affected by the use of his inventions to slaughter civilians in showers though. Weapons of war are one thing, women and children are another."

"How do we make sure that science is only used for good? You pose that as if it is an unanswered conundrum. However, it has already been answered, and if you are a scientist, you should know this. in the modern world, ie today, every bit of research in an academic institution has to be passed by an ethics panel, especially if it involves animal testing or testing on humans specifically. In the commercial world, this is what government regulation and inspection is for. This is why it is so important to keep conservative parties out of government as they are more interested in serving the financial interests of the corporations and themselves. Regulation and inspection ensures that corporations utilising scientific discoveries and scientific staff adhere to ethical standards. Conservative governments reduce regulations and defund regulatory bodies so that these corporations are not hamstrung by ethics and can thus make more profits through unethical uses and abuses of science, not to mention the unethical disposal of waste products. 
To sum up, the practical application of the academic field of ethical philosophy is what keeps science from being used for harmful purposes. Applying the major principles of ethical philosophy, justice, respect for autonomy, and beneficence to the consideration of whether a particular scientific enquiry or endeavor is ethical is what prevents the harm science could possibly do. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who don't understand this, including scientists and there are a lot of people involved in politics and lobbying politicians who are actively working against this."
"No. Clara Haber fired two shots.
The first went into the house, fired from the back garden where she died.
Speculation was, she was unfamiliar with her husband's sidearm, a Reichsrevolver Model 1883.
Reichsrevolvers are single action and require the hammer to be cocked manually. Additionally, they are one of the few revolvers that have a safety. This is very cumbersome for someone unfamiliar with the process.
As her son, Herman, was in the house, it was unlikely the first shot was premeditated, hence the accidental discharge theory.
It was a sad ending for a truly gifted scientist. 
Interestingly, at this moment the governments of the Netherlands and Canada, both  major food exporters, are in the process of denying farmers nitrogen on the grounds, ""It will save the planet.""

Wrong. Ammonium Nitrate does NOT catch on fire and explode. In order to make Ammonium Nitrate explode you need to mix it with 5% of its mass with Diesel and detonate a small primer that will begin the chain reaction of the explosion. Ammonium Nitrate does not catch on fire. It needs an insane amount of pressure and heat in order to explode. What happened in Beirut was intentional.
In america its called tannerite and is a binary explosive with nitro-methane. and you can shoot it with a supersonic rifle to detonate it. So still high pressures but focused and not that hard.

TLDR?
"""How do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?"" The first and only answer to this question is, very simply, that we have to stop being _willing_ to destroy. So long as we accept that harming ourselves, each other, and the world are somehow at best unavoidable, at worst desirable, and most commonly a lamentable but acceptable side effect of our existence, technology will always become, in some form, an engine of that destruction. Our technology only betrays us because we betray each other, and use our brilliance to do so."

"Another sad thing is that the Haber-Bosch process is inefficient, but is the best we have. Because of the reaction, less is more. If you put in more heat, you will make _less_ ammonia. If you use stronger vessels, it costs you more in maintenance costs based on using higher pressure gases, so they use lower pressures.

"I liked everything about learning about the history of ammonium nitrate in this video until the end when the author lectures us about carbon emissions and how we humans are killing our planet.
Please, everybody, listen to the interview by the owner of CNN and his interview with the original producer of the ""Weather Channel"".   The meteorologist who invented the weather channel has gone on record to say that if the human global society does everything the ""global warming"" people say we should do, by the end of this century, if we give up all of our usage of fossil fuels, and other stuff the NASA paid left-wing scientists to say we should do, the difference will be 0.005 degrees in temperature change.  This is not from me, it's from the inventor of the original ""Weather Channel"".  So we all agree to have our worldly societies go into economic depression by giving up our usual ways of travel, which will have a daisy chain of adverse events, only so that by the end of this century, the human equation will cause about a  .005 degrees in temperature change. You don't have to believe me, just go to where the CNN Lemmon gets obliterated by the original producer of the Weather Channel to see how screwed up we will be if we believe in this ""Global warming""  B.S.   Neil DeGrasse Tyson, stick to looking at your fake stars in your N.Y.C. planetarium and don't lecture to the real experts, who are meteorologists, who are not paid by NASA to come up with a one-sided conclusion.  Listen to the guy to invented the weather channel for expertise.  He's the guy who knows the real truth.  Our planet will go into an economic depression well before carbon will cause a 0.005 temperature change by the end of this century."

"The history lesson was great. The anti capitalist carbon footprint mess afterwards was disappointing. I helped develop agronomic crop growth and fungal plant disease models with world renowned climatologist Dr. Joseph Russo. He sold his company to BASF, a German company that I believe began as a nitrogen fertilizer company. Dr. Russo said that man made global warming is too small to be accurately measured. He did express concerns about the effects of deforestation on LOCALIZED weather events. He specifically stated that the CO2 discussion was more political than scientific. Maybe you are smarter and more honest than Joe, but until the climate change crowd separates itself from every other group that wants to control the world through larger governments and more regulations I am betting this is simply a new home for Marxists.

What an unfortunate story."
It's also worth noting that Ammonium Nitrate explosives are also used in the mining that supports just as many people as the farming.
"Haber had probably nothing to do with the Holocaust.   But he DAMN WELL intended to kill AS MANY people as possible with chlorine gas.  And to even suggest that he is some how excusable is to totally disregard his fellow scientist's point of view that what he was doing was wrong.    You can not use the ""those were different times"" excuse for that man.   Because right there in the moment was someone trying to check him and he said himself that killing people this way would ""end the war sooner"".   I'm sorry but he is a ferociously bad example of ""how to define good or evil"".   Billions of people may not be putting huge amounts of pressure on the environment right now if Haber hadn't created Ammonium Nitrate - and thousands upon thousands of men and animals wouldn't not have suffered so much if he hadn't been such a patriot.    I'm not saying any of the rest of them weren't bad guys - not at all.   But to say that fertilizer was a good thing is to blatantly disregard the damage it has done to the environment."
"Science is amoral.  Not so with scientists - Haber, hiding behind his patriotism, thought it was fine to develop a chemical weapon which would cause soldiers’s lungs to fill up with water thereby drowning them on dry land.  Evil."
"To be fair, war weapons becoming so terrible is what is keeping sort of peace among us"

"The pre WW1 ""Triple Entente"" relied on the ""fact"" that ""the Triple Alliance"" would soon be out of  ammonium nitrate deposits for their military explosives and imported guano for crop fertilization if a war started.

The fact that Germany was running a massive secret crash program to solve their explosives feedstock bottleneck must have never crossed anyone's mind."
Saddam Hussein also used Zyklon B during the Iran/Iraq war and the Gulf War. It’s because he grew up reading Mein Kampf. His uncle who raised him was a devout Nazi. The Muslim World and Adolf Hitler were hand in hand during WWII. Why after the fall of the 3rd Reich many of the officers went on to lead Army’s of the Muslim World.

"As an ""aniliner"" (as the BASF employees playfully name themself :-) ) I walk everyday past the rusty cylinder that you see at minute 10:12 in the video on my way to the cantin.
It was posed in front of our most representative building called ""Gesellschaftshaus"" in an honor place in the middle of the park. 
That curious rusty cylinder in such an important place raised my curiosity when I arrived at BASF 5 years ago and after a small search I discovered the epic of the ""bread from the air"".
There is a small shield in front of him that mentions the Haber-Bosch-Verfahren. Carl Bosch (no to be confused with Robert Bosch) was at the time the CEO of BASF and I believe it is fair to mention him also in this epic. He also won the Nobel prize for the process as it is mentioned in that shield and the process that is still in use today is named after both.
I'm sure that most people don´t know the meaning of that cylinder and even less that similar things are responsible for 50% of the N of their body!
To make the epic even more suggestive I discovered at that time that this process is extremely energy consuming. 2% of the total consumption of energy in the world is spent in that process and that there are some bacteria that lives in symbiosis with plants on the roots that can do the same with less energy. It is impressive that nature is still ahead! It is an open problem to discover how they can do it and someone thinks that it can be one problem to be investigated in future with the help of the quantum computer and the computation chemistry where the properties of the molecules can be investigated starting from the Schrödinger equation.
The amount of energy is a very actual topic if you think that BASF relies mostly on Russian gas :-("

"It's worth noting also that Ammonium Nitrate's explosive properties are valuable for much more than just its military applications.  (Indeed, it's generally not a preferable explosive for military applications.)  Today, its main use as an explosive is for blasting - the use of explosives to break up rock for the purposes of building roads and, especially, mining.  ANFO - ammonium nitrate mixed with a bit of some kind of fuel oil like diesel is the go to standard for mining explosives.  It's cheap, it's safe to store in smaller quantities (If it catches fire, it burns for a while before it reaches a high enough temperature to explode; you need a pretty big pile of it in an enclosed space for it to detonate), it's not shock sensitive (you can throw bags of it from one worker to the next, it's no more dangerous than throwing bags of rice around), you can buy it in pelletized form and pour it into drillholes made in the rock.  Its one disadvantage is it dissolves in water...in which case you just buy the emulsified version which adds another chemical to keep it from dissolving.

So, if you're thanking Haber for all the food, you can thank him for all the metals and such we get from hard rock mining, too."

His logic that creating chemical weapons will save lives by ending the war faster really hurts considering that multiple scientists and inventors thought the same way when creating weapons.
for someone who made as big an impact as Haber? I point to James Clerk Maxwell.
"oh its the guy who invented alcohol, nice job, yeah"
"Fritz Haber was a complicated man. Even in creating chemical weapons, he seems to have done it with the intention, or at least justification, that it would save lives. 

It needs to be noted that WWI did not have a clear good and bad side like WWII. Both sides were working on chemical weapons regardless of his efforts and they would have been used regardless. 

None of this justifies the pain and death he caused, but it puts it in perspective. He seems to be a man dedicated to science, with a strong “ends justify the means” attitude. I’ll let God be his judge."

I must have a nitrogen defect 😆
"This is very much an aside to the topic, but there is a way to add nitrogen into soil without mining it elsewhere: planting nitrogen fixing plants.

Nitrogen fixing plants are plants that can get nitrogen from the air rather than the soil - the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen (which is good because if it were only oxygen pretty much everything touching the atmosphere would be on fire).  Wherever plants get nitrogen from the soil, at some point a nitrogen fixing plant was there making it (or somewhere else, and the nitrogen got moved there through an enormous array of possible means).

These plants have a symbiotic relationship with a type of bacteria called Rhizobium, which helps it draw nitrogen in and stores it in a nitrogen nodule in the roots.  Once these plants die and decompose, the nodules release the nitrogen, but now in the useful form found in soil rather than the gas in the atmosphere.

The problem with this approach for agriculture is the amount of time it takes away from growing a crop of something more valuable.  Nitrogen fixing plants include legumes: peas, beans, alfalfa, peanuts, soy, clover, all of which are easy enough to grow on a farm field (Alder is also nitrogen fixing, but nobody's going to get very far suggesting farmers plant trees in their fields.)  But if every farm everywhere was taking 1 out of 3 or 4 seasons to grow a batch of legumes, the price of all of them (except clover, which is already effectively worthless) would drop because the produced supply outstrips demand by an absurd margin.  (Most of these are already not exactly cash crops.)  Which means you've got a chunk of every season where the field is effectively producing nothing of value - maybe forage for livestock.  Hence this tends not to be a part of farming for most crops.

The place where it is useful is in farms that need spacing between crops and want ground cover to control weeds.  Hops, for example.  Berry bushes, probably.  Grow clover (probably the  in between the plants and you've got a local supply of nitrogen fixation.  It'll take a while for the decomposition cycle to kick in, and you might want to go with an annual variety if you're actually planning on using the nitrogen from that rather than having it as a potential long term fringe benefit (the annual has to be reseeded every year, but last years plants will be decaying and releasing nitrogen at a steady rate.)"

"The idea that someone else would have figured it out is so disrespectful and whimsical. How do you know someone would have figured it out? 

But let's say someone did figure it out in another 100 years? By then how many thousands of lives would have been ruined.

You don't say 'someone else would have done x'. You just credit the man for his brilliance. By all means, criticize him for the chemical weapons."
"We have separated science from morals and ethics.   Yet the existence of humans on this planet and the existence of life on the planet is a moral and ethical question.  The British were very successful at doing science but a common comment is that they were poor and turning the science into wealth.  Maybe a better answer would be they didn't forget about ethics of the uses of the knowledge they created.
Today I see the failure of ethics in the science community.  The cabal of governments and big pharma have created wealth for big pharma and power for government and the cost of humanity: death, loss of futility, live long suffering.  They have ignored the standards they developed and worse yet change them so that future atrocities are now more likely. 
We see suito science.  Government and industry fund so called research with a preferred results with a promise of future funding if they like the results. Higher education have become dependent as have many of their researchers.  They have become very willing to provide the requested results.  Smoking, Mariana, diet, sleep, emotional changing drugs and  Climate change are such areas that promote solutions with suito proof or none at all.
I have looked into climate change.  There is not correlation between Carbon dioxide levels in the ice cores from the poles for  about 10 thousand of years.  Little ice age, Roman Warming, another cold period, and another warming.  In looking at the temperature profile we are actually almost as cool as the little ice age today.  The green house effect is insignificant then the heat output changes from the Sun.  We are just getting data from space for a few decades with a gap when the space shuttle was grounded about the sun heat output.   The ice ages where the temperature dropped more then 5 deg C below our average (peak to peak ~ 6 C) does show a carbon dioxide change, however; since we do not see a relationship for our plus or minus ~ 2 to 3 deg C change then likely the change in carbon dioxide is driven by the other effects of a much colder and snow covered climate.  A quick reduction in plant growth while the rotting and animal population will lag behind thus increasing the content of carbon dioxide."

In the United States there is the story of the Hatfields and The McCoys, a feuding family story where if you are a Hatfield you had to hate The McCoys and the other way around. Both families thought they were correct. There comes a point where individually everyone has to make a decision whether what they are doing as an individual is moral or not.

"The video is generally well done, but I would like to comment on the end because I disagree on the final remarks. Haber was definitely a villain. Not in making this discovery but in deciding to recommend it as a weapon. It is true that inventions can always be used for good and bad, but in the end it is the people who decide to use it for the bad who are the villains. Another scientist would have maybe chosen not to recommend it as a weapon. Maybe then another person X would’ve done so, but then person X would be the villain. Haber in this story plays two roles. One of the inventor who simply makes a discovery. The second one is then the role of using this discovery for killing. Taking the latter one away from him is overseeing the fact that he did take this decision and I don’t think this is ok."
I agree with you. Acting like his actions during the war were completely out of his control and do not shine on him as a worse person than if he didn't do so is completely wrong.
"So she killed herself in a way that it would be her son to find her? I'd say that someone who does such a thing is hardly motivated by second hand guilt over her husband's work, which one would guess was secret, by the way."
Not a bad story to learn about in chemistry. Especially what it teaches at the end about what we do can lead to others exploiting those techniques. And we should be careful about how we allow those techniques to be used.

isn't it weird that you can randomly claim islands and suddenly it's america?
I would agree had he not dedicated himself to making weapons. He should have joined Einstein. Continued with fertilizer. Can see the effect in Sri Lanka after the ban of fertilizers.

Your final question is basically what some argue is the Great Filter from the Fermi Paradox. I hope we can find the answer and not get filtered by it.

"Title should read ""who killed millions, initially saved millions and later killed off the lot of us"""
"✝️
For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.”
John 3:16‭-‬21."
He just killed millions.
"That one last information got me with my guard down. To think his gas was then used on the Holocaust. Well, I think you could already imagine it, since he looked like a master of the gas but wow. It's like you said, you can't say if he was a hero or a vilan. It's the same for the scientist that created the atomic bomb, dynamite and other things like that. They probably didn't want it to the used on war and to kill millions, but people used their inventions for that. You get stuck on a legacy of either you help the world with a new and powerful invention (growing crops) or you keep it low until someone else discover it (prevent being ""responsible"" for bad usage). Though."
"being a patriot doesn't mean you'd help your country to cause destruction; its a nice example of what is different in wisdom from knowledge .What good is knowledge if you  use it to cause destruction? In the end intension is all that matters, not what he had achieved in doing so."
I’m still looking for the part when he killed minions
Dr. Lieber made covid 19 and sold it to the chinese . FBI picked him up and we have havent held of him.
Know telling of how many prisoners he used to experiment his deadly chemical on and for that they all would die in an unmaginable way.

"Basic chemical thermodynamics shows how impossible it is for atmospheric CO2 to cause global warming. The deep reason is that Earth's atmosphere isn't a black body radiator like the surfaces of the Sun and Earth.  CO2-driven global warming is a fake physics hoax pushed for political gain by the global Marxist politician-run U.N. IPCC. No surprise, they never discuss the physics. They just demand that you bow to their demands for all the money in the world."
"this was fantastic, very well written"
"It's not enough... Human emissions are outside of the natural cycles of Earth, so non-natural cycles must be used to offset our emissions. We haven't disrupted Earth's natural cycles alone, we have outdone and gone far beyond, creating our own Human cycles are the only way to fix what we have done. ""Carbon Neutral"" is a trope, we need to fix our own mistakes, we need to offset for ourselves plus everyone else not helping. Even those are not enough because no amount of individual carbon offset is going to offset a tanker transport or even one war. We need entire industries dedicated to these. I tell you plainly, we are not smart enough because too many people will not help, so the Earth's systems will re-balance themselves while we constantly play catch-up, only to realize we were one step too late at each step. 

To undo something, effort must be equal to or greater than what created it. The ball is rolling too quickly now, even to the point the ball that started to roll has changed, and I don't see a hundred Manhattan Projects working to offset what we have been doing for 150 years. What I see are countless people at every turn, on every flight, around every hill, on every mountain, across every ocean, doing what we have been doing for more than a century, and I cannot see but a fraction of humanity. Call me hopeless, but I am not foolish enough to blindly believe that until economy of change takes hold that we will be able to slow let alone reverse whatever is going on with Earth's climate.

While Billionaires exploit billions of people, individuals that waste money on the scale some countries only dream of, other's cannot figure out how to exploit a patch of grass.... Influencing the masses is not a good idea, you have to change the minds of those causing the most change, and normally that takes a war because at the scale they work at that is the consequence. I don't think that anyone is willing to sacrifice their apple this and tesla that and samsung toys all bought from walmart shipped amazon, for a war that causes death and destruction just to change a perception to save something that ""seems"" to not be broken.... Do not underestimate the stubbornness and ignorance of comfortable people, nor the dreadful dogma that got the rich where they are."

thanos just needed to kill this guy🤣🤣
"this was super interesting for me. my workspace is located in a ""fritz-haber-street"" and to be honest i didnt know anything about him. thanks. what made you do this video `?"
"This is exactly what saddens me the most as someone in STEM. Every bit of information is indeed a potential double edged sword. Imagine the story of the person who invented plastic polymers, the thing on which the climate is choking today, or the person who invented the harnessing of nuclear energy, which we all know has been used for what purpose. All of their stories are essentially similar. So, it's not just Haber. It's humanity and its toxicity and carelessness. That is what we need to fight and overcome."
@M H T.Y!
"You do realize most (real) education is STEM and that makes it pointless and pretentious to make that your opening statement, right?"
"Yeah but he intentionally made the gas, that was 100% the intent."
"The latter part of nuclear is the exact opposite. Utilizing nuclear energy came AFTER we had figured out how to weaponize it. People often forget that it goes both ways, the innovations of peace can often be used in war, and the innovations in war can often be used in peace. In both, mankind still advances nonetheless. I think this is merely a product of nature that all information and everything can be used for multiple means both good and bad. I believe the ""double-edged sword"" is merely the price that must be paid in the pursuit of becoming the masters of the natural world."
"""The climate is choking"" lol I'll revisit this comment 100 years later to ask you if its still choking..."
thank you for making fear new death ....didnt some japanese guy used it in japanese subway or it was differnt thing

"gas chamber actually do not existed, you can't kill people at an intrustrial cadence like that. America also try do make a gas chamber for penal execution, they stop the projet because that was too hard and complexe, even for 1 people."

He was just a patriot who thought we was doing the right thing
"mixed feelings about wren... the entire concept of an individual's carbon footprint was, as I understand it, a diversion campaign lead by the fossil fuel industry to push blame away from them

and, from a Kurzgesagt video, I understand that my entire life's carbon footprint is equal to one, ONE second's worth of our global emissions. assuming I still have that one right.

the responsibility is in the hands of those in power, who shape the habits of everyday people. and every day people, have the responsibility of holding those in power accountable"

I would figure to call it anger."
you just... be still.
a small price to pay for salvation
"Not gonna lie Wren's evaluation of my carbon impact kind of pissed me off. I've nearly maxed out what I can do in the US. They didn't ask many questions at all and there's no way they could calculate my CO2 emissions off of it.

We moved into a small efficient town house, keep the house warm in summer and cold in winter, switched to a vegetarian diet, and most household supplies are refilled at a local shop instead of buying new bottles for anything. My wife rides a bicycle to work and most errands are done by bicycle. I have a fuel efficient and clean motorcycle that meets euro standards for commuting to work and we don't have kids. There's a ton of other small odds and ends that we've done to reduce our energy demand and emissions.

It's not rational for me to mad about their ""evaluation"" of my CO2 output but it's very irritating when we put so much effort into minimizing it and they slap on a label of my household CO2 emissions being 35.1 tons. The impression the site gave me was accusing me of being the problem instead of offering help on how I can personally reduce my impact further."
Was this inspired by the latest book of author Vaclav Smil? (How the world really works) Because that exact same story is mentioned. Very interesting video!

"Not simply this invention this is correlation and it also correlates with the oil and gas industry so the full story is the industrial revolution that took place over the past 120 years is what gave us growth in all areas.

Now with the WEF we will see hundreds of millions of people die of famine over the coming years as they withdraw and cut the supply chain of these products, crops will fail, 'they' (WEF and ideology) will blame climate change not the use of poor grade expensive (highly profitable) weaker fertilizers. Look to Srilanka one of the WEF's jewels that they were showcasing! It failed, it's crops failed, the fallacious policies failed and many got rich!. 

There is other ways to reduce CO2 as CO2 is not the actual problem! It's a live giver, peoples mentality is the problem here! Education can solve this issue but no, simple profit and propaganda.

Well done for highlighting this."
"Crop rotation replenishes soil nitrogen. I am not aware if this technique wasn't known in those times. Over a year, farmers plant a crop of primary importance and then after its harvest plant nitrogenous plants like nuts, say groundnut to replenish ground nitrogen content. This is called crop rotation."
Bro at the 3rd minute I had to tab out and see if I was still watching the same video as 2 minutes before.
"A patriotic German Jew who worked tirelessly to ensure mass killings of allied soldiers ...Jews suffered holocaust at the hand of Nazis.

Maybe we need to revisit why Hitler hated the Jews so much.
Had we allowed the big hint of a nitrogen limit to warn us off overpopulation we wouldn't be staring at total climate collapse. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
deja vu?
What a high brow question.  You are basically asking how to keep the simple minded majority out of the decision making process when it comes society as a whole.
He is a hero for feeding the world but very wrong in supporting a war. The real question is not a question of science but ethics.
just because u can and if u dont someone else will doesnt mean it justifies it tho.
"The consept of the use of very powerful weapons in war,
to END a war, will always be very contraversial. 
  The atom bombs used on Japan beibg rhe best example.

"At 2:55 I paused the video and googled Fritz Haber. He came up with a way to make ammonia. Maybe it's because I'm severely depressed but I just don't have the patience for the ""keep em wanting more"" type, ""ask a question but don't answer it but instead give some other info first"" type of stuff. Just give me the info. It's interesting enough as it is without this tired format. But that's just me."

"Should education about dual use and ethics be a mandatory part of university education in the sciences, I'm wondering? In my (German) science education this topic was never brought up during lectures at the uni. Is this different in other nations or at other universities? Recently, I heard a natural scientist (post-doc level) give an interview and not know the term ""dual use""... It's not a new topic as we see with Haber, but it seems some(?) or many (?) scientists still seem to be oblivious... Def gonna share this video."
"Well, his discovery wasn't that big of a deal, since multiple scientists around the world came up with the same solution anyway. Also his discovery is not that important because other people made it into mass production."

"Such a great intellectual contribution here on Youtube. Top job ! As a Jewish man, the irony, or perhaps more accurately, ""ironies"" of Fritz Haber's professional career are unparalleled. Additionally, I now understand more clearly why Klaus Schwab and the WEF are aggressively retracting use of nitrogen chemical fertilizers around the world. All is they have to do is stop their use and the world population decreases by 4 billion! What a fascinating way to wage war."
"This is why I see agriculture as being the development of healthy soil, first and foremost, even before the development of healthy food."
"I possibly owe my life to him, so you're saying I have to exist because of this guy"
"I don't see Haber as a villain, He is just doing his best for his fellow citizens. The borderline of morality in a war is vague, it's kill or be killed, it all depends on which side ur on. No sane man would want his country to be colonized, his fellow citizens which will be suffering and his family to be included aswell if Germany were to be colonized. It's not like he is trying to eradicate the opposition, he just wants to win the war, for his citizens to prosper. Einstein in this sense is a little bit selfish he remained neutral in the war because he knows he and his family would survive wether or not his country suffered because he's Einstein any country would want to protect him."

"I have a whole lot of trouble with ""saved"" in that headline. It implies that the humans existed and his discovery saved their lives, whereas what it is *attempting* to describe is allowing the world population to grow. 

This is roughly like banning birth control and claiming to have ""saved lives"" by causing more births."
"@Cruzeto Well, no. Realistically when you increase the total population you increase most ways to die, since everyone does die eventually. And for sure the increased population led to larger-scale famines. It's not like I'm saying we should stop fertilizing, mind you. I'm saying that the ""he did good, he did bad"" concept could have been done in much better ways than that headline."
"Is true, billions in inflated, but it saved many from starvation undoubtedly"
"The simple fact is that we will all die very soon. There is no escaping death only delaying it. So the question is why do we have to die.

And you thought the Nazis where bad!!!
Yes. They killed way more with gas than in Fritz Haber's lifetime.
Top notch history video :) ty as always

I thought the incident in Beirut had more to do with trade beurocracy surrounding a cargo ship and another chemical being stored nearby that was able to react with the ammonium nitrate because a fire jeapordised containment of both chemicals.

You could say he is the reason farmers do not know how to manage land anymore for both livestock and plant foods. Factory farming helps sell antibiotics so farmer can keep farm animals in unhealthy environments for food production and recalls after everyone gets paid for scientifically unsafe foods.

"European farmers collect all the slurry from cattle and live stock. They used to make piles of hay and poop, and let them sit for a year, it's called composting in today's world. All poop has nitrogen, as long as it's left sit for one year it's perfectly safe to use in fields that grow crops, plus there is that old 💡idea of crop rotation that also helps."
"Nitrogen , along with C02, feeds the world and makes all plant life possible. Leftist Wackos want to outlaw both and make people starve."
the discovery of the haber bosch process was without doubt a turning point in human history
"“Scientists, therefore, are responsible for their research, not only intellectually but also morally. This responsibility has become an important issue in many of today's sciences, but especially so in physics, in which the results of quantum mechanics and relativity theory have opened up two very different paths for physicists to pursue. They may lead us - to put it in extreme terms - to the Buddha or to the Bomb, and it is up to each one of us to decide which path to take. ”

"Question : if combining 2 nitrogen atoms create so much energy,why isn't this used as a source for creating electricity?"
"@Matthew Sadler In my opinion that is different, since in a nuclear plant, the splitting happens through the use of an unstable and dangerous element. It makes it much more difficult to build a plant that manages such an unstable element and also creates a waste that can last up to million of years. I think that this splitting could be more controlled and with no long term wastes. While this method is the inverse, you actually fision atoms to create energy without nuclear waste that you need to manage on the long term. You could use it as a battery (split when there is enough energy, combine when you need energy)"
Splitting and recombining atomic bonds releases large amounts of energy which we’ve used to generate electricity for over half a century now; it’s called Nuclear Power 😂🤦‍♂️
This guy's a freaking Hero.

"he didn't say billions nor is his work responsible for billions of lives today. the commercial crops that are grown such as soy or the overwhelming majority of GMO crops are not properly utilized, billions still go hungry, there is a ton of food waste, and we have destroyed millions of acres of arable land through questionable agriculture practices driven in part or entirely by his work

The ending statement about information being a double-edged sword is amazing
"He is not a monster. Had the war never happened, he wouldn't have turned his prodigious mind into murder.

When his country needed food, he found a way to make air into bread. 
When his country gone to war, he fought that war as a chemist would (with explosives and poison). 
When his country got broken, he worked on distiling gold from sea water to pay for it's debts.
When he was exiled from his country, he died of broken heart.

He was not a monster. And not an angel for that matter... He just lived and died for Kennedy words: ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"", and he done that before Kennedy said that words, or was born at all."

I hv seen most of the your video in binge watch but i can say this is your Mangun opus
Simple thing Indian farmers been doing for ages to put nitrogen into soil is by growing pulses and lentil crops in seasonally between other crops. This is not only effective but also natural
So that's why man-made nitrogen fertilizer causes a nitrogen deficiency in the ground if it's made out of ammonia it's literally sterilizing the ground you need to find a way to allow those nitrogen producing bacteria and man-made nitrogen fertilizers to work together rather than have one killing the other chemists we need to find a less poisonous version of nitrogen fertilizer

"It's sad that Haber took such a warmongering attitude to his technology. Science is never good or evil, and most technology can often be abused for nefarious purposes. If the Allies lost WW2, it's possible we'd be seeing this same episode demonizing Albert Einstein. The monster who attempted to create a limitless energy source instead passing his theories onto the allies to allow them to develop city destroying weapons. Technology is relative, but as it progresses, society must be intelligent enough to know how not to use it."

".Islam is a religion that calls for the worship of God alone, who has no partner, and that Muhammad is the last of the messengers. The Qur’an is the last book of God. It is one copy that has not been distorted. Scientists prove scientifically things that were discovered only in recent years, such as the stages of the formation of the fetus and many other facts that God has mentioned in the Qur’an to prove the authenticity of the Qur’an. That is, from God, and to establish an argument against the people and upon those who heard of this, God is the one who created you and He is the one who will send you after the grave to the reckoning. Have you not wondered one day who holds the heavens and the earth to pass away, and who provides for you and who created you from dust, and where you are when you sleep and this is an example of the grave And sleeping after it is an example of the resurrection of the resurrection"

"Unfortunately, the last question you propose is exactly why I find myself doing nothing nearly all of the time. I don't necessarily view humanity as bad... but I find that our ambitions and desires, no matter how noble in intentions, have vastly unknowable consequences. I know this shouldn't stop me from pursuing my own ambitions and dreams, but it fills me with such dread I am unable to continue."
"You cant control, we are built to destroy our self. thank you."
"The other side of the ""only for what's good for humanity"" issue is found in Haber's justification for developing chemical weapons: He wanted to end the war quickly, and in so doing, save lives.

Had the US not intervened in WWI, the Allies wouldn't have had enough remaining military power to force the Treaty of Versailles on Germany. No Treaty of Versailles, no hyperinflation. No hyperinflation, no rise of the Nazi party. Frankly, there's even more to that that is beyond the scope of this comment.

The point is that we often extend suffering when we get so caught up in our own moral certainty."

Seriously - you need to take the time to read on the N cycle from a plant and soil perspective. I am shocked at the effort you put in to the cartoons but not the research.
A few types of bacteria?!?!?!? WTH??? ALL ENDOPHYTES fix N - they cannot persist if they cannot!!!
"The Physicists, a play by Durrenmatt, discusses this exact topic: the double-edged nature of science, and the responsibility of the scientist in how their findings are used."
<<THE DEATH OF A MILLION IS A NECESSITY!>>  some crazed fictional sub captain somewhere
Dude all plants fix N from the air… this is frustrating. You have to do more research before you spread this disinformation.
"Knowledge is power, and with great power comes great responsibility. The people amassing the knowledge, aka scientists, sadly don't often have the power to take that responsibility. The only choice a researcher could make is to publish their findings or not. Publish, and eventually an ill-intentioned organization will use the findings to do evil in the world. Even if one doesn't publish their findings in well-known journals or at conferences, if said organizations are aware that one holds important knowledge, they will do everything, untoward or not, legal or not, to find out. The only option if some knowledge is deemed too dangerous, is destroying all equipment, documentation and records and forgetting everything. The scientist is not responsible, those in power are. Lamenting on how one's inventions or discoveries can be used for harming people, only leads to insanity, because everything can be weaponized. If I develop solar cells, they could be used to power a killer satellite. If I research X-ray technology, it can be used for surveillance and as a cancer ray."
"Because we sterilized our plants, we killed the N-fixing bacteria and fungi that used to live inside and on the surface of plants. We can bring them back - it’s important to understand the basics of soil science when delving into this topic. I have videos on this on my channel that could help."
"He did not attend to his God, and he did not attend to his family.

Wisdom is more valuable than any other science. It is also one that requires practice as well as knowledge. This man was not wise.

We need wise leaders, who practise loving God and man - not merely their own! - above all other priorities. Or you get World War 1 and 2. 

St. Louis IX, Bl. Charles of Austria,  and all you holy kings, pray for us."
78% of the Atmosphere is NITROGEN - plants get a HUGE portion of their N from the air (the debate about how much is still currently going): saying it’s from the soil is not accurate and misleading.
This guy was so much interested and i thinkl he is responsible for today population...;D
"As stated in the video you can't blame him for something he invented as someone else in the future would invent inevitable. He isn't to blame. And we can see the butterfly effect in action here. A scientist passion to invent something for good purpose, lead to the death's of millions and at the same time the saving and of other millions. Someone's actions today could result in the misery, pain and even death of someone else in the future without knowing it. You can't just blame him neither for good or bad. He was just a scientist. All things in life have a good use and an evil use. It ultimately depends on how good or evil the person who uses that power is."
However we do know that sometimes things can be used for 'evil' even if it's not intended for that. So by bringing forth something with potential for misuse is something he can be blamed for
"He went out of his way to kill people with his invention? What the hell are you on about with ""you can't blame him"". The guy was insanely evil and out to destroy human lives in a terrible way. In the end, yes, it is completely irrelevant that he made the invention. What matters is how he wanted to use it, and that was far from just for good.

He had smart people around him like Einstein who were denouncing the war. He could easily have known better. He also didn't show growth as a person, his ideas got darker. You can't blame him is a weak excuse for his insanely terrible actions."
Haber is also portrayed briefly in Genius Season 1: Einstein. It's worth watching.
"Killed millions, saved billions and eventually led to the destruction of everything due to population led climate change."
Fritz Haber is basically like the real Tony Stark.

Explosive equals devestation. The use of it is only to destroy you cant build anything or solve problems with boms even though humanity makes themselfs believe so. It only caused death and despair in the history and still is! It has been used since the past by the wrong people and shouldnt be made in the first place. Power equels destroy of humanity. Choosing between 1 life or 100000 lifes shouldnt be a choice in the first place. What is 1 life worth if you make the decision to soon? Explosions are made to destroy and kill and one of the worst inventions ever! People are used to use moments and situations as an excuse that killing thousands of people is justified. People who havent done anything are the victims of goverments war and the worst thing is this happened for the last hundred of years. If i were a scientologist i wouldnt invent anything for the destruction but something for the better. Thats what i have learned from all the innocent deaths by these inventions. Invent to build not to destroy. Because the power is not used properly if your not following up the basics in life. Its a harsh truth for sure!

He made fertilizer and the population grew and now we can't feed all the people's.
Well the same was done to the native Americans by the europeans and to Algerians by the french. The french detonated 6 nuclear weapons in Algeria. Till today the Algerians suffer from the nuclear radiation ☢️. Thanks Europeans.
"Carl Bosch was also the cofounder of the ammonia process 
i think that explains part of the disbelief people had in him from his own wife and all the other scientists after what he did in the war"
"Up until the late 20th century, almost all advances in science were made to improve the ways in which the king or emperor could defeat his enemies on the battlefield."
So all the plants are green and healthy looking but lack nutrients and provides no actual benefit
"Haber was a villain, and likely responsible for the murder of his first wife."
"Fritz kinda looks like hitler without hair ngl




Edit: pretty good vid👍🏻 i thought this whole 22 minute vid is just 12."
w WW2 germany
Heart touching and informative ❤️
Dude killed his wife.
How is he irrelevant your logic could be applied to all scientists ever and all scientific discoveries somebody else could have found those just because somebody else could have done it doesn't mean that he or they are irrelevant doesn't mean he's a hero or evil but it doesn't make him irrelevant personally in my opinion I would say that I think he was just trying to do what he thought was best
"I've been a subscriber to your channel for many years now, this has been one of the best videos I've seen on your channel, it encourages to go beyond just watching the video and think, awesome work!"
"Artificially ""feeding half the world"" is probably the biggest contributor to the climate change. You can change your title to ""The scientist who killed millions and artificially bred billions and killed trillions""."
this video fundamentally changed how I view the dissemination of knowledge and the creation of new technologies.  I cannot decide how humanity uses knowledge or how that knowledge is exploited by those who choose to do so.  what I can do is contribute to the betterment of us all by working towards new discoveries and furthering the breadth of human experience.
"It’s why all new breakthroughs in science and technology are heavily vetted through an ethics committee (although not perfect) made up of experts in that field who write a “white paper” highlighting the advantages and weighing them against the worst hypothetical outcomes, with checks and balances along the way…. 

This “white paper” is then passed on to the government who decide whether to green light it for further research or the polar opposite on the spectrum of research, they could ban it completely along with new laws to go along side it…"
he is patriotic scientist....an heartful soilder ..... a gentle beast
"Nice video, very well narrated. The quality of your vids always gets higher."
Yummyyyyyyyy
"It depends on intention. If it's done in secrecy and fanaticism, for an agency with violent uses for it, using violence and fanaticism to keep it secret... you don't have a say, your role is victim. Haber developed explosives and chemical weapons for the German Empire. Nazi adaptation of pesticide Zyklon B wasn't public. Good Germans all.
If it's done in the open, competing for a market with civilized uses for it or in a spirit of civic service, you have a say, you are an actor. Then it can be debated, mitigated, modulated. Haber developed fertilizers and pesticides for agricultural needs. Good Germans all. 
There's always an industry producing it, some sort of company. Public or Private. It's the end customer, what we allow to be ""legal"" and ""patriotic"" and ""good"" and have power and enforce secrecy."
Ammonium nitrate both life giver and taker... It's like nature wants to test how Humanity would use this and we failed it.
"I understand what he felt during the Great War, I understand his patriotism, I understand his line of thought."
Why there is no movie about him?
This isn't new or original. I almost thought you were reposting content.
"fun fact, breathing zyclon B turns your skin cherry pink...oh god...so many accounts of dead bodies with red skin from those horrible gas chambers....
oh wait...there are none?"
"Except for the part about saving billions, this could be about Fauci"
"""..catalyst, something that lowers the energy required..."" Congratulations, you've been kicked out of any chemistry exam anywhere."
no joke im serious my school in germany had the name fritz habers then they changed it
"In answer to the final question regarding beneficial uses or weapons in science.
Morality!"
Lol
"To suggest killing millions in such a way, even to end a war is a clear and obvious lack of empathy for humanity, the man was a monster albeit a very smart monster."
He is no different than the scientist that created the nuclear bomb and energy.
"Hi Sergei, 10k+1 comments, in 4 days wow; Haber stinky ammonia buzyed my mind in the last 30 days; still they had to be 2 beautiful minds again for this finding"
He lived long enough to become the villain.
"Justify it all you like, he developed weapons on purpose. His wife knew it and couldn't live with the idea of supporting such a man and cause. You can commit a crime and just say ""Someone else would have done it"". We already know setting a good example causes other to do good too. I wouldn't stain your channel with such justifications about scientists doing evil. It just makes you a long term accomplice."
"woah, Goosebumps near the end. As soon as you said Zyklon B"
@E-Team the death of 6+ million people
Why is that?
"And ever since, various militaries around the world, stated funding extremely large amounts to various science project's."
"Great video as always but the idea that someone being a pacifist, precludes them from being a patriot is problematic. Someday ""patriot"" might be solely defined as ""must be pro-war"" or ""must be pro-killing those with ideological differences"" or ""pro-fascism"" but that's not today. One can love one's country, be a pacifist, and be a patriot."
"I absolutely agree. I was taken aback when Einstein's ""pacifism""  was contrasted with Haber's ""patriotism"".  The meanings of these words  are not mutually exclusive and should not be used to contrast one another. A poor choice of words in an otherwise excellent video!"
He saw himself as god.
Wouldn't you say changing the pH of the soil can have negative impact on the plant life ?
"Oddly, even thought his invention allows us to feed billions more people, that ultimately is killing the planet. Would we survive longer, if we had fewer people?"
@E-Team Another what?
Oh no. Another one.
Veritasium is just as good as vsauce
Imagine they had employed Haber during WW2. They literally dumped a crazy scientist because of his religious background. It really shows that discrimination is dumb.
It wasn’t because of his religion.
"Bigger question is,is he gonna call Saul Goodman at his court trial?"
17:41 lmao why not reference America’s own chemical weapon laboratory instead? 😂
I own 167 acres of forest. I’m offset enough already.
12:13 I could of sworn that the explosion was last year time really does fly 🤯
Why gather nitrogen from fossilized guano? It is far better to extract nitrates from human Urine. Urine can easily be concentrated by simple evaporation and re-packaged as solids. We will never run short of fertiliser this way.
"Video sounding pro nitrogen as a fertalizer has me laughing my ass off as the WEF and Globalists are kneecapping the worlds food supply by demonizing nitrogen and placing bans on it. We owe our lives to a German while a Jew wants to destroy it, the irony is amazing LOL"
"My ancestors were just a small tribe of different clan and Soo we were closed to the world and was very undeveloped ,it has not been long since we started developing so in my opinion he did not save our life since we did not depend on other sources of the world, my great grandfather's were fully independent only hunting n farming with old methods and skills 
That's all, thank u for the patience of reading my comment 
Blessed day to you"
I love your videos
I didn’t click on that video for several days because I didn’t know it was from your channel based on the thumbnail… and on my tv I have to pay close attention on the small latters Veritasium… better do something that is recognizable like putting the logo on the tumbnail or even better your face :D I clicked on the video because I went to the channel and I was - Oh that video is from you lets watch it
@E-Team looks like that animated military (world war 2 etc.) videos on youtube
What about the thumbnail made you leery?
"I would not blame him. It was war and he did what he thinks was right. Though outcome was depressing. Also blaming science is also not sensible, we can kill someone with pen also.

Ohh you’re in Sydney!!!
The ammonium nitrate in Beirut didn’t detonate. It deflagrated. Know the difference.
It went boom. Know that those differences only matter to nerds.
This is the best science video I've ever watched to this day.
This is the best video i have watched today
"Killed : 999.99 million
Saved : 1 billion

Oohh…"
They supposedly used zyklon B in chambers often only closed off by wooden doors incapable of creating the right seal to block it off... numerous soldiers in the camps at least wouldve gotten sick or died if the holocaust happened as people say
amazing stories.
Looks more like Hideki Tojo to me.
He looks like Heisenberg

Not worth it

"I think this is the perfect take for Fritz Haber. 
He is neither a Hero or Villian, he was simply a scientist, who's research directly and indirectly caused a lot of good and a lot of bad. It's not really fair to weigh his good deeds and his bad. 
Science and Discovery in itself isn't good or bad its how the scientists and future honers use it. 

This gave me a lot of insight, I resubbed since I haven't been subscribed since 2018 <3"
@Envexa nah just saying to analyze holistically
In that case no one is a hero or villain… everyone is just a curious scientist.
surely theres got to be more reason why she killed herself
ok im gonna predict this guy either made mustard gas or chlorine gas
"On Aug 04 in Beirut the ammonium nitrate container didn't '""catch fire"", it was raided killing people and injuring thousands.
What you said was a dumb political lie fed by our poor and other governments.
""Caught fire"" heh."

Ohh Noo.. mustard gas
NO ES AMERICANO CITIZANO!
😱😱😱😱😱😱
"One if the most conflicting biographies ever. Still not fully written story.
Haber-Bosch is the single most difficult process to run on fluctuating renewable energy sources. People will get back to a much more balanced view on Fritz Haber. Food shortage is at the roots of all wars. Today that is wars about oil supply for fertilizers and driving tractors. About shipping food, fertilzers and energy across oceans and trading them w/o military ships needed to escorting them all the way."
Wow brilliant blog but then destroys all credibility with “Climate Crisis bs”😅
That's why today's population is close to 8 billions
It is sad how humanity came a long way through evolution as the undisputed smartest animal and the ultimate survival to reaching a point of creating a handful of ways to destroy it's own survival and species as a whole... very ironic yet it also shows how humans have a long way still against thier own collective consciousness and motive
I believe he was Tony stark at that time in chemistry
I was going to say the editing at the start was kinda off for you're style. But after it was finished I'm glad you structured it that way. Well done
"Great pragmatic men are never understood by lesser emotional men. In time, man will speak highly of Hitler once the emotional memory dissipates."
"Partially, it‘s already come this far"
"I think a question mark after ‘billions’ in the video title might be warranted. It’s perhaps too early to conclude that the use of ammonium nitrate fertiliser has saved humanity from hunger, given strong evidence emerging that overuse of nitrates on topsoil is slowly eroding our ability to cultivate land on the scale required to feed the world’s still growing population. It may be that one of the great ‘what ifs’ in human history will be whether combining new chemical processes with localised regenerative agriculture might have achieved the same results as Haber’s product without diminishing future society’s ability to farm that same land. As the video concludes, nothing is without consequence, regardless of intention."
"@too muhh Again that’s purely supposition that population wouldn’t have grown without him. And the restorative soil processes we might now be left with are not new, they’re how farming occurred before chemical fertilisers."
"lol the population wouldnt as bigger without him, ""new"" restorative techs only exist because his invention"
@None Given U ok hun?
"Yeah, and we could get taken out by an asteroid tomarrow. In the mean time I am going to take a long hot shower, use an aerosol can or two, drive my twin turbo V8 gas only car to my boat and enjoy life to the fullest...if a manatee gets in the way....future societies are simply NOT MY PROBLEM. Dont care, never will."
"A prayer for peace.
 Father God, I often find myself overwhelmed by circumstances that are beyond my control, and I am easily distracted by things that don’t matter. Please forgive me for not consistently placing my trust in You. Even when I am faced with intense situations, You are still with me. You are the Creator of peace, and I can have access to Your peace-filled presence whenever I draw near to You. So instead of silencing Your Holy Spirit when I start to feel anxious or discouraged, help me to make room in my heart and mind to experience the peace You freely give. In Jesus’ name, Amen."
He was a hero 100% . A scientist that volunteered in a war for his country.. But to judge the past with present mentality is so easy…
A movie can be made
Fritz Haber died of a bad heart
The analogues with the Manhattan project are striking
"'saved billions' is complete bull; he did no such thing. Also its not like we're sustainable as a species; we're on a trajectory he set us on that is doomed to fail. overpopulation is just as damaging to the earths ecosystems as overconsumption, both of which his discoveries contributed immensely to. The jury is still out on just how many will die if total system collapse occurs as a direct result of his discoveries. This video is far too friendly toward Haber, our species might pull this off and become sustainable, but I'm not seeing it yet."
Recommended 4 times already wtf...
Killed millions and saved billions? Yeah f**k that guy
"If you're going to wage war at all, you need to be aggressive and also calculate where an attack would effectively yield quick victory. 

This can backfire if the enemy's defense is too strong into a protracted conflict that incites escalation out of desperation. 

The way a civilized person can learn to have more control over that tension is to study all the options available besides declaring war in the first place. 

War will remain war."
what goes around comes around.
"barbarians of the past are the gentlemen of the present, just how hypocrite they are..."
He does not seem a villain to me. More like a patriotic scientist.
"Trenches and machine guns were responsible for the war dragging on. 

Gas was responsible for high lethality but Haber intended it to perform like a tank: he was hoping a crushing offense would break trenches. It's a calculated risk playing for very high stakes, but in his defense he didn't start the war and 1860s developments in military technology and strategies were already heralding mass devastation. 

Germans were studying the US Civil War by observing it directly. 

They were expecting Napoleonic style warfare but with faster cannons, so powerful defense. 

WW1 was kept short. 4 years is very short for a war. It would have been.....unthinkable....if it had lasted 10-15 years. 

In the end what brought the end of the war was killing enough men on both sides everyone quit. 

It probably had to be like that except take longer. 

WW2 was at least 5 more years of what we understand to be the same war taken up again. In WW2 high lethality offensive capabilities were exactly what threatened the end and checkmate faster. 

And it did save more lives. 

WW2 the fear was more about world domination and not being permitted to join the chosen, but it was known there would be survivors. Even the nuclear programs were mostly confident they were saving most of the world and not going to trigger extinction."
seems like his intentions for saving billions was competition and was a nationalist who made so many chemical weapons. to me he does seem like a problematic historical figure.
Fake news
Haber process?
I thought it said Minions
This man was chillin with Emcee squared 🥇🎖
Am I the only one that thinks Fritz is the funniest name ever?
In other words he is responsible for the overpupulation of the earth.
There's nothing wrong with killing humanity because it sucks to be human.
Same did Hitler
"AMAZING, this is by far one of the best videos on this channel."
Bill Gates......
"i legit thought it said 
The Scientist Who Killed Minions and Saved Billions"
"why would you consider him a villain? Because he used his invention to help his country in WW1? I mean thinking like this, all soldiers that get voluntarily in the army and go to war and kill people are villains. He was a great scientist whose discoveries helped humanity prosper, the fact that he used his inventions in order to help his country fight a war does not make him a villain but a patriot just like the guy in the video said."
by f. habers invention of amonia synthesis nitrogen source expanded by using amonia on fertilizers and food production increased. so feeding plants and other species become possible.
"Don't forget the Texas City disaster.  In the explosion, a *two ton anchor* was sent 1.6 miles.  Something likely weighing more than your car, more than 28 football fields.  The explosion sent two planes hurtling out of the sky.  Fertilizer is nothing to be messed with."
This sounds like a made up story. I can't picture anyone paying money for bird poop.
"I was waiting for this dude to accidentally discover chemical weapons. This dude deserved to be shunned. Also, I have more faith in humanity and I believe someone else could have come up with a way to create nitrogen based fertilisers. If Incans could have figured it out, then so could we."
Does the means justify the end?
"He didn't save billions, he created them. He's a God. And gods aren't ideal, like we want to think, they too make mistakes."
I hate the word carbon footprint because all it does is shift the blame from big companies to individuals I did not create any of the products that harm the environment so my carbon footprint is zero
"As Israeli Jewish, this article shocked me. Thank you very much."
"The road to hell is paved with ""good"" intentions. And often you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."
Maybe by making an organisation to check the information before popularizing and ensuring safety of everyone so that there will be no such circumstances that they were put into situation for using these chemicals in a wrong way....
Kiritsugu would be really proud of this guy

hey other countries i know we are killing all your people and throwing countless lives away but can we uhhhh ban gas bombs they are too OP
"Awesome video, thanks."
I bet the basalt & carbonates from the Wren project will adversely affect the environment in some way.
imagine how good food would taste if it wasn't laced with disgusting artificial fertilizers
"To all you Leftist wingnuts: nuclear weapons have probably saved tens, if not hundreds, of millions of lives. Just because something is a weapon doesn’t mean it’s bad."

"Collectively, we’re an algal bloom:
Cyanobacteria (single-celled thingy) and humans (multi-celled planet masters) BOTH rapidly increase their numbers thanks to all the goodies in fertilizer. Cyanobacteria will overrun its environment, choking out most other life, and it’s numbers eventually crash. Humans bring larger and more sophisticated tools to run the same cycle on a comically larger scale. That’s nature, for ya."
"crop rotation . soil is living, this  nitrogen ruins soil"
"I don’t know about everyone else, but I’m more upset at this dude for the over population problem he enabled, than for his explosives! Don’t need to convince us that war is a crime, or to split hears."
Haber and heisenberg(walter white) both wanted to do something good initially but ended up being bad.
Instead she should kill his husband
What about the attack of the dead men? How they survived a gas attack and kicked their asses out of Poland? TRUE STORY. No gas can kill a Russian. 💪 🇷🇺
"This is very close of a story to the Manhatten project where the nuclear energy can be a double edged sword, amazing how science can be interpreted in many ways."
@Kapten *BINGO!*
"@Mattia Rubio Even right now, if russia didn’t have those old nukes from the days of the USSR, NATO would have curb stomped Russia by now.
Nukes are the only thing preventing NATO countries from helping Ukraine. Thus why have +150 days of war now."
"@Mattia Rubio Yes you are right the nukes are literally saving as from ww3 because everybody is scared of war with them. But that is also a bit of their problem because if a war started with them it would be a complete catastrophe. The conclusion is that if they weren't any nukes war would probably be a normal thing like before and there would be a lot more smaller conflicts in the world it's also possible that instead of a cold war the real war would be unfortunately the activists can't think like this and think ""its bad because... its bad"" and of course yes nukes are not good but they are needed."
So he's like like Thanos if Avengers didn't stop him.
Meanwhile here in the Netherlands they want to lower the nitrogen in the soil and disown more than ten thousand farmers. Absolute madness.
I never skipped an ad because Veritasium more than deserves to be paid for this excellent video.
"Literally....

I have a single question about the carbonates from the carbon placed in the forest. Are they monitoring the forest very closely to be sure that the massive jump in acidic water in the area isn't killing the very same trees that they are placing these carbonates right next to. I'm not saying that it is wrong to attempt to remove excess carbon from the atmosphere but I don't think that their process is actually as safe or effective for the local environment as they want it to be.
"It’s mainly the pH of the oceans you need to worry about, they absorb lots of CO2 and when dissolved in water forms carbonic acid, so slowly the oceans are becoming more acidic….

It is one hypothesis put forward to explain why large patches of coral keep dying form the Great Barrier Reef over the decades….

Carbonic acid needs to react with a base like Calcium from limestone rock to form a solid carbonate salt, outside of water the equilibrium shifts over to favour Carbon Dioxide, which will be absorbed by plants during photosynthesis"

"Just like how the internet can be used as a tool for knowledge, connecting with others of similar interests, and broadcasting our human creativity. It can also be used to spread false propaganda and make people social isolated or monitored by the govt/corporations. It all depends on who has the power over technological advancement."

"Granted, there's a lot of great info here. But  the wrap up misdirects the reader to the point of harm. It tries to remove the autonomy Haber strove for in the usage of his inventions. Sure, perhaps others would have invented the chemical processes had Haber not done so. But as you reported yourself, Haber immediately commercialized the process in his own name to accrue great wealth, and then doggedly directed that wealth, his energy, and led others into chemical weapons research to murder hundreds of thousands during his life, and millions of his own heritage after his death. Haber directly shaped the results of his research, and his later actions destroys any credibility to the argument of non-selfish intentions for his nitrogen process research. Decent scientists abhor the atrocities committed with their inventions. Haber personally directed the war crime slaughter of thousands of soldiers until it was redirected towards the Jewish people. The population boom was incidental to his goals of Fame and wealth, though deliberate. The slaughter was his direct goal. You need an ethics committee to keep you accountable for your work. People get blinded by self interest and misdirection. All successful scientists do, but if you can't see Haber's autonomy in this, you need really close oversight."

"The climate change science predicted that certain large cities would be under water by 2022 unless a whole lot more carbon emission reduction took place than has. A whole lot more. Obviously that hasn't happened. So it seems like there's a flaw in that science, somewhere. 

CO2 gets converted to oxygen through photosynthesis which produces energy that is used to fuel plant growth, and then the oxygen is converted back into CO2 by animals through respiration, which produces energy that fuels animal growth. If CO2 increases in the atmosphere, I would expect an increase in plants to happen somewhere. I realize we're chopping down forests at a stupid rate, and have been since forever, but I'm not sure we're carefully watching every scrap of land that might be growing more CO2 consuming / oxygen producing weeds than it had been before. And we've also eliminated unbelievably enormous numbers of oxygen breathing / CO2 producing fish. 

Given that carbon obviously isn't nearly the climate change threat that people have been convinced that it is, and given that it is extremely critical to plant and animal life, it seems like deliberately trapping carbon in the ground.. for a really, really long time - might *not* be a good idea. At least not on a large scale."

"Genesis 12 Now the Lord God had said unto Abram, “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee.

2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.

3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”

4 So Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.

5 And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, and into the land of Canaan they came.

6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanites were then in the land.

7 And the Lord appeared unto Abram and said, “Unto thy seed will I give this land.” And there built he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him.

8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.

9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

10 And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the land.

11 And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, “Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon.

12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.

13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live because of thee.”

14 And it came to pass, when Abram had come into Egypt, that the Egyptians beheld the woman, that she was very fair.

15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.

16 And he treated Abram well for her sake; and he had sheep and oxen and heasses, and menservants and maidservants, and sheasses and camels.

17 And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.

18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

19 Why saidst thou, ‘She is my sister,’ so I might have taken her to me for a wife? Now therefore behold thy wife; take her and go thy way.”

20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had."
"Genesis 11 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there.

3 And they said one to another, “Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.

4 And they said, “Come, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.”

5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built.

6 And the Lord said, “Behold, the people are one and they have all one language, and this they begin to do; and now nothing will be withheld from them which they have imagined to do.

7 Come, let Us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”

8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off building the city.

9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel [that is, Confusion], because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood;

11 and Shem lived after he begot Arphaxad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begot Salah;

13 and Arphaxad lived after he begot Salah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.

14 And Salah lived thirty years and begot Eber;

15 and Salah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.

16 And Eber lived four and thirty years and begot Peleg;

17 and Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.

18 And Peleg lived thirty years and begot Reu;

19 and Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.

20 And Reu lived two and thirty years and begot Serug;

21 and Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.

22 And Serug lived thirty years and begot Nahor;

23 and Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.

24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years and begot Terah;

25 and Nahor lived after he begot Terah one hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.

26 And Terah lived seventy years and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot.

28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldeans.

29 And Abram and Nahor took for themselves wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran and dwelt there.

32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran."
"Genesis 10 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood.

2 The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

3 And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.

4 And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.

5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided into their lands, every one after his own tongue, according to their families, into their nations.

6 And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim, and Put and Canaan.

7 And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah, and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.

8 And Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth.

9 He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; therefore it is said, “Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.”

10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

11 Out of that land he went forth to Assyria, and built Nineveh and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

12 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city.

13 And Mizraim begot Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim

14 and Pathrusim and Casluhim (out of whom came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.

15 And Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth;

16 and the Jebusite and the Amorite, and the Girgashite

17 and the Hivite, and the Arkite and the Sinite,

18 and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; and as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha.

20 These are the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their countries and in their nations.

21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

22 The children of Shem: Elam and Asshur, and Arphaxad and Lud and Aram.

23 And the children of Aram: Uz and Hul, and Gether and Mash.

24 And Arphaxad begot Salah, and Salah begot Eber.

25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg, for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.

26 And Joktan begot Almodad and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth and Jerah,

27 and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah,

28 and Obal and Abimael and Sheba,

29 and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.

30 And their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar, a mount of the east.

31 These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands, according to their nations.

32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their generations, in their nations; and by these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood."
"Genesis 9 And Lord God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth.

2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.

4 “But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.

5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require. At the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man.

6 Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man.

7 And you, be ye fruitful and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.”

8 And God spoke unto Noah and to his sons with him, saying,

9 “And I, behold, I establish My covenant with you and with your seed after you,

10 and with every living creature that is with you — of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth.

11 And I will establish My covenant with you: Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.”

12 And God said, “This is the token of the covenant which I make between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:

13 I do set My rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth.

14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the cloud.

15 And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

16 And the rainbow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.”

17 And God said unto Noah, “This is the token of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”

18 And the sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.

19 These are the three sons of Noah, and from them was the whole earth overspread.

20 And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard.

21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.

22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren outside.

23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.

24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.

25 And he said, “Cursed be Canaan! A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.”

26 And he said, “Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.”

28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died."

"Genesis 8 And Lord God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were assuaged.

2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained.

3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually, and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.

6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.

7 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

8 Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;

9 but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

10 And he stayed yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.

11 And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.

12 And he stayed yet another seven days and sent forth the dove, which returned not again unto him any more.

13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry.

14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.

15 And God spoke unto Noah, saying,

16 “Go forth from the ark, thou and thy wife, and thy sons and thy sons’ wives with thee.

17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth.”

18 And Noah went forth, and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him.

19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

20 And Noah built an altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

21 And the Lord smelled a sweet savor; and the Lord said in His heart, “I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake, for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.”"
"Genesis 7 And the Lord said unto Noah, “Come thou and all thy house into the ark, for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation.

2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.

3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.”

5 And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him.

6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.

7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

9 there went in two by two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female as God had commanded Noah.

10 And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.

11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, that same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark—

14 they, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.

15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.

16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him; and the Lord shut him in.

17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.

18 And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered.

20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, and the mountains were covered.

21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of cattle and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

22 all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, all that was on the dry land, died.

23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle, and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth. And Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days."
"Genesis 6 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them,

2 that the sons of Lord God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took for themselves wives of all whom they chose.

3 And the Lord said, “My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for he also is flesh; yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.”

4 There were giants on the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of Lord God came in unto the daughters of men and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men who were of old, men of renown.

5 And Lord God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagining of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.

6 And the Lord repented that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him in His heart.

7 And the Lord said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air, for I repent that I have made them.”

8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

9 These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

10 And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.

12 And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

13 And God said unto Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

14 Make thee an ark of gopherwood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt cover it within and without with pitch.

15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

16 A window shalt thou make for the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

17 And behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven; and every thing that is on the earth shall die.

18 But with thee will I establish My covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife and thy sons’ wives with thee.

19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.

20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive.

21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be food for thee and for them.”

22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."

2 Male and female created He them, and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created.

3 And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth.

4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years; and he begot sons and daughters.

5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years; and he died.

30 And Lamech lived after he begot Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begot sons and daughters.

31 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years; and he died.

32 And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth."
"Genesis 4 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man from the Lord.”

2 And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

3 And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.

4 And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering;

5 but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

6 And the Lord said unto Cain, “Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen?

7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”

8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.

9 And the Lord said unto Cain, “Where is Abel thy brother?” And he said, “I know not. Am I my brother’s keeper?”

10 And He said, “What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto Me from the ground.

11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.

12 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength. A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be on the earth.”

13 And Cain said unto the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.

14 Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth. And it shall come to pass that every one who findeth me shall slay me.”

15 And the Lord said unto him, “Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.” And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

16 And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod to the east of Eden.

17 And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.

18 And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.

19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

20 And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and of those who have cattle.

21 And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who handle the harp and organ.

22 And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

23 And Lamech said unto his wives, “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech! For I have slain a man for my wounding, and a young man for my hurt.

24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.”

25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son and called his name Seth. “For God,” said she, “hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.”

26 And to Seth also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord."
"Genesis 3 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, “Yea, hath God said, ‘Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden’?”

2 And the woman said unto the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,

3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, ‘Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,lest ye die.’”

4 And the serpent said unto the woman, “Ye shall not surely die;

5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”

6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and ate, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he ate.

7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves things to gird about.

8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God, walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

9 And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, “Where art thou?”

10 And he said, “I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.”

11 And He said, “Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?”

12 And the man said, “The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”

13 And the Lord God said unto the woman, “What is this that thou hast done?” And the woman said, “The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.”

14 And the Lord God said unto the serpent, “Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.

15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her Seed; It shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise His heel.”

16 Unto the woman He said, “I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.”

17 And unto Adam He said, “Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, ‘Thou shalt not eat of it,’ cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.

18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.

19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”

20 And Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.

21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

22 And the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become as one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live for ever”—

23 therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken.

24 So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."

"Genesis 2 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

2 And on the seventh day Lord God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.

3 And Lord God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He had rested from all His work which God created and made.

4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens,

5 and before every plant of the field was in the earth, and before every herb of the field grew; for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.

7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

8 And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.

9 And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was parted and became four heads.

11 The name of the first is Pishon; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.

12 And the gold of that land is good, and there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

13 And the name of the second river is Gihon; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.

14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

15 And the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat;

17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.”

18 And the Lord God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper meet for him.”

19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.

20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper meet for him.

21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.

22 And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman and brought her unto the man.

23 And Adam said, “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.”

24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.

25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
"Genesis 1 In the beginning Lord God created the heaven and the earth.

2 And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

3 And Lord God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.

4 And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.

5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

6 And God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.”

7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.

8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

9 And God said, “Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.

10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called He Seas; and God saw that it was good.

11 And God said, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth”; and it was so.

12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind; and God saw that it was good.

13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons, and for days and years;

15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth”; and it was so.

16 And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He made the stars also.

17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,

18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

20 And God said, “Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.”

21 And God created great whales and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and God saw that it was good.

22 And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply on the earth.”

23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

24 And God said, “Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind: cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind”; and it was so.

25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind; and God saw that it was good.

26 And God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.”

27 So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.

28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”

29 And God said, “Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat”; and it was so.

31 And God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."

"Saint John 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Lord God, the King and the Word was Lord God, the King.

2 The same was in the beginning with Lord God, the King.

3 All things were made by him: and without him was made nothing that was made.

4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.

5 And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.

6 There was a man sent from Lord God, the King whose name was John.

7 This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men might believe through him.

8 He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light.

9 That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world.

10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

11 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

12 But as many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons of Lord God, the King to them that believe in his name.

13 Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of Lord God, the King.

14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Lord God, the King the Father, full of holy grace and truth.

15 John beareth witness of him, and crieth out, saying: This was he of whom I spoke: He that shall come after me, is preferred before me: because he was before me.

16 And of his fulness we all have received, and holy grace for holy grace.

17 For the law was given by Moses; holy grace and truth came by Lord God, the King God Jesus Christ.

18 No man hath seen Lord God, the King at any time: the only begotten Holy Son who is in the bosom of the Lord God, the King the Father, he hath declared him.

19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him, to ask him: Who art thou?

20 And he confessed, and did not deny: and he confessed: I am not the Christ.

21 And they asked him: What then? Art thou Elias? And he said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered: No.

22 They said therefore unto him: Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of thyself?

23 He said: I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord God, as said the prophet Isaias.

24 And they that were sent, were of the Pharisees.

25 And they asked him, and said to him: Why then dost thou baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor holy prophet Elias, nor the prophet?

26 John answered them, saying: I baptize with water; but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know not.

27 The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose.

28 These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

29 The next day, John saw Lord God, the King Jesus Christ coming to him, and he saith: Behold the Lamb of Lord God, the King behold him who taketh away the sin of the world.

30 This is he, of whom I said: After me there cometh a man, who is preferred before me: because he was before me.

31 And I knew him not, but that he may be made manifest in Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

32 And John gave testimony, saying: I saw the Lord God Holy Spirit coming down, as a dove from heaven, and he remained upon him.

33 And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptize with water, said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Lord God, the King Spirit descending, and remaining upon him, he it is that baptizeth with the Lord God Holy Ghost.

34 And I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the Son of Lord God, the King.

35 The next day again John stood, and two of his disciples.

36 And beholding Lord God, the King Jesus Christ walking, he saith: Behold the Lamb of Lord God, the King.

37 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Lord God, the King Jesus Christ.

38 And Lord God, the King Jesus Christ turning, and seeing them following him, saith to them: What seek you? Who said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?

39 He saith to them: Come and see. They came, and saw where he abode, and they stayed with him that day: now it was about the tenth hour.

40 And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who had heard of John, and followed him.

41 He findeth first his brother Simon, and saith to him: We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Jesus Christ.

42 And he brought him to Lord God the King Jesus Christ. And Lord God, the King Jesus Christ looking upon him, said: Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter.

43 On the following day, he would go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip. And Lord God, the King Jesus Christ saith to him: Follow me.

44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

45 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him: We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Lord, the King Jesus Christ the son of St. Joseph of Nazareth.

46 And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing of good come from Nazareth? Philip saith to him: Come and see.

47 Lord God, the King Jesus Christ saw Nathanael coming to him: and he saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.

48 Nathanael saith to him: Whence knowest thou me? Lord God, the King Jesus Christ answered, and said to him: Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

49 Nathanael answered him, and said: Rabbi, thou art the Son of Lord God, thou art the King of Israel.

50 Lord God, the King Jesus Christ answered, and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see.

51 And he saith to him: Amen, amen I say to you, you shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of Lord God, the Holy King ascending and descending upon the Holy Son of man.

Holy Honor and Glory to Lord God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will.
We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you,
We give you thanks for your great glory. Lord God, heavenly King.
O God, Almighty Father. Lord God Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son,
Lord God, Lamb of Lord God, Son of the Lord God, the Father,
you take away the sins of the world,
have mercy on us;
you take away the sins of the world,
receive our prayer;
you are seated at the right hand of the Lord God, the Father,
have mercy on us.
For you alone are the Holy One,
you alone are the Lord God,
you alone are the Most High, Lord God Jesus Christ,
with the Lord God, the Holy Spirit,
in the glory of Lord God the Father. Amen."

"Exodus 20 And the Blessed Lord God, the Holy Great King spoke all these words:

2 I am the Holy Lord God thy Holy Lord God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

3 Thou shalt not have strange gods before me.

4 Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth.

5 Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the Holy Lord God, the Great King thy Holy Lord God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me:

6 And showing Holy mercy unto thousands to them that Holy Love me, and keep my commandments.

7 Thou shalt not take the name of the Holy Lord God thy Holy Lord God in vain: for the Holy Lord God, the Great Holy King will not hold him guiltless that shall take the name of the Holy Lord God, the Great King his Holy God in vain.

8 Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day.

9 Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works.

10 But on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Holy Lord God, the Great King thy Holy God: thou shalt do no work on it, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.

11 For in six days the Holy Lord God, the Great Holy King made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the seventh day: therefore the Holy Lord God, the Great Holy King blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.

12 Honour thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest be longlived upon the land that the True Holy Lord God thy Holy God will give thee.

13 Thou shalt not murder.

14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

15 Thou shalt not steal.

16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house: neither shalt thou desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his handmaid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.

18 And all the people saw the voices and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking: and being terrified and struck with fear, they stood afar off,

19 Saying to Moses: Speak thou to us, and we will hear: let not the Holy Lord God, the Holy King speak to us, lest we die.

20 And Moses said to the people: Fear not: for Holy Lord God, the Holy Great King is come to prove you, and that the dread of him might be in you, and you should not sin.

21 And the people stood afar off. But Moses went to the dark cloud wherein Holy Lord God, the Holy King was.

22 And the Holy Lord God, the Great Holy King said to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven.

23 You shall not make gods of silver, nor shall you make to yourselves gods of gold.

24 You shall make an altar of earth unto me, and you shall offer upon it your holocausts and peace offerings, your sheep and oxen, in every place where the memory of my name shall be: I will come to thee, and will bless thee.

25 And if thou make an altar of stone unto me, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones: for if thou lift up a tool upon it, it shall be defiled.

26 Thou shalt not go up by steps unto my altar, lest thy nakedness be discovered.

Word of the Blessed Holy Lord God, the Great King.  Thank You Blessed Holy Lord God, the King and Savior Jesus Christ.

All you great numerous enemies; the enemy of the holy death of my Holy Lord God, the King and Master Jesus Christ on the Cross of Calvary; the prince of darkness and iniquity, the father of all liars; I stand on the death of my Holy Lord God, the King and Master Jesus Christ and offer His pains, wounds, and the Precious Blood of His left hand to the Eternal Father Holy Lord God, the Holy King for your downfall, your destruction and your scourging. Amen. Precious Blood of my Holy Lord God, the King and Master Jesus Christ - reign in me and in the lives of all men. Amen.

O holy loving Father, Holy Lord God, the King of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Who protected the Israelites of old in His holy wings in the dryness of the cold and hot desert; I offer You the holy death of my Holy Master and Savior, Jesus Christ, for the protection of Your people who are scattered all over the world. May the Holy Blood and water wash and strengthen, save and cleanse us that we might find home in the Sacred Side of Your Holy Son that opens for all men. Amen. Sacred Side of Holy Lord God, the King Jesus Christ - be our home for safety. Amen.

Omnipotent and Omniscient Holy Lord God, the King, Holy Lord God, the King of Holy Elijah and the prophets, look at the Sacred Head of Your only-begotten Holy Son and have mercy. Arise and save Your people. I offer You all the shame, the pains, the wounds and the Precious Blood from the Sacred Head of Your Holy Son for all Your children who are living in these perilous times. Strengthen our true faith through the mockery of Your Holy Son, Holy Lord Jesus Christ, and save us through the Precious Blood from His Sacred Head. May we, through the sufferings of Your Holy Son, Jesus Christ, learn to suffer in You and die in You. Amen. Holy tortures of Holy Lord God, the King Jesus Christ - increase our true faith. Amen.

Merciful and holy loving Father Lord God, the Holy King, Your wish is that all men shall be saved. Kindly look on Your rejected and condemned Holy Son Who suffered many tortures and will suffer many through the sins of Your people. Look and see what sin has done to your only-begotten Holy Son. I offer for all Your people who are living in these ungodly and wicked days, all the tortures, pains, rejection and shame of your Holy Son, Lord God, the King Jesus Christ, to You, for the true faith to withstand trials and holy patience to withstand long torture. May they through the suffering of Your only Holy Son, fight to the end. Amen. Our Holy Lord God, the King's torture - increase our true faith. Precious Blood of Holy Lord God, the King Jesus Christ - save us. Amen.

Holy, holy, holy, Holy Lord God of hosts, the earth is full of thy glory! Glory be to the Holy Lord God, the Father, Glory be to the Holy Lord God, the Son, Glory be to the Holy Lord God, the Holy Ghost.

HAIL Holy Mary, full of grace, the Holy Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Holy Lord Jesus Christ. Holy Mary, Mother of Holy Lord God, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of our death. Amen.

Deo Gratias.

"People often ask, If you like spin‐off products, why not just
invest in those technologies straightaway, instead of
waiting for them to happen as spin‐offs? The answer: it just
doesn't work that way. Let's say you’re a thermodynamicist,
the world's expert on heat, and I ask you to build me a
better oven. You might invent a convection oven, or an oven
that’s more insulated or that permits easier access to its
contents. But no matter how much money I give you, you
will not invent a microwave oven. Because that came from
another place. It came from investments in
communications, in radar. The microwave oven is traceable
to the war effort, not to a thermodynamicist"
F... this let the virgin island alone
Wow
"And yet currently, the Davos stooges known as the Prime Minister of Canada and the Dutch Prime Minister are following social engineering instructions to unilaterally cut nitrogen fertilizers available to farmers trying to grow food desperately needed because of the grain export disruptions from the Ukraine war. 

But instead they are investing tax dollars in growing insects for food. 

The anti-Habers only want to create scarcity, starvation, disease and dependency. 

And these slavery pimps have the gall to describe themselves as ‘liberal’ and ‘democratic’. 

The demonic delusion and gaslighting is officially off the charts."
Thank you for knowledge 😊 sir
"Unheard story !! thanks man for this info. Love your content , As an chemistry student this video motivates me to discover more about this subject . Hope to get some more unheard story..."
"Research at Degesch of Germany led to the development of Zyklon (later known as Zyklon A), a pesticide that released hydrogen cyanide upon exposure to water and heat. It was banned after World War I, when Germany used a similar product as a chemical weapon
Zyklon B was used in Gas Chambers"
Sleeping pills is an interesting alibi 🤔😐
Awesome video. My wife was just reading about Haber's process to teach to her O level students and one day later we saw this video. Quite interesting
Who thought having 3 whole bonds was a good idea?
The answer to your question ... is give everyone a gun.
"great video other than the end. Climate crisis is a acam, always has been. wasn't new york city supposed to be under water 30 years ago??? lol"
"Once upon a time, I was an IT contractor at Los Alamos National Labs. At lunch I would go to the Otowi building which housed the Lab’s lunchroom. There I found a lot of the “old timers” (those who helped in the creation of the atomic bomb). I spent many a lunch hour conversing with the old guys and heard many stories about their work. They were very forthcoming and I probably heard tales that were unknown outside the confines of the facility. One day my curiosity got the better of me and I asked one of them if he ever had any moral qualms about what he did, seeing as his work made him directly involved with the death of so many people. He replied directly, without hesitation, without a flinch or tinge of emotion “no, if I hadn’t done it some one else would have.”"
"​@HBitron yes but the blood split may have been that of his own countrymen. Germany and the USSR were also developing atomic weapons. It's just the US got there first. Sometimes it's kill or be killed, and I think that scientist recognized that"
"However, the blood spilt is on his hands, instead of that someone else's"
True...same for the genius behind AK47.

Last message in the video is philosophical. 
The loosing side scientist is projected as bad. 
While winning side scientists are glorrified (Inventors of Nuclear Bomb)

That is world."
i see a movie here
"For those who don’t want to watch the whole video: “he developed a method for producing ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, which could be used to manufacture artificial fertilizer.”

What he did wrong to discover this: Although he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the synthesis of ammonia, Haber was controversial for his role in developing Germany's poison-gas program during World War I.”"
"@Capricorn charger watch the video, it explains everything."
@Capricorn charger hahah but it didn't
"But watch the video instead, you won't regret it it might be one of the best episodes"
@Capricorn charger what? i dont understand
he not doing anything wrong... he just wanna help his country... yea maybe got some money from that.... but that what make us human.
"""Guano: mined as a source of nitrate, producing 84% of the world's supply of fertilizer, a 1.4 billion dollar industry."" THAT's what this war is all about! You can't legally take possession of the caves as long as the Wachatis inhabit the area, and you want that dookie so bad, you can taste it!!"
The Haber-Bosch process has produced literally nothing besides a century of human-centered ecological disasters for the entire planet
"19:33 ""It would be easy to paint Haber as a villain... or as a hero for inventing the process used to feed half of the world but another approach is to regard him as irrelevant (...) because someone else would have figured out a process Nitrogen out of the air"".
Under that premise then every single statue should be thrown down and every single name (good or evil) in history books should be erased and be considered ""irrelevant"" since ""someone else"" would have done it. 
What Haber did during WWI was probably not better or worse than what his chemist colleges were doing for the allies. Yet, his invention to process Nitrogen was unique an unparalleled at the moment."
"Exactly... true
Just becoz it would have been done in any case, in no way reduces importance or seminality of work"
"Can you be a pacifist and still be a patriot? Is it right to disparagingly refer to “pacifist Einstein” 11:37 for not wanting to help his country? In hindsight, not fighting WWI would have helped Germany tremendously"

Great stuff!!nice work!!
Thank you! I learn something new everyday from YouTube and it’s awesome content makers such as Veritasium!
This man deserves his Nobel Prize for the Haber Process but it was his choice to get involved in creating weapons of war. You can praise a man for one action in one breath and condemn him with the next.
"@TT's beauteous hair . CanadaJapan did the us know that for sure? And if so, they were also developed for use against the soviets"
@Sepp that's bs. Halfway through the war it was apparent that germany was losing and never gonna be able to make nukes. The german nuclear research's budget was 1/10 that of the mangattan project and the manhattan project didn't even finish until 3 months after germany's surrender.
"@Sepp Something Hauber would probably say. Oh, he did: 14:45"
"@Crow Eater American Empire? What are you talking about we don't have an empire, just a near monopoly on selling weapons internationally and a vested interest in keeping it that way.

This points out the fertilizer shortage as even more of an issue….
"Bro. Screw off with the carbon emissions BS... CARBON IS INERT & you're a carbon based life form. A carbon tax is a war on life itself!!! This nation was founded because the men with backbone who created this great nation realized that tax is theft and therefore they found it to be high treason to accept a 3% tax on tea and paper, the boston tea party was the result. you should know this..."
That is why farmers use cow dung manure for the nitrogen fixation
No amount of information related to mind is really enough. I sincerely request you to do some show on - Is a scientific brain just a lottery own by 1 in millions or just a rarest of  brain/mind/personality tweak that happens during the life time of a person that makes them who they became or just aliens are peaking some random people to send inventions to earth ?
The magnets on the balls are backwards. If they were facing the proper way they would fit more stronger. Lol
"I've often seen the argument that we are stuck with using fossil fuels for making nitrogen fertilizers, but that is not the case. Hydrogen in industrial processes is usually made by natural-gas reforming: CH4 + H2O -> CO + 3H2. But with renewable energy, one can make hydrogen by electrolyzing water. By adding nitrogen where the hydrogen emerges, one can make ammonia directly."
oh the irony
"You have made a great video,  both for the chemistry and the history.   I am not a Jew, but one cannot be deeply moved by a visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau.  To the extent that Mr. Haber had anything to do with Zyklon B, and assuming that there is some cosmic justice after death, Mr. Haber has a very high price to pay."
"cannot fail to be moved,."
Please do video on carbon footprint and how it came from BP.
I hit Like button for the closing speech.
The president can only order the Marine Corps to action by executive order.. any movement by the army has to be approved by congress.  Special forces is a work around.  But don't ever call Marines soldiers...
"Here's something fun. Nitrogen-fixing organisms do the same reaction as the Haber-Bosch process -- N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3 -- though without the heat and pressure, with hydrogen as electrons in carrier cofactor molecules and hydrogen ions from the surrounding water, and with a different catalyst, an enzyme called nitrogenase, named after what it works on."
"lupins do the same the fix nitrogen out of the air into soil, if one would grow plants with the permaculture method fertilizers wouldn´t be neccecary, the only downside to it you can´t use big agricultural machines to harvest them"
"It still creates greenhouse gases as far as I'm aware, its definitely more efficient but with just a single microorganism it would mess up the biodiversity as well; pretty sure with a diverse range of MOs it would work"
👍👍👍👍
How do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process? You don't. It is nature itself.
"Now I know why there are so many Asians, thanks Haber 🧐"
"Tldr, end justify means. Get lost already with your degenerate propaganda. Evil is evil, lesser or greater."
It's crazy they put the real formulas for bombs in the video lol. Stoichiometry

As far as i can tell hes still in the black no?
"Boy those Germans liked to gas people 😢
I don’t blame them for being upset.

I’ve been saying for years people are born from nothing but we’re made of matter and when we die we go to the earth to create more mass so therefore every creature on this planet extend the landmass more just my thought
This feels like some WEF propagand  to get us ready for their plans so that we will eat the bugs and own nothing I mean look at what's happening and Sri Lanka and Denmark and Canada their governments are cutting down on fertilizer so that our WEF Masters can starve us and they can use videos like this as justification for what they do. Don't worry the ends justify the means vile
Amazing yet scary 😕
this is retarded propaganda.  although if we killed about 15 -30 million ppl we would actualy have peace

"And it would be useful, if not crucial, to remember he's also JUST a man. A smart one (genius one could say), but still fallible as is our nature. 

One minute you're a blood Jew making an ammonia gas for one regime, the next you're a useful enemy in the heart of the hatered; he's just lucky he died when he did to be super honest. 
As a Jewish man by blood, in the said time period? He was LITERALLY days to months away from being shipped to a camp, regardless of his loyalties and contributions (or, most importantly, really, for the purpose of understanding a human, is what was in his heart when he did what he did that helped make that beyond nightmare that was the Holocaust, a reality in the precise way it was)
I'm a Jew, who's not directly or entirely practicing ATTT ALL; I'm closest to being a Taoist, after learning about their spiritual practice (hard to even call it a religion; a ""faith"" works though), in actuality..... But they're still my ""tribe"". We're a people and we share that innate ancient ancestral Bond.

Life's crazy, almost (if not literally) anything is possible TECHNICALLY speaking and we just gotta try and keep our minds open to that and approach everything analytically instead of emotionally (you can do the latter, later, just don't let it influence your logical mind).... Do our best at every turn, and hope we're doing the right thing (if such a thing even exists ahaha)"
Nice improvisation
"only one fault, their were no ""allied"" soldiers in the first world war (the ""allies"" were the second world war)."
"If you had done more than the bare minimum of research you would know ZyklonB is a pesticide and not suitable for gassing people. you would also know that by then the Nazis had nerve gas but honed the treaty not to use gas in warfare. 
You would also know that carbon is the building block of life on this planet and the current level in the atmosphere are 400 parts per million or 0.04% or 1/4th of 1/10th of 1% far lower than the mean average since life began. That you don't know any of that tells me everything I need to know about you."
"Question is, why is our government so gung-ho about reducing Nitrogen emissions if this is the way we fertilize the soil and feed the world? Is WEF so focused on reducing emissions to fight global warming that they are willing to lose millions of people to hunger? If nitrogen is the essential component of the air we breath, why are we so afraid of it? Why are we telling our farmers to reduce their fertilizer use by 30%? How can we stop this crazy manufacturing of food scarcity on our planet? At the time when inflation, war, logistics/delivery problems and slow economy due to Covid lockdowns are already affecting food availability and prices everywhere. One must ask if our leaders bother consulting scientists on any of these issues? All this seems very intentional and calculated. To what end?"
ohhh zyklon b
Ammonium nitrate isn't explosive on its own. It's an oxidizer.
The answer to your question is to be weary of companies/people using their research and ideas in sadistic and villainous ways.  If you are motivated by love and implement your ideas with good intentions you are pretty much guaranteed to have a positive effect on humanity.

"Chemistry is now well understood. Dichlorofluoromethane was  a refrigerant in the 80's to replace ammonia. Now banned due to suspected of ozone UV protection  atmosphere depletion. The refrigerant if heated would produce Phosgene(mustard gas), a colorless gas that was used in the first world war. That would instantaneously cause the lungs to  what i can only describe as not be able to be able to breath in or out. I know this as  a refrigeration engineer  repairing leaks using a blow torch back in the day.Not surprising it did not take much thought  to convert this to a weapon of war. Similarly ammonia nitrate (fertilizer ) , mixed with sugar and Diesel has been used in less than military funded explosives for quite some time. As  said chemicals are well understood. Biological thankfully is kept away from the less funded we hope. We also must consider the amount of deaths caused by adding lead to petrol. I believe( hard to prove ) it's in the millions to date."

An interesting way to characterize the situation.  There're several intriguing examples of how one represents moral responsibility .. or it's absence.

"I find it quite suspicious that Haber's wife would shoot herself specifically in the chest. Usually when people kill themselves with a gun, they shoot at the head to ensure a swift death."
There is no scientific backing to your claim that the increase in World population is in any way correlated to the discovery of Ammonia. There are many factors that led to the boom.

It takes time to learn from our mistakes and in many cases, it will take many mistakes to learn. Let's just hope our humanity does not lag too far behind our technology that we end up killing ourselves in the process of learning to become more humane."
It should be a universal law to work only on positive any neg should go to the death sentence for the scientist.  And u r a climate change carbon print fool.
I get it. The osmium was a catalyst. It went back to its normal state but helped break apart the nitrogen and ammonium bonds.
"I thought this video was amazing! I love the duality you brought up at the end. I want to point out that there are other ways to add nitrogen back into soil including efficient composting (ie making closed loops of nutrient usage- all the nutrients exported from a farm as food return as compost and humanure (I know it sounds gross, but I think it is important). One can also use nitrogen fixing plants such as legumes and clover. I think this specific process of creating ammonium sounds environmentally sound, but I’m concerned about using too much fertilizer."
"Going to war over poop, I love it!!! Only humans"

"Hang on, I thought nitrogen was bad. The Dutch farmer crisis is all about the reduction of nitrogen (stikstof in Dutch)."
"I find it strange that nowhere in this video is it mentioned that the Haber process relies on natural gas, and that the inevitable worldwide decline in natural gas production, coupled with the decline in oil production, will likely cause the death by starvation of billions of people in the coming decades."

...How do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the planet without destroying ourselves in the process? ... How about not volunteering in efforts that promote war?
"Science is neither good nor bad. It is just a process that helps us discover how things work around us. It cannot determine good and evil or how it will be used. Only the people who possess this knowledge decide what to do with it.
This is where science and philosophy intersect. This is why secularism, materialism, and modrenism are wrong and flawed, because they do not provide the moral reference or conduct that prevents people from using knowledge in the wrong way. A moral frame and reference is required to control people's actions and prevent these things from happening."

Very educating video. 😲🙂
It looks like you need some sleep!
I think what Derek is trying to say with this video is soon his modeling kits are going to be used to kill millions.
We would have to ask the scientists from other countries not to develop weapons and that is obviously silly so best that we let our own scientists research everything.
"He was not a villain, but use of his invention was evil. Really a very sad story."
"It could have turned out better for Haber had history taken a different path.

The scientists who developed the atom bomb used the same arguments for it.  We can end the war and save millions of lives.  The other justification was the same one they used.  The  other side is going to develop them first.

They (mostly) turned out to be right, though Germany never had a serious A-Bomb effort like we did (something we didn't know of course).  Today nobody begrudges Fermi for producing the first sustained chain reaction in Chicago that directly lead to the atom bomb.  That's sort of a passing footnote in an otherwise brilliant career that produced enormous discoveries.  These people are enormous heroes, despite the legacy of the atom bomb still haunting us today.

Chemical weapons though?  We banned them.  They're not really used anymore  They're horrible weapons (and were never even a great weapon of war), but is their really a ""good"" weapon?  We still live with nuclear weapons however.

Given that context, Haber wasn't so bad, especially since, as you say, chemical weapons were just a natural result of a war that happened during a time of rapid scientific advances."
"That’s heavy, man.
Really great video!
Thanks 🍷"
"Every new discovery meant for good, someone will find a way to make it evil. That is human nature. Atomics, drones, guns, archery, chemical research, proposed vaccines, not targeting covid, robotics... Please do a video on Alexander Shulgin and his work. He created incredible chemistry accomplishments and less savory things."
"Most people's reaction to chemical warfare: (shock and horror)

Fritz Haber: ""You call that a weapon? Hold my beer."""
cant have nitrogen..in denmark or canada..just cant have it
"They're worried about not enough food and wanted to expand the population.. now the world's Elites creep around behind the scenes doing everything they can to diminish the population and are right now in the process of cutting down our food supply right as we are headed into a famine because the same people shut down the entire world for months on end! Paying Farmers to till their crops under, kill their livestock and dispose of it, pour out millions of gallons of milk on the floor! Now they will not allow Farmers to farm they will not allow them to use fertilizer and are taking their land from them!"
"These things happens when we don't even know much about ourselves (human) and go on about trying to understand about  modern technologies, that's already wrong ."
"humans today have become more careful than they were 100 years ago. Before we sent people into space not knowing if they would survive. Today we would not do that. Everything must have safety measures and by all means it is good so don't get me wrong! But all these safety measures is also slowing down progress in science and technology research. But maybe soon with the humanity at stake , with global warming, wars, etc, we will see another research boom."
What makes me sad is that a certain policitian wants to BAN fertilizers from his country

So.. realistically he didn’t SAVE any lives.  He inadvertently caused life by being unwilling to lose a bet with another scientist — over a problem that was already over 100 years old.

"We may not know the reasons for Clara Haber's suicide, but I do believe it is telling of their relationship and Fritz' emotional stability that Fritz was on a train to continue his development of some of the world's most horrific chemical agents, the very next morning. Either he used his work to escape his emotions, seeing a weapons test hundreds of kilometers away as the perfect excuse to avoid facing his part in the death of his wife; or the nature of his exploits had dulled his sense of empathy to the point he could no longer bring himself to care."
He just serve his country. Nurdy amaricans can't understand that.
"@Artur Schmitt how can you say all weapons are wrong?  Weapons are tools.   Inanimate objects cannot be right or wrong.  Their use or the intent behind their development can be right or wrong but not the tool itself.

Smashing someone's skull in with a hammer does not make hammers bad.

A woman using a pistol to defend her children from a murderer does not make pistols good.

Hammers and pistols are nothing more than useful tools.  Only their use is good or bad."
"He is a villain for helping kill people. I understand that from his perspective he was just being patriotic. But from our point of view, they were our enemies. You can't really blame him for the problems associated with overpopulation as he would have had no possible way of knowing. Also, he is just one man and it's like you said, someone else would have come up with the process."
"Lol if he was British or American you would celebrate him, but because he's German he's suddenly bad."
Then he is not a villain.

"For reference with the Nitrogen in farming stuff... this is the exact same fertiliser the Sri Lankan, and now Netherlands, governments have severely limited use of by farmers.

Take a look at the growth comparison, and the yield curves on it. This is why farmers are protesting in The Netherlands.

"Ammonium Nitrate is a wonderful explosive.  It's inexpensive, safe (relative to other explosives), easy to handle, and powerful.  It's used every day as a commercial explosive in mining and controlled demolition.  

Any jackass can misuse or weaponize something with only a little desire and knowledge.  (I once turned a clothespin into an artillery piece and accidentally disrupted a presentation with it.) Haber did what he thought was best for his nation (and his wallet).  Einstein at least partially started the atomic bomb project.  Both can be celebrated for the good they did, both can be condemned for the harm that came from it.  Scientists in my experience are generally pretty narrow minded and work to create, the use of their creation comes later.  Jeff Goldblum has an excellent line in Jurassic Park about it, you know the one."

Very well made video and interesting debate about the morals of what scientists develop...

Of course they haven enabled us to get to the point we are now but we must start to move away and replenish the soil health!

"Interesting that he rationalized the use of chlorine gas by stating that it would end the war quicker, thus saving more lives in the long run. . . Which again would become the rationale behind dropping the atomic bombs on Japan in World War 2.

People always talk about technology making our lives better, but I think it's more accurate to say that it's simply made our lives easier. . .  Easier isn't always better. With every technology-driven societal shift, there will be some negative consequence. There are very few mass produced products that despite their usefulness, don't come with serious consequences."
He didn't do as much bad as the one who developed the atomic bomb.

"There is a really good movie about Clara Immerwahr (the wife of Haber). Its in german but maybe there is an englisch version. Its just called ""Clara Immerwahr"""
"Yahshua - you know Him as Jesus - was born to a virgin, turned water to wine, taught, healed the sick, raised the dead, casted out demons, walked on water, calmed the storm, and fed a crowd of thousands with a few fish and a few loaves of bread, among many other things. He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!

if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9

Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13

Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:
Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name. See James Chapter 5:14-15........"

We know today, with the discoveries of the science that this agricultural model is participating to Co2 emissions, freeing all the carbon that was trapped there, and that this model is also harmful in a social way, making some farmers billionaires, with gigantic lands, and many lost their jobs, selling their lands to the bigger farmers. 
I see it as a discovery that allowed the occidental societies to build the way they have done, and we know today that this road may be dangerous, with global warming and all the consequences we know.

"I’m not sure we necessarily want to trap carbon for thousands of years. While it sounds good in theory, that will ultimately reduce the carbon availability in multiple environments. All life needs carbon, and so does a large portion of products we use and consume. That’s why planting trees and creating biomass storage is much more suitable than locking ourselves out of a resource for thousands of years."
Amazing story.
"There is an answer! If mankind can put its trust in God, science will serve its best interests.

Wars, and all other wickedness done by man are fueled by our selfish desires. The desires for survival, influence, satisfaction etc. are what make science as threatening as it is hopeful. 

Jesus taught that we should love our enemies and bless those who hate us. Unfortunately, “Christians” throughout history have failed to obey this command and have even drawn out unnecessary wars in his name, but this is the fault of our disobedience and pride. If we turn back to Jesus, who is the image of God, we will no longer use our knowledge for selfish gain or the abuse of others. He will change our hearts.

This truth is what removed slavery from the western world, amongst many other small victories that seem insignificant against the looming backdrop of all man’s evils. They are very significant and telling is what I’m trying to say."
Brilliant except for the esg crap at the end.

Well now that you took a Wren sponsorship you should probably do a video on the difference between personal carbon footprint and industrial carbon footprint and how the propaganda around it shifts attention away from industry.
"I am an enthusiastic chemist, a German (not so enthusiastic) and a pacifist. Fritz Haber is a tragic figure of science and history. And, I do not hesitate to say this: a war criminal."
This is a beautiful example of balance
"Hi Derek, about your last question: war is the inevitable result of POLITICS, that is, the division of people in their own interest to live by themselves with their PROPERTY. Both concepts I put in caps are not transcendental to life, I believe they arose since the Neolithic era, when people found out how to grow food, excess food came to be, property became a thing, then you needed protection of that property, in short, the division of humanity became perpetuated, perpetuating war. I am vey convinced that so many bad things that happen today are preventable but happen as a result of the nature of the socioeconomic system and the sort of values that it imposes to exist, such as consumption, competition, self preservation over collaboration, etc."
"Habers story really touches me. He was, all things considered, a good man. He was smart, invented stuff that changed the world enormously. He had a wife with a phd, so we can assume he was a good bloke and not a misogynistic asshat, like you'd expect a man to be in that time. Also he resigned and fled the nazis eventhough he wouldn't have had to after being a patriotic dude that tried to do his part to help his community and country. Thats all so respectable. He should be a hero. And yet... he's not. It tragically beautiful."
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain...

ah finally a veritasium video I understand
The solution to the final question in the video is the same to the climate crisis: socialism. The elimination of the profit motive is key to ending war and organizing the global economy in such a way to avert accelerating climate catastrophe.
"Would’a  should’a could’a, he did it and deserves the credit for the good he did and the theory someone else would have made the fertilizer is irrelevant because we don’t issue patents or give credit based on what might happen. He also deserves the flip side of that coin. The fact of the matter is that good and evil can reside in a person and the environment they are exposed to makes them what they are. I’m sure we are making some real creeps now with the shape our society is in…….the news says we are. We deserve what we teach."
So maybe someone else will invent what I refuse to invent on moral grounds… at least it won’t be my conscience burning in hell for it!
"If anyone wants more info I highly recommend the book ""The Alchemy of Air"" by Thomas Hager, turning air into bread is truly a fascinating story"
"I mean, maybe it was actually Clara, the first female Ph.D. in chemistry, to actually discover the Haber-Bosch-Verfahren. Then your patriotic husband turns it into TNT and chemical warfare, what a dissatisfaction that mustve been :D
Sadly I wouldn't know of anything really pointing in that direction :/"
17.20 this is a MEMENTO for all young men... NEVER date or marry such a woman
@Kris G she killed her self out of missed opportunities blaming her husband for that?
and what did she do to deserve your weird opinion?
"Another problem is that different people have different opinions on what ""good for humanity"" means.  Haber clearly thought that developing chlorine gas as a weapon was good for humanity as you can tell by his statement about it."
"War is war. You include the moment with his wife to make people side but it merely demonstrates the vainglory of women. Imagine being a mother and killing yourself knowing your child would hear, despicable."

"Bird Poop ? No.

"This was brilliant, thoughtful and insightful. Thank You 🙏💖✨🙏"
"Video is very good but I think some things are framed misleadingly, like the video framing the exponential growth of the human population having this invention as only cause. Also, I don’t think you can say that ‘saving someone’s life’ is the same as what this scientist did, which is facilitate an environment in which more people could be born. When someone has sex unsafely they facilitate a an environment in which a baby can be borne, having unsafe sex then ‘saving a life’ compared to using a condom?"
I know that everyone shuns the guy for making chemical weapons. But something to think of is that if chemical weapons were never put to use on ww1. There's a high likelihood that they could have never been officially banned. And that they could have been used in a war that would have taken twice as many lives
Haber's wife was better chemist? Clara was one...
This video is incredibly well made. I found myself fully immersed into Haber’s story and I didn’t even notice 20 minutes had gone by.
"I read this comment, watched the video, then was shocked to re-read the comment and find it was 20 mins."
Yeah for sure
For real it’s a good and interesting video

The 20th century was absolutely horrifying. Humans have always killed each other.. But never with such ease and with gruesome methods at the scales seen during this period.
the last question. well the answer is morality. haber obviously was a villain. he did things selfishly for himself
We don't owe our lives to any human. Please stop with this cringe atheistic formulations. We are thankful to Allah and then we are thankful for the help of these people.
"I don't see any difference between people who developed chemical weapon and people who developed nuclear weapon. They are not villains, but they are not heroes."
"Einstein refused to use the excuse ""someone else would do it"".
Someone else will always rape and kill. So what? We are still accountable for what we do."
I wish chemistry was taught this interestingly at school

Why?  Pick your poison.  Powerlust.  Greed.  Self-promotion.  Ego.  Subjugation.  Human nature.  Animal nature.  And much, much more.

The one thing that we can do to, at least, tip the balance for good, is, to treat and believe others as more important than one's self.   And, to do so without expecting or demanding anything in return.  And, no, religion has nothing to do with this ageless concept."

"A hammer is both a tool _and_ a weapon.  How we use the tools at our disposal, whether they be hammers or chemistry, is up to us."
"Your example lacks the most important thing - context.
A hammer is a tool or a weapon. Unless you build the hammer whilst in a tribe of hammer weilding killers where hammers are revered as the sacred and only weapon of choice. Only an idiot under this context would play dumb and continue building hammers dispite their being a total climate of hammer killing mania."

"He fought to help his country end the war. Just like americans claim nuking 2 cities was good for mankind because it helped stop the war by making the japanese surrender. The germans tried to do the same, only difference is that it wasn't lethal enough."
"As someone from Chile this story is well known because the country's largest export was the natural thing and with the chemical process the price plummeted, bringing an economical crisis.
Now Chile is over dependant on copper.... But at least it's wetting its feet with lithium. Still, all of these are natural ressources that will eventually dry up.
There needs to be more investment in the sciences for Chile to have a brighter future, imo, but the governments usually don't agree."
Because the government benefits to the resources more than anyone else not you individually innovation is a better track than resources I guess for some reason every time there’s a lot of resources it’s easy to develop a dictatorship I don’t know why don’t ask me it just is look at your Congo of the central republic.

"Even if he developed chlorine gas for use in war, it's not as if it doesn't have other uses.
Everything we produce and create is a tool, and tools can be used for good and for bad. I've yet to learn of a technology or piece of knowledge that can only be used for one and not the other."

"Science empowers humans.  Some humans are bad, so science can enable them to do some bad.  More humans are good, so science can enable them to do more good.  Empowering humans tends to be good unless it is somehow restricted to selecting only bad people for relative empowerment.  The conclusion can only be that science should not be restrained.  On average that will be for the best."

i knew a lot of the facts presented. But this was exceptional well put together.
"so he thought killing opposite's war front soldiers faster with chemical weapons will lead faster end to war? 
that's stupid. 
his wife might just heard that he used chemical weapons greatly to kill people faster. until then she might had him in heart, so she shot at her heart."
"@Douglas Harbert you are defending United States. I'm talking about everyone who started, participated in war in general."
@Expired Visam The United States didn't even enter WWII until after we were attacked first....
@Douglas Harbert did they nulled the reasons that caused the war in first place?
"If the enemy has a weapon so terrible that it can instantly kill every troop that you have, you are more than likely going to surrender and end the war..."
"It worked for the United States when we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The nuclear bombing of those two cities instantly brought an end to the war and saved hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of U.S. soldiers from death by having to invade Japan."
"Biomimicry will save us .Or if we don't do that get ready for the collapse of the biosphere. It's just a game called life/ death and they go together ❤️. Egoic thought causes conflict, wholistic observation brings real solutions  and peace ✌️."
"Well, humans whenever discovered something very powerfull was used either as a weapon or to make a lot of money. Nuclear science is another example. So, we'd better focus on making money from these discoveries instead of war."
I loved haber more at the start but I now I’m reconsidering. Watching this is reminding me of chlorine and nitrogen in chemistry back in high school

As the rest of the world does!

13:11 WHO WRITES THOSE!!! Isn't it 
2 TNT---> 3 N2 + 5 H20 + 6 C02 + 8  C
Sound by the Pyro equations, laws of science (less energetic) and explains 
a LOT OF black soot in the TNT  explosion! (Yeah! TNT is not a Dynamite!)
AND AMONIUM NITRATE (NH4NO3 or AN) has AT LEAST 3 ways MAYOR WAYS of DECOMPOSITION!
ONE IS BY HEATING UNTILL IT DECOMPOSES (Which PRODUCES mainly N2O and H20, 
AND N2O is BOTH Dissociative Anaesthetic (known as Laughing Gas) and OXIDANT!

One is LESS ENERGETIC EXPLOSIVE ONE like the initial one in Beirut has A LOT OF RED SMOKE aka. NOX
(mix of NO,NO2,NO3) and
 ANOTHER, MORE ENERGETIC EXPLOSION like secondary Beirut blast is closer to 
13:02 equation and has POSITIVE BALANCE OF 02 
but require A LOT OF INITIAL ENRGY, FUEL (Fuel Oil=ANFO, Nitromethane=ANNM), CATALYST 
(like Aluminium=AN(x)AL), AND A LOT OF COMPRESSION! 
TRUTH IS, both are WERY HARD TO GET AS EQUATION SAYS and ""normal"" explosion of AN is MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND IN VERSETAIL MIX OF ABOVE CONDITIONS PRODUCING a mix of 02 and NOX (THAT IS EVEN BETTER OXIDIZER THAN ATOMIC OXIGEN!) 
There is even one that will produce significant amount of Cyanide! 
Like the mix of AN and Charcoal powder under low pressure high heat conditions! 

I mean entire video is about this, why cr*p it up with a bad equations!"
Everything has at least a double edge significance. The most likely human can do to use the products of its work and thoughts in a positive way is to guide it under the lense of positive moral rules and ethical conduct by learning from our mistakes and take responsibilities and accountabilities of our actions.

"Just a quick note since you said that Haber was Jewish but didn't practice the religion; The Nazi's weren't persecuting people by their religion they were doing it by their ethnicity. 
People tend to think of the Nazi war crimes against Jewish people as a religious persecution, in reality it was a race thing."

Imagine a President getting the Nobel prize for Peace while dronebombing children. Mayb make a vid about that?
Einstein worked on the atomic bomb. I think most agree that nuclear bombs are a greater threat than chemical weapons today. I don’t say that to disparage Einstein but to put Harber’s destructive contributions into perspective. People in power are good at manipulating the people with actual intelligence.

Fritz Haber was God’s gift to us all. Heil Haber! Lol
It's my first time visiting your channel and I'm in awe of your content. The video captures information in such a subtle manner as to not take sides and deliver every bit of knowledge about how we owe it to the science but at the same time at a huge cost (which is true for the most part provided the history of the world). Brilliant and thanks for sharing!

Science is just the discovery of our existence and war is inevitable at the end of the day a discovery like that does nothing but buy time more food and supplies available lower cost of living? I suppose I'll have more children it's the simple fact of the matter for an animal with no natural predators and there are no two ways about it when the resources become scarce or lines of though diverge as they inevitably do it becomes a matter of authority and violence is the supreme authority by which all authority is derived but you shouldn't only look at violence and war as a bad thing we reduce our numbers sometimes by enough to help make a difference where buildings once lay plants grow back we offset the balance of nature by denying it we live in an environment where we regularly save people who honestly shouldn't go on to highlight a few a kid who hung from a balcony for a period of time before being discovered and rescued who when asked what he was thinking gave the answer that he wanted to see if he could fit through the rail or the guy who fell into an active volcano in Hawaii because he wanted to take a selfie leaning over the edge as far as he could it's harsh but at the end of the day you have to ask yourself if we really should be going out of our way to ensure that these actions have no ultimate consequence

It's the mustache.
what a great video...my brain is in awe.
Atomic bomb is as bad as chemical weapon or probably more. But still world treat physicist and other scientist involved as great. whoever wins the war writes the history.
"How?  Well... doing just what you do for all of us by making such videos and sharing them.  And then we also have this opportunity to share with you and the community watching these videos.  Christine Jones has some really great videos on how bacteria produces enough nitrogen for plants, when we do not till the soil.  This is huge news, and still such new news, that larger farmers (over 100 hectors) still till, plant, and till. And then they till again and plant in the spring.  When we till the soil, it kills a great amount of the functional nitrogen bacteria and fungus.  Thank you for always having such great and supportive videos!  )))"

We talk in absolutes too much “ to defeat a bad guy with a gun u need a good guy with a gun “. No. We r ppl. We try to do the right thing but we can convince ourselves that this “good” thing is bad & vice versa. Not that I believe in regulations (except for guns. Ppl don’t need the guns they have) but we need to stop thinking of things as one or the other- it’s subjective. Anything that’s helpful can be changed into something that is destructive.

"I see him as a villain for loving chemical weapons so much. 

I think someone else would've eventually invented most of what he did, but it's choices that make him evil."
It's surprising how many people commenting on this video really missed what an evil person he was. And the narrator of the video is kind of dumb by absolving evil by saying it would have been invented anyways. Haber specifically worked on improving chemical weapons.
Now I am become death

"A little offtopic but I find that's interesting
""But another approach is to regard him as irrelevant to the larger story, because someone else would've figured out a way to process nitrogen out of the air and other scientists were developing chemical weapons""
So because someone else would have started World War II and the Holocaust, Hitler is totally irrelevant to the larger story. Well, because the world were then and is now full of other antisemitic nationalists trying to do the same.
I can see that it is the group of people that Hitler is associated with which is condemned by the public. So why is there no problem with scientists developing chemical weapons then? Or if there is, why Fritz Haber is irrelevant, if he did that as well?
I'm not disagreed with the statement, but I feel like such excuses for people that actually did something ""good"" in their lives would not have worked on those who did not (but Hitler probably did something good too I think, nobody is pure evil) in the eyes of publicity."

"It is rarely, if ever, the role of a scientist to control or influence how their new discoveries and inventions are used regardless of their initial intentions. Remember that the highest prize in science is named after a man, using your style of measurement, that has killed more people than any discovery before it or since, even nukes have not been as lethal as dynamite as far a total body count. Also note that some of the most acclaimed scientists on the planet brought us nukes also, all manner of deadly gasses and bio-weapons, it was politicians that decided which of these to use or shelve.  Sad that you lost all credibility with your climate nonsense, this is why you should never mix science with politics as many scientists have seen this all too often ends badly for them."

Weirdly worms make nitrogen and there are plenty of plants that fix nitrogen into the soil not strip it. I wondering if spraying habers zyklon removes the needed worms.
"Since a clip of it was included in the video, if anyone in the comments wanted context for what books the nazis were burning (since it's very possible that your history books didn't tell you what it was even if there was a picture of it in there if you were from the US like me), it was medical research on trans people. Keep this in mind as the far-right demonizes LGBT+ people today."
Great Conclusion.
We are out of the climate crisis already! It happened during the 19th century when the little ice age ended. A lot else of this channel and video is unscientifically.
"His story also shows what happens when you buy into militaristic nationalism, especially as a minority. He enthusiastically became part of the German war machine, knowingly inventing methods to kill people on an industrial scale. The irony of his own creations being later used to wholesale murder his own people is very grim."
So the governments are set out now to limit nitrogen and this will be the greatest genocide of history to suit the pockets of capitalism 🤔
"Sounds just like the scientists who made the Manhattan project possible, “Saved more lives by ending the war sooner”  I guess he was only hated because Germany lost."
I'm spellbound right now!!
"Haber process in high school textbooks,for sure gave me a lot of marks...."
Villain 💯. Don’t give monsters a pass. Because someone else might have developed Chen weapons doesn’t mean he didn’t. There is a difference between inventing something that is later “misused” and creating an illegal weapon of mass destruction
Would that make everyone involved in the manhattan project a villain? They did invent the nuke and I guess that also includes Einstein. All villains.
This was a wonderfully informative segment. Although I think he should be regarded as a villain. We now know that this nitrogen used to create more fertility is in fact killing the Earth soil. Also anyone who says that creating more efficient ways of killing will ultimately save lives is twisted and evil. So no matter how you package his story he is Frankenstein.
La BORE a tree
"""are you evil?""
""Yes'nt"""
"A scientist typically goes ""I'll mix this with a little bit of that and see what happens..."", and then down the line, others will take what has been discovered and develope a new more efficient rocket fuel or longer lasting light bulb or something. But that's not what happened here, he discovered a way of enriching soil and developed it himself. And he also developed ways of killing a lot of people with chemical weapons and conventional explosives. For me, a Nobel prize should be for people who are completely virtuous with their work. Feeding half the humans on Earth is certainly virtuous, but that gets cancelled out by his enthusiasm for making chemical weapons. And the way you said that if hadn't of made chemical weapons, someone else would have, the same is true for his soil enrichment discoveries too, if he didn't do it, then somebody else would have. Hager shouldn't have got that prize, and the other scientists were right to shun him for it."

"""How do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?""
I'd like to argue that the very essence of the problem lies at the very heart of the question: control.
A large swath of humans seem to have an unnatural obsession with controlling what we call the ""natural world"" without having any desire to understand what this implies. We *will* keep destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet as long as we do not understand ourselves as part of the natural world.
Science has given us great tools to increase yields and the effectivenes of our weapons but it has yet to respect life - human or otherwise - or even pay close attention to that ""natural world"". For that, you need to turn to other technologies - and by these, I do not mean modern technologies."

"On a side note, not trying to take away the focus off Fritz and his inventions, his first wife Clara’s life was probably one of the tragic - although typical - things happening to some women at that time. She grew up living a modest but wealthy life, privileged enough to be allowed to seek university education and even a PhD. Then, she married and was forced into the role of housewife. She was criticized by a few other well-off housewives for being too nice to the servants, for example, and not being a perfect housewife. The life at home most likely simply did not bring enough mental stimulation for her. She got to hold some lectures about the role of chemistry in households, cooking,… which brought her joy.

"I think of ammonium nitrate as an oxidising agent, rather than an explosive. After the Beirut explosion Australian stockpiles came under scrutiny, but their storage procedure was much better managed and the turnover of product was rapid, whereas the Beirut stockpile had been sitting for years and deteriorating. Wikipedia says that a source of detonation can lead to an explosive decomposition of the ammonium nitrate. Heating it causes it to decompose into nitrous oxide and water."

"The story about the birds is nice, but too far fetched.
The real story about chemistry started with the discovery of sodium nitrate in the Atacama desert, around 1855. There was indeed a salt peter war. Chile could beat Peru and Bolivia. The latter lost his access to the ocean. And Chile won the monopol. The British realized that they could sanction others by holding up their ships, thus denying them the production of explosives. The french chemist Kuhlmann was the first to oxidize ammonia to nitric acid.
Wilhelm Ostwald completed this work further and the Ostwald Process, formation of HNO3 out of NH3, was born. In the meantime Haber and the BASF engineer Carl Bosch ramped up the Haber Bosch process. Ostwald even hinted the german Army leaders to support their work. He was aware of the problem of a salt peter shortage.
As a precaution Germany had built up a stock of 900 000 to sodium nitrate. Haber had to give a formal comittment to the staff of generals, early in 1914.
And he told them, no worry we will have enough ammonia and nitric acid. So it went. The 900 000 tons of NaNO3 as a sole supply would have lasted only til early 1915.
As to chlorine, Haber did not develop it. The chemical has been used for many years. And its properties were well known. But there was an excess stock, as it was a by product with not sufficient use.  He just told the army how to get rid of it. Reminds us of Depleted uranium in the US."

"I want to add another (more ecological) perspective use of the haber-bosch-process for making fertilizer. 
First you can t say that something saves billions of lifes that were in part, a consequence of the thing itself. (You can t safe something that is not there yet..) 
One the other hand the ability of nitrogen fixing bacteria is more relevant then described in the video. All organic farming and also many conventional farming relies on the symbiosis between bacteria and leguminous plants (like beans, lentils but also trees like acacia). And they do it without a very energy-intensive process.. (Haber-Bosch-Process uses roughly 3 % of all human CO2-emissions)
In my opinion the more obvious approach would be to close the nutrient cycles and make fertilizer out of human poop and urine. Because that is were the nitrogen, phospathes, calium and so on end up. In our current approach we flush those down the toilet mix them with all kinds of polluted water sources and in the end a part of those nutrients ends up in our rivers and oceans and ground water. 
TO add that, the added input of nitrogen through the Haber-bosch-process is considered one of the biggest and most detrimental changes the global ecosystems through human activity. (algee blooms, mass fish dying, loss in biodiversity, contamination of fresh/ drinking water sources and so on) - check out Planetary Boundaries..

So it may be a process that seems like a good thing on the short term but for our longterm survival as a human species I would not be to sure about it."
Fritz Haber didn't do any thing bad. As a scientist he did what was his job.
"The thing is that he didn't saved billions. But instead his invention lead to billions getting born, and die later on anyways. So basically he killed billions."
"It's tragic irony that the exact same scientists who invent something good for humanity, later on do exactly the opposite. Why?"
"The answer is not to try to ""CONTROL"" nature, but to live harmoniously and synergistically with it. Disrupting only when it's absolutely necessary and using moderation and second-order thinking. Whenever we invent something, always ask - What's the best thing this can do? And what's the worst thing it can do? If the worst-case scenario is far more dangerous, then we find another way. Lastly, you can not ever control nature. The more we try to disrupt the natural balance of things, the more we will keep hurting ourselves. We need to understand our limitations and be humble."
"Instead of this clickbaitish title you could also have chosen a more information based claim: ""The man how invented both Nitrogen-based fertiliser and  warfare gases"", but I guess that would have hurt the views and your revenue :D"

Another globalist scam to subjugate humanity."
"You missed a biggie at the start of this video, regarding sources of nitrogen for plants and that is the nitrogen fixation by certain plants, possibly the most important source of nitrogen. This is why farmers have crop rotations which include nitrogen fixing plants. Some of these plants are; soyabeans, clover, peas, beans and all the legume family, as well as gorse, acacia and lupins. Should have asked a farmer!"
I have rotated fields of soybean near me. Do they get harvested? Or plowed under? The fields were potatoes last year. My first full year living here and watching the process. Its pretty cool!
he did mention nitrogen fixing bacteria
This is propaganda.

"You really don't have to put yourself in the video. Watching you walk up stairs does not contribute meaningfully to the video, and the transition from your mouth doesn't either. Don't be such a stereotypical youtube essayist. It's otherwise good so far, but you can generally cut down on a good bit of fat.

And he didn't save billions, he just expanded the supply and lowered the price of food. None of which would even be necessary if (some) people would stop having so many children. But they won't, so we just continue growing more populous until we're overpopulated again.

"It's important to note that the rational for chemical weapon is the exact same as the nuclear weapon. The only difference is one worked, the other didn't. One brought about victory and the other didn't.
History is written by the victor, it is often not objective. IMO, the slaughter, however horrifying, of combatants are better the that of civilians. So if anything, chemicals warfare on the battlefield is better than nuclear weapon on cities."
Problem (& difference) is chemical weapons are cheap n easy to produce.

"I always knew about Haber but the biggest twist i never expected was that he was Jewish and that the country he ended so many lives for would turn against him for being Jewish. You always hear justifications for acts of war as ""If we kill more people quickly, we can win the war quickly and save lives"" It's the same argument used to prop up the Atomic bombings on Japan. So interesting to hear that a German jew was using that same logic America used  for his home country of Germany and his work ultimately would be used against his own people in the end.  What complex life story."
"Which interestingly enough is yet another example of a scientific technology, namely nuclear energy, which can be used for good or for evil."
Otto Hahn the guy who was mentioned passingly because he opposed chemical weapons later won a Nobel Price for discovering nuclear fission which in turn lead to the development of nuclear weapons.

The video title and story telling implies its ok to take lives if you allegedly save more lives.... i strongly disagree. Without monsters like him there would be no war in the first place.

"A part of me is almost sure that Clara discovered the process, and then killed herself for the shame regarding how her husband used this invention. If he first discovered first a compound that was used in the war, and the he redeemed himself by using it for farming, then I would be ok with his Nobel Prize. But, instead, he discovered a miracle that could sabe millions and then transformed it into something disgusting. It is exactly the opposite of the Nobel Prize is about. I hope he is rotting in hell. Very thankful, though"

"I just visited Auschwitz, one of the main Nazi concentration camps just a week ago. I knew about Zyklon B and it's unbelievable that it was the same scientist who was probably guilty of most deaths caused during WW1 and WW2 when he was not even alive for most of the part. Its kind of like a weird fact to know that Fritz Haber is responsible for most deaths in the last century and most lives in this century."
With great power comes great responsibility.
"Offsetting carbon emissions is just the modern day version of letters of indulgence. You've sinned this much, pay that amount and you are freed of your sins. 
As long as we humans think of the world as a trade, nothing will ever change. Instead of ""sinning"" an buy our way out, how about we reduce the ""sinning"" to the lowest managable level and offset what's left."

"In the 80s ethiopia had famine, loads of celebrities got together to HEAL THE WORLD, and ethiopia got lots of money. So like any good third world country they bought loads of weapons.

At the time of Band Aid, the population of Ethiopia was approx. 40 million. By 2016, Ethiopia’s population had more than doubled to over 100 million. 80% of Ethiopian farmers are still subsistence farmers , very vulnerable to drought. With the massively increased population the burden increased on their system of food production, the land is more heavily taxed and they're in worse position than ever should disaster strike.

"Dilemma 20:18 - 20:48? Humans in and of themselves are eternally self seeking(a survival mechanism)the problem is we don’t turn it off…we can’t so we don’t create things that benefit the entire ecosystem on this planet…not just humans. We create things for the betterment of man with the notion that the earth is just gonna hold that deficit and the plants and animals are to just continue to survive. We selfishly create things that settle our needs, notions, hang ups racially or otherwise and petty beefs, instead of putting all of that aside and collectively choose the planet and all it’s inhabitants and not just the people.

Had we not designed the atomic bomb first, it is predicted the US would still have won, but with many more millions dead. Also nuclear bombs would still have been built and the current situation might be even more dangerous than today if the bomb's effects had never been proven while the arsenal was just 2 small bombs.

"@Mustachio Ronaldo Wrong. Morality arises from the same objective nature of reality you just described, because human biology encompasses both PAIN and PLEASURE. They are not made-up states, even though social morality has sometimes been hijacked by made-up religions and other ideologies. What is good is that which maximises our experience of joy, contentment, happiness, etc, and what is bad is that which maximises suffering. It is the molecular interactions happening inside our bodies between nerve cells after some external stimuli that creates these sensations, and most humans agree on a fundamental level what is painful and what is pleasurable. We are also wired with instinct and genetic drivers of behaviour that make us want to protect our family and our tribe (which gets hijacked by power-hungry politicians as patriotism)."
A hammer can build houses & be used badly.
@Mustachio Ronaldo science itself is a human creation made to explain how the universe works. Just because science doesnt care about human nature doesnt mean that it wasnt created without it in mind
"Well, in his perspective he killed to save soldiers from his side (according to this video itself). If there was no chemical gas, does anyone know how many more would've died on the battlefield? No.
It's not been invented just for evil purposes. 
Also, if the guy save 4Billion and killed around 100,000 (while in a war and they were the enemy,) so that means he still saved 3.99B people, right?

"The use of fertilizer has killed off our soils, so I say he's still a villain.  If only they had asked the indigenous peoples how they had stewarded the Earth, then they would know how to care for the soil.  Nature knows how to create and use nitrogen!  Monoculture (having only one crop in a field) is awful and leads to pests and lack of nutrition in the food.  Biomimicry (mimicking Nature instead of trying to ""control"" it) is the way to go... using a nitrogen fixing plant along with the ones you really want there makes the system work.

So you are telling me that this guy first killed a load of jews and then caused the worlds damning population boom and you re presenting him as a good person. The guy was an evil genius

Isn't it rather 76$ per ton?"
Apologies. I was writing about guano's price. Your figures do not look right.
Danke schön Fritz Haber ji
science itself is allways neutral its the scientiests that turn it either into a good or a bad way ..
"Carbon emissions is just one way that we are killing the planet, and ourselves.

“Haber was a patriot..”
Now is to many ppl in africa. And they want more food. For free.
"but why the woman always got crazy and hurting herself? why can't she tell Haber that she is dissatisfied with their marriage and wanted to divorce or something, bruh."
Sad irony is that he was Jewish and then the Germans used his science to kill Haber's own people
Why i heard sabaton when gas is mentioned??

"Hello I'm Jonas Haber, 

Thank you for making this video! I learned that the man who might be my ancestor tried to help the people to survive and hold up for couple more centuries to come. Although it comes to a situation where it has to be used on the wrong purpose and many lives were taken by accident with such idea. I am still proud of his accomplishments to give life a second chance. I carrying the same last name as him but I didn't actually know where it's origins because I'm from Philippines. But now I know why my cousins look like Europeans."
"@Jonas Haber I think you have european ancestry but just because you have the same last name doesn't always mean you're related

I mean you could always consult an expert on ancestry and family trees"
he ain’t ur ancestor man lmao
@Jay Melting Tallow 🤭 I don't lmao
bruh you look just like him
Such a interesting video!
"19:42 Bad closing sentence. Saying someone else would've done it if you hadn't, doesn't take you out of taking accountability.
And it's not like his invention was then used by others for the war. As you said, he lobbied to convert his factories to make nitrate for TNT (13:26). I think the closing sentence didn't fit that and should've been more about ethical use of science and taking accountability for what you do with your knowledge."

"The way we regard the concept of war was forever changed after WW1. I like to think that if Haber had had the knowledge of what ""The Great War"" would do to Europe, he wouldn't have been as zealous in his pursuit of chemical weapons."
Answer to your question is to teach the virtues of giving and the abomination of stealing to our children! Duh!!!
Ok
So he is the 'bad German scientist' they portrayed in Wonder Woman 1.
"How wonderful it is to see someone actually presenting ""two sides of a coin"" !

Nowadays, everyone talking about big questions one way or the other, not taking the other side of the coin into consideration. Now, Frits Habers discoveries/inventions goes extreme in both ways, but it's nice to see some depolarizing happening (is that a word?) As always great video!! Thanks!"
"@Busy Brain Tinkering To be fair, even mentioning that the allied nations were also working on chemical weapons is a lot more than most documentaries manage."
"@steve escher yes, one could argue that he could have elaborated the use of chemical warfare used by other nations in WW1, but I think that would be a bit outside the scope of this video."
I felt this was very biased haha not against him but Germany as a whole
Don’t forget that insecticides are responsible for the impending ecological apocalypse.
"Re: your final question-- the answer hinges on that phrase ""control of the natural world."" If you're over-farming your landbase and depleting the soil, one solution is to create a new chemical to rapidly replenish the soil with Nitrogen, the other is to stop those overly extractive farming practices. The first answer assumes that we should control, or dominate, nature, bending it to our will and needs. The second answer assumes that we should keep our needs and will in balance with what nature can provide us.

Brilliant video. What a beautiful, complicated story of how physics, chemistry, politics and the environment all intersect."

"I haven't finished watching; I was about to post something in line with this.

Anyone has good resources on how to start answering the last question Derek asked in the video? How can we keep the technological innovations without killing ourselves?
"@01:36 When he said ""This day"", color of the video changed from black & white into color, Derek Muller is genius.

"Salute, you made an excelent conclusion."
Why didnt they teach this in school?
"People are complex and fully capable of both brilliance and poor decisions, sometimes in the same breath. Hauber invented world-renowned fertilizer, but also fertilizer bombs and gas weapons. Einstein inspired the foundation of the nuclear warhead, but also nuclear reactors for electricity.   Science is about knowledge. How you use it is about morality. While there is right and wrong in science, morality is subject to perspective."
I learned about this guy when I read Dr. Stone and looked up Haber after hearing Senku mention the Haber Bosch process.
Reminds me of Thomas Midgley Jr.
20:19 every bit of information is a potential double edged sword
The Video is good but I miss Carl Bosch. He was also importent for the NH3 synthesis.
Damm they should make a movie about this guy!

"Is science and technology is a double edge sword??🙏🙏
Great video 🔥🔥"
I think it's a failure not to mention the origin of the Nobel prize and how awarding it to somehow who used their invention for war is at odds with it.
"There's double-edged sword, and then there's purposefully developing chemical weapons. Imo, giving scientists a free pass to forget about morality is as near-sighted and hypocritical as expecting them to know where their current research would be used in the future."

"While research is funded by governments and companies that will use it for nefarious purposes it will always cause harm. Scientists can also work to create weapons for governments for multiple reasons, such as: Money, Nationalism/Patriotism, Threats or coercion. If we can remove science from the bonds of capitalism and nationalism then we might see less of the double edged sword."

"14:51

I'm sure that there are some people from the United States that are condemning what he said there, but that does admittedly make us hypocrits.

That was the exact reasoning we gave for when we nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

If we could end the war quickly, many lives could be saved. In turn though, to end the war quickly, we had to use one of the most devastating weapons ever used in a war, killing thousands of civilians who weren't directly part of the war

I remember seeing haunting images of the aftermath of the bombings, you could see the shadows of the people who were killed by the bombs burned into the ground.

Edit: I double checked, it was that the area around the ""shadows"" was bleached, making them looked burned in. It's still incredibly terrifying that you could see where people were standing when the bombs landed."
"@joshua  what millions? You clearly dont have a grasp on the numbers leading up to these last days of ww2. There is no credible reasoning that Japan would sacrifice ""millions"" to a lost cause. That is why they surrendered, and they were discussing surrendering BEFORE the bombings, the Japanese had conditions though. The fact you are losing is evident when your allies have all lost and the powers that steamrolled those allies are now coming for you."
@dr 335 it saved millions more then it killed civilians included
"There is no justification for bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan was losing and they knew it. They could somewhat defend against the US, but they knew the red army would come as soon as it was no longer busy in Europe. The excuse of ""saving lives"" is just that, an excuse. ""Your non combatants. Your elderly, women, children and their future families are worth less than our combatants."" is the reasoning. That is a disgusting way of putting the lives of innocents well below the lives of those who volounteer to go to war. And I say this as a soldier myself. Though not in the US army."
Sicence is a tool that is not good or bad. I like to think of it as having potential. The internet is a tool and it can be used for better or for worse. Science just so happens to be the most powerful tool we have. It has the most potential for good and for evil. Or at least that is how I see it.

How does atmospheric carbon lead to more extreme weather events? And if extreme weather is somehow acting as a carbon corrective does that explain why global warming never happened?
"Contrary to common belief, the invention of artificial fertiliser was not a good thing. It was even worse a thing than inventing poison gas."
Really? Could you explain?
"Or another way to see him.

He was a human, who did what he though was best. Carried forward in time with his flaws and talents, he was one to shape the future. Like all humans, it was for the better and the worst."
"Why reduce carbon? More carbon equals a greener planet, right? aka more food 😋"
Just because someone else would have discovered it doesn't make it morally okay by default.
Inventing something good doesn't excuse inventing weapons of mass destruction.
Without respect for ancient knowledge there is no way to research and invent without it backfiring on humanity. There are laws in this universe that man will never comprehend but man's arrogance convinces him that he is the universe. The ancients survived prospered and in many ways had much more beautiful fulfilling lives compared to modern man.

Only a select few will live life in luxury
"Some will call him a hero, some will call him a villain. But the point is even if he did not invent that, someone else would've done the invention. Things could have gone in a different way if there was no war or if Haber had not been a patriot. I don't know I think there is some pattern that makes things happen the way they happen. These inventors, they are not there anymore but their inventions are with us today. I don't know what else to say."
"First impression of the video, the thumbnail is amazing"
Guy looks like he could be brothers with Grisha Yeager
Hilariously biased and perhaps unintentionally a bit white supremacist. The idea that chemist are saving humanity contradicts reality. Ancient civilizations survived for millennia before the arrival of Europeans. Ancient people practiced methods that didn't destroy the soil without chemicals. Lastly what good is there in producing more food that has no nutritional value causes disease and is then thrown away in garbage dumps that then destroy the water supply. I was once told by a white supremacist that ancient people should be grateful that Europe stole their land because for thousands of years natives did nothing with their land. The reality is that the so called intellectuals of Europe are destroying the planet for profit.
"He is my idol

Basically Thanos if the Avengers were thoughtful enough
he made us overpopulated and then killed millions of people. two things that wound up to be just horrible. he’s done a significant amount of damage to this planet. both parts of what he achieved are destructive then again. that’s what humans do. someone else would’ve. humans will always out-do themselves. eventually ending things in destruction. for our planet. and our people. we need a reset button.

"While climate change is a natural phenomena, a natural change in temperature usually happens over a course of hundreds of thousands of years, if not millions of years. The thing is, following the industrial revolution millions of tonnes of carbon have been pumped into the air, resulting in a sudden rise in temperature as well since carbon sort of acts as an insulator, trapping the heat like a blanket, which causes a change in temperature which happen in less than a hundred years. We are literally speedrunning the climate."
He was a hero and a patriot. Nothing more to ask for.
Let's give a shout out to people who like to learn from the content they consume.
Derek is an impressively good communicator
"Fritz Haber, the discoverer of the 'Haber Process', is the prime example of what science is, not what it should or shouldn’t be. The monologue in the end poses the fundamental approch of Human nature to any tool we use in our day-to-day lives, including science. This episode has to be one of magnum opuses of this channel."
Science is practiced by individual with personnal responsabilities.  some research are too dangerous if our philosophical technology isn't advanded enough to be wise enough to anticipate the inherent problems.  this video is great up to the point where he just alleviates the personnal responsabilities of individual scientists.

At the end of the day these inventions are inherently neutral and it is us humans that can bring about either good or evil"
"@Matthew Hanks Oh, alright, thanks for the clarification. It's actually me who didn't understand what you meant at first..."
"@Cy83R ASF  no, no. I think I understood ya. If I’m missing anything tho, lemme know. 

my point was along the lines that while you say nuclear energy is an invention, so is a nuclear bomb. to say the original invention starts at “nuclear energy” and that green energy and nuclear bombs are somehow “sub-inventions” at which point the goodness or evilness can be decided seems very arbitrary. like I said before nuclear bombs are first and foremost an invention that, according to your statement about inventions, there’s always a way to use for good or evil.

the likelihood that a bomb or green energy would be used for pure good or pure evil (if that’s a thing) is hard to believe unless you’d say that when it comes to ethics there’s good and there’s evil and nothing in between. it’s a stance that i don’t think holds up well. is the fact that one’s country has a nuke as a means of defense a good thing? should three mile island, chernobyl, and fukushima re-color our understanding of “green energy’s” inherent goodness? there are so many more ethical questions we can ask that show there’s a lot of grey in between the black and white

and if u agree that nuclear bombs are indeed an invention, i was also getting at that even if it (the bomb) isn’t being “used”, as in the thing that you claim is the action that defines the goodness or evilness of a thing prior to which it’s a neutral entity, it’s still sitting there holding people hostage by the idea that it could go off ever since it was invented. ergo MAD during the cold war. in that sense even the term “use” is insufficient because the mere existence of an invention creates new existence-conditions that could be called good and/or evil to whatever incalculable degree u want. hence why i think it’s not neutral before what people would likely call “usage”.

I hope that makes sense"
"@Cy83R ASF So your saying that scientist should just be mindless smart people doing research and never worrying about the ramifications of it? In science there is ethics as well and some research just given it's nature and how the research would have to be conducted brings up ethical concerns. What is the intent of the research is also very important. It is true that there is science just for the sake of science that hopefully has a use in the future that could be good or bad and it's just an unknown, there usually isn't opposition to this type of science but there are other things that have implications to it and it rest with both scientist and legislation. Is research to discover an even more disastrous nuclear weapon not a cause for concern or is a scientist just a robot doing what he was programmed to do. Was figuring out how to get a gas heavier than air that was toxic and killed men in one of the most horrific ways a good use of science. To use your term science isn't just neutral if you're actively trying to use it for the sole purpose of harming others or where other serious implications come in, e.g human experimentation and so forth."
"@Matthew Hanks I'm not sure you quite understood my point. I meant to say that, like in the video, there's always a way to use inventions for good or for evil. Nuclear energy is also a good example, as it could be used as green energy, not only as a terrible weapon of mass destruction."
@Cy83R ASF fair point. curious if you’d tag along. i’d understand if u don’t wanna. anyway…when would u say an object isn’t being used? for example a nuke in a cilo just waiting there

favorite video of yours <3
thank you sir Fritz Haber.
"I invented artificial intelligence, they didn't credit me because they are greedy of power to say the least and they claim someone else might have invented it. But to invent it makes you throw away everything you know about computer science so no one else nor a group of people could have done it. I know because I'm a computer science graduate and I also know that that is the holy grail every computer scientists dream of and search and want for. And why would someone or a group not want to take any credit for it? That is why there is so much problem in the world today because they want to take it one step further to true artificial intelligence. They want slave machines to take over the world become overlords of the world and even the universe."

Not fast enough
Well ya farming can deplete nitrogen but that’s why farmers do crop rotation like corn and then grow alfalfa or beans or clover. One plant puts nitrogen in the soil and the other uses it. Bacteria can also put nitrogen in the soil. But ya if ya don’t do crop rotation you better add it.

What is then?"
This video gave me crippling depression.
"Let me know if I got this straight. The guy invented a method to sustain world overpopulation, which has consequences such as increased carbon emissions (paradoxically, wren is sponsoring this video). He also created a way to kill people, going against international treaties and agreements regarding using chemical weapons. He helped the Germans, who thought of Jews (Haber's religion) as their enemy. He also believed that by quickly killing people and ending the war, lives would be saved; implicitly, he did not care about the lives of the enemy's army. And there are a few more things more I could mention. Despite all that, we should not pose him as a villain? I am genuinely a fool; I think I did not understand the purpose of the video."
"This is the comment I was looking for: he saved billions, but being able to sustain billions must surely be a major factor contributing to the climate apocalypse we're all facing right now? In which case, this is an agricultural advance that's caused considerably more harm than good..."
He's based AF
It depends through what perspective you see things
"14:52 damn, same justification the US used for nuking Japan"
Great work. Thank you.
"I have only respect for the guy , he was a true nationalist working tirelessly to defend his country"

I'd argue that the invention of the fertiliser was also a bad thing as overpopulation has created and exacerbated many of our current existential threats.
Good video
"So why are governments making laws to reduce man made fertilizers if they are so important in feeding the world?  ex. Sri Lanka, Netherlands and recently Canada."
"@John McKinnon it’s in the name, natural fertilisers. Basically they’re made of materials that aren’t, yknow SYNTHETIC which allows microbes to like break em down to simpler compounds."
"@Raptorzilla What will be the result of the reduction in food output?  Wouldn't natural fertilizers applied at the same rate also pollute? My point is using less fertilizer, what ever the source and for what ever the reason will cause a reduction in world food output..."

This takes me back to my school days where I was studying Haber's process of producing Ammonia 😂 great
"Wow. It would be difficult to find a history or science video better than that. If only all social studies teachers taught like Derek! I loved learning about this fascinating man, and I love these science history videos!"

You know what else help increases plant yield? CO2... MMMMM
this is the worst argument I’ve ever seen in support for fossil fuels
"Yeah ammonia and bombs, since he didn't mention it the first minutes of the video, stop clickbait video essays like this. It sucks"
"Pls let’s be fair.
History is written by winners. Germany lost WWI and thus these unfair judgements on Haber. The US won WWII and no one judges Manhattan project’s scientists, rightly so!
On the point Derek makes at the end, there is no hope: every major technological development in the last century came from repurposed military applications."

Killing even a single person to save billions is never acceptable. This scientist should have been executed rather than nobel prized.
Bro what where’s your sense of collectivism my dude
Here's the truth. He was a brilliant scientist. There is no good or bad for him. Simple as that.
Next story will be about how fauci massacred the world
How is he more important than the guy who split the atom?

I'm glad that Haber had a terrible life. His chemical weapon contribution was horrific.

"This was an exceptionally candid, poignant, introspective video on a very important (and, as evidenced, dark) part of chemistry's history. The closing is true and something I thought of before the end of the video: Progress--for better or for worse--would've happened anyway. While Fritz Harber is a villain to some, a savior to others, the inevitable opening of that door for mankind was one of the most consequential in history."
"Aren't the creators of the Manhattan project and the atomic bomb the same? They created a weapon to kill the enemy faster and in greater quantity in ""name of the country"".

Doesn't that make them the same OR MORE killers than Haber? If a German did it, it was a ""murderer"", but if the Americans did it, it was for the common good. How much hypocrisy."

"The wrong people always get the wrong credit. Along with two other US companies credited in 2005 I was one of those three who saved, and continues to save through our advancements in technology over 440,000 people per year, forever, in the USA.

Why do we keep showing recognition to those who screw up and manage some good out of their disasters?"
@Mikko Yep. Biggest lie in History is History.

Science explains creation, but can't explain the reason for it's existence without the Word.

Hence why the Word of God is necessary to explain the purpose of said functions, and the unseen spiritual implications of such.

That way, she would have lost not only her share in the discovery and international recognition, but also her husband as a fellow scientist and sparringpartner. She would have felt horribly betrayed by her husband.

I hate even mentioning this bc I despise Nazis of all kinds, especially those of 1930s and 40s Germany, and know full well of the long list. of horrendous atrocities they were guilty of, still the (easily demonstrable, in this case) truth matters. Once these claims are examined critically, they immediately become untenable for a long list of reasons.

Bird Guano was mined for is Phosphate. Nitrogen mainly comes from chemical processes as explained in the video, the oil industry being a big part of that."
The answer to the last question is to massively reduce power of governments. Notice how it’s always governments that are responsible for wars and laws that cause millions of deaths. And then they try to put the blame on scientists as if no war could be waged without explosives or chemical weapons.
"An observation on  life from another German - “We can regard our life as a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful repose of nothingness.” ― Arthur Schopenhauer 
We really needed another 4 billion people on this finite orb; what could go wrong?"
"Germany will notice his achievement but we will never honor him like other countries... cough cough USA, Russia, China"
There seems to be a rule the more useful something can be the more dangerous it can be. Nuclear can save humanity or kill us off.
Check out the autobiography “Between Genius and Genocide” to learn more about Fritz Haber’s story.
"Wren? with a logo of a bird next to it? You Americans love to copy stuff don't ya ;) Our Wren sells kitchens though, quite funny if you ask me"
"""You don't know how your research might be used""  I guess you forgot that this guy was the guy trying to turn his fertilizer into bombs, and made gasses with the intent to make a weapon to kill thousands.
Should he have been given the award?  Objectively, yes, as the invention deserved recognition.  Does he deserve infamy for chlorine gas, and conversion of fertilizer into explosives? Yes, to that as well.
Cyclon B used to kill millions?  No. He does not deserve blame for that.  The Nazis just would have used something else."

Carbon Footprint 🤔... 🤣😂🤣
Thanks. I see now why they bombed Lebanon....
The problem now is politicians to forbid use of nitrogen in Holland in the name of climate change...
nonsense video the gas had an effect BECAUSE of the wars.. If it was invented later then it wouldnt have been used!!
"i could offset the carbon emissions for my household, and the neighbors on both sides, but it still wouldn't be more than a feather landing on the elephant of china and india. i've seen it with my own eyes. anyway, i'm sure we will find a way to balance the atmosphere."
Dude can't you place less ads ?
"I actually really dislike the note he decided to out on here, he takes an issue of a scientist using their positions dn knowledge to further the killing of other people and frames it as an inevitability of learning, saying someone else would have done it. But not all learning is necessarily double sidedly helpful and evil, not every path of knowledge has equal chances of both giving and taking life. It is incredibly irresponsible for a scientist to frame their learning as simply learning for learnings sake and then turn the other way (or in the case of Haber actively participate) when someone tries to use that line of learning for destruction rather than creation. Scientists working on things like military research are actively doing harm, no matter how they try and distance their experiments from the actual killing in the end, and framing things in this way is just plain bad. Yes Haber is not solely to blame for the entirety of the war or even chemical weapons, but he is unambiguously at moral fault for actively participating in the effort to more effectively kill other human beings. And to frame that side of research as unavoidable or just as a part of the process of learning is bad and wrong."
A sad case of you reap what you sow
"Certainly an interesting man. I wouldn't neccessarily blame him for inventing those poison gases. The idea that human lifes would best be preserved by using a weapon so effective that it would end a war quickly has been common throughout the 20th century and is used to this day to justify the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in WW2. If you wanna be cynical about it, you could argue that the only fault of his chlorine gas was that it was not effective enough to actually shorten the war."
Guano!!!
Wow! This is the cleanest version of Fritz Habers story I've ever heard.
So the war criminal is now glorified by you? Are you FRIGIN KIDDING US?

I learned so much on this video. Thank you for sharing.
Knowledge can be used in anyway it’s who holds it and what they decide to do with it I don’t think it was his fault for discovering it but for using it in how he did but at the same time he did it for his home just like USA would do the same for here they will invent things and kill anyone who try’s to do us harm

"@BasementEngineer I have heard that during those trials Ernst Zundel, or someone sympathetic to him, had someone infiltrate Auschwitz and take samples of brick in a number of the buildings, including the one alleged to have been used frequently for years as a gas chamber. The samples were brought to the United States and chemically analyzed in Massachusetts. The building claimed to be the gas chamber had some ferrocyanide compound in the bricks, but so did other buildings such as the guards' barracks. The level of contamination suggested a once-per-year fumigation, e.g. to get rid of rats and biting insects."

"In the next two years it will be solar maximum, the hot weather was more likely because of the solar energy release on the 16th of July in the next two years space weather will make the world hotter. So when they go on about it, it may look true, mostly the planet will have stormy weather because heat is the main drive of Earth's weather and it's the environment stabiliser. Lead and CFC's are things that had to be stopped more solar energy is getting through because of the weakening of the Earth magnetic fields, but the Earth has been in varying relatively stable temperatures because of its weather which converts the heat energy to kinetic energy."

Answering the last question is: Accepting Jesus in your heart. The only answer.
"I agree someone else would make similar discoveries however, when said discovery, the context of discovery,  realization of utility of discovery and lastly successful industrial production and commercialization of discoveries really determine outcomes. Like the video said he got lucky. It just so happens a chemist working on this problem just so happen to have access to ozmium a rare material. Also the fact that he recognized that the material would be a candidate for his catalyst. Then afterwards he was able to secure the supply of that rare resource, and successfully scale up his experiment for commercial use. All without to many hiccups, or accidental death at any point in the process. I'm sure it was somewhat secret at the time of how it was done. I don't think progress of tech and science is a sure thing. I think we get lucky alot. And again Luckily now adays we share discoveries to ensure we don't lose those steps forward. I think  tge widespread progression of technology didn't start to take off exponentially until literacy rates have gone up and trade routes secured. Sure there would be savant and geniuses and random breakthroughs, discoveries that were important to the state or a group or even those individual would be most likely secret and consequently lost due to one thing or another. But real progress is when a technology or practice becomes widely adopted by a population or atleast spread to other specialists elsewhere. Communication, luck, and hardship drive innovation and the preservation of progress in my opinion. As people say if you'd rather be skilled or lucky, you should pick lucky"

However I differ on a few points. Ammonium nitrate fertiliser is incredibly damaging to the soil and the environment. For a start it kills the nitrogen-fixing fungi. It also kills a host of other beneficial micro-organisms in the soil, whose job it is to turn dead plant and animal remains back into plant food. (I am a farmer.) There are some 2 600 species of micro-organisms doing this job. Once this damage has been done, crops are entirely dependent on synthetic fertilisers, and are nothing like as nutritious as organic-grown foods, accounting for much of the sickness in the world today.
Global warming may be a problem, but it will shrink into insignificance in the face of what is about to happen politically in the next 8 years leading up to the Battle of Armageddon and the return of the Lord Jesus Christ."

".Seeing the summary of the Day the Earth Stood Still, I was overcome with a deep and holy indignation. Because there is a sector of ufology where the extraterrestrials unbearably acquire the hypocritical character of preaching and exhorting Fathers where they preach to us: Humans are a danger to the universe, irresponsible, polluting and warlike. Beware of chemical wars, beware of global warming, beware of nuclear energy. More love, more solidarity, less wars. They are in quarantine and penance for their low vibrations. Pollutants. If they don't change there will be a total extension.... ""This is seen from Asthar Sheran to Chico Xavier to Swaruu, from a famous appearance on the Uritorco mountain in the eighties, to the famous movie The Day the Earth Stood Still, (where in the recent remake the nature of Kenee Revee is closer to the real one than in the Matrix). But let's expand our consciousness and tie up loose ends. Aren't we run by a perverse elite tele directed by Aliens? call it deep state, caval, illuminati, or that they went to Antarctica? Are not the Anunnaki the DTs of the Illuminati who gave them the mandate: I destroyed faith, religion, morals, so that far from God we have license for total destruction. Things they do with a blind obedience their entourage of pornographic artists, making apology to Homosexuality, abortion, adultery, drugs, paganism, witchcraft.... (Artists who think they will be saved from chaos because they wear illuminati slippers, they would be adducted by ships in chaos as they show in a video... ha!) But beware, also the unarguable and unpresentable economic reset, the 5G, the virus, the AI all have an obvious and natural ET origin. (Demons, Fallen Angels, pagan gods, the lifelong enemies of Yahweh) They were told to leave only 10% and reign over them, but the plan is to betray the Illuminati, eliminate that 10%, eliminate the elite itself, to be able to say: ""mission accomplished.

"As a Chilean, who's country was severely dependant on saltpetre( mineral nitrate) export in the early 1900, Haber is known as the man who destroyed our economy indirectly. We knew we where relying to heavily on one resourse, but we never thought it would disappear so quickly. It only took 15 years from Haber's discovery to the shutdown of the first saltpetre mine in Chile. Only 10 years later the last one was closed and Chile´s economy was in ruins."

"@BasementEngineer According to halakha, a Jew by birth must be born to a Jewish mother. Halakha states that the acceptance of the principles and practices of Judaism does not make a person a Jew. However, those born Jewish do not lose that status because they cease to be observant Jews, even if they adopt the practices of another religion.

Halakha is based on biblical commandments (mitzvot), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic laws, and the customs and traditions which were compiled in the many books such as the Shulchan Aruch. Halakha is often translated as ""Jewish law"", although a more literal translation of it might be ""the way to behave"" or ""the way of walking"". The word is derived from the root which means ""to behave"" (also ""to go"" or ""to walk""). Halakha not only guides religious practices and beliefs, it also guides numerous aspects of day-to-day life."

Chemical fertilizers like uria and ammonia also make the crop more susceptible to plant diseases, which needs chemical pesticide and insecticide to kill and we inturn eat these nutrition less produce along with chemicals that were used to grow them, then we become sick and get diseases that are idiopathic according to doctors, we kill the biomass of the soil, the bacterial, earthworms, bees, ladybugs, the micro fauna of the soil, soil becomes dry, unable to hold water, lacking nutrients and filled with chemicals, the land becomes barren. Now ,   where is the wisdom in this. Except a whole lot of dangerous and deadly chemicals. Now we want organic, who is listening to us, large scale enterprises use only chemicals to grow food."
Subscribed to Wren!  Thanks for letting me know about it!
"Now even the fertilizer is becoming bad for us; too much used, so nature is killed and diversity is lowered. 
And soil needs other influences as well, only regenerative agriculture can give."

"I'm a long fan of your video and I find this one as good as usual.
But at the same time, I do think you should have added warning before showing the Beyrouth's explosion. Since the explosion happened, I wanted and try to never see seem. I succed until today and because you gave no notice at all, now I've seen them and i don't feel good. Those footage are not easy to see at all."
Knowledge in the wrong hands is destructive.
This video is a beautiful work of art
Great video. Just wanted to say that I don't think Haber was evil or smth. It's not like the German Empire were Nazis and when Nazis used his Zyklon B after he died without him knowing. That would be like saying Einstein bad cause his theory somehow helped someone discover a new method of torturing people. His intentions in the ww1 wasn't evil at all. He wanted to find an effective method to make trench  warfare obsolete so the war could last much shorter. It unfortunately didn't work too well. So I think he was much more of a good guy.
"His wife killed herself and this guy is like, can't be late for work, gotta catch a train."
What a story and how well its told!!! Kudos.
"I recently learned about his existence in chemistry lessons, it's incredible how one can kill so many, save so many, make everyone angry about him and then get a nobel prize for it."
Looks like he chose the Neutral route. I wonder how different the world would become if he went to full Pacifist route or if he went to full Genocide route
@Griffin S you are astute and wise
"@mikey forrester if it's enough to end a war then it's fine. Morally no, logically yes"
it makes sense if you count the families of those millions who died... or if you were one of those people.. its all great and youtube worthy unless you are given the short end of the stick

"To answer your last question, Gandhi said "" The Earth has enough for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed"", it its the capitalist mind of our society to ever-expanding, ever exploring, we never settle for sustainability. We have to change the way we are living today, the answer lies not in science but in social science. (I am an engineer )"
Amazingly interesting video. i Luv u Veritasium.
"Until you can change the heart of mankind, mankind will use scientific advancement for evil and some for good. Only true faith in God, producing morality, and love for one another, can contain evil. While there are people with evil intent, evil will abound."
"Its worth to place an errata here: It was Germans who used zyklon b, thus as stated in the video,  ""the Germans requested chemists remove the foul-smelling component"". Just to put an alias for Nazis, just to remember."
"Chemistry has made it possible but not wise for 8 billion of us to live on the planet. Our waste is so contaminating the planet that it is becoming unlivable for our (and other) species. We will go extinct if we don't shrink our population. The number we need to hit is somewhere between 700 and 900 million people to make the earth a paradise again. We have models to reduce population in places like, the U.S., Canada, Western Europe, Japan and Austrailia. If we educate the population and improve the standard of living people have fewer children and we could reduce (over a few generations) our population to sustainable levels."
I believe we are taking baby steps in the right direction. ESG guidelines for once is something that looks promising.
"I'm sorry, but I find it impossible to regard Haber as innocent. Whatever his intentions, the guy came up with a chemical weapon for military purposes. No patriotism justifies that."
Now the planet is overpopulated...
Such is the relationship between humans and power. Human nature is something scientists and (many political extremists) are optimistic that they can change.
The dialogue at the end  (last 10 mins)of the  1950s scfi move FORBIDDEN PLANET comes to mind.

he didn't really save billions. those billions just wouldn't have been born.
they would have been born and then died like the century's before. the reason the population grew with a stagnating birth rate is that fewer people died due to illenss (medicine) and food shortages. often food shortages also forced people to eat unsafe thing which than lead to illness.
sad story.

No verifiable evidence to substantiate this assertion.
"the thing is there are peaceful and natural and antient ways to do some things, 1 example instead of manufacturing nitrogen we could practice crop rotation or permaculture in farming which involves growing certain plants in your field between or during yields in order to replenish the soil with its needed nutrients. just like how humans and trees both help each other through photosynthesis and breathing. plants help each other too."

And then the Germans tried to kill   so many after his product saved so many
"Well, then don't declare war on Germany or fry to invade it.  Simple, really."
We can start by admitting that leftism is at least as dangerous as right wing extremism.
Little note - most of the actual concussive explosiveness comes from the moles of gas produced . 1 mole takes up 24dm3 - so 220ish grams of TNT produces 1.5 moles (so 36dm3) of nitrogen gas. Which is a much larger volume than the original solid.
"Please read ""An Agricultural Testament"" by Albert Howard!!"
I love when your all video. In this Case not only the science but also the history
Looking at Haber as irrelevant doesn't make sense. Someone would have eventually come up with Einsteins ideas at some point if he didn't do it. Same can be said about any famous person really.
"There's a great book all about this called ""The Alchemy of Air: A Jewish Genius, a Doomed Tycoon, and the Scientific Discovery That Fed the World but Fueled the Rise of Hitler"". Highly reccomend it to anyone who found this video interesting."
And governments around the world i.e. Canada and the netherlands have adopted reducing nitrogen fertilizar by 30 percent minimum.  So how are we going to feed the population
and the chlorine gas that was used in warfare now forms the basis of the agriculture products used to kill insects that are used on crops that we eat every day. sad times still exist. He died of a heart attack!!! The increase in heart related deaths today? Anyone see a link?????
"So Haber is a bitch but i owe my life to him?  
He probably wanted to impress everyone again so he turned to taboo since it was low hanging fruit..  Chemical weapons?   No, thank you."
"Is it bad that the first thing in mind when it comes to the Haber process is KSIs science rap from back in the day? I don’t remember learning about it from a teacher, only from the internet but maybe that’s just me. Really interesting video as usual"
"to the first part of this video......regarding agriculture......the overuse of nitrogen and the sad impact on the environment, climate change and ocean degradation is the perfect example of lab technicians not understanding the effects or properly testing the effects of their invention and letting it run globally for profit."
"Zyklon B was simply a delousing agent.  The US military used it until 1979.  You sure know a lot, but you don't know everything."
Saw this on Sci-show or vsause I forgot >:D
"I don't buy the irrelevant argument. He literally started a research institution, that kind of leadership makes a difference. It is probably true that everything he invented would have come to pass anyway, but it might have happened decades or centuries later. Other solutions to the same problems may have been invented before them, resulting in a very different history.

I don't blame him though, even when he was killing people, he was fighting for what he believed in. It was war after all, this kind of stuff is the norm in war."
"This video was really great until you started shilling carbon credits.  The CO2 lie it the most economically destructive lie of the last 15 years.  Carbon Dioxide is not a pollutant, and never was.  And there is not a single study that has linked them empirically.  You have been lied to by evil, rich communists about global warming, and it has been so since the beginning of the movement.  STOP LYING ABOUT CO2, GET EDUCATED ON THE TRUTH.

There are many other acute and long term environmental issues that need real attention (water table pollution, genetic manipulation cascade effects, insect population destruction and many more) and work, but the CARBON lie has prevented these issues from being known. Why? Political corruption.  That companies that pollute the most own the most politicians.  Wake up.  Stop being a shill.  If politicians are pushing it IT IS MOST LIKELY A LIE."

Oh stop with the climate change fear mongering!  The globe isn't that fragile and there is nothing mean can do to stop the fluctuations.  Rather we should focus on adjusting to it.
Zyklon B was also used by the Americans.... in smaller doses we would spray all immigrants who were brought to the country to work on farms in the 1920s.... every day they were sprayed with the stuff.

It makes me wonder how many ideas have been put aside because the scientist felt the world wasn't ready . . . .

"gotta love seeing this while there is a massive discussion about dutch farmers producing too much nitrogen in their farms.
turns out if you put too much nitrogen near a forest the grass grows so fast that no trees or other plants like flowers grow there, that reduces the chance for insects to inhabit the location, resulting is severely reduced biodiversity.

"I seriously can't believe that only 217 people died from the Beirut blast...  so incredibly lucky

Don't get me wrong, even a single lost life is a tragedy!  But I just can't believe it wasn't in the thousands dead."
"also a lot of people went missing and were never found, though I'm not sure if those are included in the death toll or not."
"some people suffered a worse fate to be honest. This number doesn't take into account people who committed suicide, people who not only lost their homes entirely but suffered a variety of lung diseases due to the release of toxic gases from the explosion itself and the chemical releases from the rubble of the destroyed buildings and houses, etc. Though, yes, the timing was relatively lucky in the sense that if it was an hour earlier, or around noon in general, a lot more people would have been closer to the blast since there's a highway right next to it that gets blocked with traffic regularly in rush hours"

2:25 Zadornov moment
"Fun fact: although the Haber process,  (today called the Haber-Bosch process) has fed billions. There is a growing community of science called regenerative agriculture who claims that not only has Haber’s chemical weapons killed people, but the beloved haber process itself it destroying the fertility of soil. To explain why. You have to know how nitrogen gets into the soil naturally in the first place. The answer is microbes, like bacteria and fungi. They are fixing nitrogen from the air constantly. Regenerative agriculturists claim that farms can be sustained without the haber bosch process and the only reason farm lands get depleted is because heavy tilling, and adding the salty fertilizers destroy the micro biome in the soil, making it dependent on synthetic, haber-Nitrogen. So there is a group out there that says that haber is still killing to this day, and that he is even more deadly than Thomas Midgley and friends.  Derek please make this topic a part 2 to this video"
I'd say Haber was no less evil than any allied scientist who helped them win both wars . Top of this list is openheimmer.

"Derek, not all of ""us"" if by ""us"" you mean this planet's inhabitants who have benefited as I have from technological advances, includes everyone on the planet with its unwanted byproducts like climate change. 

The majority of the world's population will not have benefited to any particular degree at all, but will bear a far higher proportion of the burden of the unwanted byproducts of our luxurious lives, such as climate change than will we, the world's wealthy.

It has been a privilege to live the life I have. 

I was born white, male, a native English speaker in England in the latter half of the 20th Century. I have made far more than the average income, and I have lived in beautiful places: California; Devon in the UK;  Morocco; Seychelles.

But as lucky as I have been, and as much as I have enjoyed my privileges and the benefits of the timing and placement of my birth. I have also experienced a growing unease at the costs, the externalities of my good fortune, and how they are increasingly the burden of the world's poor. Who have not enjoyed the benefits and privileges of the accident of my birth.

The latest example being our ""principled"" stand over Ukraine. It will not be any of us in the EU, UK or USA who starve as a result of our ""principles"".

He killed millions and saved billions...that will be killed one day due to overpopulation that is leading to environmental collapse and global warming. With no nitrogen fertilizer our numbers might have been kept in check.
Go cry on Twitter about it.
"Seems like you could offset any negative effects of living by simply planting trees and having a garden in place of maybe half of your grass lawn.

We are humble enough to accept we don't know how nature and physics works and trying to learn but we become so arrogant when we get a little bit information. That evolves to making terrible decisions on behalf of others, i suppose.

"While it may divert from the narrative: Carl Bosch did recieve the nobel price in 1931 as a reward for his thus far overlooked contribution to the Haber-Bosch process. Bosch was the one to disover and fix a flaw in the method making it workable on the industrial scale. This does emphasize how important this development was, rewarding two seperate nobel prizes for the same development."
"What amazes me is that the third nobel prize linked to the Haber-Bosch process was given to Gehard Ertl in 2007, who after almost a century finally got the full mechanism of the reaction right. So we basically used that process for 100 years without knowing how it actually worked."
Fritz Haber’s greatest mistake… he neglected his Torah studies!
In fact that was his greatest decision;  it permitted him to discover worthwhile scientific principles.
What a fantastic Channel. 👏

I don't agree with you. There is a big difference between inventing something that gets misused and actively developing poison gas in order to kill people and then lobby your government to use it.

"This is a well researched video. Even the gold extraction from seawater is mentioned. I am a chemistry teacher myself and I tell this story my students. I like the aspect of regarding the person as an inventor as irrelevant. For sure someone else would have found out, different time, different place. Nevertheless, looking at the effects that overpopulation and large scale industrial agriculture have on our planet, I am having difficulties in calling the Ammoniaproduction an heroic invention, even though my existence may be a direct consequence."
"The increase in the human population is going to be the death of us - or at least of our civilisation, so I don't think you can say Haber ""saved"" anyone."
"Don't worry, most of Europe, China and Japan are all in dire straits from population pyramid problems so severe, the population might never recover.  At best, the population will be halved."
"As a former student of chemical technology, I really enjoyed this video. We have been taught about Haber's process, and I knew it was kind of important in farming, but it was never explicitly said how much important it was.
Great video, as always"

I love to watch every Veritasium video because I know a great and interesting story awaits. I turned on all notifications for the channel.
But I ignored this video since it came out and I saw it popping up in recommendations because the thumbnail and title seemed a bit weird to me. Like a comic story. I just had no idea that this was a Veritasium video which I would've watched right away. Your thumbnails (great as they might be) are very diverse and unrecognizable.
I'd say, it would be nice if your thumbnails contained the channel icon, so people won't miss videos because they just didn't look at the small channel name print."

"For that reason I quit robotics in 2003. I was enthusiastic to develop limp prosthetics or external skeletons for heavy lifting tasks.

Arguments that this would result in a never ending war where every pilot could treat the war as if it was a video game.

"Nah this guy was a straight up shithead. He sacrificed everything to get in with the intellectual elite of Germany. He was self-hating, which is why he never practiced his faith. Clara most likely did what she did because he trapped her in a life of motherhood, effectively ending her promising career as a scientist. And when Einstein told him that it's stupid to dedicate oneself to an identity based on nationality, Haber shunned him. Even with a warning from Einstein himself, this guy still chose to invent instruments of death. When the time came when he thought he'd be rewarded, Germany's new leadership abandoned him, just as he had with everything else he was supposed to love."
You know Einstein's work was the basis for the Atom Bomb?

"Every new human innovation has been weaponised. The answer to humanity's deepest problems do not lie in science or technology, wonderful as these are."
So why is the Dutch Government *demonizing Nitrogen* and threatening to confiscate farmland  ?
"He is definitely not irrelevant to the larger story. His involvement with the military led to the outcome we got, to say the outcome would be the same no matter what is short sighted at best. To assume the same scientific discoveries would have happened is probably fair, but what led to and came after could have been so much better or worse...if it weren't for him I probably wouldn't be here. Being as objective as I can be, I'd say him being the one to make the discoveries he did was probably one of the worst people to make them. It could have been a decade or more before someone figured out what he did and that could have saved lots of lives. Maybe a different source of nitrogen would have been found and mass production of nitrogen wouldn't have happened for many more years. Maybe we don't over populate earth so staggeringly fast with the delay of mass produced nitrogen. Maybe with slower population growth our science can keep up with our population."

"I think that you shouldn’t take Haber out of the picture and the results saying that is irrelevant cause someone else would have invented or discover the process of separating the N atoms or the zyklon b or even the chloride gas. Cause the thing is that HE did it and on time for it to happen. What I’m trying to say here is that, yes i would also say that someone else would rathe found the same the process of the N atom or invent zyklon b or so but the thing is that this other person maybe would have discovered it 20 or 50 years from that moment so for example wouldn’t happened the chlorine gas in WW1 or the Nazis couldn’t make as an effective killing project as they did, and maybe we would have stopped growing the world population around the 1950-1960 or something cause of the lack of food production. And to give you another example of this point that I’m trying to make here is: take Lionel Messi as a clear example, he has records and records on soccer and I’m not talking to goals that it is something that is firsthand of his skills but assists for example, he discovered ways of solving the problem (scoring a gol is clearly the problem) but he is not scoring the goal but he created the way of doing that just as Haber created those ways to get there"

"I really enjoy these biographical videos. Truly remarkable stories of complicated people. You're probably right WRT trying not to label such historical figures as villains. However, being so even-handed and dispassionate is difficult for me.

"A source of nitrogen fertilizer that is often overlooked is human excrement.  The catch is that it must be “hot composted” if it is used in mass quantities to kill disease spreading organisms.   

But in addition to fertilizer, human sewage also produces biogas (methane) as does all organic matter. If all of it was harvested, it is unlikely we’d need much petroleum.  But again there is a catch, as there is no easy way to liquify it.  But it could at least replace propane that is used on-site."

"Wait - the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry has a pickelhaube on the corner tower!  Fitting, and amusing as well.  Awarding the Nobel Prize to Fritz Haber is also fitting, because Alfred Nobel had the same double-edged sword with his invention of Dynamite.  
Although it might seem a miraculous invention, ammonium nitrate may be a long-term disaster.  It requires the use of vast amounts of energy to be made, mostly fossil fuels.  It has also allowed the unnatural increase of the human population to unsustainable levels, which is a disaster for the ecosystem of the whole planet.  It's hard to predict the next 100+ years, but survivors of future generations may end up cursing the invention of ammonium nitrate, and the ecological disaster it created.  It may be far worse than chlorine gas and Zyklon-B combined."
I like Science.
Wren is useless to me the questions do not contain options that apply to me.
"Heil Haber , the German killer !"
"I got a chill watching this video when I saw how closely population is correlated to food production.  Trudeau just announced that he would restrict (reduced) the amount of fertilizer that Canada will use in the production of food.  This is being done to save the planet's climate ???  Hey, if we just reduce the population of the world by starving its citizens we can reduce emissions.  The elite are a bunch of sick puppies and must be stopped."
"I love these videos with this animation, it is amazing."
It feels like with every new invention we get one step closer to a better world and/or the end of the world.
"One of the saddest parts of this is the earth can provide way more food than we thought if we just used natural processes (IE: permaculture, agriforestry, regenerative agriculture, and the like). But farmers were stripping the land faster than it could provide with the techniques they had been taught by generations prior so the need for Nitrogen arose and all of its legacy, including related events like the Dust Bowl and the current issues of agricultural runoff of pesticides and fertilizers which have poisoned our oceans."
@ChemicalFrankie Yes. We didn't have the knowledge of them that we do now.
"Are you telling me ‘natural processes’ yield more than ‘artificial’ ones? How would that be possibile? If that were the case food business would switch to them, and that is not the case."

"The story was not quite like this. Or at least, this is not how they teach it to us, Peruvians"
and even the single most important argument *against* physics can deny us it...
"I think ""someone would have done it eventually"" as a way to dismiss an individual's terrible actions is ethically problematic. Haber should be both praised for creating fertilizer, and criticized for creating chemical weapons; he doesn't have to be either a ""good guy"" or a ""bad guy"", people are complex and that's okay."
"Despite your speech at the end I'm going to continue to see him as the villain. Although somebody else could've and would've invented a chemical weapon it could've taken months. Many thousands of people could've lived and gone home if it weren't for his ""patriotism"". He wasn't being patriotic he was being selfish and doing everything he could for more fame. He was a selfish mad chemist who killed millions for personal gain."
His logic was to end the war faster by creating horrible weapons. Einstein helped in the same fashion with the A bomb. Is there a humane way to encourage people to end early?
He over populated the earth and caused many to die in a terrible way. Thanos should of just snapped people like him away.
"You know the way they used the gas as a weapon, it reminds me to Attack on Titan where Marleyans used gas weapon to turned the humans into titans. And the titans origin is from Ymir Fritz, she also have the name of the founder of the gas weapon in this video. lol"
"I don't even blame him for the people he killed in the war. Like how a soldier fights for their country, he does chemistry for his country. One doesn't blame the soldiers who love their country, but are controlled by evil, for killing those they fight. So why should he be at fault in creating weapons for his country. His logic was the same logic behind researching nukes in WW2, but we don't roast Einstein for creating the nukes. People shun him essentially because he was on the side that lost the war. The approach of seeing him as irrelevant is a very interesting. It kind of reminds me of the reasoning behind most nihilism philosophies. It's fun to think about because you could apply that logic to anything, thus making all discovery irrelevant, as someone else will get it eventually. But this leads to less motivation to move forward as a society, so nobel prizes do have relevance cause that dude discovered it first, putting society forward just a little faster. Or, someone could just say Fritz is a good person because millions are less than billions lol. Anyways, this seems like it could have been a big debate between philosophers and scientists 100 years ago lol."
"Not trying to dispute your point, but Einstein didn't create nukes."

"i don't know, his wife's letter to her friend made me think she helped him a lot on his project, but let him have all the glory. since she was a chemist too, but back in the day, a woman's discoveries wouldn't have been taken as seriously. that's why she killed herself, because a project of love was turned into a weapon."
wtf why is the video trying to get people to pay for trees to take co2 out of the atmosphere? greedy
"I think it would be (would have been) worthwhile mentioning that the Birkeland-Eyde process, the electrolysis of air and water to produce nitric acid for fertiliser, was industrialised in Norway circa 1904, preceded the Haber's discovery by a five years, and has interesting tie-ins not only with with Haber and Bosch but also with heavy water, nuclear weapons research and a very cool WWII resistance sabotage story."

"Seems like a great scientist who was just on the wrong side of history. I find it highly questionable to blame him for the execution style of most of the holocaust especially given his disillusionment with the state after the power grab of the nazi party. Whilst chemical warfare is terrible, we must remember that it already existed, the addition he brought was in its effectiveness. Lastly saying he's irrelevant because somebody else would have invented the things he did is an outrageous comment which just belittles any and all inventors, as going from that logic everything mankind has invented is just part of our natural evolution verses testament towards our creativity in finding solutions to problems through individual brilliance."
Or is he the cause of the unprecedented population boom?
Well we can put him with on the list of all inventors whose inventions were misused by so many. Ballons lead to blimps bombings in WW1. Fireworks to gunpowder.

"@Maria Manson Everybody knows of Haber, but no one thinks highly of him as a person. He's treated as a warning for letting science and patriotism come before ethics.

Very good video! Congratulations and thank you!
"19:05, Not true. In 1945 the US said ALL camps had and used gas chambers to kill prisoners. Then it was proved that ALL camps in the now Western controlled non-Soviet area did not do this, that all the ""showers"" could not carry Zyklon-B gas. The British tested dead prisoners and none were killed from gassing. Only the unobtainable Soviet controlled camps that could not be investigated became the only ""death camps.""  Zyklon-B was used to kill lice from bedding and clothes so the prisoners wouldn't get typhus because they were slave labor."
He allowed the human species to breed at unprecedented rates causing unfathomable man made destruction as an externality. He's a monster no matter how you slice it the gas was him trying to fix his mistake.

Fantastic video!
"You said ""Incan farmers"", turns out the name INCA was given only to ""royalty"", it was the emperor's title and also for one of his children (the future ruler). One more thing, you said that in  4:09  while you were showing an image of a Maya´s pyramid... (I am not sure if it is Maya or Azteca), not ancient Peruvian structures to storage food, for example Wiñay Wayna, Choquequirao, Ollantaytambo (also a fortress), but luckely you showed Machu Picchu. Ollantaytambo is one of the main places for corn or food storages named Qolqas, another one is in Raqch. There are different Qolqas in Peru.  
Thanks for the video, it was really good.
Disculpa por haber puesto algunas cosas en claro."
"it puzzled me when they showed Mayan ruins when they started talking about the Incas, they aren't even from the same continent 😅"
"Modern agriculture is the most destructive thing that humans do to the planet.   Synthetic Fertilizers play the majority role in this. Add to this the fact that synthetic fertilizer is volatile and prone to explode.  Not to mention the guy who invented it went on to create chemical weapons for the Nazis using the same base materials.  Despite all this, somehow, slipped into this video is this, and I quote: “there’s a good chance you owe your life to Haber’s invention” 10:30 (fertilizer)  by the same logic, China should be held accountable for every death by firearm because they invented gunpowder."

A very interesting fact you brought up was that Zyclon B was an insecticide.   Could it have been used in fumigation chambers to get rid of fleas and lice that carried typhus.   Maybe you could do a video explaining how this product was able to kill humans so quickly.
"@Darthplagueis13 Okay great, all good information.  But what I am hearing is that people were eating the insecticide by perhaps picking it up off the floor or catching it in their mouths somehow.   And when you say "" we have testimony"" are you referring to the people who were tortured in captivity to extract such information.  Now I am really confused.   Please enlighten me more.  My research suggests that the insecticide in question had to be heated in a machine to a certain temperature and  then mechanically distributed using a powered fan to be effective.  Also, bedding and mattresses were  treated from what I have read and not just clothing as you are indicating .  So you could use more if that were the case.  Would you not agree?"
"Well... the active component in it was cyanide. You know, the toxin commonly associated with suicide pills carried by spies because it is so efficient at quickly ending a human life by inhibiting the cells ability to produce ATP which is used as an energy carrier by the body.

As an insecticide it was useful because you could essentially cover an entire field in it without needing very much because you could finely disperse it and even in that low concentration it was still so dangerous to humans that they added an additional scent so people would not accidentially inhale it. In fact, it might interest you that it is technically better at killing humans (and other warm-blooded vertebrates) than it is at killing insects. You need a dose that is 22 times higher relative to body weight to kill an insect than you do to kill a human with it.

It's extremely toxic and you absolutely could not delouse a person using it without poisoning the person.

That aside, because I am slightly worried that you are trying to pander a common holocaust denial theory, I'd like to point out that we have testimony from the people performing those executions and that the Concentration Camps also imported significantly more Zyklon-B that would be reasonably required even if they deloused every single piece of clothing on site on a regular basis with it."
"20:38 
First of all.. i am really tired rightnow so i am sorry for my not so good english and for maybe not such a good explanation but pls TRY to understand my point.

Some months ago I thought about this topic really long and it made my brain hurt. Because no matter what you think about there seems to be no solution.
But i think there is a way to atleast influence the mind thinking and behavior of the people. I heard it once in a tv show so i am not sure if it is 100% sientificly proofen. However from our own experience and some logical thinking this makes quite sense. 
Somebody is most influenceable in his first years around 3-10 years. In this time the human is developing the most especially the brain. This is the time the basics of somebody is created. Special behaviors, basic concepts of the world, and other stuff which they learned. This is also the reason why it is more easy to learn stuff when you are young. For sure you can still learn stuff however if you start a new hobby now or try to learn complicated math without ever touching it before you will never be able to learn it. I think that this is something extreamly underrated in our todays world. I think that this is the time which influences if your kid will be successful one day (successful could also mean to be happy or to build up something or to reach his oen goals) or if it will be sad or crazy and thinks he is sonething better than other people so they shouldnt live (for example hitler killing many jewish people). If in this time 3-10 kids getting influenced the right way and being taught that you should respect everything and everybody you reduce the risk of bad people on this world. I know it is not that easy and the discussion about what is bad what is good and the border between these two things is small but at least it is step in the right way.."

Perhaps if we could get our act together as a species and stop warring and consuming everything around us, we could achieve an equilibrium with the world as populated as it is, however we're currently on an undeniable trajectory towards our own destruction. Climate change is no joke and we're just starting to see it."

"Well, it's known as a Haber-Bosch process with contributions from the honorable Henry Louis Le Chatelier. To oversimplify this and make it about one man is literally the same as forgetting everyone else involved.

It is quite something to see something that has saved so many lives but it wasn't a one man show. We have to give our respect to all parties involved."

"This is a great video and excellent summary of the dilemma of science! One aspect I am missing, though, is that of the pollution of waters caused by excessive application of nitrate fertilizers. I live in Germany (actually only ~10km away from the BASF plant mentioned) and go fishing in the river Rhine which flows by here. I eat what I catch and thus care about the water quality. The EU has drastically reduced limits for nitrate fertilizers and farmers, especially in the Netherlands, are currently going bonkers about it for fear of less profit. But I am convinced it is the right thing to do to prevent further harm to the planet. I work in the agricultural industry and I know that technology can help keep yields high while reducing the application of fertilizers and pesticides. Maybe a topic for another video. Thanks, keep up the spirit!"

all science has been funded in some way by war or the fear of war.   scientists are problem solvers and discoverers not implementers Fritz solved key problems to save and kill people because he thought in both outcomes less lives would be lost. I would also argue he had no part in the holocaust because he isn't responsible for the implementation of it especially as he was already dead.

"12:00 Q: What nitrogen becomes in such a case it is used as an explosive? Does it re-enter the condensation cycle like it would during thunderstorm, or does it transform into something of lesser quality?"
Got my answer right away on video timeline x)
"Your presentations are always of the highest quality. True science happens after critique, review, and refinement in many iterations. As a critique, I ask you to review invocation of “moral” language such as “bad” or “good.” Discovery is amoral. Application of discovery by free moral agents is bad or good or both as you aptly state. But, an “is” cannot produce an “ought.” To invoke morality without defining how we know it leads to confusion, corruption, and guileful reasoning. Still, keep up the good work!"
"​@Mike Stone  Thank you for that reply. My view wholly comports with yours. Perhaps we, at a minimum, start by training scientists in metaphysics and philosophy. My earlier point, though, on morality, is, that invoking morality begs the question, ""Are there objective moral values and duties and from where do they come?"" The stance I take when, espoused, would see me summarily dismissed from the discourse, as Lee Duke has mentioned in another reply. Nevertheless, after decades of searching, the answer to the question above is the God of the Bible. But He is not admitted to the forum of modernity, or that other self-destructing forum: postmodernity. ""The reverence of YHWH is the beginning of wisdom."""
But that would be an insult to the Universalist ideology. It is difficult to be platformed if you don't pander to the dominant ideological group.
"Thing is that this notion has been misused in science too often. Scientists have used it to justify their research and even their methods. On the other hand, people like Einstein have taken a moral stance and refrained from letting themselves get involved, even if they would see some justification in the goal. Keeping morals in the equation from the beginning might be the only thing to keep us all alive one day. I think that's at least a thought worth discussing."

Hello why don't we just use urine ? It's ammonia  and full of nitrogen
@Dal Haw high in the sense that ammonia is very damaging for living plants in very small quantities but when used in fertiliser it needs to be much higher concentration
@LivelyOsprey it has so much that why when a dog or a cat pees on something  it dies it has very high concentration
@LivelyOsprey look it up
such low amounts
"How do we increase science without destroying ourselves? Remove the incentive for war and development of weapons. Wars are mainly fought for imperial gains, so if we managed to end imperialism we could halt the development of weapons and instead focus on useful technologies.




I propose socialism as in democratically (by the People) and centrally (the whole at the same time) planned economy with no pressures from the rich who make big money from weapon production or their use. Most people would be opposed to war and so, with no reason to invade or fear invasion we wouldn't develop weapons and the problem would be solved. That's our best bet."
Thank you.

Stop claiming the Immune System doesn't exist, so when a foreign attack is being created by your own cell lines to protect from a certain COOF, your Immune System somehow DOESN'T start attacking your cardiovascular system that's producing it... Apparently. According to the opposite of 200 years of science. So many simple things."
"Look to the work of Dr. Stanley Milgram, whose life was dedicated to discovering and implementing a “social immunity” to the tools used by both the Nazis and their modern counterparts globally.

Currently, fascists have had control of global states for decades and they are still advancing on the global front.

This is most easily seen with reference to the handling of our current pandemics; COVID variants and monkey pox—with many other diseases waiting.

Very few countries took action as soon as the threat was evident—the kinds of actions which we have known for centuries stop plagued.

"As for your sponsor... Have you really thought this through? Absorbing CO2 in the middle of a forrest is not the brightest idea. Those plants need CO2 to grow and produce their food. Trees are about the best way to sequester CO2 ever invented. Oh yeah, we didn't invent trees, they just exist.
Please do try to come up with something better."
"Its quiet sad that every great scientist or inventor that studied or lectured got his tribute at the University of Karlsruhe, but Haber did not.

Understandable but sad"

I agree!
"I have a theory about your next video.  This theory originates from a thought that has been in my head for a long time, but since I don't have the means to test it, I ask you to do it.  It's been a while since I feel that everything I see or every video I see from you is as if I already know what I'm going to learn, and I'm reminded just by seeing them, and my theory is that man knows all the sciences.  It has its own mind since birth and there is no such thing as learning, but only a reminder that it exists.  A small example: in all matters of life, a person knows well which is the right decision and which is the wrong decision.  Even when you have a four-choice exam. Like me, who passed many exams with high scores without any study.  The only problem is that we are the ones who decide whether to choose the right or wrong way"
"Saying he's irrelevant because someone else would have done it is a common falacy that you shouldn't be falling for. You have to give people their dues. Someone else would have come up with relativity if Einstein didn't do it. Someone else would hae invented the telephone if Bell didn't do it, but they did do it and Haber did this. You have to credit him with the good and the bad. To say he's bad because he developed chemical weapons for the Germans is kind of wrong. He was German and wanted to help his country; that's only natural. Plenty of still highly regarded scientists worked on the Manhattan Project which is probably the most despicable scientific project ever undertaken, so you can't take credit from Haber because he worked on some chemical weapons."
"Max Plank tried to obtain a role for him in the nazis army talking with Hitler in 1933, but the furher refused and Haber had to migrate. This could have been a video about a nazi war criminal that made an important discovery before becoming a butcher. Historical relativism."

"This is why it is especially crucial to teach ethics to scientists! Not as a single course at some point during their degrees, but several compounding courses throughout. It needs to be engrained in us!"
"Thank you for the bit at the end. I was thinking it at the beginning, and every time someone like Haber is brought up. It's so stupid to think that discovering something true about the universe is good or bad. It's even stupider to think that discovering something true about the universe FIRST is good or bad. It's even stupider when that thing was discovered by other people FIRST, and you're mad/glad/morally judging the person who wasn't first, but happened to be first in recorded history.

If what Haber did is wrong/right/good/bad, then it's equally wrong/right/good/bad for anyone (re)discover chemistry in high school.

It's just true. There is no morality about true, and there is no morality about firstness."
"@Dexter Synester (formerly Sorb Reezi) Neither observation of reality changes morality. Experiments and observations are proofs of existence and causal relationships, not morality. Faiths are irrational. Very little of any faith's mythology is ""there for a reason"", other than the obvious reason that a human put it there. Other faiths believe other wrong/fantastical things. Are you defending all faith-based mythologies as reasoned, or just knowledge as original sin? There's no sense in your comment. Faiths are blind. Things exist whether any person knows they exist or not. Knowledge can't change morality. Things either exist or don't. Things don't have morality. People do."

"I didn't realize at first that Fritz Haber is the same Haber who created the 'Haber's process', the same reaction that i had learnt just last year in class, and which i was coincidentally literally just studying, for my exam next week. 
I never knew there was such an interesting and deep backstory to the Haber's process and Fritz Haber himself and his enormous impact on the world, especially to someone who is interested in history and science like me. It makes me look at all those reactions i had to memorize all these years in a whole new light, that all those reactions i have been having to memorize for the past 2 years probably had fascinating backstories to them as well, and probably changed the world in many ways. 
How many of those names had similarly fascinating and tragic stories to them. 

I wish they taught us in class with half the enthusiasm derek does. 
A shame that in the education system in my country, Chemistry has been reduced down to a mindless list of formulas and reactions in our chemistry textbook and curriculum. Something to be feared and dreaded in the exam. Something that is a struggle and burden more than anything. 
Reduced to nothing more than An abstract metric, a number on a sheet of paper, a scorecard, or a percentile benchmark. 

Shame i never got to learn the true meaning and depth of the subjects i was learning. i do wish they taught with the same depth and understanding that derek imparts to us."

"Pick up your cross and follow Jesus! The world is quickly headed for destruction, and sooner or later you will have to sit at the judgement seat and give an account for your actions.

Call on the name of Jesus and pray for Him to intervene in your life! - Revelation 3:20. 

Contemplate how the Roman Empire fulfilled the role of the beast from the sea in Revelation 13. Revelation 17 confirms that it is in fact Rome. From this we can conclude that A) Jesus is the Son of God and can predict the future or make it happen, B) The world leaders/nations/governments etc have been conspiring together for the last 3000+ years going back to Babylon and before, C) History as we know it is fake. You don't really need to speculate once you start a relationship with God tho.

If there was a better way of keeping peace that could be proved without having to try it out then it would be interesting to hear that.  But history has told us one thing Marxist communism and social engineering by academics and politicians lead to one outcome. Genocide of the people they control because when things go wrong they protect themselves by destroying the people that they control.  100 million people in the last century died because of communism and Marxism.

"""More than anyone, he has shaped the world today""

No, at best, he's #2

The Medici Pope Leo X wins #1 hands down... First off, he and his family were major backers of the scientific and artistic development of the Renaissance. This is indisputably one of the most significant foundational components of the world today.

Second, the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church under him got so markedly significant that it spurred Martin Luther and created the entire Protestant movement. And many key wars of the last 500 years, prior to the 20th century, were religious in nature, between Protestant and Catholic.

So -- while Haber was critically significant to at least one factor of modern civ, Leo X was central to not less than two, at a much earlier time. His actions have thus had centuries of effect."

At the beginning you get an intro and the main point of what the video is about, bringing up the nobel prize controversy so the viewer wonders why, develops interest and keeps watching.

Definitely less dry than just from start to end."

@Innocence the observation us accurate. This story was not at all explained chronologically.

"19:18 'This gas - Zyklon B - was then used to perpetrate the holocaust'.

This needs some nuance. Yes, Zyklon B was used in Auschwitz and Majdanek, and yes, Auschwitz was the largest death camp of the nazi's killing >1 million people. However, the other large scale death camps (Chełmno, Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka) they used carbonmonoxide (from exhaust fumes) to kill millions of people. Most killings were done with other means than Zyklon B. 

In other words: the invention and procuction of Zyklon B did not play an *essential* role in the holocaust. If the nazi's would have used carbonmonoxide in Auschwitz, the number of deaths would not have been considerably lower. The plan to systematically eradicate millions of men, women and children did not depend on the existence of this chemical. Millions had already died  before the nazis first introduced Zyklon B."
"Ah yes, the legendary carbon footprint back at it again. AKA ""You plebs do the dirty work while us corpos do nothing to reduce emissions, it's all your fault (despite of industries doing most of the pollution)"

If Germany had won the conflict - as the US did over Japan - perhaps that excuse would have gained credibility. Still, I am not convinced that having 3 or 4 billion extra people on Earth is such a good thing."
Poor Carl Bosch who took Fritz's idea and scaled it up deserves as much credit. So many ideas stay stuck in the lab because they don't scale up. You could mention legumes that don't need nitrogen fertilizer and make cover crops (green manure) that farmers plow into the soil early spring before their planting their primary crop. Nitrogenase could also be mentioned as a great candidate for biomimicry as it converts N2 into NH3 at ambient conditions. This video is so relevant to what's going on today in Sri Lanka and Holland to name a few places. Many scientists are pointing to legumes as the salvation to feed the masses during fertilizer shortages due to the Russian-Ukrainian war as well as fertilizers currently being cost-prohibitive to produce and buy by farmers all around the world.

Fritz Harbour
Hey insanely good video
Its sad to know that our school system fails to educate us about how things were actually invented and fails to educate us of the BIGGER PICTURE. When my teacher was teaching about the Haber-Bosch process he mentioned how great this guys (especially Fritz Haber) were and how they helped society by discovering how to create ammonia. Because I had watched the documentary series about Albert Einstein and they were very close friends I told my teacher Haber was the inventor of a chemical weapon ( using chlorine) and he was suprised to know that this guy also killed thousands or millions during the World Wars and was considered the Father of chemical warfare. This video is perfect by showing the contrasts of this discovery and the reality we live in today with the big technological advancements that have their downsides too.

Of course I hope not, but with thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and more tripwires to set them off being created every year, how could we possibly prevent an accident or misunderstanding that leads to all out war? And if you consider some of the leaders of the countries that have nukes, our chances appear slim to avoid annihilation."
Due to its global relevance ammonia production would have been discovered either way. Chemical weapons during WWII of this nature hinges in large part on this one person. He is disgusting and hopefully rotting in hell.

But no no no, it's fine, use ideology and a new doomsday cult to oppress people by removing cheap energy for the poor, limiting farmers productive capability....

@bobshenix Yes.  Objectivity.  Certainly several top physicists were involved with building the Abomb and later the H Bomb.  They bear the moral responsibility for their actions.  The fact that others would have taken their place does not excuse them.
"Every country has scientists working with the military. Hell, Einstein helped ensure atomic bombs would be dropped on Japan and kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people. In a political sense, he was doing the bidding of the ""good guys"" but ultimately it all boils down to a battle of competing interests and it could just as easily be stated that Einstein was a monster for his role in the atomic bomb. A little objectivity is all it takes."

"Eh... Humans triggered an extinction event 10,000 years ago.  By killing too many key species off.  Or forcing species to fight against others for food.  Or whatever else.  There are innumerable reasons why.  However humans doomed all life to cycling down to extinction except maybe water microbes.  Like the Earth has done at least 4 times before.  

I hope the next sentient species, if there is another.  Since Earth is almost out of the life window, like Mars was and it took a long time to create us.

"I really can't agree with Derek considering Haber irrelevant 'to the larger story' only because some other guy could have done what he actually did. How would we feel applying this same logic to Newton, Einstein, Turing or Wittgenstein's contributions to scientific progress? Would we conclude that they were irrelevant as well?  Ok, the Scientists I quoted made Discoveries while the Haber-Bosch process is an Invention (which is something easier to achieve...) but anyway Haber was the one who both condensed Nitrogen from the atmosphere and synthesized deadly gases. Which puts him in a kind of 'moral superposition'...  Einstein, if I'm not wrong, in the end forgave him and the two of them reconciled... Truth is that the the most appropriate thing about this matter was written by Theodor Adorno: he stated (in 'Minima Moralia') that applying mass production to killing made previous (classical) moral tenets outdated and ineffective. And that we therefore need new ones. And this is what his book is about..."

Last question: Ethics
"The Nazis imprisoned the Ashkenazi in work camps.  The Americans imprisoned the Japanese, German, and Italian Americans for the same reason... a perceived internal threat.  In neither case were they death camps.   A main death camp was at Rhine meadow, and that was run by the Americans.  No crematoriums or poison gas needed.   Death by starvation and burial by bulldozer.   If the Germans really ran death camps, the Americans made them look like MORONS."

Second: Just another Nazi doctor that likes to kill people. I hope he is one of the ones that was put to death following the Nuremberg Trials, and The Nuremberg Code that followed. Speaking of that there are a lot of doctors and scientists that have been doing things the past couple of years that goes against same code. They deserve to be put trial as well.

"Really good video . Just a subscribed to your channel. Watched one video of yours and I had a doubt about your why no one can measure speed of light video. I had an idea like we could put 2 clocks at some distance from each other and program them to start exactly at 12:00 clock . Then exactly when its 12 clock we can send the beam of light and the clocks on both ends will start and then we can measure the time taken by light to reach the other end, hence calculating the one way speed of light"
me thinking....why dont they just karate chop the atoms😁
"Another really tragic WW2 postscript to this story is that not only was Haber's assistant , Otto Hahn, a committed pacifist (at least after seeing and protesting the development of chlorine gas), he went on to be the first person to conduct nuclear fission. He was incredibly depressed upon hearing of the nuclear bombings."

If an asteroid couldnt destroy the planet then neither can we.
"This is just my opinion but he isnt the one thats irrelevant. Hes the most relevant of all of this because hes the one who has figured it out. 

Whats irrelevant is that other scientists are developing chemical weapons.

Its he that did it all. He chose to pursue chemical weapons instead of just doing the good that he did with fertilizers. If he believed that the war ending sooner would save more lives, he shouldve at least reconsidered given what that war stood for. He wanted less lives to be wasted but also enabled it. The effect of his good deeds outweigh the bad but goddamn is developing chemical weapons such a heavy mistake."

Until then, only lightning and bacteria fixed all the nitrogen available to life on the planet- like a governor on a motor keeping it from destroying itself. Now, human N fixation is over double all natural processes. We lack the wisdom and foresight to have grown so quickly, it will be our downfall. So, arguably, Haber never did anything good."

"Fritz Haber did what he felt was best. From our point of view today he seems like an evil mastermind, but our view is as subjective as his. 
It is a bitter sweet tale, but scientific discovery isn't something we have control of. We would all like to uninvent nuclear weapons, but the science behind them is useful and could be more useful in the future. 
However the apparent lack of intelligent life in the universe suggests scientific discoveries ultimately lead to extinction. 
There's a cheerful thought!"
So we should still be living in the stone ages because technology also produces weapons?
"The only way to have science only used for good is to only create good people.  Unfortunately, we are mostly producing propaganda slaves, and governments are destroying ""good"" in favor of ""controlled"".
Greedy governments and big tech are creating our new generation - ""goodness"" will not come from this.
Science will be used accordingly - it's a tool.

"The illustrations are so good, it's like watching a movie."
"I am sorry for the nitpick, but catalysts don't reduce the amount of energy needed for a chemical reaction. It just reduces the time needed to establish an equilibrium.

Since these videos are usually very precise and well-researched, I don't mind such a detail.

Even as a chemistry student, I learned a lot in this video. Also, I am a little jealous of your molecule model kit."
"They do reduce the activation energy of reactions, which is directly equivalent to reducing the time required to establish equilibrium. In the case of the Haber-Bosch process, the equilibrium is majority ammonia, but the time to reach that at normal atmospheric pressure and temperature without the catalyst is probably something like billions of years."
"I don't think Haber actually saved billions. Sure he was the first one to invent the process, but I have no doubts that someone else would've come up with a solution in time.

If you find a cure for cancer today, you don't really save all cancer potions from now until eternity, you only really saved the ones between now and the time someone else would find a cure if you hadn't found one."

Great video. Thanks man .
Best presentation ever
Thank you to e-penser that inspire this vidéo.
Funny this comes out right when he Canadian (Trudeau) government is trying to destroy/starve it's people by removing so much of farmers right/ability to use nitrogen.
All about collective choices
"The reality is that good or bad are our own perspectives and technology made us more comfortable and secure (happier?) but it is actually a death trap. It is only because of technology that things like climate change can exist, problems which threaten life on earth and they are going to increase, the more we rely on technology and the more complex it gets untill we are going to go extinct without knowing why."
"Also, a different note: If by using the Fritz Haber method we remove Nitrorgen from the atmosphere, doesn't that mean it's also a large reason for climate change? I mean, obviously if we remove the Nitrogen, the ratio of other gases will increase, right? It's simple math."
"@Shany Topper The concentration of nitrogen commonly referred to is known as ""fractional concentration"" i.e. the ratio between the number of nitrogen gas molecules and total number of gas molecules (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide etc.) in a given volume and atmospheric pressure.

Greenhouse effect (the mechanism of climate change) is caused by an increase in the number of greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere; the increased concentration is the effect but not the cause. As long as the number of greenhouse gas molecules in the air remains the same, the change in nitrogen gas concentration relative to the air would not affect climate change.

By the way, nitrogen gas is returned to the atmosphere by denitrifying bacteria which turns nitrates into gaseous nitrogen."
"@Len but it's the same thing. If you had (lets just throw random numbers here) 78% percent nitrogen, and now you have 77%, it makes all the other gases more concentrated. This includes co2 and othe greenhouse gases."
It is not the ratio but the amount (concentration) of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that causes climate change.

"Damn! There's so much of this and more on the internet! But one thing is for sure, we will never be able to undo what we've done. Coz the people profiting from it will never let it happen! Everything from the air we breath to the food we eat to our genetic structure and any and everything in between has been lost to greed, the planet is almost ruined and trying to survive and fight back with what we call natural calamities. The only ray of hope in all this chaos is us - the people. Care for each other, treat each other well. That's all there's left to do. Unless not....


Also carbon emission is not even a thing that people need to be worried and bothered with. It's INDUSTRY that needs to worry about it and work on it, they've just shifted the blame and responsibility on the people so they can avoid the blame and responsibility themselves and  completely and only focus on making profits. Especially the oil and gas industry. Same with the plastic recycling industry."

"One huge problem with the process of producing nitrogen out of the air is it`s energy cost. It`s a very unsustainable way of producing the nitrogen we need to feed our plants. The video completely let`s us think that this chemical process is the only way to feed the world, which is more than false. The only sustainable way of growing healthy food in the amounts we need is through understanding how soil works and how we can improve it`s fertility without the need of chemical fertilizers. And cover crops are VERY capable of producing all the nitrogen we need, simply through growing. And they also provide other nutrients to the soil, that make nutrient dense, healthy food. Healthy soil also tremendously reduces the need for pesticides. I would love to see a video on this channel about regenerative agriculture and permaculture as systems, that provide all we need to feed ourselfs sustainably."

"There is one issue that most people fail to understand. You didn't simply refuse the Kaiser, particularly if you were a Jew...
My grandfather's father was an industrial pharmaceutical chemist who worked for a German/ American Firm and was in Germany when the war broke out. He was also a Hasidic Jew with a wife and children. So he helped engineer the mass production of Phosgene because he couldn't take care of his family while freezing to death in an unheated prison cell...
Because of this, my grandfather's father, wife and children were banned from the US, and from working in his field outside of Germany and as a Jew was essentially banned from professional work. Using forged documents & a new last name, he managed to get his family into the US just in time to avoid the Third Reich unlike most of the family. He spent the rest of his life as a poor tobacco farmer producing the leaves that cigars are rolled in...
My grandfather married a Métis Nurse, which resulted him being cut of from his family as his children would not be considered Jews as my grandmother's mother's mother was a full blood Native American. His parents had already disowned him for walking away from their faith, but this resulted in most of his family stopping speaking to him. My grandparents adopted my mother, the result of a fifteen year old residential boarding school student being raped by a white man. So yes, my mother is mixed First Nations / European...
My grandfather volunteered for the US Army once the US entered WWII and was a field surgeon in a front line field hospital. So he had to euthanize about a third of his patients during the war, as they couldn't or should try to save them, something that haunted him. After his field hospital was involved in their second concentration camp liberation, he wrote the medical protocalls for treating the survivors. Because he spoke fluent German and French, my grandfather like a lot of German Jews acted as an interpreter for the Army, which is when the US Government learned that his family was in the US without legitimate paperwork, but it took no action....
After the war, my grandfather delivered over ten thousand healthy children over his career, in addition to the deliveries in Europe he performed during and immediately after the war. A few tools for performing Cesarean Sections that were designed by my grandfather are still used today. Instead of patenting them he made them public domain. You could say that he spent his life making up for the sins of his father, who had no choice during WWI, and for having to kill some of his own patients during WWII, as he had no choice...."

"Thank you for that last bit. Salk was a hero. Mengele was a devil. Haber was ... both? No, no, and no. All three were people with strengths and weaknesses who did good things and bad things.

We spend too much time debating whether various people are heros or devils, too much time arguing who is the best role model. Teach the act, not the person."

"I wish schools would focus on more scientific history, it'd really get people truly interested in science and show people the mistakes we made in the past and how we should avoid them in the future.

bad boi Fritz Haber
"Good and evil are subjective and that's why intent can matter. You can kill someone by trying to save them and you can save someone by trying to kill them. There's very few people that do things without reason. People kill for religion, people can kill someone because someone lied to them and someone could kill simply because another person ate their left over dinner. All are reasons However few are good reasons at least to our perspective. There's very few deranged people that kill strangers for no reason at all but these people usually have something wrong with them and most people would agree that they can't be held accountable for their own actions. People are too complex to be good or evil. A smart doctor can still be a rapist an excellent teacher can still be a theif the best therapist can still be an addict, a police hero can still be racist. How much good actions does one have to do for people to forget about the bad. In this day and age 1 bad action out weighs all the good one can possibly do in their lifetime which is an incorrect way of thinking. Your 1 bad action makes you a bad person no matter how much good you do, this is why there's cancel culture."

"At the end of the day, it's the people that have the ego and greed which leads to the intention of whether to save humanity or make it worse.

Science and tools are the accelerators of this behavior. We're making our sword sharper at a rapid scale.

Of course, those tools could also be the cause of the issue if the morale of society and policy hasn't kept up with technological growth.

In this story, I put Haber on the villain's side at the end. Because when he was inventing the process of creating ammonia, he was on the mission to be the one that solves a century old of scientists' problem.

But because of the war, he saw the opportunity to make use of that ammonia as a chemical weapon. He was aware and conscious of his decision, while he could just decide to not be involved in the war.

But the real point is, that until someone like Haber comes along with all his (family harming) dedication to his scientific project, discoveries would happen way later if they happen at all, if all people would think along the line of ""Someone else will figure it out if i dont."" If you really want to make progress in a very difficult task, you need to put everything you are into it. that means something else will come too short. either your own health and happiness, or your family. If there are no people willing to sacrifice those, than advancement of the last century would have crawled in a snails speed."
"@arcguardian yes, but i don’t think you could balance family with researching and developping something major on a worldchanging potential. That does not mean you have to abstain family, just to find someone accepting and fine with the very little time you can spare."
"@Ric Walker my point is, it's probably worthwhile to balance it out, or don't start a family."
"@arcguardian i agree! i hate such people too that say ""do x or else!""

the point i meant is to not discourage people from making the decision to put their passion project first and family second.
If you come to the decision that your goal is worth sacrificing other things along the way, than thats up to you and no one has the right to tell you otherwise. its your life and you alone decide who or what stays how long in your life and of what you are unwilling to part from no matter what."
"@Alejandro Tuazon No. Yes, the partner might be a factor contributing to the suicide. But at the end of a day its the person who comitts suicide that is stupid and weak. And before you call me heartless: I had both in my life. People that left me that way, that i dearly miss and i was myself so deep down, that i considered it in earnest. But i figured out that there is always a way to endure through misery or to walk away and begin somewhere else anew. Life has so many to give. there are very rare instances where i do agree that to comitt suicide would be a mercy. But everyone else? Endure through the hard time or flee to somewhere where what gave you trouble does not matter. If you cant find a way to pull through or find something else to live, than you are simply weak. especially if its so blatantly in your eyes like in Mrs. Haber's situation: a 12 year old son!

Am i okay with people harmed in an experiment? Absolutely no! Such things happen in pharmacy and i hate such soulless bsdrds with a passion.


Dont marry a person thats needs to put great parts of his time into his work if you cant accept to be always 2nd place."
@Ric Walker how many other scientists lead their wife and child to commit suicide? Is that a price for science?
Your question at the end is the answer to the Fermi paradox.
"Hi Derek, small correction. The explosion has little to do with the energy released when the molecule breaks. It's more a consequence that gas takes thousand times more volume then solids."
@Mike s Yes but this energy comes from expansion of the gas (low anthropy towards high entropy) not the binding between the molecules. It's basically like opening a gas bottle. The gas expands/explodes as long es can get enough energy from the surrounding. And yes the whole reaction is highly exothermic but that's not the reason for the main explosion.
you just explained a release of energy due to that expansion.. :/
"If your country is in war and your country people start attacking the enemy, then there is no problem. If USA, Russia,UK,kill nazis because of their nation security then there is no problem, but a person made bombs and poisonous gases then there is a problem. What type of double standard it is. USA has done more worse in Vietnam. For example agent Orange, sufferers descendants are still born with genetic disability"

Dude where can I get those Atom models from?
"First, the statement ""...more frequent and severe heat waves..."" is not true.  Several recent studies have shown that there were heat waves in the 1920s and 1970s that were similar to what we have been experiencing the last couple of years.  Hmmm, could there be a 50 year cycle here that nobody noticed?

Second, this story illustrates how mankind has always managed to create and innovate when people were predicting doom around the corner.  Climate change is already here.  Sea levels are going to rise a few inches.  Weather patterns are going to change.  Wine grapes formerly grown in southern France will now be grown in northern England.  For decades people have flocked to the south.  As temps rise and water becomes in shorter supply, people will move back north.  The middle of the USA has very low population density and much of central Canada is virtually empty.

Third, there is a crisis coming not in decades but in months.  We are about to experience a shortage of urea.  The USA is one of the top importers of urea and Russia is the largest exporter.  Russia has said it is going to stop exporting.  Urea is used to make two important things, fertilizer for crops and diesel exhaust fluid (DEF).  All diesel engines made after 2010 are required to use DEF to reduce particulate emissions.  The will not run properly without it.

So, no urea means shortage of fertilizer to grow food and a shortage of DEF for the farm tractors and combines and trucks that convey the food to market.  Add in a shortage of diesel fuel and we could be looking at huge food shortage in the next 6 to 12 months, maybe sooner."

"Great video, hadn't realised the whole tragedy behind Fritz Haber. However I was surprised and disappointed to see no mention of Carl Bosch. Everyone forgets the Chemical Engineer! Without Bosch the process would have stayed benchtop scale, as he was key to developing the requirements for upscaling to industrial quantities, including better catalysts than osmium (iron based) that help make it more profitable and practical for scale up, and the general process equipment for coping with the high temperatures and pressures."
"Exactly. In school and university the process was always called the ""Haber-Bosch-Verfahren"" (""Haber-Bosch process"") and not only ""Haber-Verfahren""."
I have wondered how the earth’s population grew from 2 billion to 8 billion in my lifetime🇨🇦. Thanks for the video
Achievement unlock: your a muderer? Or maybe not...
why is Einstein a passivist when he help with the atomic bomb
"Nitrogen is only harvested out of the soil using unsustainable industrial processes. Soil mineral health and the bacteria that break down nitrogen for plant use can be maintained with regenerative agricultural practices. Things like no tillage, use of cover crops, polycultures instead of monoculture, integration of farm animals etc. Love the channel but this is a dangerous assumption that establishes the basis for this story. Worth looking into! Search for the book ""Call of The Read Warbler"" by Charles Massey for anyone interested."
Germans made for war
"I already knew what he did when I saw his last name, haber

"I never heard of ""Osmium"", but I suspect that the name of the german lightbulb company ""Osram"" must be a fusion of ""Osmium"" and ""Wolfram""(i.e. tungsten). Checked it... its true! Yeaaah!"
"As mentioned ammonium nitrate is a fertilizer and an explosive.  But, even explosives are used to make our lives better in so many ways that outweigh the bad.  Explosives are routinely used in mining and construction."
Nice video

"Excellent storytelling as always, thank you so much! I can't help but wondering, why in the world this story is not in primary school curriculum. It contains so many valuable lessons."
"While I admire the sponsor, shouldn't we as individuals be better spending our time forcing the 100-200 companies responsible for over 90% of our emissions to be more sustainable?"
It feels like so many discoveries simultaneously make the world better and scarier
"Nice video, great storytelling."
Just like Ford. There no good thing come without equally bad thing. Bad thing come with equally good thing. There a fundamental law irrelevant to human ethical subjectivity. And equilibrium neutrality inherently universal and fundamental. Human have no interference power in these law. That what make the universal higher law than the subjective existence

"Science itself  is neither good nor evil. It is just the ability to change the world, due to the knowledge about how it works. Basically the one thing that really sets us apart from other animals. It can be used for good or evil. It made us humans conquer the world. We got very far with it. But we are now approaching a time where devices become accessible that enable single individuals to change the world. It may be AI, it may be a perfectly engineered pathogen or a nuclear detonation device the size of a suitcase. It might be the natural end to a technological civilisation. The great filter."

Osmium. The only element named after a family music group.
"The only thing you lost me on was your final message, that he was 'irrelevant to the greater story.' *We* are the greater story, collectively, our race, with all its strengths and faults. Fritz wasn't a hero, nor was he a villain. He was *human.* One of many influential people who, if we think history deserves a record, deserves their place, if not only for their impact. Not only this, but before we give judgement on people like Fritz, maybe we should judge ourselves, too.

We're not perfect, nor better, despite how we may try to convince ourselves; where most of us differ from Fritz is not in our principles, but our ability to act on them. He was a gifted scientist, who could make great strides in his field where others struggled. He could make the change he wanted, with his ambition and grit, and for him, his goal was fueled by his national pride. I can say with certainty that many in this very comments section could, and would do horrible things, if they were as capable as Fritz. People motivated by greed, nationalism, even personal affection. They will tell you they'd 'never' do the things Fritz has done, 'never' harm people, 'never' exploit those with less agency and power. But they *would,* they simply never had the opportunity.

Offer enough money, most will kill a man to take it. Threaten their loved ones, and they'll do anything to protect them. Threaten their culture and livelihood, and they'll lay down any life necessary to preserve both. The truth is, most of us will break our principles when what we personally value is threatened; when there's something to be gained or lost, and you can't get much more desperate than a world at war. And, given how life was for post-WW1 Germans, his desperation turned out to be justified."
"The truly poetic irony in this story for me is the fact that Haber, who created the deadly yet indispensable nitrogen compounds, was awarded the Nobel Prize, created by Alfred Nobel to try and do good after inventing dynamite, which killed his own brother.

Edit: People have pointed out that the invention of dynamite was after his brother died, so I stand corrected there, but I feel like my original point still stands since dynamite was also a compound that came with great progress and simultaneous evil"

whether you make it or break it. Science is the BEST way to do it. It's Ultimately important which way you choose.
"I do not agree with the final words. Indeed every bit of information is a two-edged blade. BUT We're not talking of a scientist interested in Nitrogen here. You describe him again and again as ""Patriot"" who took ACTIVE PART in transforming chemical knowledge that was used as fertilizer, to one that blows people apart, or poisons them down, and AFTER he knew what his chlorine gas does to thousands of enemy soldiers HE CHOSE to go to the Russian front to SUPERVISE one more such attack. 
Here one can clearly identify personal responsibility for the ""other edge"" of the technological blade. Same goes, by the way, for Mr. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein who from similar considerations, started the nuclear weapon era and race. 

What I say, is that scientists DO HAVE special power to decide which edge their discoveries will serve. Not indefinitely, not completely, but they are obviously the smartest people around that could circumvent things so that these horrors won't happen, or will only happen in minimal way, or will be used to threat rather than to kill in horrible ways. 

My last word is: scientists are human like all the rest. They're evil and good, and ridiculous and noble and -- everything human. Only their deeds have such impact on their society, that society should take special care about them and what they do with their special mental muscle. 

The requirement and need to win a war is not only understandable, but also desired - survival is the first law of life. However, when you can make a CHOICE over the MEANS you will to employ, and when you set your lines somewhere on what you WOULD NOT DO, even at the price of defeat - then you become the real ""human"" thing. The animal with conscious. The Responsible animal. 

Strangely enough in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, where I studied, the chemistry institute was (and still is) named after Fritz Haber, and I passed his bald face in a little statue near the entrance hundreds of times, not knowing this story. I do not know what to think about this now. The Jewish-descent German scientist who developed the gas that killed 2/3 of our people, commemorated by the Jewish state? Hmmm. Weird."

"According to the IPCC’s own data, man-made CO2 output levels are 3% of 3% of 0.1% of the total Earth’s atmosphere. That means less than 0.0001% of the atmospheric gases is CO2 from humans.  

The only way ""scientists"" make CO2 so important is by not including water vapour. But water vapour, clouds, you can't scare people with that. You can't regulate that or tax people for clouds. But if you make a gas sound dirty and twist it's name to sound dirty, like, carbon, then you can get people scared. Fossil fuels are hydro carbons. So why not rename them hydro fuels? Why only focus on the carbon? Why? Because it makes it sounds worse and pushes a biased agenda."

"the perception of science as a force of humanity seems too optimistic. it is specific individuals that make the necessary connections in order to solve problems. perhaps fertilizer would have been invented with a different method or man, but how could you know that? it will be a man, not society, that determines the state of the art. it is much like walking up to an oil painting and uttering to yourself. ""i could have made this"", but you did not... 
in fact, it will always be the obsessive man of singular vision that achieves what many would disdain to be impossible or a fruitless effort."

"Haber embodies both the light and dark sides of obsession. If he had Einstein's wisdom and self-control, he'd likely have been considered the greatest scientist in human history."
"@LollyPopTuttu Ehh the atomic bomb ending the war is arguably considering the position that Japan was in and the fact that it surrendered a day after Russia (a country that Japan was utterly terrified of) declared war on them, and the fact that the main threats to Western Europe (Nazi Germany and Italy) were defeated rather heavy handedly by the Russians with some help from the other Allie’s (not downplaying the Allie’s effort but Russian by and large was the country that took down the Nazis through sheer brute strength but it was at the cost of a ridiculous number of civilian and military casualties). HOWEVER, I still agree with you, while you can definitely call out Harber for his actions you can’t necessarily say that he alone should have known better, when we as a race shouldn’t have let war out to begin with, at that point everything changes, and try to say who is right and who is wrong kind of loses all its meaning because war in of itself never should have happened, and if it hadn’t then Harber probably never would have gotten into chemical weapons in the first places. On a side note, one of my favorite YouTube historians, Potential history did a video on the bombing of Dresden, where he argues as to whether or not it was a justified target to bomb considering the civilian casualties, and I think his argument can with some changes, apply to a lot of scenarios whether it’s the use of the atomic bombs, or Harber creating chemical weapons, “objectively should it have happened? No, but objectively war shouldn’t happen” it’s a great video I highly suggest checking it out."
"he still thought that he was doing something good for his country, better weapons win wars and the faster you can kill your enemies the faster the war ends and peace returns, even if you can argue abut the ""humanity"" of the method. Ww2 only ended thanks to the atomic bomb, a terrible weapon, but is still mantaining peace until now since is a strong deterrent, everything is relative at the end"

"In this way if we consider Haber as a villen, we may consider auto Han and Einstein also , as they are the key scientist to invent Atom Bomb (Originally they regretted this decision very much. Auto Han or Einstein considered themselves gulity as well as Haber also  considered him guilty for killing so much man ). But the thing is this he is a true nationalist and loved his country very much, so he did what was possible to win the war. When it comes on a country everyone would do something to save their country,and if we really think deeply, we will find humanity was killed brutally from both parties, we cannot blame Germany not in first world war not in second. And let's not talk about brutally shown to India during British Raj, Hitler would have felt ashamed. I think Haber did whatever a true patriot would have done . Even Hisenberg didn't leave Germany (also refused to make atom Bomb but he was very much capable of doing that ) and tried to save his country. It's wrong in terms of morality or humanity what Haber did,but war is already above humanity and saving his nation is first priority."

"The magnetic interaction which allowed ordinary magnets to bind to each other without making contact carried the term ""bound state"" of quantum physics to classical physics (check Magnetic Bound State). At the same time it shows the potential of magnetic interactions and new theoretical possibilities. Suppose quantum magnetodynamics is the next thing and turns atomic/particle physics to chemistry in terms of capabilities. It can be seen that things based on chemistry cannot compete with things based on nuclear processes. What would be the responsibility of a scientist made from chemical elements?"

"Check out Birkeland-Eyde process. Kongsberg, water power, YARA, Kongsberg Weapon Factory. Those go hand in hand. The process was discovered when Birkeland tried to demonstrate an electric gun and nitrogen just fell out of the air. The process was commercialized to make nitrogen with help from Eyde. Said nitrogen would be used to feed the world and to destroy our ememies. Well, sort of anyway (it is an interesting tale)"
"Haber was a brilliant scientist who happened to be a citizen of a country at war and joined. There's no hero or villain per se. Unless one can prove that every american soldier or volunteer in history served in a righteous war. I regard Churchill as a horrid human being but I have to also acknowledge that he was a heroic figure for the English because he was both. The world & its history are grey, so we ought to stop viewing things in black or white."
"So amazing, more more more!"
"Either you die as a hero, or live long enough to become a villain. The uncomfortable fact that the scientist that saved us from mass starvation had used his skills to cause plenty of human death. Such irony oh so poetic."
@Slevin Channel I am not familiar with what you are talking about.
"@Fruz Makes me wonder how 'Second Thought' will be remembered 
by History. I mean, right now hes known for his epic overage 
of Workerclass-Struggles and the Failings of Capitalism."
"@Fruz  You said ""maybe we would not be living in this messed up society thinking always 'more and more and more'"" without this invention from the early 20th century.
And I’m saying that I believe our world would work the exact same way it does today, just with less food available. We would still be destroying our planet. There’s no point blaming scientist who worked for the progress of humanity. The change we experienced might have been too fast, but at this point there’s no turning back. We need inventions like these to tackle our future problems and it’s okay to give these genius people credit for what they archived."
"Agree. In the same way that other person would have invented this fertilizer... some other person would have invented Zyklon B. 

In the end, people who made history, whether they made it better or made it worse, they were only able to achieve that because there were living in the ""right"" moment and in the ""right"" circumstance. Yes, of course, they had talent and they were smart, but.. chances are, no matter how SMART you are, there will be someone who knows more or less the same things you are researching and they will eventually, maybe in just a few years, arrive in the same conclusion that you and discover the same things you did.

Information and knowledge doesn't happen in a bubble... someone else would have done it."

"Cool, your intro made me google him to find out the interesting parts in 30 seconds. Thanks

Fritz Haber (German pronunciation: [ˈfʁɪt͡s ˈhaːbɐ] (listen); 9 December 1868 – 29 January 1934) was a German[4] chemist who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918 for his invention of the Haber–Bosch process, a method used in industry to synthesize ammonia from nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas. This invention is important for the large-scale synthesis of fertilizers and explosives. It is estimated that two thirds of annual global food production uses ammonia from the Haber–Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half the world population.[5][6] Haber, along with Max Born, proposed the Born–Haber cycle as a method for evaluating the lattice energy of an ionic solid. Haber is also considered the ""father of chemical warfare"" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing chlorine and other poisonous gases during World War I, especially his actions during the Second Battle of Ypres."

Fritz more like Ritz
Science is not a complete ethic. Great video thank you so much!!!
"Ah, osmium! One of only two elements with a valence of +8! -- A promising catalyst indeed. (and the other is xenon, which is hardly useful.)"
"Just a small note : the pesticide that was invented at the Haber institute was Zyklon A, with the smelling compound
Nazis then increased its severity (pushing it from A to B on the pesticide severity scale) and removed that smelling compound to create what was used in the gas chambers.
Great video and amazing work nonetheless !"
This appears to be a bot-generated post copying a post by Karim Zermaini
"Impressive, I am in total agreement with the last statement. At the end, science is neither good or bad, the intentions of the people are. Science is just like a hammer, the people can choose to hit a nail, or something worse. In neither case is hammer's or hammer inventor's fault."
I don't think this is a good thing. It could be better having the earth supporting much much less people. I think 4bn max population would be better
"In answer to your final though / question.
We humans off earth"
I'm mesmerized beyond thoughts to see the extent of human madness... Positive and negative.... THANKYOU!!!
"I don't agree with calling him irrelevant and that ""someone else would have figured out [a way]"". If that were true, why do we celebrate people at all for anything. There's so many of us that of course someone else will eventually figure out what some other person did. Regardless, Fritz Haber is still a hero in my eyes."
You should have mentioned the attack of the dead men when you mentioned chlorine
"For me as a German with some distant Jewish roots it's not that easy. I feel contempt for Haber's ""patriotic"" motivation and actions. But the empire and the Nazi-Terror were also inhumane. 🤔"
Hail all the Chemists!!!

"Everytime I watch something heavy about chemistry or physics, I can't wrap my head around how everything in this universe works. Just amazing. A dissection of a molecule brings life, and when it comes back together, can be so explosive that it can harm life."
"@Sakusei Huoshén yeah man, that's something that I would have vehemently rejected when I was a young teen but honestly now, seeing how absurd reality is, I'm very open to ideas 😂 but they're also just that - ideas, since events (if there were any) before the big bang are non-falsifiable. Shouldn't be a reason to not let the imagination run a bit though!"
"@BayLeaf Honestly think that if God existed, his actual species would be 'the universe' or rather the consciousness of the universe(nothing is completely impossible)."
@BossMan indeed
"@Mr. Cantplayaninstrument sure but the likelyness of an event is determined by its probability, If we can agree on one thing the world may or may not have a God but there is a high likelihood that their maybe and multiple scientists have concluded the same. 

Outright denying the possibility is one of the most ignorant things you can do.

Final response."
"@BossMan probability doesn't tell whether something will happen or not, it tells  the expected time it'll take to happen

it's a truth to say that anything can happen and will happen, even impossible things, but expect those things to take an unfathomable time to take place

everything in existence all have had the same chances of happening, that being 100% but what differentiates things is the time gap between the beginning of existence and the moment that thing happens. 1 in a trillion chances does not dictate whether something will happen or not, but you can trust that it'll seem like an eternity till it inevitably does (time i don't think we can ever really comprehend) 

it's all about one's perception on things"
"As a layman, I always dream to make a perfect invention, something which will resolve every possible problem of human race. And I came only to one conclusion - it has to be a super-powerful weapon of destruction. When we eradicate ourselves, that will solve all the problems. Every one of them. For good."

"Haber's life and interaction with Einstein is also portrayed in the Genius: Einstein series directed by Ron Howard.  In it Haber dies because he is unable to take his heart medication pills which also probably contained Nitrogen in the form of nitroglycerin.  (Don't know if that was actually available or being prescribed at the time, but ...)"

"Can I just add that Haber was not alone in the chemical weapons race in WW1, he's really not the only villain here. The Hague Convention banned chemical projectiles so the German army argued that by releasing them at ground level they were not projectiles anymore. Secondly, Haber discovered the lethal use of chlorine gas and used it at Ypres and technically threw the first stone. But the French had used tear gas a year earlier so he saw it as revenge. Then the British invented phosgene, a more lethal chlorine based gas so the Germans discovered mustard gas to incapacitate the British. It truly was not as one sided as it first appears and by the end of the war everyone was using mixtures of all three in warfare: British, French, German, Russian and Austrian. Thirdly, the initiation of chemical warfare in WW1 is speculated to have saved more lives than harmed, a strange theory I know but hear me out. Hitler refused to use chemical weapons in WW2 because of his experiences with gas in WW1. This is very significant because we discovered after WW2 that Germany had an immense stock of nerve agents well beyond the level any of the Allies had. During the wartime, the Nazis had developed a series of organophosphate based nerve agents like tabun and sarin which might have won Hitler the war. They were colourless, tasteless and highly lethal in small doses. So every cloud has a silver lining. If Hitler had of employed these on the troops he would have killed millions and possibly exterminated the entire Jewish population on mainland Europe."
"@Honourable Doctor Edwin Moriarty Yes sorry you're correct, I thought phosgene was developed by Special Companies during the war but I was mistaken, I remember reading about Humphry Davy arguing for chlorine but I didn't know it was connected to phosgene and his younger brother. I cannot find if the French or the Germans deployed phosgene first. Some sources say it was the Germans in December 1915 but other German sources say it was the French sometime between June and December of 1915. It's all very unclear."
"Phosgene was invented by the British, but the Brit in question was John Davy in 1812. I believe the Nobel laureate Victor Grignard was the first to suggest using it as a weapon in 1915."
The animation makes it much more intresting
"climate (n.)
late 14c., ""horizontal zone of the earth's surface measured by lines parallel to the equator,"" from Old French climat ""region, part of the earth,"" from Latin clima (genitive climatis) ""region; slope of the earth,"" from Greek klima ""region, zone,"" literally ""an inclination, slope,"" thus ""slope of the earth from equator to pole,"" from a suffixed form of PIE root *klei- ""to lean.""

Life is a paradox!
"​@Bunny Poop You make assumptions - again.

Have you experienced meeting a non-human source of a love so strong, it makes every human example I have met seem tame in comparison?

Or is your wisdom derived not from personal experience, but books you have read, or lectures you have attended?

You paste labels with wild abandon, but - as yet - you have revealed not one example of that unique interaction between yourself and God / One Mind / Univers / Call It What You Will that characterises The Path that The Seeker treads.

If spiritual wisdom and peace on earth only required slogans and flag-waving, then Utopia would be available to everyone, yet clearly this is far from being the case.

Actually 'bunny poop' makes first class compost from which to grow plants, but as your bible says, some seeds fall in good ground, while others do not - and of those in good ground, not all are well tended.

I greatly enjoy planting things, and seeing them grow, both plants, and ideas in people's minds."
"@Zen StandFastForTruth that's what I thought. You don't know what Love is. You have no objective definition to present me because without God, there is no Love"
@Bunny Poop Maybe not 'bunny-pooping' on others with assumptions?
@Zen StandFastForTruth Jesus is Love. What is your objective definition for love. Do tell you Heathen 😂 🤣 🤣
"​@Bunny Poop Love unites effortlessly, so Love's energy attracts, whereas fear repells.

Your statement, although no doubt made with good intentions, waves a huge flag, and is therefore self-evidently not effortless, plus your words are not fully clear, suggesting that you have doubt in your mind, which you deal with by evangelising.

A wise man once said "" It is not what you do that matters, but what you be!""

When I heard that, I knew it was a message for me, and I remembered, and in time the meaning became clear to me.

Life is a paradox!

Why?

Because there are multiple levels of meaning, dependng upon one's level of awareness.

I believe New York exists.

Why?

People say it is there.

I have seen photographs and film,
so it probably exists.

It certainly exists in the collective awareness of mankind.

But it is possible
that New York is an illusion,
and that I have been tricked,
as I have never been there myself.

Unlikely,
but possible,
so it IS possible
that I may UN-believe in New York's existence.

/

I know spirit exists.

I know other dimensions exist.

I have had two-way conversations
many times
with my spirit guides
during two years of my life.

I encountered minds
far in advance 
of any human being that I have met,
who knew my hstory,
and could read my mind
as if it was an open book.

I experienced a love
far beyond any Earthly love.

That kind of experience
remains with you.

It cannot be unknown,
however many people ridicule it's existence.

Breathe deep.

Relax.

Be inspired.

Be true.

"This story reminds us that, yes knowledge is a powerful tool that can be used for good and evil, but we human beings are deeply flawed. Seems the Bible is wiser than many give it credit for."
"some scientists absolutely know the nature of their research and what it does. then lie about it. like scientists paid to lie about tobacco harm, or big oil harming our environment. or inventing leaded gas and lying about its harm by doing public stunts that eventually kill the inventor. money corrupts."
Now of course this ties into the present day with the Dutch farmers revolt… Doesn’t it? Dutch government wants farmers to use less nitrogen. And possibly use less land… Or lose their farms… Possibly again… In order to create housing for the influx of migrants/immigrants/refugees that the country is saying. Please… May a smart person correct my statement.

"This story, which I have known for a long time, is part of the reason why we grow most of our own food organically.

Can't feed 8 billion people without devastating climate catastrophe? Bring down the birth rate and don't waste the 50% of the food that is already being produced. Haber is an infamous, immoral, evil figure. Otto Hahn at least helped to get Lise Meittner out of Germany and slowed down research on the German atom bomb."

There are plenty of crops that can fix nitrogen into the soil, and crop rotation doesn't have all the side effects that artificial fertilizers have.

On a similar line of thought, what are the side effects of all these ridiculous carbon-offset programs?  Has anyone bothered studying that?"

"19:40 I don't know if I agree with your assessment here. Sure, someone else would have come along and figured out that Nitrate is a good fertilizer/explosive. However, I personally could not knowingly attach myself to weapon production (and as a grad student in a field that's largely funded by military grants, I've grappled with this before). It would be one thing if Haber's process was used by someone else to create chemical weapons/explosives despite his reluctance. But he *chose* to create them knowing full well what they would be used for. That makes him evil, not the fact that he invented something that would eventually be used in war/killing."
"@edsnotgod I did not mention the words ""life expectancy"" even once in any of my previous replies. And I seriously have no idea where racism factors into any of this. You really should work on your comprehension, my friend. 

You brought up life saving medical research in a pathetically weak attempt to whatabout my stance on weapons of mass destruction. I rebutted it by saying that overpopulation (in the style of Erlich's population bomb) was largely discredited by advances in agriculture and more sophisticated population models that predict that we're actually not going to grow indefinitely.
Now you're shifting the goal-posts to life expectancy (EDIT: and problems associated with people living longer) (which I never mentioned once in any of my replies). I get it, you're in favor of celebrating scientists who enable mass murder, but aren't sure how to rebut my original statement. No need to dig yourself further into the ground."
"@edsnotgod No it doesn't (nice try at whataboutism though!). Most population models predict us to level off by the end of the century. As people's lives get less desperate and they get wealthier, statistically the number of children they have decreases. As the major economies in Asia become more developed, their birth rate is going to go down."
"@Inscrutable Mungus does not working on the cures for cancer, diabetes, viruses, etc virtually guarantee a cataclysmic disaster called overpopulation?"
- He was also a new father to a boy and a woman. What kind of grammar is that? 😬
"Chemistry sets were a frequent Christmas present when I was a kid in the 1950's. We enjoyed making stink bombs and explosions, so I can see how Haber could have easily got excited by the possibilities of new chemical processes, but he lost touch with ethical principles."
"Pick up your cross and follow Jesus! The world is quickly headed for destruction, and sooner or later you will have to sit at the judgement seat and give an account for your actions. Belief in messiah alone is not enough to grant you salvation - Matthew 7:21-23, John 3:3, John 3:36 (ESV is the best translation for John 3:36). Call on the name of Jesus and pray for Him to intervene in your life! - Revelation 3:20. 

Contemplate how the Roman Empire fulfilled the role of the beast from the sea in Revelation 13. Revelation 17 confirms that it is in fact Rome. From this we can conclude that A) Jesus is the Son of God and can predict the future or make it happen, B) The world leaders/nations/governments etc have been conspiring together for the last 3000+ years going back to Babylon and before, C) History as we know it is fake. You don't really need to speculate once you start a relationship with God tho.

Can't get a response from God? Fasting can help increase your perception and prayer can help initiate events.  God will ignore you if your prayer does not align with His purpose (James 4:3) or if you are approaching Him when ""unclean"" (Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 59:2, Micah 3:4). Stop eating food sacrificed to idols (McDonald's, Wendy's etc) stop glorifying yourself on social media or making other images of yourself (Second Commandment), stop gossiping about other people, stop watching obscene content etc and you should get a response. Have a blessed day!"
"at the time war wasn't regarded as fundamentally unethical yet. It was a fact of life and seen as a good thing. The war that changed this was ww1, and Haber played a large part in the perception of war we have today"
"Guano bowls, collect the whole set...."
Global famines coming and countries across the globe are trying to ban nitrogen . Make it make sense

"Also to highlight that plenty of the advances in health sciences that we enjoy today were discovered from unethical practices by past doctors, inflicting suffering onto a multitude of patients."
"Something i wish you clarified: Zyklon B wasn't the primary gassing method in WWII. A lot of deniers cite the production needed of it - when most camps used carbon monoxide /smoke from decommissioned tank engines (which will still kill people regardless of wooden doors). Know history, dont let psychos on the internet change it."
I personally see nothing wrong with Haber. He was a scientist who advanced science on a very practical way. But his use of science in politics is what led to his downfall. nevertheless it wont ever downgrade his scientific achievements as what matters what he thought of himself rather than his peers
"Paracas in Perú is well worth a visit, you get a tour of some of the guano islands on a boat and see them close up with all the birds , seals and sea lions sitting on them, some still have the machinery on them that was used to harvest the guano."
"The conclusion of this video describes much of my recent spiritual awakening.  In essence, we all have a responsibility to our fellow human to help, but there simply is no way to ensure there are not others who intend to hurt.  You can get caught up worrying, but while you are constantly lost thinking for solutions to the problems of humans you are not actually LIVING.  In all things you must find balance.  You have a duty to yourself to act with integrity, you have a duty to others to treat them with integrity (and you will find they will treat you with integrity too in time) and you have a duty to enjoy life while you have it."
"""Bad is such a small word, for being such a big word."" As my former boss once said. Max knew his work was illegal and he didn't care. We make laws with pens and computers but, it was decided in advance that what he did was wrong and yes someone else may have done it but, he did. Whether it's BASF or Bayer AG it makes no difference. Zyklon was a pesticide that was not materially repurposed for anything other than delousing. All evidence points to gas chambers being rooms where people simply asphyxiated. One has to wonder why history is repurposed in pursuit of a modern day goal, and what you hope to achieve other than to prove that population data is wildly overstated. By best guess the population of the United States by those who could read and write, through time, is 43 million and yet you'll find a 330 million number floating around like a triple bonded nitrogen. Cheer up, and relocate, the end is nigh, but for whom, no doubt. I hear or I don't hear of the west of your land."

There's no such thing as ethics or morality in science but it certainly exists in how we do science and what we do with it. Answering whether research over a particular field is more preferable over the other can't be answered scientifically. It's humanity that needs to be more smart and aware of where it leads the society.
"@Craig Carmichael 
Werner Heisenberg probably"
"The guy who may have saved the most people was the German scientist who they tried to put in charge of an atomic bomb project before the war. They wanted to give him an unlimited budget and whatever staff he wanted - like they did for von Braun. Knowing better, he thought no one should have such a weapon and said it was in an early research stage and that he should just have a small lab with a small budget to conduct experiments. The Nazis were deeply disappointed. I forget the guy's name."
Soooooooo....we can blow up humans??
Ironic that a jewish chemist was instrumental in the development of Zyklon B. If only we could see the future.
"And now our batdroppings crazy WEF and International Deep State are prohibiting farmers from using nitrogen fertilizer!!  This is why Sri Lanka chased their president off their island.  This is why the Dutch farmers are up in arms.  Now Baby Trudeau wants to prohibit Canadian farmers from using nitrogen fertilizers.  The premiers of Alberta and Saskatchewan say they are ""disappointed"".  Really?
This whole idea that fossil fuel generated carbon dioxide and Haber process produced nitrogen fertilizer is damaging the climate is a scam!  Our use of fossil fuels only accounts for less than 4% of the entire carbon cycle.  What it does is that it returns carbon that has been buried for millions of years to the biomass.  A higher level of CO2 in the air makes plants grow faster and farms more productive.  That nitrogen oxides raining out of the air after thunderstorms is also what happens to nitrogen oxides formed in high compression engines.  Which is why we force truck drivers to use DEF and reduced the compression ratio of car engines going from the 1960's to the 1970's.  Because using our cars and trucks to fertilize the land is ""bad"" for the environment!
A 9 to 1 compression ratio car engine creates a bit of nitrogen oxide and plenty of horsepower per cubic inch of displacement.  An 8 to 1 compression ratio car engine gets the same gas mileage but less horsepower per cubic inch of displacement.  This is why '50's and 60's vintage hotrods are valued and '70's vintage cars are not.
They got away with this scam because it did not keep us from having cars.
But now they want to keep us from having plenty of food?"
I see what you did there.
"By the way, as for CO2, you may have heard of this experiment. Take two Cokes, or two beers, pour them in glasses. Leave one in the refrigerator, and the other one on the counter in a warm room. When you return, a few hours later, take the beverage from the fridge, and compare CO2 levels with the warm drink. The cold one is still bubbly, the warm drink has given up its CO2.  Like our experiment, CO2(which is in much greater abundance in the oceans, than the atmosphere) follows warmth. When the planet warms, more CO2 is released. Carbon Dioxide levels on Earth rise, following the warming of the planet."
"But if you say that someone's contributions over their lifetime are irrelevant then you are saying that people's lives are irrelevant.
How isn't that just nihilism?
I agree with the double edged sword premise but the same can also be said about explosives, I prefer to think of it in a detached manner and think of his life as a lesson, and not a tragic story, which of course it is."
That video leaves me with my head shaking we are no over 8 billion people on the Planet still rising and no total overall birth control!🤪🧐🤦🏼‍♂️
14:49 “we could save lives by ending the war quickly…. by murdering people faster”
Ironic this video came out as multiple governments of first world countries around the world start to ban fertilizer to kill off as many people as possible.
"Why didn't the Nazis use pure hydrogen cyanide instead of ordering what is essentially cat litter with a couple of percent of cyanide by weight? That stuff is only good for delousing clothes, one tin only contains like 5 lethal doses if all the cyanide is ingested, it's not going to kill two thousand people in 3 minutes or less"
So you have to kill a person to save 2 others? Got it. I do it all day in GTA
"So what I'm hearing is we need to make a diesel emissions system that makes N2O from the NOx the engines produce and ditch the def since the hard part, breaking the N2 bond, has been done for us during combustion."
you cant stop people from destroying each other through education.   Teach ethics and religion in that ethics subject as religion itself is unethical!
really a lot of inventions have been a double edged sword
Tell him i said thx for my life ig
"It was all good until you started pushing the government promoted Climate Change mantra. Watch out, it's Carbon! Wait. Isn't that the basis of most life on Earth? Yep.  For some background,  during the Cambrian Period, millions of years ago, the levels of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide were a little higher than our current amount of around 400 parts per million. Back then, it was over 4,000 parts per million(too many SUVs?)  The Cambrian was also known for a veritable explosion of new life on Earth. Over long periods of time, that abundance of life giving CO2 became sequestered into rock, like limestone and marble. By the 1880s, atmospheric CO2 had dropped down to dangerously low levels, around 180 ppm.  When CO2 goes down to only 150 ppm, almost all plant life on Earth dies. No more oxygen is created. All creatures that breathe will then die off. Thankfully the CO2 levels are back up to a better number(though still low) of about 420 ppm. The Earth is getting greener, as plants thrive at higher levels of CO2, as that is how most of them evolved.  Most commercial greenhouses pump in CO2 at about 1,000 ppm. Research this. As for sea levels, the charts for NY Harbor show that levels have risen at the same rate, year after year,  since before Lincoln was President. SUVs again?  So  Forest fires in the U.S. burned 10 times more trees in the 1930s than today(listen to Tony Heller YouTube).  The 1930s was also the decade that was far hotter than this one. Dust Bowl, anyone? Don't forget, in the 1970s,  government scientists wanted to coat the North Pole with mega tons of coal dust because they predicted we were entering an Ice Age(Leonard Nimoy narrated a film on this). Right. What about deadly hurricanes far worse now than ever? Research the hurricane that hit the Florida Keys in 1934, or the Great New England Hurricane of 1938. Worst year known for hurricanes? Try 1780, and the storms hitting the Caribbean  including the Great Hurricane of 1780. Over 28,000 people died that season. So. There are many actual scientists that are not pushing the government/corporate media propaganda. I would recommend Richard Lindzen, Patrick Moore (cofounder of Greenpeace), Ian Plimer, Willie Soon, Peter Ridd(Cook College), Freeman Dyson, William Happer, Tony Heller, and for a funny and informative vid, try the longer version of Mark Steyn discussing his lawsuit with Michael Mann, the creator of the disproven ""Hockey Stick"" graph, purporting to show that the temperature of the Earth has remained constant over 2,000 years. No Roman Warm Period? No Medieval Warm Period? No Little Ice Age from early 14thvcentury, to mid 18th century?  ""Yeah right. That's the ticket.""  Cheers..."
we cant
Waiting for the days where we can have a video about Ancel Keys and how his arrogance impacted the health of people around the world for the next 70 years (and hopefully no longer) by cherry picking data from a not so randomized study and fiercely fighting off critics that had found several flaws in it...
Is this what Vandana Shiva keeps talking about ?
So The Hague Conventions only banned gas projectiles not the gas itself?
Now we are all sons of bitches
"As soon as you started with the carbon footprint garbage, you lost credibility. Carbon is not a pollutant. Carbon is plant food. Solar weather is well understood to be causing the temperature fluctuations that bad, dishonest people say are caused by carbon, methane and whatever else. Please stop with the pseudo science."
Also the reason farmers and agricultural producers are upset right now are because of governments forcing them to stop using fertilizer which will lead in some areas (big areas) to produce lower amount of food stuffs for the market which in turn will drive up the price for the average person
The name reminds me of Attack on Titans
Ah I vaguely recall this from highschool chemistry more than a decade ago.
The worlds greatest inventors create the best inventions and the worse weapons
"""Don't you see?"""
He deliberately sought to create chemical weapons to be used in war. That makes him a villain.
9:52 (Kids cheering)
"at the end of the day, what did it benefit him? To use chemicals as weapons? All his zeal lead to his fellow Jews demise.. 

He said to his friend that the chemicals would be ""for the greater good, by ending the war quickly""

I often wonder how people who use that ""for the greater good"" line, I wonder how they could be so blind?"
"New series??
Thoroughly enjoyed as always"
"For those that don't have time for this long-winded video that refuses to get to the point:
Fritz Haber invented the Haber-Bosch Process which would eventually help grow crops but also make weapons of mass destruction (bombs, chemical weapons).

Haber himself was very enthusiastic about making chemical weapons to kill people in WWI, so much so, he would definitely become an evil Nazi scientist if he were alive during WWII."
"Ammonia Nitrate can be used to feed people, or to be made into a bomb to kill people. Look what Timothy McVeigh did in Oklahoma City"
0:29 why they hate him so much?
"As a STEM researcher, im terrified of the possible evil outcomes my research can cause."
He brought the definition of “For the greater good” to a whole another level
"thats def not what ‘for the greater good’ means. he got nitrogen from air which is good. but by creating the gas that was used during the war, he killed so many people, and that was evil & horrible, not for ‘greater good’ or wtv"
"Not really, that's not what ""For the greater good"" means"
18:29 I find it ironic how he stated his loyalty to his country but later turn against until his death for the injustice.
"Great man, wrong side"
"Yup, that double edge sword is why i sabotage my life can't trust humanity with what's in my head I'd rather be dead"
a fucked up story
"History repeats itself, this is a lesson that also applies today in our present times. Science is helpful to humanity but also, how in the future will it be used adversely against us? Only time will tell…"
"As the old saying goes, if you want to save a billion you have to kill a million."
"No. He found the Ammonia process before the chemical weapons. His knowledge in chemical warfare did NOT lead to the Ammonia process. It was the other way around. So in this case, He saved a billion, then killed a million."
"I don’t think synthetic nitrogen was needed, like you said plants and bacteria replace the nitrogen along with adding compost and other techniques, the problems and need for synthetics arise from mono cropping and large scale agriculture."
Oh hell no the title and it’s a new video and bill gates acting suspicious AND ITS NUMBER 10. nope
"The answer is God; the answer is God. 
His love and providence has given us all this and so we really need him, in the true and undiluted light of his character and wisdom to make this world work."
"you should make a video on Death, the destroyer of worlds Robert Oppenheimer"
"I think saying 'science is neither good nor bad' is a cop-out, making an apology for frankly irresponsible behaviour. It is down to each of us to try to make the world a better, not worse, place, and should scientists get a pass on that simply because others will use their inventions or discoveries? No. If anything, scientists need be more responsible. Presumably, Haber's colleagues who didn't turn up at his award ceremony understood this."
"¡Muy interesante documental! Para complementar, además del guano, la industria minera del salitre también fue un importante suministro de nitrato para uso agrícola antes del proceso de Haber-Bosch. También sería interesante conocer el aporte de Carl Bosch en esta historia. Una consecuencia ambiental poco mencionada del proceso de Haber-Bosch es que ha generado un exceso de nitrógeno fijado que circula en la biosfera. Esto se vincula directamente con fenómenos como la lluvia ácida y la contaminación con nitrato de  aguas subterráneas, y es considerado uno de los componentes del cambio global."

nvm sorry
Sir please make a video on James Webb new photos released by NASA. Please describe those photos.
Anyone else notice that one of his shoulders is always higher than the other?
There's a great episode about this on The Forum a few months back. Such a good listen.
Never rely on scientists on what should be done. Let the public political process to decide what discovery can help people.
Now I get to know why its habers process to synthesis ammonia
"There are many informative channels on youtube, but i find yours and kurzgesagt to be one of the best!!!"
"I am a scientist myself, molecular biologist. Sometimes I ask myself that last question. What if the answer is that we should not keep accumulating so much knowledge and should stop trying to control nature?"
yeah... what would happen if one day scientists just... stop?
Arthur Galston had his work turned into Agent Orange.
What do you mean how do we keep control of the natural world and not destroy ourselves? Why do we need to control the world? Let's work instead to gently lower our population to a more manageable size. Then our environmental problems become much simpler.
"Feeding half the world a poisoned loaf isn't an accomplishment.  The vast majority of atmospheric carbon is a direct result of these belligerently delusional notions that centralized mono-culture and domestication is anything but ultimately destructive.  It baffles the rational and educated mind.  Nazi Agriculture IS the carbon crisis.  Every aspect of it was designed to secure centralized control and make use of the second hand hardware being handed down by the war machine.

It was always known that ammonia based fertilizers combined with yearly tilling poisons and ultimately sterilizes the soil.  The Nazi Agriculture model had 3 goals.  Rapid short term production, rapid soil degradation, and permanent reliance on Nazi supplied chemicals and infrastructure.  It had nothing to do with feeding more people.  The Nazi's were in the business of making less people."
This reminds me of the person who invented Dynamite for the sole purpose of helping miners get materials from mountains. Science truly is a crazy thing which applications rely dependant on the wielder of said invention. So many things were made with good intentions but are used for malice. It's just sad how the world works sometimes
"Yeah, but nobody has heard about him."
"Seems if you want to de-populate the world, ban fertilizer, Sri Lanka, Netherlands and coming to the US and Canada soon, thanks to the WEF"
One o t the most valuable post I've ever seen.  Thank you for true history shown as it truly is...
"4:48 ""The world would need another way to get its nitrogen fix""
I see what you did there"
"The real question is ""How to launder a nazi in 22 minutes and 34 seconds."""
by the impossible feat or removing greed.
Eight billion people is too many! Two should be max. Damn you Haber!
Your question at the end.  We don’t continue to control nature.  We work with it.
Scientists of the manhattan project are not condescended though. It all depends on who won the war does it?
What a hard story to digest.
"well this is the the great filter..The Great Filter theory is that something leads to the destruction of civilisations, before they manage to master intergalactic communication and travel."
"It’s not about putting scientists in a cage, but putting politicians in a cage. Their decisions affect voters to bring any kinds of people to power and affect even more people in the generations to come. Unfortunately, our science advancements are not accompanied by politics advancements. That’s why our future is clouded."
We are so tragic. 😔
AI is going to be the next ammonium nitrate. Its going to both revolutionize and be used to destroy us.
"And now some governments around the world today are trying to get rid of nitrogen farming. Compliments of the WEF and other parties...
This whole climate crisis thing is nonense started by companies like BP to make their environmental disasters look like our fault. What an amazing marketing campaign."
Don’t forget chemotherapy! There should be a ‘One more last thing’- which would be that his chemical weapons directly led to the discovery of chemotherapy which saved even more lives. Crazy to think that one individual had such a massive impact (both extremely positive and extremely negative) on the world and that more people don’t know his name.
Why don't you talk about how government around the world are trying to get rid of nitrogen fertilizer
This video was so profound
"The farming methods were terrible, should have taken notes from the native, people they never had this problem with their farming methods."
"To think of it, Hitler would’ve still initiated the holocaust even if there was no chlorine gas to be used, it was just a tool in the wrong hands after all."

"'Fixed-Nitrogen' = that is the secret to making fertilizer that feeds our population.  First, it was bird poop that had 'fixed nitrogen',  but then Fritz Haber created a chemical way to fix nitrogen in solution, and that resulted in a population explosion, and now it results in huge algae blooms that is killing our oceans, and if our oceans die, then we die too."
"Just wanna point out there's a lot of research on regenerative agriculture, there are ways to have nitrogen without artificially fixing it. (e.g. the Amazon rainforest)"
"Hero?  By his creation, the means to add BILLIONS people who need water, clothes, housing, transportation, medical, etc.   and short stalk wheat, we are poised to destroy the planet.

"I do not want to push into conspiracy too much... but listening to the scientific history, on relations between farming and explosives...

plants take co2 and make oxygen from it. if you get rid of the carbon you get rid of both the plants and people.
"I get the idea, but it would seem if we as humans would not cut down the forests they would do just fine by being the forest that they already are.  Now if instead, they spread the rock all over outside of cities because I can't imagine that the rocks on top of the road or sidewalk would be beneficial.  And here in Canada we have issues with fertilizers ending up in our lakes and turning the lakes green and I don't mean like the two big lakes in manitoba have hug issues.  Now teh farmer is like we don't use enough to make the difference but the families that use fertilizers on the grass use far to much and are the cause.  I don't wish to fight that for all I know both may be correct.  I do wish to complain that the problem is caused by lack of crop rotation and did not actually need to be fixed with chemicals.  At least that is what I believe but it is extra hard to convince someone when they guy who does the video does not even admit that crop rotation is a thing."

"Impressive, I am in total agreement with the last statement. At the end, science is neither good or bad, the intentions of the people are. Science is just like a hammer, the people can choose to hit a nail, or something worse. In neither case is hammer's or hammer inventor's fault."

"I normally like your videos, but I feel like this one really missed the mark. The idea that scientific steps are attributable to a single person is naive. Science progresses through teamwork, and by building on the ideas of others. The notion that if person <X> hadn't existed, his contributions wouldn't have been made is also a little short-sighted. If Fritz Haber hadn't existed, the work he did would have very likely been done by somebody else. The idea that he's responsible for 4 billion people's existence is highly improbable.

I strongly suggest you read ""How We Got to Now"" by Stephen Johnson. For the majority of scientific problems, there are several independent people/groups working on similar solutions at similar times, and who gets credit for the advancement is down to luck more than anything else."

Who was that Otto Hahn guy?  Wasn't he the lab assistant who wrote letters to the woman who discover atomic fission in Sweden without her nephew's help?
"as a forming scientists, this kind of things are so heavy on one's mind, just as you can do one more step from someone else's work, the same might be done with yours, and you can never predict it."
"I think I accidentally made something like the chlorine/mustard gas stuff when I was a kid. I've been interested in chemistry and chemical reactions since I was like 4 years old. I was at my grandma's house one time when I was maybe 6 or 8 and took a bunch of cleaners and mixed them together (not knowing about the bleach/ammonia thing as a kid) and it made some gas and when I inhaled it, it was like my lungs just vanished - like trying to breathe through a brick wall. I didn't know what the hell to do so I grabbed some water and tried to purposely inhale it. I'm assuming that didn't accomplish anything but I survived. I had/have really good parents and grandparents who watched me closed as a kid but I was a total hoodlum and could nearly have the house burned down by the time they blinked."
@Beyondo That is why you should keep a gas mask near your lab like I do. I always keep an OM-90 and a few A2B2E2K2P3 (means it protects against pretty much everything) filters around.
"I did worse... I was 17 doing an electrolysis experiment on iron and metals then went out of my room for 10 minutes doing some things and came back just to notice my room smelling with death... I couldn't breath... it literally burns your throat when you do it like inhaling fire. I did this experiment many times before to extract elements and I know that never happened before.... The problem is, I wasn't able to even get close to terminate the process. Though I'm lucky I was using a power supply instead of a battery because I was able to get into my house's breaker and break the electricity.

I got my mask and goggles, sealed every hole on my face, taken a deep breath and went in my room. I closed the door quickly before me so it doesn't get to my parents. I turned everything off, tried to make the gas go away.... and when I looked at the experiment, I found a big ass fly lying dead there almost 60% of its body is decomposed and about to vanish. That fly probably got here through the window that I left open..

Again, I was just extracting some metals and gasses through some tubes and basic methods. I never thought a fly would go here and drink from the solution or that it'd even cause so much trouble."

"The truly poetic irony in this story for me is the fact that Haber, who created the deadly yet indispensable nitrogen compounds, was awarded the Nobel Prize, created by Alfred Nobel to try and do good after inventing dynamite, which killed his own brother.

Edit: People have pointed out that the invention of dynamite was after his brother died, so I stand corrected there, but I feel like my original point still stands since dynamite was also a compound that came with great progress and simultaneous evil"

"See how these problems were solved, and the dire predictions of experts never came to be, in this and many other cases?. These days it's climate change. A problem, and one that can and will be solved without having to reduce the quality of life our children. For example, it could be solved in short order with nuclear power right now. And that may not even be the best way. Thank goodness our forefathers weren't as defeatist as our modern media. If anything, let's take a lesson on not catastrophizing, whether honest, or for click money. Our average inability to properly weight risk these days, is doing real harm."
"Making the issue about extraction of Nitrogen is reductive and inaccurate. He was despised for getting involved with the German army and looking for ways to make chemical weapons. The extraction of N2 isn’t relevant to his later decisions. He may have created a way for people to make weapons, but he didn’t have to. Even if someone threatens your life, you still don’t have to. But he wanted to produce the weapons, and that part does matter to what we decide to do in light of that knowledge.

It’s not what we create that matters, but what it’s intended for and how we allow people to use these things. If we create nuclear energy, that’s not the same as bombs. Creating guns only for select law enforcement purposes and national defense is different than mass proliferation of firearms. It’s our intentions, policies, and procedures that determine how things get used or abused.

We don’t have to participate in evil things. Just because “someone else will” (they might, it’s not a guarantee unless we all decide to give up on virtue) doesn’t mean I must. That’s defeatism and moral licensing. 

But why are people trying to get rid of chemical weapons, cluster bombs, and nuclear proliferation nowadays? It’s because we accept that we’re better off without these things. It was better that they never existed. If we choose to see what awfulness can come from something and choose not to participate, we can prevent great harm. Perhaps we can even decide what we won’t do, even if we can.

The pinned comment says to “use chemistry for good”. So you acknowledge that people intentionally use knowledge to create weapons and processes to kill each other and that there’s a better way of living. 

That has nothing to do with “science and technology”, those are just terms and encompass broad ideas. It’s the actualization of ideas that manifests as problems for humanity. Let’s just instead choose to let someone else do those things and live upstandingly."
"So progress demands we stand on the corpses resulting from invention? History tells us it’s true but it makes me incredibly uncomfortable regardless of the positive benefits that preceded or follow.  Surely we would have arrived at a method to move air-bourne nitrogen to soil without the human-suffering? This is a fantastic video, thank you. It’s really made me think!"

"1st we need a World, where we can trust eachothers loyalty towards agreements, so we can predict the behavior of others, to make trustworthy interaction possible...

To do that, we need a common point of reference, to align our differencies...

Next, we need to stop thinking: If we don't develop this idea further, others will - and thus we have to get there before ""the others""...

Some things should be left alone - and NOT all science is worth persuing, considering the risks involved...

THAT however is very much up for debate, because individuals with a short attention-span has no clue of the effects of their own actions...

The better you are at ""connecting the dots"", the better predictions you can make and the better understanding do you have for the reactions of ""others""...

Simpleminded people can't understand the concept of ""dynamic effects"", because they're imcapable of connecting things that way...

People with no understanding of the consequences of their actions, are willing to perfortm actions, others decline, because they understand the bad effects...

Like putting profits over people - fear over trust - and development of stuff, that should never have existed...

People with a better understanding of things, need to take control, where simpleminded individuals have set all consideratoions aside...

Like ""privatizing"" everything, not realizing, that the more land that is ""privatized"", the less is left for the rest of the population to roam, where they can escape the exploitation of the rich ""landowners""...

""Public land"" is the only place for people with no land of their own to take refuge from THAT exploitation...

But the rich have convinced some with less insight, that ""Property Rights"" are worth more than ""Human Rights""...

They need to balance eachother out, to make things work to everyones satisfaction...

The alternative is called ""Arbeit macht Frei""...!"
"I'm confused. The title says ""killed millions"" but the biggest number I heard was 100,000 soldiers killed by chemical weapons. When did Fritz Haber kill Millions?"
@Peter KelleyIt was his weapon so technically he is also responsible for those deaths
@Peter Kelley The narrator mentioned that that happened quite a while after his death. Surely you're not holding him accountable for something other people decided to do after his death?

"To be honest, even the fertilizer has a bad influence. Because we are way to many humans and therefor we produced more CO2 more quickly because of our ""needs"". Instead of producing more food for more and more people, we should have stopped making more and more humans so the food would be enough."
Where did you get those atom magnets?
"Chemical fertilizers are killing the soil and will eventually kill billions of humans.  They have already killed billions if not trillions of organisms living in the soil.  Maintaining the nitrogen (and other nutrient) balance in soils is best done by nourishing the soil ecosystem, and planting nitrogen-fixing host plants, not by adding industrially produced nitrogen.  Very tired of the technology apologism that seems to be taking over this channel.  Understand that attracting sponsors may be necessary to your livelihood but it's really turning off this erstwhile enthusiastic subscriber."

What an excellent video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"It may be a bit of a stretch but, the use of ammonium nitrate as an explosive also makes available almost everything physical item we use today, as it is an essential part of the mining process for pretty much every minable commodity and mineral. The big one is steel, without ANFO (ammonium nitrate fuel oil) explosions there would be no iron ore or coking coal."
"As an Analytical Chemist, I adored this video. One of your best so far. Detailed, considered, and considerate. Excellent animations too."
Were you in Sydney when you shot this? 2:44 looks very familiar
"Excellent production, great quality."
"Nitrate as a fertilizer was already available, albeit in limited supply, as nitre (saltpeter) which could be mined.Guano was also important for its phosphate content.

We now have a way of synthesizing ammonia and, from that, nitrate, providing a supply of nitrate limited only by available energy.

On the other hand, two other important fertilizers, phosphate and potassium, are still only available by mining them. The phosphate still comes from guano deposits (and other phosphate minerals like apatite). The potassium comes from potash deposits. Both of these are, in the long run, in limited supply. What will we do when these mines run out?"
"such a good video. never knew there was so much backstory to the haber process my chemistry teachers taught me last year in class 11.

"If you go digging, most inventions have an interesting story behind them. We are all humans, even the great scientists were and still are. The difference today is, that most topics have become so deep and complicated, the chance of discovering something game changing while bumble through the lab after hours or doing experiments in your shed, has dropped to virtually zero."

Great video.  the universe would have been better  if nitrogen was never created this way. So many fewer people. that sounds nice.
"The last deduction before your sponsor segment is very profound. The problem I see is that while humanity has developed amazing technologies, our ethical and sociological evolution has failed to keep step with technology and science. 

When it comes down to the wire a single human, as well as society as a whole still has a tendency to first think on its own survival. 
A single human in a large group of humans sealed in a cave will find it nearly impossible not to think about gulping that last breath of breathable air in the sealed cave, even if it means killing off all others as well. 

We find it so hard to make the sacrifices that will be detrimental to ourselves but to aid the survival of a group at large. The horrible yet ethical choice for a large group would be to find volunteers to kill themselves so others would have more oxygen left over, so that in the increased duration supplied by that there may be a chance of rescue. Because we see the ethical problem of someone giving their life so others may possibly be saved. Soldiers and firefighters are amongst a handful of people who actually sign up, knowing that they may be forced to risk their lives so that others may live. 

The destinction however is that soldiers know that they also may have to kill other humans to do their duty, determined simply by a fairly uncaring superior who again recieves orders down the chain of command, right from the top, where political decisions decide the fate of both the soldiers fighting on their own side, as well as other humans involved with these soldiers.

Firefighters on the other hand DON'T sign up to kill others; their job description is to put their lives at as little risk as possible while saving as many people as possible.
There is no 'better or worse' between the common soldier and the common firefighter. 

But from a societal standpoint, if we could make wars extinct by making EVERYONE recognize that wars never bring anything good, except destruction, and that cooperation is much more preferable, then we could abolish soldiers as well.
Until we reach that point in our societal ethical development it is unfortunately utopian, wishful thinking.

In the same way larger groups will find ways to implement their own survival over and beyond the survival of other groups first. Whenever any resource that defines survival becomes limited humans as individuals, as well as larger groups, right up to blocks of nations, STILL think in ""us vs them"" categories, not in ""who has the greatest chance of survival if looked at rationally"". Because the ""us vs them"" mentality is easier to understand and to emotionally bond with. Because the ""survival of most to the detriment of some"" is ethically problematic, but might become a necessity in a world growing constantly more crowded.

We as a humanitarian total have to develop from the Neanderthal mindset of ""me first, then my loved ones, then possibly my neighbors and friends, then possibly all the other unwanted ones."" Our ethical and moral compass has to evolve. We cannot delve into more and more destructive measures just to gather more resources for our own little group.
We have to begin thinking like a whole.

It will be difficult to survive for humanity as whole otherwise."

Hey. So I just got back from Pigeon Forge and went to WonderWorks. You think you could do a video breaking down how the inversion tunnel works?
so tnt is a nitrogen bomb? so then a hydrogen bomb is the same thing using hydrogen? is it really nuclear and radioactive or just the same thing using hydrogen and the term nuclear is like adding an x to everything to make it sound more extreme? it seems like a lot of things we talk about and are taught are deceptive..

"""So the real question is: How do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?""

The answer (if anyone at all is listening) is a Resource-Based Economy, which is defined as: The application of the scientific method for social concern. Full Stop.

The reason why we so haphazardly perform dangerous experiments is because there is no ethics in Capitalism. So, we must remove the profit motive from our global society. The only way to do that is to remove the monetary economy. Human health, well-being, and social progress is always 2nd to monetary gain.

It its place we would institute a global ethics board and begin asking questions like ""do we have the technology to feed, clothe, shelter, and educate everyone on the planet without the need for labor for income?""

The answer is YES, we do. We have this technology to support this at a bare minimum. So why don't we apply it? BECAUSE the scarcity based monetary system makes everyone insane... chasing after more digits on a screen for their entire lives, treating other's like poop and inadvertently murdering people for the sake of profit.

I have been preaching this for 14 years. No one listens or engages this conversation. No one wants the real answer, because it threatens their profit motive. But transitioning out of Capitalism towards a Resource-Based Economy is the ONLY answer to this problem. Keep your monetary economy and you will continue to see countless preventable deaths when we have the technology to bring sanity and balance to this planet."
@FrostDirt Watch Zeitgeist: Moving Forward here on youtube.
@Peter Kelley A RBE has quite a steep learning curve for those who haven't been introduced to the concepts involved. The extra bit was supplemental for anyone who's not aware of it. The first bit was for people who already are. What is ironic is the belief people hold that a scarcity based system that demands infinite growth on a finite planet can continue on forever.
What do you mean resource-based economy. That sounds redundant to me because every economic system deals with resource and its scarcity.
"You wrote, ""... The application of the scientific method for social concern. Full Stop. ...""  And then you went on to write another 5 paragraphs.  A bit ironic I think."
"Villain. You don't create chlorine gas out of benevolence. He just oversees the killing of 67,000 people from the gas right before his wife's suicide and they had an argument about his creating chemical weapons. Then he immediately leaves to go execute another gas attack?! She was a women's rights activist and possibly a pacifist. 
Also you can't create chlorine gas (among other chemical weapons he created and tested btw) and use it to kill so many people and then pretend you are suddenly pro-human rights when it's turned on your own people. The logic of a hypocrite."
The end of the video is true we got all kinds of advancement in technology we have today because of WW2 and even the Cold War advanced our civilization even more.
"It's horrible how both World Wars brough the worst in humanity. First Chemical Weapons then Nuclear Weapons, one kills in painful ways and the other just straight disintegrate...

"Haber happened to be on the wrong side of the war. If he were to be part of the Allies, he would've been regarded as one of the greatest minds of the 20th century. He only wanted to protect his country and end war by decreasing the number of the enemy troops in an effective way. Same with the Americans dropping the bombs in Japan."
"Haber had nothing to do with the holocaust. He made a pesticide and even put in some smelly stuff to keep people safe. Blaming him for Zyklon B is dumb. Besides, the Nazis would've found out another way to kill people, for example a big drop."

"Well done. I hadn't heard of this guy (I think - the Haber-Bosch process rings a _very_ dim bell); it's a nice case study of how science can cut both ways. I feel bad for Haber, who seems to have drunk some sort of patriotic Kool-Aid. Twenty years ago I once got half a short shallow breath of chlorine gas and it took a week for my throat to be right again. I can't imagine dying from that. Horrible."
to be fair to Haber if he didn't do what he did the german people (including himself) would have suffered anyway and probably worse. ww1 broke the morale and economies of the victors so they couldn't stomach an occupation of Germany and if they had won things would have been even better. the 'patriotic kool-aid' was actually fairly rational.

"19:28 was perfectly spoken.  whether for productivity or destruction science is science, it does not care.  It is what we as a species do with that knowledge that makes the outcome.  I love your channel so much by showing as much of the whole story without bias."
"I would argue that regarding him as irrelevant isn't a good idea from a historical perspective. The fact is he, as a person, chose to do what he did and deserves all the fame and infamy that comes with it.The question you pose at the end is precisely the reason why we remember and learn from his legacy."
"@Honourable Doctor Edwin Moriarty There's a whole other side of what-ifs and alternate history to speculate on for sure, and perhaps some things are indeed inevitable. Nonetheless, the unyielding wheels of fate don't make good lessons to learn from.

To quote Alex Gendler at TEDed ""We can never be sure how things could've unfolded if different people were in power or different decisions were made. But to avoid the mistakes of the past, we must always be willing to put historical figures on trial."""
"@Markus Johansson There a lot of alternate history ramifications if someone else had done what he did at a different time.

Regardless, that's not the point. The fact is, one man made the choice to kill others on an industrial scale, and it is his choice that we must examine so history does not repeat itself."
@Markus Johansson yeah thats what we said
Somebody else would have invented what he did if he didnt do so first. Just shortly thereafter.
exactly!! yes some1 else wouldve done it but regardless it was HIS actions and HIS work

"Well,  some may struggle with the thought of whether he was a hero or a villain, but the Simpsons taught me, ""No one who speaks German could be an evil man!"""
"wait... this premise is unfair. To say he saved billions- you showed a population chart and correlated it with ONE invention, leaving out penicillin, GMOs, and the millions inventions and events. Correlation does not equal causation."
"The irrelevant argument doesn't really stand up to any scrutiny. Developing it for munitions is understandable, but he then actively worked towards chemical weapons that killed by the thousand and maimed by the million. He not only chose to take that direction, but he did it with glee. Don't forget, it was him personally that used chemical weapons in Ypres first, everything after that was in retaliation. He is single handedly responsible for every single chemical warfare based death, regardless of side, throughout the entirety of WWI.

That doesn't sound very irrelevant to me..."
This video was insanely well made and told. Kudos
did we not give Einstein a Nobel Price? Haber is a quireboy against the guys from the Manhaten project. Haber's problem is simply he worked for the side that lost. Science is and never was ethical all the weapons in the world are made by scientists and most of them could not find a moral compass if they stood on it. they know exactly what they are doing and the only motivation is money. Haber Einstein Oppenheimer Hass .... you name it they are all the same none is above the other and none of them had a moral compass.
pertaining to chemistry I don't think co2 is to blame for the majority of humanities suffering. of all the toxic chemicals elements drugs/ fake for profit placebos  ect.. co2 is a critical part of the earth's life cycle. seriously I'm sick to death of hearing about it. since the first earth day back in elementary school. yah global warming is a problem.  but compared to the real suffering of people around the world it's nothing but a red herring.  when compared to the lack of actual civilization here and around the world poverty drug addiction apathy ect... it's really more of a future problem in my opinion. be warned the Nazis were really good at controlling the minds of the masses to. just as much as any faith thru religion. me it boils down to basic human dignity. basic equality. when the result of the trillions spent on global warming over the past 30 years don't have any effect on the total co2 emission. not to mention the result of reckless regulation/ initiative increasing mass poverty and creating a worldwide famine. while the people at the top of it all stuffed their own pockets.   I call that economic cannibalism and genocide.  put the health and wellbeing of people first. co2 in the atmosphere is measured in the parts per million. fill minds with science and dignity not genocidal/suicidal dogma. the real problem is the math well the dogma of. minimize cost and maximize profit. not to mention miss spent dead weight loss. ie derived from taxes that people also get filthy rich from. oh know the problems of global warming for decades now. why hasn't any of the money been spent on say infrastructure to protect the lively hoods of the people at risk. say like desalinization or irrigation infrastructure.  there is a complete lack of equality with eugenics woven in to the fabric of the green agenda. oh wait most people can afford and use led lights. 30 years that's it. yah scam filled with inequality designed to push the masses into a drug induced suicide. sounds like a nazi agenda to me. spent trillions mostly tax deferred or derived to develop technology that for the most part only the well-off can afford.  yah who ripped off who?
"today agrotoxics do more harm than good, we have new revolutionary techniques that involve better crop yelds and more eco friendly that are tottally organic and some of them even rescued from ancient traditions. We need to stop using agrotoxics now"

Ironic.
"It's incredible how important nitrogen based fertilizer is to feeding the worlds population, yet now we have several governments around the world trying to restrict or ban its usage. Here in Canada, we grow a large part of the worlds supply of lentils, among other sources of food, and our government has vowed to cut nitrogen fertilizer usage by farmers by 30% by the year 2030. We've recently seen how banning chemical fertilizers entirely has effected the crops in Sri Lanka. Luckily for the rest of the world, they aren't a major food exporter that other countries are relying on."
We have also had crop rotation for few thousand years to replenish Nitrates in our soil.
I would also like to add Haber’s mustard gas paved the way to chemotherapy
Did I miss it or did the video mention why his peers refused to attend? Was it because he created a deadly weapon?
I love these kinds of episodes - i call them “Behind the Science” ala Behind the Music
"Ironic scientist would protest Fritz Haber at the Nobel Prize since, you know, Alfred Nobel invented Dynamite, which contributed to the advancement of explosives warfare, leading eventually to nuclear weapons.

As pointed out, it's irrelevant who invented or founded what; there's more than enough Humans on Earth to figure out and invent all the triumphs and horrors."
"Wait, how did the Nobel prize suddenly turn to bird crap?"
Incredibly well done. Your remark to not demonize or saint this man was brilliant.
I feel like one of the few people with a similar impact on humanity and the environment was Thomas Midgley Jr

"In the book ""The Invention of the Atomic Bomb"", the author describes that last night with Haber's wife (who was also an accomplished scientist in her own right).  She insisted that he not attend the gas attack test and said she would leave him if he did.  He said something along the lines of having a responsibility to his country first.  So she killed herself. This book is great because it gives insight into the motivations of scientists who in the lens of today can appear to be monsters.  A lot of the people motivated to help with the creation of the atomic bomb were working under the fear that Nazi Germany was making their own bomb and they all remembered the use of chemical warfare just a few decades prior.  They knew what Hitler was capable of."
"@Aaron Fuller No, they're not. As Derek said during the outro, any invention can have the potential to save as well as to kill at the same time. Thinking in binaries is reductive and dumb."

"Didn't Haber convert to Christianity well before the Nazi era? Pretty sure he said he probably could have gotten an exemption from the Jew ban, but decided to resign anyways because a Nazi officer offended him with one of his statements."
"At the end, you say knowledge is a double edged sword, which is truth. But Heber intentionally chose to make weapons of war. That is a big difference"
"No one is a Saint, no one is a Jesus living out there so no, I don't think he is irrelevant, I think he made an important contribution to humanity and we should be thanked for that

"12:11  Incorrect. It did contain that amount when that warehouse was first loaded up from that rusty old cargo ship. But as the years went by the amount decreased as most likely the military controlled this ammonium-nitrate through the corrupt government. And thus they put large amounts of this into all kinds of bombs, missiles and other explosive weaponry. The US or UK intelligence services (I don't remember which one at the top of my head) calculated the amount that exploded to have been around 500 tons, based and calculated. on the yield of the explosion itself."

"This entire video I was just thinking thank god though it was WW1 and not 2, and he didnt create zyklon b that killed millions of my people until i got to the end and you ruined it for me :(
It makes me sad, because its clear that through his patriotism , he would have continued his work even if he knew what the future of it would be, since he was ok with using it on other soldiers."

"I feel like this video ignores the fact that artificial fertilizers only postpone the problem of soil depletion. In the long run, we need to learn to use nitrogen fixers and sustainable models of agriculture to feed our population, and it might have been easier to make that switch when we weren't also facing cataclysmic climate change."
Awesome video
Why don't we mimic nature by creating artificial lightning ⚡ to produce nitrogen dioxide(basically an electric arc through the air in a sealed tank). Then fills the tank with water to dissolve it.
I don't think it's right to regard him as irrelevant because _someone else would've figured out how to make that deadly gas poison anyways_ ... He specifically looked for a way to make such a deadly weapon to use on humans.

"The ending very muc reminds me of a chapter from Heisenbergs ""quantum physics and pilosophy"", where he distinguishes the inventor, who builds something with a goal, eg someone who invents a bomb to kill people, flom discoverers. the discoverer does not have a motive, and if his discovery is used for evil, as e.g. the person who predicted nuclear fission, he should not be taken responsible for what inventors do with this discovery."
"I think you should do a video like this about Nikola Tesla. Incredible accomplishments, but with a dark side that few people know about. (Strong believer in Eugenics, argued that the forced sterilization of criminals wasn’t going far enough and that instead there should be strict regulations about who can procreate). Also important to talk about his failures (like his obsession with wireless power transmission) and the insanity of his later years (believed he had contacted aliens from Venus). Definitely not as dark as Haber, but much less talked about despite how much people talk about Tesla."
"I think the main reason people don’t talk about it is they want Tesla vs. Edison to be a good vs. evil story (Edison is definitely Evil, despite his own incredible accomplishments, which people also now undersell to fit the narrative - Edison didn’t invent the electric light, but he did invent audio recording and the motion picture camera, in addition to his lab developing the tungsten filament lamp)"
"So, Haber and his lab invented the chemical weapons used in WWI war crimes, then the chemical used in the Holocaust, but the ""good"" thing is that we can also thank him for the overpopulation that is creating runaway greenhouse emissions, deforestation, exhaustion of non-renewable resources, increasing political instability, and possibly the eventual collapse of society?"
"There's a saying that goes ""There are always 3 kind of inventors. The original one, the one that revolutionize something and put it to good use for the better of humanity; the second one that looks at the first one discovery and say 'I can turn that into a weapon'; and the third one that look at that and says 'I can turn that into a porn'."""
"All Haber managed to do was speed-up the processes. Make plants grow faster, check, make people drown on land, check, kill my wife, check."

"Nice work, more detailed than what shown in nat geo's series ""genius"". Your work and you, are both awesome, as Always."
The amount of people helped from his invention is significantly more Than the amount of people got killed. After all he was a man working for his country. I don’t blame him for that.
And now the food shortages are coming
"I was 2km away from that explosion in Beirut, fell off my chair while working. Cracks formed in my apartment ceiling plaster and the whole building was shaking.

Not fun."
That last part really had nothing to do with Haber. Honestly shouldn't have been included. Haber had as much to do with Zyklon as the man Walt Disney had to do with The Avengers.
"I thought it was interesting that Nazis co-opted a Jewish man's work to facilitate genocide of their own countrymen. No honor among warlike nationalists as it were. Cannibalizing your own auxiliaries and their resources probably led to a significant brain drain as the empire devolved into a frenzied Pervitin political machine. Nazis even called atomic science a ""jewish science"" before the Manhattan Project succeeded, so it actually was quite an interesting connection there they used the work of others but rarely ever designed or created new weapons themselves besides wildly over engineered tanks and coal planes. Even their V-2 rocket research programs mainly relied on slave labor. A common trend in the mind of an enclave of tweaker racial Dunning-Kruegers I've noticed. Hyper specialized for warfare, chemistry and reverse-engineering. Basically gorilla nerds, yet they largely relied on or would try to claim the technology of those they deemed inferior to feed the illusion of an intellectually superior monolith."

Science and engineering is what has built the world around us.
"This is a great video, with a great conclusion.

I disagree with the implicit argument that because ""another one would have done it"", we cannot hold responsible the one who actually did it.
Other chemists would have worked out chemical weapons ? Then their responsibility would be in question.

However, neither do I like the idea of judging and condemning past actions from our present standpoint : Haber had no objective framework telling him where to stop. 
For the military, war crimes can be punished because what constitutes a war crime has been defined in advance.
I believe we should start there"
"we can absolutely condemn past actions from our present perspective, plenty of ppl were anti-war and even einstein was a pacifist! saying that we shouldnt condemn the past is ridiculous because we need to learn from our history or else..."
"good video, I always love these videos.  I learn a lot, not only because of what is shown in the video, but it also helps me to listen and understand English better."
"Great documentary.  But please do not say Einstein wasn't a patriot and Haber was.  Einstein and Haber were both German patriots.  They simply chose to address the issue of war in different ways.  Peace between U.S. and Russia that ended the Cold War is proof that ANYONE can make peace, as long as there is mutual respect and win-win deals involved.

  I do not blame Haber's colleagues for boycotting his Noble Prize win. While Haber did indeed save millions of lives, there was no justice for the sins of his past.  If anything, Haber's invention should have been seen as redemption for his past crimes against humanity - something that does not require recognition or awards."

Thank you so much for the work you do!"
14:00 the same false logic used when the bombs were dropped huh
"Wow, mind-boggling video! I don't know what to make of Haber. I'd say all-in-all, he wasn't such a good guy since he consciously decided to build chemical weapons, knowing how deadly they were. I even heard that Einstein got very angry at him because of his efforts in this regard. Still, perhaps I owe my life to him - pretty bizarre!"
"I hate the conclusion of this whole video.  It makes it seem as though we are powerless to manage the results of our discoveries.  That should not at all be the moral of the Fritz Haber story.

His story is a familiar one.  A powerful man's ego, lack of ethics and confidence in his own moral rectitude led him to evil.  We have seen this pattern in all different fields of science.  The lesson  in these cases isn't that scientists have no agency when it comes to what other people will do with their discoveries.

The lesson scientists should draw from these evil, negligent, and/or callous men is to do research that is moral.  Fritz Haber's story isn't one where his great discovery was subverted and he could have never predicted it would be used for evil.  No.  Fritz knowingly developed weapons to murder people en masse.

Scientists have agency here, we shouldn't throw our hands up and pretend we don't."
"This was very interesting. I live in Russia and what i'm seeing here might be very similar to what Haber saw participated in thinking he's doing something good for his country. And then a monster emerged... And i'm looking at my country now and i see a political chimera being born. And so many people don't realize that they feed it with their misconceptions, illusions and ignorance. To me, Haber is a very smart chemist who aimed at solving problems fast and concrete, but who failed at the moral front and obviously didn't consider the outcome in case his country lost. History truly does repeat itself..."
"unfortunately, the world will destroy itself. It's easy to see when low IQ people are contstantly denying globally scientifically accepted issues like climate change. 
Politicians (mainly Republicans) are the root cause and will be the end of our world as we know it..."
Why is there so many German scientists lmao
"Operation Paperclip, and before that germans are a big part of both the Anglosphere and Latinsphere because of their trade network. They downplayed their role in the US when Germany declared war, but they never really left. Many american and argentinian industrialists in particular had German family and trade connections such as Bayer and Ford (probably why Operation Paperclip was a priority) and we really wanted their chemistry and rocket science in exchange for giving them amnesty and shielding them from the Hague and warcrime tribunals"
"Another episode from the ""Derek reads you Wikipedia entries"" series."
"Nice Video, but BASF is not only germanys biggest chemical Company but also the worlds biggest with the biggest chemical factory being the BASF Stammwerk in Ludwigshafen or as you called it oppau. Oppau just seeing a part of Ludwigshafen. Carl Bosch, the chemist who made the process possible at industrial scale also became the head of that company later on and there are lots of things named about him in the region - for example my former high school in the heart of Ludwigshafen."

I choose now to turn from my sins, my self-centeredness, and every part of my life that does not please you. I choose you. I give myself to you. I receive your forgiveness and ask you to take your rightful place in my life as my Lord and Savior. Write my name in the book of Life and set me apart. Lord reign in my heart, fill me with your love, and help me become a person in your image. Jesus restore me and make me new. Thank you, Lord. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen."

"It’s true that scientists can’t necessarily be considered responsible for the wicked ways that their science is applied, and it’s true that scientific advancement can be considered to be collectively inevitable, in a sense — a sort of entity unto itself, with scientists operating as just the worker bees that move it forward. Given a large enough system, individual scientists might be thought to be irrelevant, even, to the inevitability of the advancement, being replaceable, as you say, and it wouldn’t make any sense to think of individual contributions as carrying any moral component. But that’s a big qualifier. The size of the system in Haber’s day was small enough that the choices he made in how to direct his energies and apply his talents would have immensely consequential outcomes and it seems fair to believe that things would have gone differently without him. Nitrogen capture for agricultural application is the sort of thing that was driven by such powerful economic factors that his contributions in this area might be considered inevitable and probably even historically irrelevant, with these advancements being poised to occur without any special genius. It might be argued that his contributions would have been used by malicious actors in war and that personal culpability would make no sense, but in this case, he devoted himself to that outcome and made efforts that inarguably changed the lives of many in ways that entail a knowing and moral intention. He doesn’t get to use his status as a “mere scientist” to cover for his actions as a moral agent. 

The work that anyone does, whether historically consequential or inevitable, might"
Great
Very well made.
"This day and age, it is extremely popular to recast people from the past as evil, simply for doing what was right at their time, or doing something that resulted in evil by no fault of their own.

I blame modern education, which is designed to create judgmental results, instead of simply educating the facts."
I would say he has a self canceling legacy.
I guess it is all in the eye of the beholder. Were you in the millions killed or the billion saved
Amazing his justification is the same as the atomic bomb use. Everyone thinks they are doing a good thing.
bravo

"Saved billions, while killing millions? How laughable. This murderous psychopath with a white lab coat had no more to do with saving anyone than  the number of people I save by taking a pack of cigarettes out of circulation per day. This is pure babble.

Ah...Haber Bosch process

A Spiritual authority does this
"I am of the opinion that we should always be careful not to be too judgemental. Looking back on someones decisions in life and judging them with the knowledge of today is pretty flawed. Condemning someone from the safety of ones own peaceful home is easy. But good and evil are at the end of the day two sides of the same coin. And most people beleave themself to be on the side of good. Being very patriotic was normal at the start of the 20th century. So doing everything in your power to make sure your country does not lose a war cant by itself be condemned. There usually is only two outcomes to a war. Your country loses or it wins. Trying to prevent destruction and suffering in your own country is most of the time synonymous with bringing destruction upon someone else. Condemning Haber means you have to also condemn Oppenheimer for example. We should not let the victor of a war determine who was good and who was evil. Because that leads to a distorted view on history. The real evil are not humans or science. It is war itself. War knows no real victor. Everyone loses at the end. It brings out the worst of humanity on both sides. So stories like the one of Fritz Harber should be a lesson to us that righteousness is to a large degree in the eye of the beholder. It is important to always question ones own motives. And most of all it is a lesson to never resort to violence in the first place.

Also some additional facts: While chemical weapons have a terrifying reputation and for good reasons (they kill people in very nasty ways after all), they were rather ineffective in the grand scheme of things. One hundred thousand killed people is a huge amount. But that is still only about 1% of the overall losses of soldiers during the war, even less if you also count civilians."
"Excellent work about one of most fascinating character (in his ambiguity between Evil and Good) of the human history. Maybe the best thing is: stop perpetuating birth/death cycle. An answer to Fermi paradox, too"
"Science isn't good or evil. It's amoral. Humans, on the other hand, can be moral or immoral. The problem is that we can't yet control whether a person with a level of genius that can unlock a given scientific discovery is moral or immoral. Also, those that are in power, and can use a geniuses discovery, may be moral or immoral.

A fundamental change in human behavior is the only way this species is going to survive."
19:28 He seems like he's lost a couple nights of sleep after learning about Haber's story. lol
Lmao
"The dramatic irony of the “saved billions” part is that adding artificial fertilizer is only a short term fix, longer term it destroys the symbiotic ecosystem of healthy soil, and the runoff of excess nutrients from such artificially high-concentrated areas pollutes water. so, while his invention was able to feed people by helping create so much food, in the long run it left us with a reliance on unsustainable farming practices and a whole lot of mouths to feed"
@Revolutionary Bruh do be facts tho
nigga I don't care about water pollution. I'm alive because of his invention.
Totally agree with this. Nothing that kills this many humans should be put in the food 😂
"So what is your solution

Less people?"
"@Elvi Nimali Yep, a food crisis due to the overnight ban of chemical fertilizer. But if it had been a planned process of a shift to organic over a period of years, it myt have been possible to a certain extent. But it's a fact that full on organic would never be able to give the kinds of yields we get from chemical fertilizer. So if you have to go sustainable farming route, you just have to accept (or sacrifice?) that a few million or maybe a billion or so people would have to die of starvation. Greater good?"
So we owe him potable water as well?
He literally didn't kill a single person.
"I don't like the final description of Haber as potentially ""irrelevant for the larger story"" - as this can lead to the conclusion for certain individuals working in science, that they are freed morally from their actions, as ""any other scientist would do what I do if I quit"". I think we need moral responsibility in the whole chain of production, individuals, culture, leaders, politics, law. A single scientist might be replaceable by others - but might not; less efficiency in developing some technology matters. 

That said, our biggest problem as a human race seems to be that we have a very hard time stopping dangerous technology, before we have experienced the downsides the hard way first."
One's good intentions can produce a product that can always be used for another's evil desires. It all comes down to the human condition and what we choose to do with our power when we have it.
"The reason he's a villian is because he personally made the chemical weapons. It's not like they used his formulas for evil behind his back, he was doing that himself. Patriotism is a disease"

"He didn't do it, his invention facilitated it with the help of others.

Also, the heat waves effect could be a result of more asphalt and more foliage destruction in urban environments, not an increase of C02."
"The Fritz Haber process is one of the most beautiful chemical syntheses.  Undoubtedly he is one of the greatest German scientists and a true patriot of Germany.Everyone knows who Einstein is, and what did he do for science?  But few people know about how Haber saved Germany from starvation, and the army from complete defeat, since without the Chilean saltpeter, inaccessible due to the naval blockade, the production of ammunition is impossible.Thank you so much for this essay."
"@Adarsh Mohapatra So the fact of the matter is that the enemies of Germany announced a blockade, just like Russia is now, and the scientist chemist Haber and engineer Bosch nullified these sanctions.  But the main thing is that without nitrogen fertilizers it was impossible to feed the huge population of Germany, well, as the situation would be in Sri Lanka now."
Wow so he literally made ammunition for Germany from the air. Damn that's cool
Climate crisis cult is the biggest fraud in history
Haber is mid. I can name 683 people ive met irl smarter than him.

"20:30 Good point apart from the whole.. Chlorine saga.  That was quite purposefully made with his knowledge to do harm.  Sure someone else might have invented it and I'd say let it be them.  He has to take that one on the chin.  For whatever context you want to put it in to he still made that choice.  So yeah he's kind of a dick or a villain whatever box you want to try fit him in.  Each decision he made benefitted him or was selfishly driven.  Even his stance of solidarity was from a place of ego because he was Jewish he didn't stand in solidarity for not trying to make chemical weapons because they hurt people.  Fertiliser again he benefitted. No matter how smart or intelligent people are their ego seems to be such a big driver and it is this nature I believe that makes the double edged sword exist in the first place.

But you can also see this nature reflected in his partner who says for everything he has gained she lost.  The man was selfish that much can be deduced."
Guano! Collect the whole set.
He is wrong
The other piece of irony is that ammonia emissions via volatilisation are a leading contributor to global warming. The chemistry that allowed us to quadruple food production is also killing the planet.
Adaptation.
Its like when people criticise Hugo Boss for making the Nazis uniforms... As if the Nazis would have had to go to war naked if he didnt. Or as if they would have just gone home and forgot about the whole war thing.

"As a synthetic chemist, I've used chlorine a few times in the lab. I've briefly inhaled low concentrations of Cl2 when it off-gassed from reaction mixtures and it's really unpleasant, I can't imagine how bad a death by chlorine gas in the trenches was."
"I'm no chemist but as kids we learned that chlorine (which we got from the kid with a swimming pool) when combined with brake fluid (which was easy to buy) was highly reactive resulting in an extremely hot flame. We would take a large bottle or can, put in the two chemicals then drop in a compressed CO2 cylinder (used for soda streams.) Then we would run. The explosion could (and did) destroy brick letter boxes. We were so naughty!"
"My father is a chemist and one of his friends almost killed himself with  chlorine gas when they were both at university, because he did a very dangerous reaction that produced a lot of chlorine gas without a fume hood in an enclosed room. They intubated him and put him into an artificial coma for a few days, after that, he had to stay in hospital for weeks while taking high doses of opiates to fight the excruciating pain in his lungs. I think they actually had to remove one of his lungs or at least a big part of it (it's been a long time since my dad told me this story, so I'm not entirely sure) and he suffered from shortness of breath and some pain for the rest of his life. He died in early 2021, when he got sick with COVID, in his early 60s. There's a big chance that that previous injury contributed to his death. Chlorine is one hell of a weapon."
"@Hugo Nascimento yup. have done it and suffered the consequences... I need my girlfriend to tell me if something stinks or not... funny side note, trichloramine is also boom stuff and simple chloramine is what makes your eyes red on pools..."
"I still remember and am shocked by some old footage (possibly propaganda) of a soldier diying after breathing chlorine, there is a lovely rationalization of such war atrocities by saying ""well, we are actually sparing people from more suffering by (insert whatever thing the general thought would be less effective)""
Haber and company said ""if they see this horror, they will surrender faster..."", on the other side of the trench they said ""if we fire bomb their cities, they'll see the horror, and they'll surrender faster...""
those are the things that make me hail the antropocene extinction..."
Why weren’t you using a fume hood?
"2 CO2 + H2O + CaSiO3 = 2 CO3- + Ca++ + SiO2.  Ok. But how do you precipitate the Calcium carbonate so you can keep driving the reaction to the right? E.g.: Why do we 'lime' oligotrophic lakes & rivers instead of 'basalting' them? My understanding was that granite and most basalts are acidiferous, and leachates from them actually dissolve bio-available carbonates. I don't mind being wrong and/or naïve, or maybe I'm talking about an unrelated process?"
"“He’s the reason we’ve got 8 billion humans today”

Gracias Derek. Tus vídeos son cada vez mejores
Thank you.  Excellent video.  The availability of nitric acid derived from natural nitrate sources drove the weapons industry for several decades.  And Britain with control of the seas could chock Germany off from these supplies thus starving Germany’s ability to wage  war.   Until Harbor’s process changed this dynamic.   So nitrogen fixation could be cited as the technology that allowed WW1.
Beautifully tragic. Love the storytelling.

Result is a 800:1 positive result of scientific advancement. You have worse odds in your drive to work.

However, a handful of dedicated people could end all life on earth with science if so inclined. Just two of our several thousand nuclear weapons is enough to put us into nuclear winter."

"I’m pretty sure if haber was a British and won the war through chemical weapons, he would be considered as a hero of humanity + hero of war"
Not gonna lie. I thought guano was something the producers of Ace Ventura made up. Turns out I was wrong 😂
"My opinion 
He is an Anti-hero portrayed in real life"
"Pointing out that historically, gold was ~$20 an ounce-- this is reflected in the $20 gold double eagle made from 1850 - 1933.. so it would have been one pound of Guano for ~4 ounces of gold."
"@Ghost2Coast Heh yeah I didn't even think it through that far. Just kind of assumed it would be powderized and go a really long way. 

But now that I'm thinking about it, that doesn't really make sense, given the high concentration of nitrogen in soil."
"and even that's wrong. He got his figure off of a miscited google search answer, the price for guano is suppose to be in TONS not pounds. So 4 ounces of gold would have bought you 2000 lbs of guano. Think about it from the farmers perspective, economically, how the heck would the farmer turn a profit at an insane price per pound. 1 lb of fertilizer is like what, maybe 100 plants?"
Haber isn't the only guy to win a Nobel Prize that went on to kill people. Obama won a Noble PEACE Prize and he used drones to murder thousands of Afghanis and Iraqi civilians.
"History is recorded by those who ""win"" the wars of culture.   That no good person who does good deeds also has not done things others would deem bad,  or things people less good can use to do bad.    In the end tools are just tools.   Its about how they are used and Social Ethics to matter being remembered that Good deserves to matter., that good must need to matter with mindfulness to total good not at the exclusion of anyone wrongfully.,   that there are no ""protected groups"" aside the very young, old, or disabled.

History and Reality are indeed complex complicated things that must never be erased."
He’s like a German Walter white
"Derek's final thought reminds me about how science is neither good or bad but what we do with the knowledge that makes it so. I disagree with his belief that Haber is irrelevant because somebody else would have invented the same thing; as Derek himself said, chemists spent 100 years trying to manufacture nitrogen, and potentially could have spent another 100 had Haber not figured it out. Also he could have boycotted the war like Einstein but he didn't. It could have been somebody else who invented mustard and xyrcon gas but he decided to do it instead. 
Speaking to Derek's final point, as I'm increasingly starting to believe about politics as well; society has to agree to use science for good, if even one person chooses otherwise the whole thing breaks down. Unfortunately humans are known for going against the grain and rebelling against norms so we will never truly fully agree one way or the other"
"This is the perfect ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"" arc I've ever seen."
"Haber never intended to help anyone, why don't we celebrate Bosch who did intend to make it possible to create fertilizer? Haber literally used his invention the first several times to kill allied soldiers. Bosch was looking to help all mankind. They invented the same process at the same time. Yet we are still talking about that asshole Haber who only intended to make weapons of war."
Haahahah clasical jew

"Before synthetic fertilizer was invented, farmers planted nitrogen-fixing crops such as legumes (beans).   Crop types were alternated which also controlled insects without insecticides.
Modern industrial farming techniques of planting the same crop year after year on the same land has led to dead zones in lakes and oceans from fertilizer runoff, pesticide resistant insects, and herbicide resistant weeds.
The main purpose of GMO is to allow crops to tolerate the pesticides and herbicides that are supposed to protect them, and those chemicals are being used in ever increasing amounts, without any safe exposure level ever being established. 
This is the reason people oppose GMO, and Monsanto develops it."
With the state of the world these days he probably should have saved millions and killed billions...

"No matter what scientists invent, one day it will be used in war."
"Phosphorus, beneath nitrogen in the Periodic Table, has similar energy bonding properties.  A biochemical substance, adenosine triphosphate, is used in living organisms as a sort of ""energy currency,"" because it can release phosphate groups, providing energy to drive a multitude of necessary biochemical processes."
"...And furthermore, if the past few decades are any indication, science and technology have never improved overall quality of life, and in fact, the greatest period of the most rapid of advancements in the latter if not the former has correlated to tremendous decline in that area, as I have witnessed and experienced personally. It would be even worse without the conveniences, but it is not nearly as good as it was without them when things were so much better overall."
This must be one of the best videos that I‘ve watched this year. Keep em coming! :D
"A very captivating and unfortunate story. Thanks for sharing, Derek."
"We may not know the exact form it will take, but we can be absolutely sure that if we invent something that is better at killing people than the current collection of deadly weapons, it WILL be turned into a weapon. And the side that wins whatever war is popular at the time using that new weapon will write history to make themselves glorious. The side that loses will bemoan their loss and vilify people who the winning side regard as heroes. Has that ever failed to happen? So is truth nothing more than perspective?  Haber  just happened to be on the wrong side of things doing his very best to save his country. How can anyone argue that he is other than a hero and patriot."
I’m intrigued by the fact the Haber’s wife was a chemist and wonder if it was at least partly her invention. I would have liked to know what her work entailed. Surely she didn’t take a phd in chemistry to do nothing with her knowledge. Possibly it was because her husband put “their” invention to such evil purposes she couldn’t bear it and killed herself.
"If I remember the biographies I read right, they worked together a lot. I think she does deserve a lot of the credit, and maybe part of the blame."
For a woman in that time it was impressive for her to study at all. Shw was probably not that important.
"I'm sure she was an average scientist who kept telling haber it wouldn't work. In the end maybe that's what gave him drive or somehow enabled him to do it but I doubt she directly gave a hand.
Her marriage was also not going well which I assume is because her husband was pursuing an 'impossible' task."
Her letter says what he gain she lost?!! Is she talking about happiness or her work?   Am I watching too much detective movies 🤔

That smart fool turned his genius of supporting life into death. Well what's done is done. Very sad story. You know fritz owes his early success to his wife's support. I'll remember this woman a PhD in chemistry and probably protested and pleaded with her husband to stop the insanity. I'll remember her favorably.
"But CO2 is also vital for plants to grow, the more CO2 the more they grow; so this sponsored effort seems counter productive... We really can't stop or create Ice-ages nor warmth periods, all the science says is that we could move the niddle a few % but that's it. Some people are afraid of rising tides and others are bussy building new islands."
"Interesting you compared Haber’s chemical weapon lab to the Manhattan project. In a sense, they are really similar.

Nuclear bomb is way more capable and efficient than chemical weapon in terms of killing, but maybe it’s the different ways in which they kill that make people feel somewhat differently about the two weapons. I guess because quick death (nuke) is considered more humane than a slow and excruciating death (chemical), even when the former can kill many more much faster. (Actually nukes have similar inhumane aspect since they also kill people with radiation.) Anyways, somehow people feel differently about nuclear weapon (Maybe that’s not true? Maybe that’s only my own misunderstanding?) I feel most people consider the Manhattan project scientists as war heroes, meanwhile we have Haber and his chemical weapon that conducted very similar business and are deemed evil.

In a sense, Haber’s reasoning was correct when he thought a more capable weapon can save many lives by ending the war sooner, because nuclear bombs pretty much did just that (i.e. ending WWII between US and Japan), and nukes have, in a sense, been deterring large scale warfare due to their world-ending deadly power.

I think Gatling had the same reasoning when he worked on his machine gun where he believed more efficient killing machine can save more lives by ending the war sooner. Maybe they are correct? Maybe that (inventing more powerful killing machines to deter war) is exactly what’s been going on behind the scenes this entire time? I don’t know."
Why didn't humans just use urine as a source of nitrogen?
"By definition,
Without Bad,

"It's doctorate in chemistry, not ""Philosophy doctor"", lmfao"
"meet Fritz Haber - the german scientist who boosted production of fertilizers, but also the production of chemical weapons.

The answer to the question how to use science solely for good purpose is easy: by shunning those who support science for evil purposes, no matter is scientists or companies.
The answer that ""somebody else would have invented it then"" is irrelevant, because we just don't know IF - and WHEN.
Maybe by this time better regulations would have prevented it, maybe by this time war would actually be over and there would be no need to explore this branch of science any longer.

A good example is the use of laser weapons - which could be effective on battlefields, but would cause large numbers of soldiers being blinded as a direct effect, that would later even do worse harm to the affected society in the aftermath (i recommend to read into the story of the ""byzantine blinding"" at this point).

Luckily we have never seen these weapons in combat up this date, most probably for the lack of scientists willing to introduce it and wise men in politics and armies not to push these efforts any longer. (Yes i know that the soviet empire crumbled - but there were other countries which would have been able to take up their effort at this point).

Let's hope that moral standards will prevail in the future - and let us rather ask the question - what we can do to improve it, rather then relativizing the crimes comitted by those who broke these laws for ""a higher good"".
The story of Fritz Haber showed very clearly that eventually you will reap what you sow - scientist should be wise enough to know this. For me, he will remain a villian forever for the things he had done."

So I thought it as a joke that Eistein, who is the most well know mathematician and scientist that ever was, was an actual ""evil scientist,"" even though he never had such intentions, was a pacifist and also believed in God and made huge leaps of progress of our understanding of the universe. Conclusions about Haber could be made similarly, which Derek points out. 
I like your closing thoughts Derek. I'm glad you can share your ideas."

"Ah yes. A german murderer and a person directly responsible for the overpopulation crisis. Truly, a person worthy of respect."
"The answer is: the humanities. Every bit of scientific information is a potential double-edged sword, but only a philosophical take on those things will allow us to use it better rather than worse. There's that common anecdote about a scientist who spent so long wondering how to arrive at a conclusion that they never bothered to think if the process was worth it. I think about that all the time, how society regards STEM fields way over the humanities, but without a humanities hue to scientific development, we'd be nothing but robots churning out that (mitchell and webb reference) killing all the poor is the way forward."
"In many parts of the world, cow dung was used as manure for the plants. And even human excrement, that is ‘night soil’, is used as manure for the crops. Can you make a video on how advanced nations are trying to solve the disposal of human excrement problems all over the world?"

"I don't get it, how did he go on scene and accept the nobel-prize if he was already dead? The reason you said ppl disliked his prize was that he had done chemical weapons and (inadvertently) helped the holocaust, but he died before the latter, and was in a war after the former (dying soon after that ended), with no mention of the prize being given between those points (so must be after the latter, which was after his death), and you actually explicitly stated he only ran his institute after the war meaning he never did anything nobel related during that period."
"Do you know how much human misery and death would've been avoided if we could've just somehow prevented World War I from happening?  Every major conflict in the 20th century is a *direct* result of that war.

The treaty of Versailles that ended the war directly led to Hitler's eventual rise and thus World War II. (And the invention of nuclear weapons used to end that war.)

The Russian Revolution is a direct result of the Tsar getting involved in WWI -- the peasants were tired of being set to the German front to be killed, so they revolted, thus ushering in Communism and the Soviet Union.

*NONE* of the conflicts *after* WWII that were the result of the Cold War would've existed were it not for the Russian Communist Revolution, which wouldn't have happened were it not for WWI.

Mao Tse Tung wouldn't have come to power, were it not for the Communist Revolution in China, supported directly by the Soviet Union and Stalin, which wouldn't have existed but for the Russian Revolution and WWI.

I could go on and on...   It's amazing how one single event can be responsible for so much misery and death in the world."

stupid plants not realizing air is 78% nitrogen
"10:45 so people before Haber's nitrogen technique had less amounts of nitrogen in their bodies? what effect did that have, if anything?"
"Yes those scientists totally irrelevant. Einstein? Phe, who cares I can do it too. :-) You know there's Nobel prize of peace. So there's also should be Nobel prize of war, for such as Haber. Because what used to kill will one day be used to heal. It's just inevitable, there's countless examples."

"I think hat Fritz is not to be blamed at all. If you think of each decision he made while considering how the situation at that instant was, you can easily argue that the man lived and died a hero. The issue is, from our perspective, many of us fail to recognize the entire picture. Many of us are mad because he was the reason behind the death of a 100,000 soldier, while from his perspective he helped his country defeat a 100,000 *enemy* soldier. Many of us, especially when we look at such numbers, think that all life is the same - which is not true in the case of wars. And the irony is, even if you consider that all lives are the same and look at the entire picture from that perspective, then you can't deny that numbers matter. In that sense then 4,000,000,000 >>>> 100,000."

"The last question posed: How do we do all this without harm? (note: not specifically those words)

The answer, to me, is obvious: Remove need and want.  However, that answer is simpleton in nature, surely, and does not appropriately encompass the scope of things that would have to be done to do that simple thing.  Needs and wants are many... food, air, water, shelter, clothing, medicine, power/influence, money, love... all these and more.  If those needs of humans are removed, then the weapons no longer become a thing, because nobody needs or wants.

Which is silly.  What point of existing when you need and want nothing?"

"I think there was a lot of relatively basic information in the video, but it was also an integral part of the introduction and damn was it slick.  These videos are some of the absolute best of what YouTube has to offer."
"Its sad to hear about the way this all played out. You have a man who managed to create Nitrogen for the benefit of everyone. And then when war broke out, he tried to use his own knowledge for his own peoples prosperity. 

Noone holds the people who created the Nuclear Bombs to anywhere near the same standard as Haber yet destroying large amounts of lives in the process. However they were on the allies side. If those people were on the other side, and had killed our own, this same story would be told differently. 

In the end, he managed to create Nitrogen at a time when it was very much required for crops and the population at large. Yes it may have been created otherwise, but who knows if people would have suffered in the mean time. 

Being able to separate the good from the bad with the achievements people have been able to make is very much required. Doing what he could for his country? Doesn't sound like a terrible thing to me."

"cool but, the use of synthetic fertilizers are what is killing the soil
abundance maybe, but poor nutrition and farming this way leads to killing the soil effectively reducing yields , damaging water systems through runoff  and rendering the land useless for growing crops.

I'd say it has done more harm than good.
This video really needs a follow-up especially for the effects of what synthetic fertilizers has done to the soil, health, nutrient and environment"
Very good video as usually

"I have to wonder with both of them being chemists and his wife's strange letter, who actually was the inventor of all this, and who was simply good enough to understand the invention and had the ""correct"" gender for the time to be recognized."
"The idea that the scientist is irrelevant is a horrific take. Perhaps someone else might have discovered it later, but Haber *did.* And that counts for a lot. Trying to depersonalize and dehumanize progress is dangerous, and disempowers everyone. If progress will happen anyways, then I have no responsibility towards that progress, and if that idea becomes widespread, *we make no progress.* It's a wildly irresponsible tagline, and a childish way to deal with the fact that even heroes can be villainous."
"In Paul's Offit book Pandora's Lab he had a whole chapter on Faber. He goes more in depth about the creation of the factories that extract Nitrogen from the air, about the geopolitical situation during that time and the ethical implications of his actions.

Great story until you started spewing crap about co2.
Derek did such a good job with making such an informative video o7
this is just amazing
"You got slatpeter and guano all mixed up, saltpeter was the one used for fertilizer but mainly to make gunpowder. Also, your narrative is backwards, the reason Haber synthesized artificial saltpeter(ammonia) was to make gunpowder for Germany during ww1, as importing was too costly."

"The world we live in forces people to go to extremes ,but the irony is that balance is never extreme and we cant force those extreme thinkers to understand this obvious logic..."

If your response to malicious use of knowledge is to blame the discoverer of knowledge, it's fundamentally an argument for ignorance."

This is one of the best videos in your channel! Great work! Keep it up
3.26 plants get their N from the soil?! If you pay attention you can hear the heart of a nitrogen fixating bacteria braking.
2:35 i get it :) I know why that German guy is related to bird poop trade :)
"Hold up. Why did you not mention Legumes? Synthetic nitrogen is not only one way the fertilize plants. 
In ecological agriculture, which evolved besides conventional agriculture, they never used synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. Or synthetic pesticides, which come with heavy nitrogen fertilization. The plants grow softer and more dense, which boosts aphids and fungi.

The footprint of that synthetics is one of the worst things in agriculture.. I mean, the enormous energie used to fix it from the air comes from fossil fuels. With all its hidden costs.

In ecological agriculture they use legumes to fix N in the soil witch can then be used by following crops or animals (which excrements then are used to fertilize too) or directly as food (beans for example). They also need to hold N in the crop - cycle more effective. 
It´s not like its backwardly like the ""good old days"". It´s more advanced then the system before Haber - Bosch, an sustainable alternative. Ecological agriculture is not perfect too (but more sustainable), but at least some critical thought on synthetics.

I guess there were money - interests too in not shutting down the war - machinery, lucrative providing fertilizer and pesticides. I doubt it was the best way for humans and nature.
Greetings from Germany (sorry for my englisch)."
"I see him like a successful worker. He made really great effects of his work, and i would not try to describe him as good or bad person. It is as simple as that"
"Equally important was Carl Bosch, who took Haber's tabletop setup and scaled it up to factory size, which, among other things, required finding a catalyst other than osmium.  He also won a Nobel prize for this, and the process is most referred to by both their names: the Haber-Bosch process.  Bosch went on to be one of the founders, and first head of, the chemical mega-conglomerate IG Farben.  IG Farben would become notorious for its practices during World War 2.  It was the company that made Zyklon B.  Half of its workforce was slave labour and it had a factory that was effectively a concentration/death camp: Auschwitz III AKA Auschwitz Monowitz.  IG Farben was also involved in the medical experimentation conducted at a number of concentration camps."

Blaming a scientist for the actions of a government is myopic and misunderstands the true danger.   The power of government to take the science and use it for unjust and immoral ends is the problem.
"@Shubham Sarkar Misguided but in the context of his place and time he and others thought him a “patriot”.    That’s one of the most pernicious things about government, it turns otherwise morally repugnant behaviors into things to be revered and respected.   As with most every military “war hero”, their behavior would typically be considered aberrant in any other context and by practically all those on the opposing side."
"I mean he did want to create a deadly gas to kill people or rather ""end the war quicker"" during ww1 so much so that he scraped his whole production to make that gas"
"I was in tears, you make the best videos thank you so much sir, it helps me so much you are an true inspiration."
Where is the ending sound effect?
ALL SCIENTIST ARE KILLER OF THE PLANET BECAUSE MANY SCIENTIST ARE MADE OF REPTILLIAN ALIEN
"what? Even in your imagination this doesn't make sense. Why would all scientists be killers of the planets if only ""many"" of them are ""reptillian alien""?"
"This is a great story of karma. When he did good, Haber was made wealthy, famous, and was loved for the good he did and his family did well. When he did bad things, everyone turned on him, he lost literally everything he held dear, and died with a legacy marred by shameful circumstances.

I would say that I would consider Haber to be a good, well-meaning person that was looking to solve problems, without having the social skills to understand the corruption that can come with such power. Even when he was helping to blow things up and smoke people out of the trenches, the goal was to end war faster, which he assumed would save lives; especially those of his people.

I feel like if Haber could have seen his own life in this form before making the choices he did, he might have stopped at fertilizer and retired. I don't think that he ever meant to deal so much death; to kill literally millions, most of which were innocent civilians.

Contrarily, we still haven't seen the end of nuclear tech, so those people that looked at him with shame and hate for his deed in war (like Einstein) could still be the undoing of the rest of us."
What brings life brings death.
"Nitrogen products are now made from Natural gas. There are currently restrictions on its use in farm fertilizers as it is claimed to harm the environment. The problem with restrictions is that food production drops dramatically without its use. Sri Lanka has a food shortage due to environmental restrictions on its use...  The price of nitrogen fertilizers in the US has increased dramatically causing financial hardship to farmers and the restrictions on its use has resulted in lower crop yields.... As important as environmental concerns are, high crop yields to prevent food shortages are the bigger priority."
"Have you ever suffered from a cockroach infestation? It is caused by access to a food and water supply. Technology has provided humans with both. It's a chicken and egg situation. Access to food and water leads to excess humans which leads to food and water shortages. Around the 1900's the global population was roughly two billion which was probably the upper limit for a truly sustainable, practical global population. As a species we humans have infested the planet and are destroying it and ourselves in the process."
"Great video, hadn't realised the whole tragedy behind Fritz Haber. However I was surprised and disappointed to see no mention of Carl Bosch. Everyone forgets the Chemical Engineer! Without Bosch the process would have stayed benchtop scale, as he was key to developing the requirements for upscaling to industrial quantities, including better catalysts than osmium (iron based) that help make it more profitable and practical for scale up, and the general process equipment for coping with the high temperatures and pressures."
@Ben Avery Semmelweis was Hungarian.
"Yeah, I was waiting the whole video for the Haber-Bosch process and I was also suprised Bosch wasnt even mentioned."
No worry we the all students here in Asia learn haber-bosch process
"There are a lot of nonfamous German scientists. The only one I'm dredging up at the moment is Koch, got another, Semelweis, I think!"
This. I was wondering when he would mention using finely divided iron as an alternate to osmium. I don't think ammonia could have been developed in large-scale using osmium as a catalyst
This felt like a Cosmos episode. Great work
"""... how do we...""
Who's ""we""? I can't remember authorizing or blocking any research at any point in my life. The people in charge, however, are perfectly fine with the way things are as long as they can get away with it (and they can). Entire countries torn in civil wars is just a way for them to grab more money for themselves. 
So who's this ""we""?"
"I really appreciate the last question that you pose, and I think that we need to be ready to admit that there may be no solution on the scale of the individual. it's a hard reality, but we very well may need to radically rethink the role we have as individuals and as a species. BUT we must also rethink the fatalist view of humanity's inevitable progress that permeates science education (I'm looking at you Neil deGrasse). We are not fated to a specific technological epoch, as we are neither fated to a specific economic or political system. Anyways, ok now I'm the one ranting. BUT thank you for the super important reflection."
"Thank you for share behind knowledge, these things were never told in schools or colleges"
"Saying ""bread from air"" feels kind of misleading. Actually it's almost entirely bread from fossil fuels. Using the Haber process you take in air and methane, you burn a whole bunch of coal, oil and what have you to compress, heat, condense and separate the ammonia (all in all with around 15% efficiency) which you then used to grow food for people and cattle. That's how the population grew by 4 billion, but can you guess what happens when the fossil fuels run out?

And no, bird guano isn't any more renewable, our own on the other hand..."

"The greatest human technologies always have two sides, one where it can be used to bring great life and prosperity, the other even greater death and destruction. Atomic energy could power the world yet the atomic bomb needs no explanation."
this is boring as f.  can someone tell me the point?
never knew Hitler was a good chemist
"In Atom bomb government effectively forced the scientists to work for them, but here the scientists themselves volunteered to create gas which would be used for holocaust. It is quite jarring that a Jewish was the one who provided the means to Nazis to do those atrocities.

In the end, his so called patriotisms led him to convert his own invention into the weapons of war. Maybe the root cause was and will be the naivety of humanity to even fight wars to occupy the fictional boundaries they created."

"Today, almost 50% of the nitrogen in the human body originated from the Haber-Bosch process. In other words, half of the global population would not be alive without it. The industrial synthesis of ammonia is crucial for our modern society. But it also has negative ecological impacts: The Haber-Bosch process has a high energy demand and consumes currently 3–5% of the global natural gas production as fuel. Also, the excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers leads to algal blooms and ecological degradation. Thus, the Haber-Bosch process contributes both to climate change and biodiversity loss."

Is it really a good thing we’re 4 more billions? We use so much more ressources and are destroying ecosystems across the world which will ultimately end up in the death of millions if not billions.

"Love the video.  However, I disagree with the failure to condemn a man that knowingly created weapons intended to kill people.  Especially, weapons that inflict massive pain prior to death.  I still give him much credit for the help in farming."
This is best explanation and exact facts shown 🔥🔥 man you are great. The way you show explanation 🔥🔥🔥🔥😘😘 of topic is unimaginable 🙏🙏🙏
we ganna forgive Albert Einstein for his contribution in atomic bomb and forget him cuz his invesions were used in war

"The victor gets to write history. If Germany won WWI and/or WWII, he would have received the Nobel Peace prize"
14:20 This is terrifying because although world leaders signed treaties not to use nuclear bombs it makes you wonder if one ever will. If we broke treaties in the past who's to say it can't happen again?
ever heard of nitrogen fixing plants? how can you say farming depletes the soil of nitrogen? you must be completely ignorant on the theme not to know that only a certain type of farming does that to soil. The only thing this scientist achieved is making it possible to keep using a wrong method of farming for a longer period of time for the sake of the multinational food corporations. that 's not saving the lives of billions that's literally saving the wallet of very few people.
"and also allowed the system as we know to function, where people are alienated from nature and live in grids with no nature around them where they could be just eating from fruit trees indefinitely."
"I never agree the ""science is double-edged sword"" saying...you could kill some one with a chair if you wanted to...does that mean the chair is a double-edged sword?"
"Yeah, except that he didn't ""save"" billions, he just allowed everyone else to unnecessarily procreate (and feed) billions (of pointless people) and not just kill Ourselves off via starvation. Which we're still doing but now we're gonna take most other species with us because of how those billions often dominate the land, water and air and squander this planet's most precious resources in the name of selfish human constructs like ""happiness"" ""power"" or ""profit."" Humans don't live within their means and he enabled us to take that to the most extreme level in Human existence. Yeahhhh super dope! Haha net loss all around.

Fritz Haber: *“Equally Balanced…As All Things Should Be”*
"Well, victors write history. Nobody blamed american or russian scientist for their nuclear weapons research or chemical weapon research.
I think Haber is a tragic figure, that wanted to use all his powers to do the right thing. But he was just a human being, unable to see into the future and what would happen. Thus in the end, he had to witness the ruin he brought and lose everything he had worked for."

Is anyone feeling that way too?"
"Other scientists who played leading roles in their nation's wars were many of the ""Manhattan Project"", during WW2, to develop a US nuclear bomb.   J. Robert Oppenheimer was a principal example.   The ""father"" of the bomb later saw the dangers of entrusting government with such weapons and opposed the development of the hydrogen-bomb.   He was transformed from a national hero to a ""subversive"" by the bomb's advocates.   Those who opposed the complete development of the ""atomic"" bomb, when the danger of NAZI Germany's development passed, were without influence.   Scientists who develop such weapons for governments are the accomplices of barbarians."
"Natually people blame the scientists for inventing things. But unless that thing is 100% for killing people, it's really not their fault. In this case, the Gas used in ww1 is in deed his fault but the pesticides...I don't think he is the one to blame. And btw, even explosives are not evil. The mining businesses rely heavily on explosives. It's a very useful tool to modern civilizations."
"The most important thing about his story is: regardless of sides, war is hell..."
😳 literally my face after watching this!
"It is not whether he is a villin or hero, since technology can be used for both, good and evil; which depends on the person's use. For example, Nobel himself invented dynamite to make mining quicker, but his invention was misused. I could go on."
"Had the man been born British and invented the same chemical weapons, public perception would have been different.  He would have been a hero for accelerating the end of the war."

As counterintuitive as it may seem using herds of large herbivores and rotational grazing will actually restore the land and an incredibly high rate there was an experiment in Africa were they used rotational grazing and were able to see hundreds upon hundreds of percent of regrowth in the first year using a large enough rotational grazing area could provide plenty area to grow crops and still feed the breathing herbivores in the end nature already had the problem under control it's just when we remove the large Purge of herbivores we created soil runoff a lack of fertilization and the death of the soil
insightful video!

"Developing agriculture was the worst mistake the human race made. Hunter/gatherers had a healthy well balanced diet that limited their population growth.
In my lifetime the global population has more than doubled from three billion to nearly eight billion.
Fritz Haber is responsible for more misery and death than any other human not to mention the probable destruction of the earth as a habitable planet. Well done."
"So... every scientist is ""irrelevant to the process"" because that thing would have been discovered anyways?"
If this video came out 24hrs earlier I would have used Haber for my research project on a person of extreme significant to society Instead of Einstein
Inventions aren't inherently good or bad. That depends entirely on how they're used.
she wasnt happy in her marriage so she killed herself? for someone with a phd she wasnt very smart.
"Haber died of heart failure.... So, he drowned on dry land, just like the victims of his chlorine gas."
"That one difference between scientists and engineers.  Most scientists are insane in some way, and they lack the ability to understand the possible bad effects of their “research”.

Chemical weapons, nuclear weapons, biological weapons, Covid, killer bees, eugenics, and now they are itching to get into genetic research.  Ultimately the public tires of scientists dangerous games, and just like in the Frankenstein story, out come the torches and pitchforks"
The notion of using a newly invented weapon so it will shorten the war is so terribly wrong (Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and the idea that if I don’t do it someone else will is just a rationalization for doing bad things.

"As a German this makes me feel very uncomfortable. On the one side, he was one of the greatest chemists of all time, but on the other side, he was a war criminal. The difference between hero and villain can be small sometimes."
"im pretty sure the advancement of medicin, antibiotics, and vaccines also had an affect on the human population growth at the same time. nitrogen is just a small part of the equation"
Birdies
The main problem is to get the atmospheric nitrogen into Nitrate to nourish biological produce of aminic acids. Fritz Haber was a tragic figure giving the enemies of his culture to kill it. We learn this in Haber's home country as Haber Bosch procedure. But not great background information given as natural scientist teachers don't like to go too much in non direct related matters.
Suggestion: Make a video about the physicist Cesar Lattes
His work was that of designing weapons to kill people in painful awful ways. Why not highlight someone who wasn’t a monster?
Very interesting video thx

"Warriors, conquerors, emperors, Kings etc, are celebrated in our history.

However there's one little mentioned and inescapable fact, namely it's the nerds the tinkerers the inventors who built our high quality of life and knowledge and for the most part they are ignored because they often do not exhibit braggadocia and self-promotion so we think they're boring.

However I will maintain that boring nerds, tinkers, and inventors are what should be celebrated in our history.

"Regarding the bit at the end, what's that you were just saying about a double edged sword? You are effectively children playing with fire in thinking that you have the necessary skill to *control* things that are further beyond your understanding than you know. You could say that this is the ultimate in hubris and the ultimate offense to God. Not because of the desire to understand the world we live in, but the desire to control it as a means of personal fulfillment. It's greed that will bring the species to an end because you lack the will to root out such things for the benefit of all. Indeed, you actually praise those things, and the people that represent them.

But hey, you all have got it under *control* right?

By ""you"" and ""you all"" I'm referring to those who would put their own thoughts, opinions, and feelings about scientific understanding above the well being of others. The inordinate desire for money is a root to all kinds of evil. Maybe it should be taken away? However, it can also be a root to all kinds of good... If anyone had the will to do it.

Anyway, love the work you do in attempting to bring understanding to the people. Hope to see more."

"Hey just wanted to share a possible video idea(?): Say you had a special paint, that changes color at an even pace with the passing of time, say from blue to red. Then you paint a giant flat disk with the paint, and start spinning the disk extremely fast. Due to the theory of relativity, wouldn't you eventually see a color gradient with blue towards the outside of the disk, and red at the center?"
"@KJ Dude right! So theoretically it could work as a demonstration. There are luminescent paints that lose their glow over time, but I wonder if you could get a wheel spinning fast enough to see the difference."
"Yes. Since there is no universal inertial reference frame, each molecule of the color changing paint would experience its own time dilation based on its local speed through space-time. Very similar to the atomic clocks that were synchronous and one that was sent into orbit (increased velocity) and then returned to earth showed less time had passed."
This seems interesting

"Knowledge and technology do not kill on their own. An incredibly sharp sword, a gun, or zyklon gas lying on a table would generally not kill anyone. We need to stop blaming inanimate things for what people do. This is a burden that scientists and engineers should not have to contend with - unless they're conjuring up something specifically designed to cause harm (e.g. chemical, biological, nuclear weapons). We should be mindful about avoiding any impulse towards petulant demands for things to conform to some version of perfection. That impulse is part of our problem these days - there's a significant loss of perspective partly caused by the level of comfort provided by knowledge and technology (at least in the fairly developed parts of the world). Arguments like ""not having nuclear technology at all would completely eliminate nuclear destruction"" is interesting but not useful. However, for scientist and engineers out there- if you're working on something where success leads to something like free perpetual green energy, but failure means the immediate destruction of the planet, and you're still thinking about going through it...stop immediately, and find some other line of work. Preferably something that won't involve a catastrophe should you fail at whatever tasks the new line of work involves. That will help out A LOT in not destroying ourselves as we pursue knowledge and technological advances. Oh, and we'll keep an eye on you just in case you're tempted to potential destroy the world...again."
"14:48 ""Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly"" sounds an awful lot like ""the more you spend, the more you save"""
12:19 this is a lie. This was a deliberate strike by Isreali forces.
"I remember learning about this man in college chemistry. Being curious, I did research his work. I cannot see that the good he did overshadowed the harm he caused and the lives he took. Germans are such gifted chemists, but it always seems to bend them in ways that we can now see as predictable. He gave us further knowledge, but he didn't truly give us anything good some other person would have discovered as well. Nobody with any decency would have thought to create the horrific weapons he did. There is a reason my father walked away from his study of chemistry after receiving his doctorate. It's one of the many reasons I left molecular biology. Nobody wants to fund the good you can do. No. They want weapons."
... and doomed tens of billions. When the population boom caused by petro-agriculture meets the end of cheap oil there's going to be starvation unlike anything in human history.  And most of our ariable land has been stripped of nutrients due to generations of monoculture farming.
"The truly poetic irony in this story for me is the fact that Haber, who created the deadly yet indispensable nitrogen compounds, was awarded the Nobel Prize, created by Alfred Nobel to try and do good after inventing dynamite, which killed his own brother."

"@Matthew Sadler oh rad, and thx for explaining that mix-up! chemistry was never my strong suit tho I do find science absolutely fascinating. ur job sounds rly cool!"
"@Feral Animation No worries just some crossed wires…

Don’t worry you’ve filled in that blank from high-school history lessons, however I don’t need any more info on it, as I said I work in the pharmaceutical sector making/discovering new medicines to cure people not looking up poisons, although salts of cyanide and cyanogen halides are useful & common chemicals you’ll find in most organic chemistry labs; as long as you keep the pH of the reaction basic you’re gravy.

BTW reading the article it seems you mixed up the formulation of Zyklon A & B, the B compound contains the stabilisers & a lachrymator (severe eye irritant) compound. 

Most probably changed for ease of handling and safety of the prison guards, as cyanide gas has almost no smell, you get an early warning there is a leakage, when you start crying, and have time to take precautions before you are exposed to a fatal dose…"
"@Matthew Sadler  oh dang I *really* messed up here, I’m so sorry for just assuming the worst. 

Tbh that’s all the in-depth info I have on it, and even that was from a Wikipedia rabbit hole (though the article was about a riot on the US border in 1921).

But yeah, Wikipedia’s ‘death chamber’ article and its ‘zyklon b’ article both explain its use and composition, respectively. Both articles have cited sources, so that should be a good starting point for more info.

Sadly I don’t have any other specific info/suggestions besides ‘Google it’ (which just sounds snarky tbh tho that’s all I did myself), but I might look into it more later. If I do and I find anything interesting, I’ll reply again.

Sorry again for picking a fight, it’s a gross habit of mine and I usually know better than to act on it. You honestly seem like a decent person and we might have more in common than i first expected (or was open to, for that matter). Anyway, love ur pfp, hitchhikers guide is great."

"It's WWI not WWII, learn your fricking history."
This is the most complete story of this topic I've heard.  Most previous references shared limited details because of their passion that the creator of these poisonous gases get no positive press.  There is a reason why we don't publicly proclaim him to be the father of modern agriculture.
and yet it completely leaves out the chemical engineer / industrialization part of the Haber-Bosch process (see: work done by Robert Bosch)
"The story isn't over yet. It may ultimately kill billions if monocrop agriculture turns the land into a dust bowl with no top soil. Regenerative agriculture can restore the land, but it uses herds of ruminants, and popular opinion is currently opposed to that. So we are going to see it get worse as more people eat monocrop plant diets."
i love these types of videos so much
man induced over population
There is no such thing as over population! We could easily be 10 billion and eat enough food. The problem is inequality and carbon emission from developped countries.
"I understand Dereks point about science and most of it being a double edged sword. But there is a clear moral dilemma when it comes to specifically developing chemical weapons for use in war. I mean you even quoted Haber saying that whatever kills the quickest will save lives. This is a mad scientist we are talking about. The things you said at the end are certainly misplaced and even gross. The experiments done on holocaust victims may be describes as a double edged sword, but where is the justification in this phrase ""double edged sword""? We can understand that all true scientific experiments further our knowledge without throwing our hands up and leaving everything on the lab table."
"Scientists figured out that they could kill off all the mosquitos by genetically altering a relatively small number of them and releasing them.  They also figured out that it could cause a collapse of the entire food chain.  They decided not to go forward.  The idea that a comic book villain could kill everyone with known science with relatively easy to obtain information is the stuff of, well, comic books.  As an engineer I don't blame the scientist (or the engineer) for chasing a solution to a problem ... it's humanity that needs to be good enough to not use it to make things worse.  The fact that we have reached a level of understanding that it's not up to humanity but in some cases a single human is kind of scary."
"""In times of peace scientists belong to the world, in times of war they belong to their counties."" I wonder if he'd lived to see WW2, seeing as how he was Jewish, perhaps Haber's thoughts might have changed."

The truth is, all things used in peace whether it is agriculture, transportation, electricity....can be exploited and used as an advantage or weapon in war.

Everybody is enamored with the Hollywood version of the ""mad scientist"" and loves to chastise science and jump on a soap box about it, but we give businesses, corporations, and our own neverending greed a free pass."

"""It would be easy to paint Haber as a villain, or as a hero for inventing a way to feed Earths population. but another approach is to regard him as irrelevant because someone else would've figured out how to process it into chemical weapons"" Whether someone else would've done it is irrelevant to the fact that he did do it, intentionally and deliberately. If you do something good for the world and someone else misuses your invention for evil, then you are still a hero. But the moment you willingly do these evil things yourself you lose your hero status and become the villain, regardless of what good deeds you have done before. Becoming a hero may be hard, but staying a hero is even harder because as a hero it is all too easy to slip and fall."
100% agree.
"who just woke up and thought ""yeah lets put bird poop in soil"""
"I disagree with the premise that he saved billions of lives, as actually he just enabled for more people to live. There would've just been less people on the Earth, with that probably less misery and even starvation. So the guy was a net negative regarding both inventions, in my book."

Ahh imperialism
"Before the Haber process, we had the Birkeland–Eyde process for making nitrates. This is similar to the natural splitting of nitrogen in nature: air is pumped into a reactor which has electrodes and a magnet. High voltage is applied to create a curved electrical arc, and this converts the nitrogen and oxygen into NO2, which dissolves in water to make nitric acid. Obviously the process consumes an obscene amount of electricity (it's basically artificial lightning), making it useless except if you have virtually free electricity."
Wait this is a Deja Vu
The world is waiting for your to find peace and prosperity the EARTH IS AT PEACE what are y’all waiting for the facts are y’all worship negativity Y is the question?
very informative
Actually he also depleted soils worldwide and could easily kill billions again if we don't step away from it. And Holland is an example where it is going wrong. Proper organic farming can achieve the same but the industry never worked that way.
"""Nitrogen Fix"" I see what you did there"
A great example of how a brilliant intellect doesn't guarantee you to make wise political decisions.
"""regard him as irrelevant to the greater story."" yeah that´s why you made a video about him and titled it ""The Scientist Who Killed Millions and Saved Billions"" because he´s just that irrelevant"
And yet we now have have 7.5 billion to dispose of.
"I would suggest his wife committed suicide, because she helped him and possibly was the entire reason chloric gas came to be, not even knowing what her husbands intentions where.
As in those days lots of women helped or where responsible for inventions, but where never credited because they where women and inferior to men, and to not be ashamed as a man or for the invention to ever be accepted, they credited it to themselves.
Imo there should be more video's like this, but about the women, wives, daughters, mistresses from in the lives of these so called highly regarded male chemists."

"He's irrelevant because he's just an actor for inevitability - the real issue is that there is a mindset that is eager to undertake this role, thereby making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

This mindset is the same mindset that defends ""scientific progress""."
"That is a really good question to leave with, I would love to spend my life researching and developing new technologies, but it seems like we have to much tech to really deal with already... 
I think the main bottleneck in this issue is politics, we will probably have to revolutionize our way of organisation and orient ourselves toward a global identity (maybe even a cosmic or spiritual shared identity) that allows us to live out our freedom while also establishing some basic understanding of our differences and a common ground we all agree upon.

It's a really difficult task, the only technology i could see helping there is web3, maybe by establishing e-democratic elements like sound (and open-sourced) cryptographic protocols in governments, or keeping truely public and shared registries to automate burocratic processes and make democracy a little quicker, more transparent and maybe even more representative.
Just makes me think what the flipside of that technology would be..."

"I initially thought this video was gonna be about cyanide as fertilizer from the thumbnail.

Instead, I got a flashback to high school chemistry and the many forgotten months spent talking about Haber and ammonia factory processes, without actually talking about Haber. That makes a grand total of 2 tragic fertilizer chemist tales for parties."

"So when nitrogen factories fail, 4 billion people will starve? What a solid system we live in"
"For the first of the video the name Haber felt so familiar yet so foreign, then I pronounced it in my own accent and then it hit. Goddamn."
"The same could be said about scientists who promoted the development of nuclear bomb and those who participated in the actual development. They too wanted to save lives by ending the war faster, and even more by defeating Hitler before he gets the bomb. We generally don't think about them as villains, mostly because their side won the war, so their side got to write the history books.

Also being killed by poison gas isn't necessarily worse than many other kind of deaths you find on a battlefield. Dying in general is not a pleasant experience. Even simply being shot can be a slow and painful death.

There's also an arguments which says making war more horrific can prevent future wars. And by the same logic making wars ""cleaner"" only makes them more likely to start. Nuclear weapons strongly support this argument. There has never been a war where both sides had nukes. And not because they learned to get along peacefully."
Derek I'm in love with your channel :)
Last night I watched episode 9 of NatGeo's Genius. The episode shows Nazies insolent behavior toward Haber and how he died on his way to Palestine. RIP Prof. Haber.
He was German after all the VW scandal has killed million's
I don't trust a word out of this puppet's mouth.
So you mean he killed billions because he is responsible for the overpopulation of the earth AND chemical weapons? Bit of a shortening but you know what I mean

"Incentives honestly, consider the fact that most of the world engages in trade rather than war, the reason?  Simple, the incentive to trade is simpler and allows for more stability and reduces risk to oneself and kin.  Conflict, violence only arises when every other avenue for attaining one's desires fails.  Its astonishing folks look for some technological solution to this problem when it can't be solved by just applying technology.  Its a solutions problem, one about the desires of those involved.  Which makes me think it falls under communications theory, or cybernetics."
Yayyy...another amazing episode of the kind 💖👌💎💎
why not focus on the ethnicities of those he killed and saved? He killed millions of Europeans and saved billions of non-European third worlders.  The man deserves to burn in hell

"The issue is not ambiguous nor a grey moral area. It is clear cut: Haber's initial beneficial discovery did not have the accidental bi-product of weapons. The patriotic madman actively worked to convert the technology to use in an unjustified imperialistic war that killed millions. It was never an accidental bi-product. It was deliberate. As that population graph shows, it took at least a century for that population boom to happen after the discovery.  Plenty of time for someone less blinded by ideology would have discovered this eventually."

So they are something that when you throw out it helps the globe. Pretty neat to know.

Sounds like he stole most ideas and whatever from his wife.
I read it as the scientist who killed minions
"“A scientist belongs to his country in times of war, and to all of mankind in times of peace.” -Haber"
Yeah kinda agree while him on this one. The scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project saved millions by doing so. Operation downfall would’ve made D-Day look like beach party would would’ve led to tens of millions of dead. World war 2 would’ve dragged on for years while Japan would be devastated and been split like Korea. There would’ve been a North Japan if not for the atomic bombs.
Yea… coming from a German I don’t see that as a good thing.
"@Natalya Woop ""Best for their country"" is again a matter of opinion. Was it best for Germany to remain subjugated, occupied and disarmed, according to the will of foreign powers? Or was it best to assert themselves even if it risked going to war and losing?
We could do this all day, but the fact that some (many) Germans supported Hitler and some opposed him is proof enough that it was indeed a matter of opinion."
"@Diego C. ""The end result is not what makes it patriotic or not"". Or course it could. A patriot would want what is practically best for their country."
@Firstname Lastname One thing's for sure: People looking back at history after decades have passed will have a much different perspective than the person in that country making decisions in 'real time'.
"I found this one really interesting.  I learned all about the Haber process and it's influence on agriculture.  But other than a passing comment about bombs, the darker side of Haber was never taught to me."
"no man Derek man, don't swallow the camera, we do not want to go there 😂 
excellent way of lecturing science, your videos are cool..."
"You americans, because of your culture, and the fact you are all liberals and fascists, always think that individuals make history. That's false. If Haber never discovered this way to make amonia, another one would have found it a few years later. if he never invented chlorine gas, another one would have, or would have discovered another dadly way to fight with chemistry.

History and science are made by groups of people. The work of hundreds of scientists made us discover they way to grow more food, not just Haber. The work of undreds of mad politics made WW1 comes, and the work of hundreds of scientists came up to the discovery of cholrine gas.

Sometimes, you americans should really understand that you can't rule the world, that you can't made a god out of your corrupted politicians, and that the benefit of billion of people is more important than the profit of a few of your mad businessmen.

So i'm glad that you, Derek, an american like others, can have the same speach."

Why we we doing anything at all?"

"This proves that ""people remember you for your mistakes more than they remember you for your success"" 😥"
"Chemists are sciencist. Science is knowledge, but knowledge is not wisdom."
"Nazi,s of germany are like Rss in India"
anyone who thinks that creating a deadly weapon will end a war faster is lying to themselves.
The way Haber's glasses are deigned is cool
"He didn't save billions, he made it so the world could have resources for these people to be born. You can't ""save"" someone who doesn't even exist."
"@TPGslmth not those billions he was referring to, for sure."
A lot of people would have been born into food shortages tho. It'd take time for population growth to account for the new lack in fertilizer.
"There are a lot of ways to kill people. Sabotaging geniuses who are non-conformists is a way that people are murdering huge percentages of the population but nobody's talking about it... More importantly, nobody's doing anything about it."

"""did everything to fulfill his patriotic duty"" is a bit of an euphemism for chemical weapons isn't it? Patriotism isn't a moral value. People's wellbeing is."
"To be fair, every time we learn chemists/biologists comes up with a way to help society, another person from the military finds a way to weaponize it"
"Germans so ungrateful: electing Nazis, and punishing the best of their scientists and soldiers... they didn't change still, Scholtz is paying billions to russia while making entire Europe dependent on fossil fuels, refusing to launch clean nuclear plants, ruining our planet's climate while financing russian army... all while wanting to take away Ukrainian grain, because Molotov-Ribbentrop pact is still in action, only renamed to Nordstream."

"""pacifist einstein"" the same einstein that worked on the manhattan project"
I am sure I read that Einstein did not even believe that atomic/nuclear bombs could exists. he was not right obviously.
*Insert quote from Harvey Dent*
"Speaking as a newly graduating physics student, it is within these lines especially at the end which is why I am so hesitant to work for any company focused on weapons development or delivery (call them 'Defence' or whatever, they are still used to broadly harm humans at best). Even if I leave a minimal mark on humanity, I want to have my labours leave a positive mark on the world or at least those I can reach out to. I envision science, technology and human knowledge at large to be used ethically and responsibly (e.g. reducing the effects of global warming, improve quality of life in third-world countries, etc.), rather than something which accelerates our decline or demise. Yet it seems even discovering new knowledge for a good cause is not a certainty of ethical application.

On another note, something which bothers me about Fritz Haber working for the military is that he ~chose~ to. He was not force-marched or coerced into developing weapons - he willingly converted his work into this out of patriotic pride. He could have chosen to stay out of this and continue overseeing his fertiliser work, and at least let someone else like him to do what he eventually did. But he did it anyway, and now his legacy is tarnished with human corpses by his technology. He may not have released the gas to the trenches himself, but it was his work all the same."
Him : it's big brain time
"Just because you can thank someone for something, doesn't mean you need to admire him."
"Other scientists worked on and invented fertilizer, gas weapons and pesticide. Haber's unique contribution was to aggressively push Germany to use the chemical weapons on the scale we saw. He used a lot of his influence and contacts in government to make it happen. That would not have happened without him. This video didn't mention it much except to say his wife thought he was obsessed with it."
"He was a Jew, never a German. A son of Abraham."
"He is an agent of entropy unleashed on the world, keeping it in balance during his life time"
reminds me a bit of breaking bad tbh
Humans have always been motivated to develop when it came to the advancement of ways to slaughter each other.

"""War, war never changes."""
The carbon that the world improvers wish to reduce - is us.
"To add to one of the reasons why chemical warfare is looked down upon among nations today is how they can be used.
Germany in WW1 had an especially effective use of chemical weapons as they used multiple kinds of chemicals at once. This was in response to the Entente employing gas masks in response to Germany's use of chemical weapons.
For starters, they used Chlorine to signify that an attack would commence. This would then prompt the enemy to wear gas masks to protect themselves from it. But the most devilish part comes next: Mustard Gas would be deployed to irritate the exposed skin of soldiers enough to prompt some of them to then take off their gas masks and breathe in Chlorine gas. 
The worst part about it? The gas masks do protect against Mustard gas......but trying to breathe normally in a gas mask is like trying to breath while you're under  your blankets but with a face mask to boot.

Even more, sometimes the German didn't even use Chlorine gas. Sometimes, they used and/or field-tested Phosgene gas instead, which was nigh undetectable and only needed small concentrations to kill. It was odorless and invisible.
The only problem with it was that it took about a week to kill someone."
One correction: He was not a patriot. He was a nationalist.
"""We should not supply weapons to Ukraine. Then Russia will win quickly and many lives are saved."" This kind of argument resembles to what Fritz Haber claimed about development of poisonous gas as weapons."
"""The earth support 4 more billion people"", no thanks I want less people"
"Clara Haber (nee Immerwahr), to her university professor Richard Abegg;

"It is ironic that the Albert Einstein, the ""pacifist scientist"" is the same scientist who persuade Franklin Roosevelt and the USA government to build the atomic bomb."
"Besides the fact that he was developing chemical weapons he also killed a lot of people just by due to development of the Haber process. If it wasn't for this process Germany could not have continued the war, since it lacked the recources to produce ammunition, and therefore the war would have ended with a mutch lighter peace treaty for Germany, the Austrians and maybe even the Whites winning in the russian civil war."
The content and storytelling in this video is absolute top-tier. Veritasium has to be one of the best YT channels if not the best. Found this channel during the Covid-19 lockdown and have been following Derek ever since then.

Truly. The only channel other than Veritasium that moves me is Kurzgesagt. The top tier channels of YT.
DisruptTV is really good too
"The irony is that in the netherlands (and europe) this is actually a big major problem - in reverse. The netherlands has a big problem that the soil has become too rich in nitrogen, washed away from the farmlands into nature. Poisoning the native plant species (and native ecosystem), currently leading to a major case which blocked any further farming, forced reduced car speed and a full stop on any civil engineering."

"What he did in the war might be inexcusable, but you have to admit everyone alive now are thank to his creation for farming activity.

As for those who might think he is evil, no he isn't. You can't just say he is evil because of him trying to kill people using chemical weapons. He did said that the war would end faster this way. It is the same as why US back then bombed Japan. Think about the casualties, it is better to end a war earlier than prolonging it. The casualties might be worse than what's already happened.

Haber just wants to do what is for the best, but just not a humane way."
This MF created deadly gas and overpopulated our planet which is the main reason for global warming
The actions of a man must never be divorced from its results. Haber made a process for creating fertilizer. Great. That he then actively chose to take that knowledge and work to make it possible to cause death on massive scales means that he had a clear intent. He wanted to cause death. That his process helped others was an obvious side effect to his desire to cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands. To attempt to rehabilitate him is to try to separate the man from his actions.
This MF created deadly gas and overpopulated our planet which is the main reason for global warming

"""Is science of any value? I think a power to do something is of value. Whether the result is a good thing or a bad thing depends on how it is used, but the power is a value.""

Fritz Haber is awesome. He taught me that as a chemist I hold the power of life and death and that the skillful application of toxic gasses/volatile liquids can solve many problems.
"One other way to get nitrogen into the ground so that our croup plants can use it is by growing other plants like clovers, beans, peas or similar plants. Also the Australian wattle bush or tree does the same. A combination of plants grown together can make a very good production. The real problem is when only one plant is grown like wheat. I believe that it is not without reason that the weed grows well. It is in my mind because that particular weed it well suited to the chemicals in the ground (or lack there of) and many of them actually improve the ground for other plants so that they can grow."
So haber makes nitrogen to feed the world. And now the libs are saying its bad for nature?
"@TPGslmth ""oversaturation"" oh no how terrible graslands changing into more forrested area's because they reach nitrogen levels they had before the lands where farmed. sounds like a real nightmare"

"that is happening when us, humans, instead of living a humble, pure and faithful life, as Almighty God told us to do, we play god and bring evil in our world. maybe ammonium nitrate is responsible of more illness and dead by poisonings our food, that TNT and fluorine gas together. “Return, O faithless children,” declares the LORD, “for I am your master, and I will take you— one from a city and two from a family— and bring you to Zion”.  receive Jesus Christ into your heart as your Lord and Savior today and let us pray that our Father, Holy God, have mercy on us. amen."
When the population reaches 100 billion how will we feed them then?
Somone would have made ammonia but would not be made chemical weapon at the same time

"Context behind the development of this weapon.
From the beginning of the War, the Brits conducted an illegal starvation blockade of Germany.
There was a treaty signed by Britain.
Not against soldiers, against babies, children, women, elderly people.
How many Germans died from starvation and disease during the War would be an interesting subject for your ""Truth"" channel.
Even after the Armistice was signed, the good guys, the Brits continued the blockade which the Armistice was supposed to end.
Another ONE MILLION Germans died!
Was this the first time the wonderful Brits committed such acts?
Let's see, around fourteen years before, the Brits heroically fought the Boer War where since the mighty British Empire could not defeat ten thousand Boers with a professional army of a quarter million, locked up all the Boer women and children and starved 32,000 to death.
No child under the age of six survived.
About twenty percent of the Boer population.
How about the disgraceful Opium Wars.
There is so much more.
I would be more impressed with an exposition of history not so well known and wiping off the smug moral superiority exhibited in this comment section."
"He wanted to be a hero, and he did became one. But he tried to be a God with his knowledge, but instead he turned into a devil."
"It would be great if scientists would purify their minds, and learn to live fully in their hearts."
well this shows he was bad but not that bad as us made nukes and war is war.
"Don't tell us how or what to think. Highly intelligent people are stupid and people like The Haber-dasher-maniac belong in hell. And this claim of ""feeding half the people of the world"" is very suspect. Calling that claim horseshit."
"12:16 i Wonder 
Amonium nitrate itself  can't catch fire or explode but it's need any fule to make explosion because NH4NO3 is an oxidizer and it have to react sometimes with high temperature to cause explosion so if there was only amonium nitrate in the wherehouse with its packing as fule so there shouldn't be enough fule to cause that extreme explosion .
It should be Attack by terrorist ."

The farmer's son rode on one of the horses, fell and broke his leg. ""How unfortunate!"" people exclaimed. ""Who knows?"" replied the farmer.
War started and all able-bodied young men were drafted. The farmer's son was exempt thanks to his broken leg.
""How fortunate!"" people exclaimed. ""Who knows?"" replied the farmer.

History doesn't care about right or wrong. The greatest wrongs may turn out to be the greatest rights, whereas the greatest rights may turn out to be the greatest wrongs. World War II was one of humanity's most horrible events but also brought unprecedented peace. Technology... in the long run, who knows if it will turn out to be a good or bad thing?"
"@Yassine Ben Othman Unprecedented means 'without precedent.' Please point me to a single time in humanity that was more peaceful than now.

"@Valerie Van Kerckhove The end of european colonialism didn't mark the full end of warfare. A new type of imperialism, mainly the american and soviet one, started a whole new era of conflicts and division. Europe maybe was more peaceful since WW2, if we ignore the Yugoslavian wars, but the rest of the world, including the Middle-East, Africa, Southeast and Northeast Asia, was a playground for global powers to experiment their new ideologies and to settle their businesses. Therefore yes, my point stills ; there wasn't an unprecedent peace after WW2."
"@Yassine Ben Othman Yes, isn't it great that they're mostly gone now?"
@Valerie Van Kerckhove Colonialism and imperialistic expansionnism were the main reason why there were wars in the first place.
"@Yassine Ben Othman Things are pretty damn peaceful now compared to how things were in the millennia before. Besides, without World War II the colonial powers would still be colonial powers."

"EDIT: I was the one confusing the conversions. Gold price per ounce in the late 1890's was ~$20/ounce, and I figured they somehow wrongly got  $76/pound to $20/ounce ~= 4 to 1. But that would be *guano* being worth 4 times more than gold. It's $76/pound to $320/pound ~= 1 to 4.

Leaving my incorrect message below: 
_________________________________________________________________________________
""The price rose as high as $76 per pound, meaning you could trade four pounds of guano for one pound of gold.""

This can't be right, I've just googled historical gold prices, and while gold was ~50 times cheaper in the later 1800's, this is still off by an order of magnitude. Did you mean to say ""you could trade four pounds of guano for one ounce of gold""?"
"You seriously think people can GUESS your measurings of things in ouches, pounds and, eww, feet? Like I get foot measurement of height - someone lays on the ground and gets stepped on, you count the steps... it's kinky but works.

But how you measure weight in pounds, the British currency? Do you use paper money, or metal? What about denominations?

Like yeah you can count how many grams a bunch of 100 pound banknotes weight, but did they even weight the same back then?

Just use human measurement system like the homo sapiens species of planet Earth does. Using English Imperial system when British empire is no more is a punchline at this point. Stop simping for dead Empires."
he was a patriot not a villain.
"An important detail to mention is that the problem of diminishing nitrogen in farmland is a direct cause of a specific method used to perform agriculture; monoculture. Agriculture does not necessarily deplete the soil of nitrogen. Artificial fertilizer is an incomplete solution for a problem that is actually caused by ignorance of the complexity of the vast networks of creatures and processes involved in sustaining all life on earth. And we are now finally making strides in improving this.

Of course we can be grateful for the invention, but we are now at a point that requires a change of strategy. Just putting this comment out there because I felt this perspective was missing in the first quarter of the video."

"Any piece of technology, no matter how good the intention, can be used for evil. There's a neural network that was developed to check if some known medication can be used to treat diseases other than the ones we already treat with them. It can also be run in the other direction to develop new medication for known diseases based on existing chemicals, though wether they work irl is another matter. However, some scientists have taken this neural network, intended to find new treatment options for diseases, and, instead of training it to heal, trained it to kill. They taught it how nerve gases work, and then told it to generate chemicals which the neural network believes would have the same effect. After 24 hours, it had found several thousand chemicals. A few among them are chemicals like Tabun and VX, known nerve gases. However, it also generated countless new chemicals, which, according to the neural network, are even deadlier than the ones we already know about."

"Brilliant video; I love the well balanced nature of this series. You show elegantly that nothing is ever black-and-white. 

For me, it seems that the use of synthetic fertilizers themselves are a double-edged sword (perhaps more;how many edges can a sword have?). 
There are many short-term benefits given by synthetic fertilizers, but they are being shown to cause larger and larger issues. As often happens, simple solutions are causing ever increasingly complex problems. Over-fertilisation and over-use of soils is depleting them of available micro-nutrients. Plants need these in the same way that we need them. If they're only given a few key minerals, those needed for fast growth, they will have compromised immunities and will need to rely upon ever-increasing amounts of herbicides and pesticides.

Small farms are dying off by the dozen, because nobody but the large companies can afford the ever increasing cost and need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, much less compete on price.

It's the biology in the soil that can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, break down minerals in the soil to plant-available forms and food it to plants only when they need it. 

The alternative, this current model, is to give the plants what we think they need, hope they uptake it, and watch it wash into the rivers the next time there's a thunderstorm. Not only is this causing environmental disasters on a massive scale, compromising aquatic health and water quality in entire regions, but it's also a massive waste for the farmers themselves. 

I don't want to tar all farmers with the same brush. Individual farms use their own practices, and every parcel of land is different. 
Farmers aren't stupid, but modes of thinking in the field are outdated, with studies, education and lobbies funded by the corporations that benefit most from the way things are.

Of course, it's not easy to see every side of a problem this complex, but these problems are at least part of the issue, as I see it."

No he didn't! He discovered nuclear fission (by accident). He did not work on the development  of nuclear weapons. Up to the end of the war he did not even have an idea how nuclear weapons would work. When he heard about the explosions in Japan he was shocked and desperate because he thought it was his fault (by having discovered nuclear fission).
"1914
Haber: ""I built a chemical weapon to end the war faster.""
People: ""That's inhumane, you can't do that, you will kill thousends of soliders.""
Haber: ""We kill thousends to save millions.""
People: ""No, you and the german empire are evil and the bad guys in this confilct.""

Bro he basically made a video explaining why this statement is wrong.
"Im a great fan of your videos... But carbon emissions(it rubbed me to think). I would question and criticize its implications and consequences and applications towards guilt marketing. Its pretty bad bs right there focusing on little details. Id call it a sophisticated (sophizmatic) lie even. Its not untrue at its core whilst just drawing away attention from the bigger problem.

I would like to see a video researching emmission contributions by various sources. Could you please make a document shining some light on emissions by industries - land and marine traffic - households?"
"Now do Alfred Nobel. Less obvious benefit and much higher body count. Less gruesome, but higher. A significant fraction of WWI and WWII's deaths can be laid at the door of his inventions, we just consider those deaths to be less gruesome than chemical warfare. Nobel had a better press office, though (i.e. the Nobel Prizes, especially the Peace Prize)."
I strongly believe that giving context to the history and slowly guiding students through the mindset of scientists is much better than spoon-feeding them equations and dry theory.

"u cant blame a person for wanting to fight for his own country , even if that country is in the wrong. The alternative is to let your countrymen , neighbors , people you know , etc....just die.
As with explosives , the way any given substance is used depends on the person who uses it. Its not the responsability of the inventor."
"I have a different opinion. 
You can always use objective reasoning as justification, but not pride (what patriotism just is).
An alternative could be for example, just not to fight and to surrender or flee and maybe nobody has to die.

I agree, that the one who controles the weapon is the responsible one.
But Haber wasnt only an inventor. He directly produced  the gas for the purpose of war and also activly participated in using it."

"Many of the names that Veritasium mentioned, prominant scientensts of the time were jewish it was ironic that those people (including Haber) which worked so hard to push Germany forward would end up paying the price for helping germany - Haber did it to be patriot, he was surprised to see how germans still regarded him as a jew and dismissed him as soon as they could.

- chemical fertilizer arent arguably necessary to feed the world. It is though for our monoculture model with is centered around rich people
- Farmers are poisoned by exposure to amonia, so it's still killing to this day
- chemical fertilizer are today destroying the soil, in part cause of the soil erosion effect. Crops are less and less productive and entire river and ocean shores are polutted by algea. So this model is not sustenable and a lot more people will die in the next decades"

""" These millions of birds eat the fish, and then they poop, a lot"" ✍️ - Derek 2022"
Clickbaity title and introduction
"Derek, you ended this piece with a question.  This is a cop out.  I believe you have a responsibility to answer that question.  Otherwise, you’re just like every other guy “just asking questions, man”.  . . . Also, it is a cliche (and another cop out) to assume that if this particular scientist hadn’t invented this particular weapon that another scientist somewhere sometime somehow would have invented it anyway.  Is it likely that this would happen?  Perhaps.  Is it certain?  Not at all.  What would be the evidence for any certainty on this matter?  . . . On the other hand, I do believe it is our duty as scientists—and especially as science educators—to take a real stand on this issue.  Do you support scientific endeavors which are designed specifically to destroy human life and cause human suffering?  Is this ever an acceptable use of science?  My answer, for whatever it’s worth, is no.  . . . Especially now.  Especially when the climate crisis is already ramping up, and it’s catastrophic effects are touching down.  Especially when we are yet again faced with the real possibility of multilateral nuclear world war.  Especially when the stakes are so very high.  How can you just be asking questions?  How can you not take a stand?  How can you shy away from proclaiming your ethical standards?  . . . We must—if not long ago, then now—we must be better than this.  For far too long scientists have hidden themselves in the false notion that their work was divorced from ethics.  Divorced from causality.  Divorced from humanity.  Their work, their science, and they themselves were never divorced from humanity.  . . . Maybe someone somewhere somehow will invent some new weapon that will destroy life in ways we can never even imagine.  Or maybe not.  Maybe they will decide not to.  And then the next inevitable scientist will say no.  And the next.  And the next.  . . . I will say no.  What will you say, Derek?"

"Equally important was Carl Bosch, who took Haber's tabletop setup and scaled it up to factory size, which, among other things, required finding a catalyst other than osmium.  He also won a Nobel prize for this, and the process is most referred to by both their names: the Haber-Bosch process.  Bosch went on to be one of the founders, and first head of, the chemical mega-conglomerate IG Farben.  IG Farben would become notorious for its practices during World War 2.  It was the company that made Zyklon B.  Half of its workforce was slave labour and it had a factory that was effectively a concentration/death camp: Auschwitz III AKA Auschwitz Monowitz.  IG Farben was also involved in the medical experimentation conducted at a number of concentration camps."

"@Vigilant Cosmic Penguin Bosch also died in 1940. He was pushed out of the company as a result of his vocal attacks on antisemitism and warmongering, and he did not live to see the monstrosity his company became. Blaming Bosch for IG Farben is incorrect."

I felt like i'm watching a movie. The production quality is off the roof. keep it up man. love it!!
Please more about mad scientists!
Too many ads and overly dramatised.
"Fritz Haber once said: Im Friede für die Menschheit, im Kriege für das Vaterland. (During piece for humanity, during war for the homeland"
"The so called good guys, the Brits, from the beginning of the war, were employing a starvation blockade of Germany.
Totally illegal by international treaty.
An extra one million Germans died from starvation AFTER the Armistice was signed.
The British officers occupying Germany were begging the blockade to end.
I would be more impressed with this video producer if he published the real history!"
"The western world realized the importance of fertilizer after Alexander von Humboldt reported Incan Indians in South America used bat poop to make it and thus increase their soil fertility, and yield of crop. That was the true origin of the modern day race to figure out the importance of the nitrogen cycle and its role in agriculture.

I'd love to see the @Veritasium take on Humboldt. That would have to be a multi-part series due to the impact my man had on the world!"

"I do not think he saved billions of lives. It is more appropriate to say that he created a process that made it possible for the earth to sustain a larger population. Without him (or the process), human lives would've continued but the population size would've remained small. So he helped in creating a billion lives and not save them.
Still, I think it's better to mark him as irrelevant, might do justice to him."
"“To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.” Buddhist proverb.

Every tool invented in the history of mankind from the simple knife to nukes can both further progress or destroy mankind, it just how we use it."
Its 8 billion now? It was 6 billion when I was a kid. Inflation has exploded
Its sad
We have significantly reduced use of chemical warfare but nitrogen based fertilizer are still mostly used. We took 2 steps back but nearly 100 steps forward and that can be considered a win...
Why are Dutch farmers being told to cut their nitrogen use by half?
"Choose not to perpetuate destruction.
If he had chosen to not help in the war to ""end it quickly"" there may have been another person to do it, but the responsibility would have been on them, but there could have not been such other person, a knife is a weapon, but it's bad only when a mad man wields it. Make peace not war, or you get your buildings broken. War was fun once upon a time, when it was a sport and the worst outcome you could have gotten was getting your pride broken, and then they invented the sword and all hell broke loose, because people stopped following the rules of war ""don't do unto others what you don't want done unto you"" because i am you, people are people."

"You essentially end by pointing out the moral and ethical questions of Human activity. We do NOT have the capacity within ourselves to make wise choices about such matters. But, more so in the 20th Century than at any other time, we have abandoned God to go our own way. God's Word, The Bible, is as relevant today as it has ever been. As 'The Teacher' says ""The knowledge of God is the BEGINNING of Wisdom"". Knowing God is just the START! How can we know God? The Bible explains CLEARLY that ever since our original ancestors committed the Original Sin (i.e. going our own way instead of God's) we are increasingly broken people living in an increasingly broken world. God cannot abide Sin, cannot even look at it. Nevertheless, He loves us, and has done all He can and all He needs to, to get us back in the right direction and back into relationship with Him. The death Jesus experienced on the Cross is the death YOU (and me) deserve - complete destruction. But Jesus died this death ON YOUR BEHALF so that you don't have to, and instead can have your relationship with Him restored. Jesus PROVED this by rising from His Death three days later, the most pivotal and undeniable FACT of history. And it's handed to us on a plate, nothing we can earn or deserve. God leaves the choice up to you on a personal basis, to either accept His free gift or reject it. It is personally and globally disastrous to ignore spiritual matters. So make your choice, but remember, the universe doesn't revolve around YOU, you don't know everything, you aren't perfect, and there's nothing you can do about it. But God loves you anyway, and is eager for you to choose Salvation instead of destruction - ""Choose LIFE""! The START of doing this is to accept His free gift, to ask Him to forgive your sins, and to ask Jesus - God made Man - to become Lord of every part of your life. Just a simple prayer, spoken wherever you are. There will be surprises and difficulties ahead, but I promise you, it's a decision you will NEVER regret."
Keep telling these stories please. They are fascinating.

I'm relatively dumb compared to the target audience of these, but watching these videos really gets things in perspective. Like for example, when I was a kid/teen I couldn't care less about math, but following Veritasium through the years, I realized it's single handedly the most fundamental tool not only for our survival and progress as a specie, but also for the understanding of our universe and existence."

The other, embracing military madness by developing chemical weapons of mass destruction... The world is still struggling with its schizophrenic fixation with the inanities of war and the need to sustain life on an unforgiving planet."

"""Over the past few centuries, science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably""...but have not returned things to the state in which those responsible for science and technology found them millennia ago which they destroyed in the first place. 
It is not difficult to establish that the very ""scientific curiosity"" and absence of inclination toward normative human behavior which defined those who invented agriculture and thereby brought civilization into existence, with all of its disease, disorder and dysfunction, abolishing the normative human way of life and replacing it with the contrivances of their myopic, ignorant, baselessly self-assured minds, is the same as that of ""scientists"" today. In fact, those who claim to be the ideological if not biological descendants of the former, who are often also the latter (for example, Christopher Wren, who was an Invisible College Freemason as well as a founding member of the Royal Society, incorporated ""sacred geometry"" and Kabbalah into his building projects. Sacred geometry was also used in the building - directed by medieval Roman Catholic priests - of some of the most famous cathedrals in Europe. Contrary to the disinformation spread nowadays, the priests were NOT ""duped"" by Knights Templar surreptitiously placing occult symbols into their work, but in fact, it can be proven that the priests themselves were immersed in the study and incorporation into Christianity of the teachings of pagans like Pythagoras, Euclid and Atistotle, which is the ACTUAL reason there are statues of those three pagans in the exterior of Chartres Cathedral), even admit it: 

 ""This class is loath to take
things on faith and prone to prove all things by the light of reason. These people BELIEVE
IN WORKS rather than faith, and by their dauntless courage and inexhaustible energy they
have transformed the trackless wilderness of the world to a garden full of life and beauty,
so lovely in fact that THE SONS OF CAIN have forgotten the garden of God, the Kingdom
of Heaven, whence they were expelled by the decree of the lunar God Jehovah. Against
Him they are in constant rebellion because He has tied them by THE UMBILICAL ""CABLE
TOW."" They have lost their spiritual sight and are imprisoned in the forehead of the body
where it is said Cain was marked; they must wander as prodigal sons in the comparative
darkness of the material world, oblivious to their high and noble estate until they find the
door of the temple, and ask and receive LIGHT; then as ""PHREE MESSEN"" or children of
light they are instructed in methods of building a new temple without sound of hammer,
and when the spirit realizes that it is far from its heavenly home, a prodigal, feeding upon
the unsatisfactory husks of the material world, that apart from the Father it is ""POOR,
NAKED AND BLIND,"" when it knocks at the door of a mystic temple like that of the
Rosicrucians and asks for light, when it receives the desired instruction after due
qualification by building and ethereal soul-body, a temple or house eternal in the heavens,
not made with hands, and without sound of hammer, when its nakedness is clothed with
that house (see Cor. 4.5,) then the neophyte receives ""THE WORD,"" the open sesame to
the inner worlds and learns to travel in foreign parts in the invisible worlds. There he takes
soul-flights into heavenly regions and qualifies for higher degrees under more direct
instruction from THE GRAND ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE, who fashioned both
heaven and earth.
Such is the temperament of THE WIDOW'S SONS inherited from their divine progenitor
Samael and given by him to their ancestor Cain. Their past history is a struggle with
adverse conditions, their achievement is victory wrested from all opposing forces by
indomitable courage and persistent effort, unchecked by temporary defeat."" - ""Freemasonry and Catholicism"" by Max Heindel"
this is probably one of the best veritasium vids
Not to play down anything about this video (really superb content as always from this channel). But I couldn't get through the first half of it without thinking of the 2nd Ace Ventura movie.
Even his good side was double-edged. The synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen fueled the human population explosion and global environmental damage that followed from it.
An example of Science is a double-edged sword
Make a series of you discussing the life of famous scientist
So you could argue that Haber is responsible for the worlds current severe overpopulation?
a superb video... thank you sir
"20:48
I don't know. You didn't tell me."
"Don’t know if he was an outright villain or hero.
I think he had phases in his life, some heroic and some villainous
But talk about consequences, being a patriot to have your work ultimately be one of the greatest downfalls against your people"
So we now have a population crisis and a 6th Mass Extinction.
"He is a hero, 
He was born for this purpose"
So you also listened to that one Radiolab podcast huh?

"What?? That final conclusion is insane. From that point of view, we could just add well argue ""you shouldn't blame Hitler, because of Hitler wouldn't have done it, somebody else would have"".
Haber chose to work in the weapons industry, and even develop weapons of mass destruction. ""Patriotism"" is just a fake argument people use to justify unethical and imho evil things."

"An absolutely breathtaking telling of this story, and a sobering reminder of the responsibility we all have to use our powers for good, without straying away from nuance. Thank you Veritasium this might just be my favourite video yet."
With great power comes with great responsibility.
"The problem with these kinds of videos is that they gloss over so much work, dedication, etc. that someone had done just because of a terrible event that they might have had a part in or no part in at all. The guy saved billions from starvation and help develop a weapon that he thought would change the outcome of the war, (with fewer casualties). But instead he is treated like garbage. But at the same time, the perpetrators of the Manhattan project, which did literally no good for humanity and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and millions of cases of cancer, are hailed as heroes. American double standards 101."

Each level is 10 times stronger than the last
So 1 is 1
2 is 10
3 is 100
And so on...

everyday when we are having food then we should remember Dr Haber for his ammonia process which changed the history of modern agriculture to meet the increasing population in the world
So an inventing from a jew killed the jews

"i think that no matter how much good fritz haber's invention of nitrogen fertilizer was and how much it revolutionized the world in the process, it pales in comparison to creating weapons that killed millions. for me he cannot be forgiven for what hes done, even karma came back to haunt him after his own death by using cyanide pesticides against the (you know who, i wont say because youtube censorship is a bish), no matter how much good you do for the world, it cannot be offset by all of the lives you have taken, because every life you take is a capital sin to your name, your soul would weigh so much that it would sink to the bottom of the river crossing before you ever reach heaven, no amount of good can excuse you from killing millions.

i agree that noble inventions meant to do good by for example improving crop yields - can also be used to make bombs. but it was his decision to do that. he could have opposed it or simply kept silent hoping that no other scientist would make the connection that ammonium nitrate could create explosives, but he himself was the one who decided to use his life saving invention for ill. doctors and scientists share many things in common, but one thing they dont share in common is that doctors are oath bound to never take lives, scientists have no such oath, maybe they should. (see : Hippocratic Oath - Doctors oath of ethics)"
"There's the theory that haber was approached by a very powerful group 
and threatened, and that's how everything unfolded"
oh so this is the dude who ruined our planet with overpopulation?
The reasoning of fritz haber making a weapon that would end the war faster was a similar reasoning of the nuclear weapon being a weapon to end all wars .
These type of videos are great! Showing the history and drama behind the science. Hope you keep making them Ve.
That's a mistake
"This was documentary quality and even better but for free ,insane"
Wasn't personal carboon footprint debunked like thousand times? That it's basically just companies shifting blame from themselves to individual people?
"14:50 , This is the same excuse used by USA to drop Atomic bombs at Japan, then Why Haber was wrong and USA justified? Is it just because Germany lost the war."
The ends never justify the means
You are starting to overproduce your videos.
"Excellent video. I'm a big fan of this form of storytelling. Adding the simple cartoons and archive footage is amazing at helping the narrative.

Reminds me of neil degrasse tysons cosmos."
"As Isaac Asimov once said, “The saddest aspect of society right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom."""
"It just shows how inhumane, cruel, horrific and the WORST history of humanity, that is the world wars."
This video is a top five now my god. Amazing work dude
this story seem like dr Manhatten in watchdogs (2009) movie
"Maybe the Haber process is what contributed to WWI, because more food = more people and more demand for land.  Haber may be thinking somewhere along the lines of I've made all these people, and now they're going to war, so I need to destroy them."
"""We (scientists) are collectively part of the society that is using or not using, to its benefit or its detriment, the discoveries made by science. And at the end of the day, the discovery itself is not moral, it's our application of it that has to pass that test.""

"There were a lot of industrial accidents due to Haber's invention also, like the West Fertilizer plant explosion."
Brilliant documentary - again.
If Haber is a criminal then Issac Newton is also a criminal. Issac Newton's calculus is used to throw bombs using projectile motion
"I think you asked one of the most important questions here. How can we  survive as a species the next hundred thousand years, while evolving?(Fermi-Paradoxon) I think we have to let mother nature doing her job and hope for the best that we're not killing each other like animals!"
"Today we have declared war on CO2 because of its excess and consequent warming of the planet. On the other hand CO2 is the main food component for plants. Plants wouldn’t exist without the CO2 in the air. Thus, life would disappear without CO2. Do we fully understand the dangers of what we are doing? Are we not just opening a new chapter of this continuos cycle of short term success/long term failure by reducing the CO2 permanently trapping it in rocks?"
primitivists must be happy about this
The animations and script was amazing
Einstein made the atomic bomb but he is still a legend. And don’t think that the atomic bomb is really that different than what the chlorine gas is.
Every solution solved by humankind creates a problem.
This Single Upload from Veritasium is definitely one of the best in their channel
"perhaps haber's work not only fed man, but also showed the world just how hellish war could be. WWI, the war _to end all wars_ , is generally regarded as the war that awoke man to the hells in war due to the ease of civilian communications from frontlines and perhaps first hand accounts of gas attacks (among other horrors) still dissuade both the common man and the ruling elites from waging war."
Well told. As a historian I appreciate your final remarks regarding the impossibility to prevent or even undo scientific discoveries and the implications that has.
"The simple answer to the question is we don't, we destroy ourselves and move past our former forms
We evolve"
Russia was always in a toxic relationship with allies. They sacrificed millions of their lives only to be criticized and hated by the west in the future. It would've been better to just not join the allies. Russians deserve better.

Should we increase CO2 production or decrease it? What are the pros & cons of each?
"I'm incredibly skeptical of carbon offsets. If you do a video on it, I am willing to listen, but will view it as a scam otherwise. It seems like the sort of thing oil companies do to greenwash their pollution and to make people feel better about polluting, and if that's true I'm disappointed that'd you'd promote it."
Woah
"Dear Derek, I love everything you have put out and you are a huge inspiration to all of us. You deserve a Nobel Prize."
I'm at 0:14 and I think this is going to be about ammonium nitrate. I'm curious what it will actually be about
@Darts Highlights he mentions ammonium nitrate a few minutes into the video? are we confused?
@About 33 Asians interesting how you watched 22 mins in 3 minutes
I really don't know why I knew this. I just wish I knew why this came to mind instantly.
"Why go through all this because of lack of nitrogen. Why didn't they just planted nitrogen fixing plants like pulses every once in a while. It wouldn't've been a problem. If I am saying anything wrong, please reply."
"While his actions during WW1 are quite inexcusable, he was hardly the only one to develop chemical weapons. The gas phosgene was the biggest chemical killer of the war, and was created by French scientist Victor Grignard. It was the primary weapon of the Entente. The harsh realities of modern warfare forced countries and scientists into desperation."
@Vanda Maderová Germany didn't fail. They were just late to the party and the best parts were already taken by the much older empires of Britain and France.
@TheGaymo ah so you have no clue on why the Treaty of Versailles created so many problems.
@Harsh Jain I wasn't talking about just Germany. And if you read about what went down at the tail end of the 1800's you would know that pride was a *huge* reason.
"@MacroMicro thats practically right.  serbia was only the casus bellus used by then but if you read the letters of english / french / german nobility of the years 1890 to 1913 you see that there was always talk about a great war to defeat the enemy.  england didn´t want a german concurrent on the market,  germany wanted to end the british naval hegemony / global market hegemony, austria was missing its former glory,  france and germany had lots of ongoing border disputes and  then there were lots of open colonial questions and little conflicts all over the place.  there are about a thousand reasons to why ww1 happened and what lead up to it. Every big european nation had a list of things it wanted to achieve by going to war.  serbia was just the last nail in the coffin."
"@Harsh Jain Germany attempted to colonize, they just failed. That also doesn't give them a moral high ground."
So he caused the fertilizer buildups that we're having to deal with today?
"For the last question about how to have science only helps humanity, I believe the basic of this is keeping science separated from government like religions."
"The communist ""Great Reset"" is on the way to starve to death billions of people in the name of false narrative of climate alarmism.  The green communists are anti-human and they want to destroy the freedoms and prosperity of mankind because they can."

15:05 gas
15:12 the rumbling is here
"Right before he said someone else would have developed chemical weapons, I was going to comment it. In the end it doesn't matter."
Isn't natural fertilisers the best way to recover soil?
"Wow! I think this is one of the best Videos you have made. Maybe i am biased, because I pursue a degree in chemistry, but nonetheless the dramatic shift troughout the Video is really well executed.
I would like to add though that one Thing, which makes the Haber-Bosch-process so effective, is that an iron-based catalyst can be used to realize the reaction between nitrogen and hydogen. This was only found out after rigorous testing by BASF over many years. If I remember correctly BASF even bought almost all of the worlds osmium resources, only to find out that an iron-based catalyst works just as well, rendering the investion in osmium pretty much useless."
"Yeah, as a chemical engineer, one of my first introductions at university to inorganic chemistry was the explanation of how the Haber-Bosch process ensured that 2/3 of the world had food to eat.

And while Haber is more famous for it, Bosch was the one who managed to convert his process to industrial scale with an iron-based catalyst instead."
"Thank you for valuable information. And yes, humans misuse their capabilities."
I think I have seen some parts of it like death of Haber's wife and others in Genius Einstein documentary by Nat geo.

"It's actually the same process that von Braun experienced, except for a reverse way... Both were one of the kind, and their expertise were used in a war."
"sometimes it amazes me how complex science builds behind things that are familiar to us, such as crops"
Lets talk how to catch lightning.. Infinite energy and teleportation
Ever since I learned about Fritz Haber I have thought that his story has all the elements to make a great Brechtian punk opera.
Everything can be both good and bad it depends on the person who uses it nuclear energy can be used to create atomic bombs but can also be used to form nuclear reactors which can give clean energy (almost) to people in great amount.

"In Paul's Offit book Pandora's Lab he had a whole chapter on Haber. He goes more in depth about the creation of the factories that extract Nitrogen from the air, about the geopolitical situation during that time and the ethical implications of his actions.

Is a must read for all who love science."
@Nate Scherer yes I meant Haber :)
Haber?
Do you know any more books revolving around science which you'd like to recommend? I recently read When we cease to understand the world by Benjamin labatut and have been wanting to read more ever since!
What about Bosch? Didn't he make equal contributions to the Haber -Bosch process?
"The truly poetic irony in this story for me is the fact that Haber, who created the deadly yet indispensable nitrogen compounds, was awarded the Nobel Prize, created by Alfred Nobel to try and do good after inventing dynamite, which killed his own brother."
"I love history pieces like this. And can we appreciate the irony of scientists snubbing a man for making weapons while accepting awards started by a man that essentially made weapons? 

I don't blame Germany for WWI, but absolutely for WW2 -- however, and to answer the end-of-video question, both world wars, the conflict in Ukraine, and many others are caused by expansionism. I think it's time we start talking about creating a world that works together instead of ripping each other apart."

I studied and wrote a summary of the haber process in our class 11 finals.... It seemed so simple yet so ingenious but i didn't know about the tragic past behind it. Thank you Derek for telling this story.

another magnificent video from you my friend
"""From Bread out of the Air""
French :hon hon hon baguette 
""To Bomb Out of the Air""
Japanese: Hirohito Flashback"
"Haber did not *kill* ""millions"". As stated in the video the chemical warfare caused 100,000 deaths (from which 9,000 were Germans and 3,000 were Austria-Hungarians - because the Allies used chemical weapons as well) which means that less than 1 % of all victims of WWI were killed by gas."
"This guy is fast and loose with numbers.

Einstein did the same thing.. bomb he created killed 200000 japanese in single hit. Is he hero or villain 🤔.  Wait he is American 🤣 so he cant be villain 🤔
Yeah that's the way if a person is American or American ally he cannot be a villain but if he is against America then he is definitely a villain.

I almost got to tears. Your videos have reached yet another level of greatness
"some inaccuracies derek: he didn't ""save billions"" - his discovery inflated food production which in turn made an inflated amount of humans (and the animals they [mis]use) which is very probably unsustainable. forcing free-nature into agriculture production machine and over population is not ""saving"" - it created a whole set of problems that are very hard to solve if possible at all without crashing hard. those ""billions"" that have been created out of air might die or be killed when no natural resources are left to exploit.
carbon credits won't save these billions.. it is largely a scam that makes the elite feel less guilty and some companies rich."
"@Peter JF We are able to sustain more people, so given the option I think having more people is more interesting"
@iñaki bolivar I disagree. In my view the world would be much better without the current large population surplus.
"@Peter JF Boring, let’s get to 10 billion, we can sustain it"
Agreed. In my opinion we should aim to eventually get back to what the population was in 1930. That should be realistically sustainable in the long term.

"Whenever somebody wants to stop a war before starting innocent people die - Steve Rogers.

How did the company that commercialized Haber's process find enough Osmium to produce 5 tons of Ammonia per day?
"How is 9.2 eV tremendous amount of energy? 
I mean eV means joules in the power of -19 right? How is that tremendous?"
1 mole of a thing has 6.022×10^23 number of atoms of that thing so even if 1 ev is in the power of -19 but when you multiply it with power of 23 it becomes 10^4 that is very much when considered the amount of nitrogen broken.
"@Itsawfal The energy required to break the bond of 1 mole of nitrogen atom is 226,000 calories or 949200 J of energy and using that much energy you can only break nitrogen gas of mass 28 gram which is very less compared to required amount.
If you are saying that it requires negative energy then you are looking at the reverse process i.e. the formation of N2 from nitrogen atoms but the reverse reaction requires exactly that amount of energy but with a positive sign."
How much? Millions? Billions? It's still in the power of minus..
Multiply that with no of nitrogen atoms present in a bomb
"Why bring up the murder of people after his death that had nothing to do with him or his invention? The vanishingly small tie-in used is a building was named after him. Weak beer dude. Your ideology is showing, working on your ESG score?"

It's crazy because that's one invention I never knew came from Germany.... Why did I not learn about Haber in school?

"Really? Some else would have done it? Problems get solved, no matter how we hold the problem solvers in regard? In conclusion, the oppressive systems are right to go after scientists, because some else will solve the problems? That is really an irresponsible, diminishing view. I would more attribute it to cowardice with respect to facing how social reality actually is and to not engage with narcissists.  Take Haber's life story for what it is and try to extract valuable lessons for future generations. Some one else will do it, is the ultimate signaling to narcissists that you will not stand in their way, when they try to get rid of competition!"
"Just to make a point: I have a fusion concept in my drawer and can not communicate to peers because of idiots that pander to narcissists needs. Should we wait? I do not know if it will work, but initial Fermi estimations look good. The problem is it that seems to be weaponizable.  How much time to we have left to solve our energy problems? How much time did the Chemists had left in Harbor's time?

This man has been both in his lifetime a villain and a hero."
"if want to offset carbon footprint why dont we start with the 0.000001% scum from using 99% and force them to relase all the secret tech that could fix all these current problems ofthe world, MEANY in which THEY THEMSELVES had created."
"And this is also the reason why claims of overpopulation based on malthusian derived theories are absolute scientific nonsense. Population growth trails food supply, not the other way around. During absence of food fertility plummets."

My nemesis and hero, at once."
"I believe your last statement is wrong. You are right for saying it was easy to depict Haber as an evil scientist and one has every right to name him such. He worked actively at manufacturing weapons for war, it was not a byproduct of his invention, he invented those things new for war, that is one of the most evil i can imagine. He was not Albert Einstein, who’s inventions in the end lead to the atomic bomb, and at this instance you are right at saying, we as a society have to try to control those things, not to be used for the bad, but with Haber its a different story. He himself desited freely to work for the evil, and you have to make every scientist who does so personally responsible for his actions, I salute to the man with settled moralic believes, who gave away their noble prices."
"this is the guy responsible for chemical farming and its poisonings of our soil, water and air."
"Someone living today could be the next Haber, in pursuit of saving billions of people while killing millions in the process. The problem is, it will take a hundred years for people to acknowledge it."
"A good start would be to limit research ""cooperation"" and trade of advanced technologies with authoritarian regimes as these are the ones that most often misuse this knowledge. ""Cooperate"" on nuclear fusion research? Don't, because that may aid them in building better H-Bombs. ""Cooperate"" on AI? Don't because it may aid them oppressing their citizens with facial recognition, automated censorship etc. ""Cooperate"" on viral disease research? Don't because you will aid them in creating bioweapons.
This needs to be legislated as researchers are usually way too naive to recognize the dangers of supposedly innocent research ""cooperation"" with authoritarian countries."

"Yes, well, now I agree he should not have won any Nobel prize.  They are for works of peace, and he didn't have other people use his work for ill later, he was directly involved.  So no peace prize for you.

Of course, there are many other issues with those prizes, but this is a black eye on it just the same."
The fact that in the opening shot he says 1918 and the wall says 1919 - is it a mistake or is it a date thing about when Nobel prizes are given out?
"Overall conclusion 
Habber was great scientist."
when derek say he is jewish
Wonderful and informative video. Thank you viceroy
Excellent video! Btw the picture of the building is of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for chemistry which is next door. Haber's KWI for physical chemistry and electro-chemistry looks different.
"Thank God that he gave us politicians to ensure we safely use these double edged swords only for the betterment of humankind. Yes, this is doubled down sarcasm."
"One more thing is that the gas invented by Fritz Haber, the so-called ""mustard gas"" for his yellowish color, became, years later, the first attempt for human medicine to treat cancer. It was indeed the first shape of what we call today ""chemotherapies."" So he first saved humans from starvation, then killed humans with the terrible ""mustard gas,"" which later saved lives from deadly cancers. I have cancer too, unfortunately, stage IV, which is not very good, but I am confident and optimistic, and I am being treated with chemos, and everything weirdly started with prof. Fritz Haber."
"While, as you said, many of us may owe our lives to this POS he was undeniably evil. It's obvious that the pursuit of science can have both positive and negative outcomes but he actively sought to kill people with his research. There's no doubt in my mind that, had he lived long enough and had the nazis genocided a different group than his own, he would have undeniably rejoiced in the use of his invention. His wife's ""suicide"" seems also pretty suspicious. It took place during a party so he was most likely drunk, they got into an argument,  he shot her, then took the sleeping pills to go to bed with little to no recollection of what took place the night before..."
"Every advancement creates an information hazard. Is it better for every person to have the instructions to create enriched uranium and have the ability to create nuclear weapons? Because the same process can be used to create nuclear energy. Science is a tool. I can use a hammer to drive a nail into wood, or I could use it to bash in someone's skull. The hammer doesn't care either way. It's just doing what it was designed to do."
Amazing story.
How come we Germans so often produce  the most genius and at the same time the most short sighted scientists?
well war is war but he didnt know thats what was gonna happen after his death
And turns out that extra 4 billion people might also spell the end of humanity as we know it.
"Interesting how when we learn these things in chemistry, the name of the process is hard to remember because there is no context, no story. And I agree though that however tragic this story was, in the end Haber was irrelevant. He happened to be the one who did it, but somebody else would have done it eventually. Maybe somebody else was doing it already, at the same time. We'll only remember the one who happened to succeed and we'll never know who else could have been in that position a day, a month or a year later."
"Ah yes, ""The Alchemy of Air"" probably my favorite book for the past few years. Tragic story, Fritz son Herman also committed suicide after the war and the passing of Hermann's wife, then 3 years later Hermann's oldest daughter also committed suicide."
Crazy how he saved the life of 4 billion people but couldn’t save the life of his family

@Arno Wisp Yes and that is what he did on his countries side
@Amit Bhoir Sadly you ain't stopping weapons development. Its a game the biggest loser is the one without a weapon.

You wil say Atom bombs are good since they brought world peace but truth is that is US version not everyones. I condemn all weapons development not based on which country developed it"

"So much good information came from the evils of Nazi scientists. It would be a waste if we intentionally forgot these lessons, no better than burning books just because we don't agree with the evil origin. When they start burning books, burning bodies will soon follow.

"I think the end sentiment ""how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process"", is highly relevant to AI and robotics today.

Mustard gas was observed on those suffering from blood cancers (leukemia) to shrink their tumors. A chemical weapon's components was eventually turned into some of the first chemotherapy drugs after WW2. Chlormethine which is chemically similar to mustard gas  is still used today.
Something good salvaged from the horror.

Not false. Not a crime to help your country. But people will question how you do it.
"Agree with everything you said, Derek, except the last bit. He was smart enough to be well aware and completely responsible for everything he did. He did it for nationalism or some one else would have done what he did are not valid justifications for what he did. 
Science is a tool and it could be a powerful weapon in the wrong hands and the weaponization of science and the people behind it should be treated as criminals and shouldn't be let go just because they're scientists. Otherwise there wouldn't be any difference between Science and Religion....

From Japan to Brazil...if u really have got balls then make a video on the lives that were extinguished by allied forces during ww1 and 2"
Right. Lets bash heads over the number killed in a war where whoever kills the least loses.
He did more good than bad
"This is an amazing story! Everything Haber discovered should allow him to be one of the most successful chemists ever. Regardless of the deaths he caused, imo he was just doing his duty for his country. He had the knowledge that his country needed and invented successful weapons more quickly and effectively than others. People who see him as a villain only see that because Germany ultimately lost the war effort. 

Now look at Einstein and the Manhattan project. We see them as heroes and geniuses. I don't think the Japanese have the same view of them at all... do you?"
"@Scriptsmith I completely agree, but it seems you are still holding that against him. Let me remind you that, even to this day, Japan still suffers from the aftermath of Big Boy and Little Man... so while Haber's weapons may have had ""ghastly effects even on the survivors"" the Manhattan Projects results had life altering effects for multiple GENERATIONS but is still noted for being the defining end to the second world war. Still, which is more revered (for lack of a better word)?"
"Getting shot by bullets is bad enough, but Haber cooked up a weapon he knew would produce the most ghastly, horrific damage even to the survivors. Having been forced to flee Hitler's Germany, he was, in the tradition of the international brotherhood of scientists, taken into Rutherford's labs in England, but was shunned by younger scientists who, having served in the British Army in WWI were appalled at what he had done- and is is hardly surprising that he died of a heart attack not long after."
"he wasnt like a real real monster apart from the part where he gas was tested on his fellow germans

i thought i would be horrified but he turned out to be one hero and an icon and an inspiration.
as far as human beings go he performed execllently and made mistakes we all make during our lives"
So basically he got canceled

"_""How do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else in the planet in the process""_ 

You cant. 

Everything lies in the human imagination, perseverance, dedication and meticulous process on achieving a certain goal. Though the ""Certain Goal"" is very very questionable, which needs to be scrutinized by the foundations of what is ""good and moral"" that have been tested by time. Some of these foundations are ""Basic Human Rights"" and the ""Hippocratic Oath"" of Do No Harm, etc... 

Sadly everything has a PRICE. And if stands it moral ground and if one does not fall for the insurmountable price that is offered, one shall take its place, and will do it by *GREED* in a fraction of the cost, of which replaced the first by forgetting all foundations of good and moral."

"Science is very much like Mjolnir, a tool to build or a weapon to destroy. I am a huge proponent of science, but only when used in conjunction with empathy."
"Haber worked to make his discovery a weapon. Einstein supported him and created the atomic bomb, rumor is Einstein knew his scientific discovery would create a highly destructive weapon. Rumor is Einstein used the “if not me then someone else” excise to justify publishing his discovery that lead to the atomic bomb. Fact is both scientists are more evil, if not equally evil, to confederate statues. To argue in favor of Haber or Einstein is to argue in favor of the absolute destruction of all life on earth. To deny that, is to deny man-made climate change, because they are both threats to life on Earth and very much equal possible means to extinction."

"I love how dispassionate and thoughtful this analysis is. Yet another fantastic video. Thinking about it, civilization needs to remove obstacles in order to grow. Lack of chemical fertilizers was one. Now we need a source of energy that will substitute carbon-based ones, but if we succeed, there will be new barriers. I think it's time for once to accept as real the concept of our planet's ""carrying capacity."" People dismiss Malthus, who said there will eventually be too many people for population to keep growing, and Nature will ruthlessly curtail our numbers. The truth is more complicated, but the idea is sound. We can expand planet's carrying capacity, but at increasing cost and effort. However, if we are foolhardy about it, we might sooner or later be unable to come up with a solution to the next barrier, and then a catastrophe will be inevitable. Our seeming inability to come together to reduce CO2 emissions could be that crisis point, but there will surely be others if we pass this exam. That's why I think that rather than trying to increase Earth's carrying capacity forever, we need to learn to live comfortably inside some reasonable population limit. In other words, we need to come up with a number of people who can live comfortably on Earth, and bring the population down to and within this level. Of course, that would require answering the question ""how?"" in the light of economics, social structures, religious beliefs, and all the other issues that now prevent us from doing so."

"I mean, it would be unjust to said he wasn't right by saying that ending the war sonner was the priority, look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, thousands perish those days, but that meant Japan surrender, and made what Japan is today, as imperfect as it is.
His plan didn't pay off of course, but the point is, you cannot save everyone, sometimes the more gruesome path is the best one, no matter the side, you'll always be a hero and a villain for one or the other, somebody else could've discovered a way a better fertilizer, but when? somebody could've made better chemical weapons too, but when? in the end, somebody had to be the author of it, turns out it was him, could've been any other scientist at any other time with better luck or better tools.
It's kinda odd, we can judge him as if we had the higher moral standard, by calling out how many people his inventions killed, but, we have to call him ""our hero"" whether we like it or not, because if he hadn't discovered that, we wouldn't be here today, somebody else could have done the same at another time, maybe 5 or 10 later, but that wouldn't be our timeline, it would be somebody else's timeline, one were no one of us would exist, by denying him, we are denying our own existence. The only people who can rightfully call him a monster, are those his inventions actually harmed, we are not those people.
In the end, his invention to feed us is probably the only thing we should remember him, not because we should forget his crimes, but because it should be the only valuable legacy we should carry on."

His creation of a process to extract ammonia was world changing
But for his other creations.

And there are plenty of poisonous gasses.
And chlorine isn't very complicated to make people make it accidentally all the time.
Mixing bleach and a acid like lemon juice or a grim eating cleaner will create chlorine along with hydrologic acid.

So I believe he did more good than harm because people would have found a way to hurt each other even without his help.

"20:17 ""Ask scientists to only work on problems that are good for humanity"".
If you asked Huber that, he would say his chemical weapons work *was* good for humanity.  It would end the grinding war and save lives.

Great video Derek. Awesome storytelling. Keep it up!
"America developed the atom bomb to save millions of lives.  Haber developed a deadly gas to save many lives.  Many people agree that the American experiment worked, that without the Bomb the war would have dragged on killing many more persons.  Habers side lost so the rationale is that his gas did not save lives, but cost lives.  This is the danger of producing a weapon so powerful that there is nothing to equal it.  If it fails the whole experiment backfires."

"we literally talked about this in chemistry a couple weeks ago while learning about chemical equilibrium, 8:15 the idea of raising the temperature was actually really weird, as to improve the yield of an exothermic reaction, you're typically supposed to cool the reactants down, but for some reason, the haber process is different"
@Kizu thanks!
"Hello, from my understanding and some info in textbooks.. Yes! To shift eq to the right, the reaction ought to be carried out at a lower temperature as Haber process is exothermic. But this reaction is rather slow (my guess is because at room temperature, there is not enough energy required to break N-N bonds which contributes to the high activation energy of the rxn, despite enthalpy change to be negative. Its like climbing underground and losing potential energy, but there is a mountain blocking your way, you'd have to climb up a mountain first which requires a lot of energy!). Therefore, they found out that a temperature of 400°C and catalyst of iron would produce the greatest amount of NH3 in a short time.

Its important to take note that yes at a lower temperature the % yield of NH3 is greater (meaning the purity of NH3), however it would take too long. Instead they opted to use a higher temperature (producing less pure NH3) but the amount of NH3 produced is greater than at optimal conditions!"
"Your answer? Someone else would have figured it out?

"The fact that he intentionally made a chlorine gas to cause people to drown in their own body fluids undoes any good he did. How is the world population increase a good thing? That caused even more negative repeprcussions to the earth. So also give him ""credit"" for climate change that is now occuring, and the drying up of rivers and lakes. Many scientists have made great discoveries only to end up using them (directly or indirectly) for destruction. Once it's world knowledge, these things can not be contained. None of these people are heroes to the world. It is always money, power and recognition that drives these things.There are better ways to live."

I HOPE HE IS BURNING IN THE WORST HELL POSSIBLE FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS!!!"
I can only imagine what would have happened if Haber had used his intelligence without succumbing to his prejudices.
"When he died of heart failure in basel, no institute wished to associate with him and so he was going to the last place, he would be welcome -: Palestine."
"1:06 I have heard this exact same opening before. I just cannot remember if it was from you, or Simon. So either this is a years old video being reuploaded, or someone plagarized somewhere."
Having a bigger population was actually worse so either way he fucked us
Video editing of this video is top notch. Great work Derek and team!
"Thank you! Food production lead to an increased population. Technology, the ability to store food, also lead to an increased population. Improvements on medicine lead to an increased population. We also learned that the population stagnates based on food production. So, what caused the reproduction rate to stagnate, or even drop, in first world countries? Both parents working. 

Two incomes caused a spike in finances that increased the cost of living. Now in order to have a middle class life that people living in a first world country strive for both parents HAVE to work. 

I fully support women working the same jobs men work in. I fully support men staying at home and being caregivers. The fact is, neither parent can afford to be a caregiver, as to sustaining a middle class life requires both parents earning an income in order to come close to making a livable wage. Making a two income household necessity in order to have a resemblance of a middle class life. 

If we raise minimum wage, we only make the middle class less attainable. The only solution that truly reduces overweight statistics, the crime rate, and the poverty numbers is making a single working parent’s wage livable. Making a two parent income closer to a single income. How can that be done? Hopefully through society refusing to work both parents to raise a family."
Wait isn't this fertilizer the one which some countries are banning because of climate change right now even though there has been warnings about global food shortage?
"I still remember i was taught Haber's process, taught in chemistry across various chapter from thermochemistry to, le chatlier's principle to chemical kinetics, and chemical equilibrium.
But never knew that, this process and the man had this much history"
Governments use anything created for good and turn it into weapons of war. Everytime.  The weapons of destruction always outweigh the good. Everytime.
"Funny. If Germany had won WWI, Habar would be as revered as Einstein. History is written by the victors."
"Do you really think CO2 is a problem for humanity and for the climate?  Really??   Think again.

Contrarian CO2 Facts:

Contrarian fact 1:
CO2 is the most important gas in the atmosphere. It is plant-food, and without CO2 all life on Earth would die. 

Contrarian fact 2:
The average lecture hall has a CO2 concentration of 2,000 ppm, and everyone is fine. In fact, your exhaled breath is 40,000 ppm, and you don’t die.

Contrarian fact 3:
Extra CO2 is already Greening the planet, and about a billion people already rely on that extra agricultural production.

Contrarian fact 4:
Greenhouses often have their CO2 concentrations raised to 1,500 ppm, to make the plants grow quicker. Workers don’t need masks to work in them.

Contrarian fact 5:
CO2 was six times higher (2,500 ppm) during the Cretaceous and Jurassic eras, and the biosphere thrived. In fact, the huge size of dinosaurs was only possible because of higher CO2 concentrations. Thus the apocalyptic claims of Greta the Gremlin are completely unfounded alarmism.

.

Contrarian Climate Data:

Then there are the usual media claims made about the climate, most of which are completely wrong. So here is the contrarian climate data that climate ’scientists’ and their sycophantic media will not talk about:

Contrarian data 1:
The number of strong tornadoes in the US has been decreasing for 65 years.
Data: NOAA, NCDC. (See data and graph from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - NOAA NCDC.)
Tornadoes strong to 2019.jpg


Contrarian data 2:
Northern hemisphere autumn and winter snow extents have been increasing for 50 years.
(See data and graphs from Rutgers Global Snow Lab.)
NH Autumn snow extent.jpgNH winter snow extent.jpg


Contrarian data 3:
There has been no significant increase in the number or total energy of tropical cyclones, over the last 40 years.  (See data from Dr Ryan Maue, meteorologist.). (See also data from “Declining tropical cyclone frequency under global warming”, by Chand and Walsh et al, June 2022.)
Cyclone accumulated Energy.jpg


Contrarian data 4:
Arctic sea ice extent has reduced by 16% over the last 40 years, while Antarctic sea ice extent was steadily increasing until the large storm in 2016.  (See data and graphs from:  NSIDC National Snow and Ice Data Center.)
Arctic sea ice 3.jpg


Contrarian data 5:
Polar bear numbers have been increasing since the 1960s.  (See data by  Prof Crockford.)
Polar bear numbers.jpg


Contrarian data 6:
Dr John Christy has concluded from the data available that global temperatures will only rise 1.1ºc for a doubling of CO2, which is: “not a very alarming number”.  (See Dr Christy’s public ‘easy-read’ paper ”Tropical Skies”.).


Contrarian data 7:
CO2 is plant-food, and thus perhaps the most important gas in the atmosphere. Extra CO2 in the atmosphere promotes faster and more vibrant growth in plants, especially in C3 plants located in arid regions: the conditions found in many Third World countries. (See data from ‘Higher Than Expected CO2 Fertilisation’, by Haverd et al, 2020.)

"None of the ""Contrarian facts"" you made have anything to do with climate. You are talking about agriculture, politics and ecology, not about climate..."
Is it 1918 or 1919 I’m confused. Opening graphic shows 1919 but he says 1918
"Ohhh my sweet summer child, if we ever reach a golden age of technology and space exploration let me give you a quote that defines what it will become:

“IN THE GRIM DARKNESS OF THE FAR FUTURE THERE IS ONLY WAR.”

If some of you know of what I'm talking about, there might be hope for humanity yet."
This reminds me of Attack on Titan
human lives are not as valueble as you think
"Thanks.
I love your work."
"I liked the first ~21 minutes where you explained such tragic yet important part of history, that still today isn't told in german (or most of anywhere) schools. Really good to educate people.
I don't like the last seconds of the video tho, it feels like doing a Haber or monetarization mistake again in saying ""oh look, carbon is trapped there for 1000s of years, let's release it"", yeah that sounds like solving your so called carbon dioxide climate crisis, what could possibly go wrong."
10:58 Steve Carell on the left
I didn't know diorite was this popular...
Really great! Thanks!
"Who knew a paragraph in our chemistry textbooks mentioning Haber’s process had left out so much rich history, euphoria and sadness. Thank you veritasium for telling us such amazing stories."
This video actually fits internship quiet well :D I am working on an ammonia-excreting diazotrophic strain
I sat down for dinner to watch this thinking it would be a fun thought experiment. So far all I’m getting is poop.
"Fritz Haber caused the death of my great great grandfather. He was gassed at the Somme. But Fritz Haber has also saved my family. His invention of turning air into fertilizer has allowed earth to sustain billions more people, my parents and myself among them. So thank you Fritz Haber. As a descendant of one of the victims of your weapon, I forgive you."
Bro you must understand that Haber hasn't directly saved billions or killed millions..if not him then others would have discovered the process (maybe a Lil different)
Dud that’s sad to hear I respect your choice
"Neither a hero nor a villain. A human, and a smart one with a good heart but a questionable moral vision. Not everything is black and white, most people are just ""human."""
The thumbnail makes him look like C-3PO
It's like... Walter White of real life.
This guy has got a thanos kind of thing 🤣
"What an interesting person.
On one hand, he was a brilliant scientist who saved the world from famine and brought in a new era of human development (I for one know that I most likely owe my life to Haber)

But on the other a misguided patriot who threw away his morals in order to give his nation an edge in the war. Ultimately being directly responsible for over 100k excruciating deaths.

He is interesting to me at least because my great great grandfather died at the Somme, dead by gas attack. Yet despite killing a member of my family, and injuring another (great great granduncle got gassed a few months later, came home though), he has allowed me to live, and for my parents to live. What an interesting man.

A pioneer, and a butcher."
"@Sal3600 fair point, the chemists of the entente were just called patriots. I guess that's just some of my bias leaking in"

Missguided lmao. He did well for his side. If he was fighting on our side we'd be praising his less moral action.
Yo
Totally serious right now. How hard would it be to make hydrogen vehicles with ammonia storing the hydrogen
Next video on Max plank
It feels like so many discoveries simultaneously make the world better and scarier
The erasure of Norman Borlaug from the population spike is disappointing.
"Fantastic conclusion; importantly, though ruination is perhaps more efficiently prosecuted through scientific enlightenment, knowledge is not a precondition for destruction, and in many cases is the only way that one may observe pitfalls before disappearing into them."
Maaan he didn't deserve that. It sounds like he genuinely just wanted to help people and his country
im sure bill gates hates this man for contributing to the increasing world population
"Man, Fritz Haber literally looks like a James bond evil villian. He just needs a cat over his lap to pet."
"Pacifists like Albert Einstein, who also contributed to make nuclear bomb. Life is ironic. Scientists are just that, scientist. It is up to the rest of the world, how we use or abuse their contributions to science."
"Ahh yes.. the most easily understandable Great Filter in the Fermi Paradox.  It's inevitable knowledge leads to self-destruction.

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to avoid this of course.  Just like death being inevitable, we might as well do the best we can while alive."
When i read the title i was like: Yeah thats Bill Gates. But then i realised thats not a scientist and he didnt save anyone. But thats the narrative.
*In DR NO the criminal genius was running a clandestine guano island lol*
"something is just DIFFERENT with this  video. u used wayy too much stock footage, that it literally feels annoying. I like the style of your other videos more"
sadly he can't just interview Haber in 1910's
"Thanks, it was so informative and helped us to know what can we do with our knowledge whether to use it in positive ways as Hober first did or to use it against human existence"
He's my first cousin 4x removed
"Thank you I love this stuff. Sounds like Clara was a raging liberal. I'm sorry for her death, but I will be happy when they are all gone. And the liberals will keep attacking this as a CO2 producer. And bad for the planet."

"Someday humanity won't find a scientific breakthrough to help it avoid ""growing to death"" with a population that exhausts resources, and we will wish that we had just controlled ourselves a little better instead of thinking uncontrolled population explosion would just miraculously work-out for us."
“To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell. And so it is with science.” -Richard Feynman.

Who knew the country you so patriotically fought for would end up being the one to persecute you and your people in the near future.
He was simply a cold hearted sociopathic person who only cared about his own success. Scientists should also care about peoples’ lives.
Technologies often solve one problem and creates 10 more.
Haber looks like Hitler
i think i learn more from the internet than school.

"Instead of blaming science, blame society..."
"There may be a small error regarding Zyklon gas. The original product with the warning scent was called simply Zyklon. The German army was a major consumer because large quantities of clothing, etc., could be disinfected quickly with the gas. When the SS ordered the first quantity without the warning scent, it was designated by the manufacturer as ""Zyklon B"" to differentiate it from the gas with the warning scent."
bro why couldnt you make this video 5 months ago when i had a presentation to do on him D:

"I think another video can be on Nikola Tesla or Ramanujan.

Great video
"Haber is more like the left extremist George Soros. Both belonged to the Jewish community, yet never followed it. Haber used chemical weapons to win wars in vain, Soros uses his money on brainwashed communist/left intellectuals to form obstacles in the path of economic progress in developing countries. This is nothing but white supremacism. Europe developed by the riches looted from the Indian subcontinent and South America, whereas the US developed from looting Europe itself, as well as economic colonizing of Arabic and Eastern Asian countries. Science and technology has nothing to do with this. Race and religion are the true enemies of humanity. Indigenous people of North America and Europe did not survive the barbaric onslaught of religiously driven and mad invaders. The Vatican even twisted the meaning of Hakenkreuz into the Hindu Swastika just to target Hindus in the same way they had targeted Jews once. They will never agree that Hitler himself was a stout Christian and the symbol of the Nazis, the hooked cross was taken from a Church in his hometown. Today the pope is going to Canada on pentinetial pilgrimage. Ha ha what a joke! Abrahamic ideologies have been the ultimate curse on humanity so far. When the British were having fun in world wars with the Indian money and food, millions in India died of hunger and diseases. No Western print media did any coverage. Why?"
"Tools don’t destroy, people use them to destroy. Don’t project evil intent onto inanimate objects."
"Yeah, and guess what powers that nitrogen fixing process?

Fossil fuels...

So, all of those that want to ban or make fossil fuels exceedingly expensive, guess what that's going to do to food prices and availability?

Lots of folks *think* they're capable of playing 3D chess, and yet, setting up a checkers board is a challenge."
"we will keep discovering how the world works, it all depends on how we end up using that knowledge"
"how about instead of doing carbon footprint stuff, why not have our regulators do their job and stop corporations from causing the VAST majority of pollution. oh yeah, and cloud seeding isnt do us any good either. some of those chemicals are flammable, and dumping those on areas prone to forest fires is just plain nefarious. and guess who funds them? Blackrock :O would be great to adress the root issues instead of what.... choosing ""better carbon furniture?"" haha seriously?"
"It’s interesting this topic showed up in my subscriptions, because I’ve been hearing a LOT about countries ( including western) want to ban fertilizers completely. Sri Lanka tried that and look what happened to them. Their reasoning for banning, fertilizers can tribute to climate change, but it really stems from the Ukraine war, Russia blocking sales of fertilizer."
"I just love Herr Doktor Professor Fritz Haber, he's totally my hero. He and Dr. Robert Oppenheimer. To me, this was a very emotional video, and now I know that many nitrogen atoms in my body are the legacy of Doktor Haber."
Thanks haber

"Guano was used for agriculture purposes ,good ,in INDIA cow dung is being used for a long long time for the purpose(people get healthy food and very little diseases). However increasing demand of food made chemical fertilizers popular-they made pesticides popular-they made people more and more unhealthy."
I bet Ted Kaczynski would have loved Fritz Haber.... Package delivery people 🤣
"You sold out to the greenies, follow the science dude, you're a scientist right?  I know you've read the papers, you know the temperature differential on this earth while supporting life has been wildly and drastically higher than it ever will be in any human lifetimes."

I guess people forgot that noble peace prize was made by a dude who killed millions and wanted to make sure he try to save more.
"Cellulose nitrate used to make gun powder 😁
And cellulose is made of 300-2500   beta d glucose monosaccharides in c1 and c4 linkage
And you can found cellulose 90% in cotton
And make reaction with nitrogen and make bombs 😅"

"Yes, actually Clara did kill herself because of her husband's choices. She was a pacifist. Also, Fritz Haber was ignoring his wife. He was spending more time with his colleagues and other fellow researchers rather than come home to see his family. This guy IS NOT tragic. He did this to himself. What is tragic was what happened to his wife."
What about the guys at the manhattan project being hailed as heroes for inventing something that was used to kill half a million japanese citizens.
Haber's main problem was being a German citizen on the 20th century.
The duality of man.
"""Every new piece of information is a double edged sword ""

"Climate change and overpopulation is directly linked, we're getting to a point where there are too many humans, which will in turn endlessly be producing carbon and other byproduct waste/pollutants just from having more humans around. There's no denying this and we need some acknowledgement towards it, uncontrolled procreation or unplanned families isn't viable for the future."
"How can one actively involved in developing/designing the killing gas be irrelevant ? He was not just developing Chlorine gas for other purpose, he was doing it for killing. I agree for science/technology, most if not all discovered/invented may be developed/invented by another smart guy eventually if the first guy did not exist. But this cannot be the reason to call him irrelevant."
I felt so bad for him when I first learnt about him while watching Einstein's episode of Genius

Hello
"History treat scientists unfair and it shows the world have no justice or moral, only losser and winner.  Haber invented nitrate but it's not only the German was using the bombs.   Chlorine killed thousand of soldiers?  how about civilians killed by nuclear bombs? it's not about what kill more, it's all about who's the winner."
That was a great video!

This was definitely the best video I've watched in a while. Very well made
U r the most hardworking youtuber
As far as I’m concerned there was nothing wrong with what he did. Haber only tried to save his country and there was nothing wrong with that! Germany was fighting not for some kind of imperialist expansion in an aggressive war but a defensive war by the real imperialists of the time to the east and the west.
Yo. This is your best video yet I think. I cannot think of one that's better off the top of my head.

"Star Trek touches on the moral dilemma of using scientific breakthroughs discovered thru ethnically questionable or ill means.  Personally, I think it's OK.  

Knowledge has no mortality.  The methods by which said knowledge is acquired may be unethical, but the knowledge itself is not.  

If a discovery is achieved thru ill means, and that greatly bothers you, the answer should not be to reject the knowledge, the answer should be to use that knowledge for good."

"Your final question is very easy to answer, because you need to ask to correct question first.
WHO MAKES WARS ???
-Governments make wars, the very concept of World War is entirely depended on Governments, conflicts purely by private people NEVER escalates to large scale wars.
War is not Normal, its NOT a Natural human thing, War is the Extension of Politics...
.
How to stop Wars?

"I am seeing a lot of comments saying, ""Oh you forgot about Bosch"".. well, this video is about the life, death and chemical obsession of Fritz Haber, not just about the creation of Ammonia Distillation.

Fritz Haber is LITERALLY the SUBJECT of the video.

""The Scientist..."" not ""The Invention..."""
"Chlorine gas, when inhaled, combines with the water in the mucus layer covering the lungs and becomes hydrochloric acid. This then burns the tissues and causes fluids and blood from the body to leak into the lungs. It is a horrible, painful way to die. It also burns the eyes and if not flushed quickly with clean water, can cause blindness. Chemical weapons are banned by treaty for very good reasons."
There are no blacks and whites in life only grays. Everything has a positive and a negative that can be associated with it everything will be used to help our lives and to destroy life. Death is just another section of Life the sooner we realize this and stop worrying about that as soon as we can move on as a species and try to work to harm ourselves less. Very few men in this world whom you can actually blame for any one group of people being dead or not. With the exception of Hitler and some other major dictators most people are both good and evil
Fritz Habers inventions saved many more than they killed so I think his overall contribution was positive
Humanity is a people of fire breathers. The techniques we rely on are the very things that can kill us and yet we have learned to thrive with them
Its great to know that 2020 was worse than I thought

"We know most of the guano based fertilisers as super phosphate.  Guano was so much more than a source of nitrogen.  We're facing a potential phosphate shortage, not an ammonia shortage. The Haber process uses fossil fuels (usually natural gas) as the source of H2.  Not good"
"small correction, ammonium nitrate is a oxidizer makes anything that releasing heat do it waaay faster which is why it is often used in explosives"

Einstein wasn't just a pacifist he was a socialist. The impact of your work has more to do with who's side you're on than what it technically does.
Soooo NYT have been douche bags for over a century. Figures.
"The penultimate and the final part of your video don't match well. In the first you mention that technology poses extreme risks on us, which is true and in the second you mention climate change. While the latter is a problem worth talking about it is hugely disproportionately recognized. Climate change will by no means kill us, while the far greater risks of for example AI are widely ignored. WE WILL most likely die out because of it but almost no one ever talks about it, while the rather small problem of climate change is on everyone's minds. If you really want to do something for the world and the future of mankind, that is something you should address rather forcefully."

"Great video Dereck! If you haven't, you should read ""The alchemy of air"". A fantastic in depth read of this history."
"I would argue creating lives is not the same thing as saving those lives. He probably saved millions, and allowed for the expansion of population. If the population wouldn't have exploded without him, then there wouldn't be billions of lives to ""save"" in the first place."
"I understand that it wasn't important to the video (which as always was amazing) so I'll put it here:                                                                                                                         Later that year Booker T. Washington, founder of Tuskegee Institute, convinced (George Washington) Carver to serve as the school's director of agriculture. At Tuskegee, Carver developed his crop rotation method, which alternated nitrate-producing legumes such as peanuts and peas with cotton, which depletes soil of its nutrients.

Following Carver's lead, southern farmers began planting peanuts one year and cotton the next. Although the peanuts were used to feed livestock, large surpluses quickly developed. Carver developed 325 different uses for the extra peanuts–from cooking oil to ink. When he discovered that the sweet potato and the pecan also enriched depleted soils, Carver found uses for these crops as well.

Upon his death, Carver contributed his life savings to establish a research institute at Tuskegee. His birthplace was declared a national monument in 1953."

When Derek keeps his science-communicator hat on, he's terrific.  (When he tries philosophy / worldview stuff... well, let's not dwell on that.)  I think there are others who are better at explaining things (SmarterEveryDay), or who find more interesting, unique topics to discuss(Steve Mould).  But I don't think any of the other science communicators on  youtube can compete with the artistry he brings to it.  This guy should produce movies."

Haber follows the procedure of science. It can be mix with other procedures. In his mind is the prosperity. It is the first stage. What you are suggesting is the second stage.

So he is like homi bhabha of india? He was also a scientist and a patriot who was extremely important to our nuclear weapon project sadly he was assassinated by CIA.
yeeeaaaahhhhhh. Humanity has some growing pains we gotta go through.
You should do one on marie curie
Sounds like he just got lucky his company was working with more Osmiam than Breaking Bad.
Very insightful
"Why t. h. people separate science and politics? 
Why you call him patriot when he just helped that crowned murderer to conquer some territories because Germany, unlike other countries, had real problems with colonies? And when, in fact, real patriots helped German revolution at that time? Do you know what patriotism is? 
 Blackshirts are real patriots then? Or maybe Shiro Ishii is a hero too? 
And why t. h. science can't avoid killing millions of innocent people? Is it unavoidable? Or is it matter of choice? 
In fact a lot of people are still starving due to political and economical reasons, it's not because science can't avoid it, it's because some people protect their monopolies. 
But, sadly, it is normal in our society to treat criminals as heroes, because same people who want you think so, made you close your eyes on so many other crimes that happening now, right under my nose in fact. Those people made you think that war in Ukraine is more important then any other war that happening nonstop all across the globe since WW1 just because it's their economical interests, No f...s were given about Ukrainians or Russians for 30 yesr and now, ""suddenly"".... 
Ugh, anyway, real patriots serves to the people, to majority, not the govermental minority, and so many real heroes who were against wars died in resistance throughout the history. 
You can't just drop the historical and political context, everyone choose their side,  help or ignore, life or death and so on. That man had chosen his side. 
And of course captured german equipment helped allies somehow during and after the war, if you know what i mean..."

"That last point I've heard described as reaching into a bag and pulling out a marble every time we discover something new.

Suggestion - next video should be on regenerative agricultural practices and carbon sequestration.
A true hero.
"Still, people kill people, not weapons."
"You don't know how your research may be used but you have agency when partaking in research with deliberate goals. Ammonium nitrate is an explosive, there's no way to predict its outcomes as a tool of destruction. However Haber knew the outcomes and deliberately made tools of destruction with chemical weapons. This contribution served as a foundation to some of the most terrifying weapons someone can inflict on another human being. I don't agree with the ""elevated"" 'all is irrelevant' view that panders to easier viewership, its uncommitted and morally vague, he did know, and he deliberately went toward a direction which would bring more suffering to society for war. Even the founder of the nobel peace prize, Alfred Nobel realized that his contributions to dynamite would bring great suffering and progress, made the nobel peace prize to serve as a model to do good for scientists and later anyone with great contributions to society.

Haber was short sighted by his jingoism. That's the reality of his story."

@10:44 Are you saying that Haber or the Haber process _CREATED_ 50% of the nitrogen ATOMS in my body? Or are you saying that the nitrogen atoms in question were 'made available' by the process?
"@Twiisted Panda Not quite the question. Is Derek suggesting that  EITHER Haber or the Haber Process  __CREATED__ nitrogen atoms.
You know, it is difficult for anything much less that star-power to change one element into another."
Ofc the process
Science is a beautiful thing but one must always remember its purpose
We need more of these kind of videos. Thanks Derek!
I think anyone who had anything to do with chemical weapons belongs in a special place in hell. May Haber rot.
"A lot of respect for the little details that show the nuance, that he could be a villain or a hero. It would have been so easy to portray his wife's death as a direct result of the chemical weapons to push that narrative."
"it's easy to judge him, but the US had the exact same thought when it comes to the nuclear bomb"
The same goes in the Medical field what people would call horrid or unnaceptable paved the way for medical breakthroughs medicine and procedures we now take for granted today.
Isn't ammonium nitrate also a component in creating methamphetamines?
"Easy answer to your final question... Recognize the obvious: there is no virtue in intelligence. Scientists must remain as servants, never leaders. Those who govern must do so in accordance with transcendent values before earthly knowledge."
"Lol cant say ""saved"" when ppl already got killed.

""Killing millions to save billions"" is THE MOST STUPID thing anyone has ever said!! We hear this logic thrown around a lot these days.

Here i will simplify: After killing millions you get the desired results of the experiments. The remaining population could then be easily programmed - worse than dead!
Lesson: Get rid of such justifications!"
"The real question can also be IF we should keep increasing our control of the natural world if it leads to ways to destroy ourselves. Or alternatively, if the knowledge and control is worth the danger."
"Every Hero is a Villain and every Villain is a Hero to someone else's story.

He was nothing but a man who had a love for Chemistry and wanted to fight for what he believed in, something that many others would have done."
"@Pulsarnaut There is no justification for his actions, both the people who think of him as a hero or as a villain are wrong in my opinion, he was simply a man, nothing more. He did cruel acts and heroic ones. There are things that he is to blame for and things that were out of his control, his invention caused the death of millions of people for the sole purpose of him wanting to take on a challenge.

He probably never had a heroic intention for the fertilizer, nor a villainous one for the chemical weapons, just an aptitude for Chemistry, knowledge and simply having his own fun/challenges. Something millions of people are doing today."
"The problem I have whenever subjective heroism is brought up is that it always tries to create a justification for the actions of someone who is objectively a villain. In this case, what the man believed in was that he could make a weapon worse than they were already testing. That was an intentional choice, with horrific results. The fertilizer he made also isn't necessarily an act of heroism, because he was paid for it. Not a crime or immoral to be paid, but I would hesitate to say that creating it was simply out of love or for the greater good.

For what his discoveries and/or inventions were used for outside his control, I will neither credit nor blame the man for. But for knowingly creating a horrific weapon to more easily kill men in a torturous way, I will wholly blame him for. However it was used, and however many times, were the direct and intended result of his creating it. However he thought of himself, he was a villain who used chemistry to worsen the conditions of the already horrible thing that is war."
The Beirut Explosion is estimated to be as equally as powerful as the Texas City explosion in the 1900s. Really puts into perspective how big of an explosion that explosion was.
Equal to about average day in regular Ukrainian small town.
"I don't agree with the idea of considering a person irrelevant regardless of their positive or negative contribution. Haber was the hero and the villain, we don't need to paint the hero a villain or the villain a hero. There is no necessity to reject such a duality. Sure it is possible that some may develope the technologies to better serve mankind just as Haber did with fertilizer Nitrogen, but he deserves his honor just as he deserves his sins as a chemical warfare initiator. I think people should be educated about the story and understand the danger of the unhealthy obsession one may acquire while doing their own studies. He is not irrelevant, he is a crucial lesson learned."
Is this a re upload because I swear I’ve seen this before
"why there  just 4 billion population, not 7/8?"
"""Over the past few centuries, science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably, but they have also given us ever increasing ways to destroy ourselves.""

""...that we could ask scientists to only work on problems that are good for humanity, but the reality is that every bit of information is a potential double-edge sword."" 

This. 
Gave me literal goosebumps.

Makes you really put into perspective everything known till now and everything that will come in the near and forth future. Both horrendous and beautiful."
double-edged sword is the keyword
"Brain research leads to ways to treat mental problems, but is also paving the way to massive mind control. And not in the psychological way that is already used today."
Reminds me of ai
Haber should have to spend eternity facing the souls of all the countless young men who died horrible deaths from the poison gas weapons he invented. My grandfather was one of the lucky ones whose gas mask saved his life during WWI while serving in the US Army artillery in France.
You would condemn all those souls to spend eternity in the torment of tormenting one man? That's deeply perverse.
Why does Fritz Haber look like Frank Fontaine though?
"When your wife commits suicide out of dissatisfaction, that is a red flag."
"You know I’m so glad you made this video. The question, how do we increase in knowledge and control of nature without destroying ourselves. This is such an important question we need to meditate on as individuals and as communities"
By materially stopping antisocial behavior and dismantling violent imperalist systems. Compassionate systems are possible and people put a lot of work into thinking about and developing them. That's how we progress without destroying.
"""Get their Nitrogen fix""!!!! Get it????"
dont judge scientists for their decision to kill many or change history. dont play the role of historian its not your position to judge powerful people. historians are all red notes in society.
I'd say this process is largely responsible for climate change being so far along advanced.

"The last argument is moot. If he is insignificant for. The whole as others would have invented it, why reward Nobel prizes. The truth is, he did both good and evil with a clear conscience; he knew it would kill thousands, with ending the war sooner in favor of his country. He was a patriotic scientist. Perhaps the nitrogen retrieval process caused more harm in general. Can the world really support this much people? Naivity harms more than intended for..."
I for real read those millions as minions
"The dreadful parallel:  We said the use of the atom bomb shortened the war and therefore saved lives.  How many more times will we find it ""normal"" to justify development of new weapons in this way?"
Victors write the narrative.
Right irrelevant
"So what you are saying is that a Jewish chemist created an insectecide that was later used to commit the holocaust.

In other words, you are calling Jews insects since insectecides kill insects, not human beings.

This video is anti-semitic."
"@DS Ebbebridge Not effectively no. To gas human beings you have to use deadly gas like the one mentioned earlier in this video. Not insectacide. Which begs the question, why not just use Haber's already produced weapons of war gasses instead of an incecticide? Either this video is anti-semitic by calling Jews ""insects"", or you are denying the holocaust."
"@The Fascifist what? The holocaust happened, insectisides can also kill humans?"
"No, hitler thought of them as insects, he just explained what happened"
"the answer to your question is to trust God to guide your steps... i know you science types dont believe in God,  but he invented the science you use to try to disprove him."
So when did god invent science exactly?
We are meant to kill ourselves to control the population.. there are just too many people now..
"Well it would be wrong to Haber ""irrelevant"" if we very likely owe our existence to him. What was that, like a 50% chance basically?"
Paleoclimate data reveals earth is in a carbon starved state right now. cool idea with the rocks though
"Was the ""Everything is a Remix"" vibe of the last segment intentional, or an ironic example of convergent creativity?


In any case, video!"
Who knew our bodies were made up of 90% guano?
To dismiss Haber as irrelevant because somebody else would have  dicovered or invented the things he did is ridiculous.  The same could be said for every scientist who has ever lived.
"The question posed at the end of this video is profound and worthy of an answer. Science is a gift, and so is philosophy and theology. these applied together give a nuanced and human answer we often call ethics. let's use all our gifts to bring about the best outcomes for humanity."
I consider Fritz Haber to be a tragic figure.
Outstanding video 👏👏
"Actually, gaseous chlorine reacts with water forming muriatic acid. So  you are essentially drowning in your own blood.
Second. Why illustration of German chlorine attacks features German soldiers in gas masks which weren't invented yet?"

Always a treat to watch derek.
The logo for Wren needs a longer tail. Have they ever seen one?
Nothing is truer than science being a double edged sword. I think today's greatest example of that is any nuclear projects. If done right current studies have found it could give us ample clean energy for centuries or with just a sprinkle of hatred and one short temper it could blow us all to smithereens tomorrow.
Wisdom and humility are necessary to turn knowledge into a benefit rather than a weapon.
I really like these little scientist documentaries
"What a great video, loved the message at the end. Keep up the good work fellas."
"As Isaac Asimov once said, “The saddest aspect of society right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom."""
Haha. Tell that to the mass.
"As Schopenhauer once said: ""Today it is bad, and day by day it will get worse... until at last the worst of all arrives."""
"@Tapis T You are confusing morality with sentimentality. Morality has absolutely nothing to do with how the choices are made. Actions are either good or bad, ethical or not, regardless of the reasoning behind them. Whether you decide to give to charity out of a rational desire to help others or the sentimental good feeling it gives you, that doesn't change the goodness of the action itself.

I think you should’ve more clearly stated that a massive percentage of our CO2 emissions come from the production of these fertilizers. The large temperatures and pressures needed to produce ammonia are created by burning fossil fuels. Through regenerative agriculture we could maintain our current food production without the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Making this change will be essential in fighting climate change but the most powerful agriculture corps and big oil refuse to allow that to be an option. Instead they are claiming that getting rid of meat and continuing to monocrop with chemical fertilizers will fix the environment.
"3:10 I'm glad you didn't spend time potentially confusing the audience... There's a strange issue in chemistry where breaking bonds releases energy, but also making bonds releases energy.

That idea was invented by British petroleum to smokescreen away the lobbying and work they do to keep the world addicted to oil.

"There is NO climate crisis, only alarmists who demagogue the issue use such language. Climate authorities such as the IPCC and the Secretary General of the UN's World Meteorology Organization have spoken up against such language. Furthermore, none of the metrics used to measure weather and climate do NOT show alarming rates of increase and in some categories, such as tornadoes, actually show a decrease in numbers and intensity. Stick to the science and avoid the politics please."
"@First Name Last Name Look it up for yourself and show me how hurricanes, tornadoes, heat waves, droughts, wildfires are any worse today than in the past. You can't because they aren't. 

Metrics such as the Accumulated Cyclonic Energy (ACE) scale shows NO increase in hurricane intensity over time. The Palmer Drought Severity scale shows droughts were worse in the 1930's when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were very much less, wildfire acreage burned is down ~25% in the past two decades globally etc., etc. 

Climate Change is REAL, but not catastrophic, as both the IPCC and WMO have publicly stated. Don't be a sheep, look for your self! 

The so called crisis is based on computer projections of future warming which have demonstrated to greatly overestimate the amount of warming which occurred based on past forecasts and the author here is not a climate scientist anyway."

"What Clara says in that letter seems to me less like she was upset at him for the gas and more that she felt disheartened by the gap between them as fellow chemists. After all this very video is about him and not her. She may have even aided him in his work. She was his wife and again a fellow PhD chemist so she may have supported him. However she didn’t receive any credit at least not as much wether for her own work or potentially assisting in his. Feeling like you’re career, and one you worked hard enough to get a PhD for, come to what in comparison may feel like nothing. That can be utterly and maybe even lethally depressing."
"This also maybe due to princess syndrome.

"Farming practices play a big role in the amount of nitrogen fixing bacteria in the soil. When fertilizers are used, plants like legumes which normally form a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria no longer sustain their side of the deal because they get nitrogen artificially. This leads to an overall deadening of the microscopic soil food web. I wonder if the nitrogen scare in the 19th century was partly a result of industrialization and farming practices that neglected the soil. 
Growing a Revolution is a great book about a geologist's study of regenerative agriculture and how many farms are reducing their use of chemical fertilizers by focusing on soil health. Thanks for reading my thoughts:)"

A lot of energy is involved in the process of creating Nitrogen. If we're able to optimize this process it'd be huge for climate change.

Jesus dude.  What a depressing ass story.
"Great video Derek and the Veritasium team! I appreciated the deep dive and comparison and contrasting of Fritz Haber's achievements. 

I think its worth noting that synthetic fertilizer are themselves double edged swords, especially since Wren is your sponsor. While they've done a lot to produce huge amounts of food, they also kill the microbial life in the soil and are largely responsible for the huge damage to marine ecosystems caused by algal blooms where agricultural watersheds empty into seas and oceans such as in the gulf of Mexico. 

A substantial amount of research in agriculture is finding that just using chemistry to grow food degrades the soil and grows poorer quality food. By using techniques that uses biology and ecology along with chemistry you get better results. For example, by plnting nitrogen fixing plants during non-growing seasons (cover cropping), planting many different kinds of plants together to attract beneficial insects (polyculture), and using mulches and composts, you can create farming systems that mimic natural ecosystems and require little to know nitrogen input while being more drought and pest resistant. 

All that said, I think this was still a great video. After all, it was more about the nuance of discovery than the use of chemical fertilizer."
"@Veritasium Oh wow, I'm surprised you commented but thanks! I think one of the biggest challenges with tackling complicated and entangled topics like this is that you can never really tell the full story. There is just too much detail in pictures this big to even summarize it in an hour, let alone twenty minutes. I think you guys do a good job of managing that balancing act between relevant information and approachable story length. Keep up the good work!"
Pretty sure my teacher said something like this about building new things and people will always fear new things but it’s because of that fear we can also keep going
@Veritasium it’s understandable

"By trying to end a war quickly,he threw his ethics away,and gave the state a weapon that was later on used to kill his own people.

He didnt throw away his ethics. He did what He believed to be patriotic and ethical.
"reminds me from a sentence that translated in english say something like ""those who live for the sword, die for the sword"" so, if you use a sword to kill, eventually ou will be killed by a sword, or better said, a man using a sword, so, he invented a weapon that eventually cause the death of his people, like a man creating a sword that eventually is used to kill his own people"
@McFlyingFury why did you have to make it cringe

"To be fair, the same could be said about nuclear energy. The energy used to power homes of millions of people around the world was also used to kill hundreds of thousands and threaten billions.

If you are going to work in the weapons industry you should design weapons which kill in a humane way. That being quickly and with minimum excess pain. Inhumane weapons cause drawn out overly painful death. That is sometimes hard to define and heavily debated but it should always be at the forefront of your mind.
"Which makes you wonder, if you must execute certain criminals, why laughing gas (nitrous oxide) is not used."

"I feel the analogy of keys for scientific study is apt here, I don't remember where the quote is from, but it goes that science gives us the keys to unlock the gate to heaven or to hell."
"Max Planck, Max Born and Max ...Uh I mean Albert Einstein."
"You can't really blame him for developing chemical weapons if his true intention was to end the war sooner, this is what the Americans did with atomic bombs, at least his was only on military personnel."
Great conclusion. Haber's story is one of inspiration and tragedy.
Loved this episode… thank you sir.
"the answer for your question in the end of the video ""how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?""  is basically to have a ""religion"", and to be more specific is to be Muslim, Islam invite people to live a peaceful life based on theism, justice and purity. Therefore, peace in Islam is an eternal constitution. Even the nature of war in Islam is a defensive one, not an offensive one, because the principle of Islam is peace and coexistence, not conflict, violence and war."

How come we never learn about stuff like this in school?
"You know what. The guy SOLVED FOOD, honestly who cares what else he did.



PS:  Also to say anyone who invented something is irrelevant because Science would have invented it later it is VERY naive. Yes the worked on it but they could have worked on it but the problem with new stuff is that until somebody makes it, it is completely possible that nobody will ever figure out how to make a thing, regardless how easy or logical it appears to us after it was invented."

"I don’t find this to be an accurate account of the long term benefit of nitrogen fertilizer. It’s caused a lot of damage as well, and while we’re producing enough calories for everyone, we’re not producing the required nutritional needs. In the US, 1/3 of the population is both malnourished AND morbidly obese. 

The amazing thing is that we’re learning so much about biology, and applying that over the chemistry we’ve learned in the past, allowing a return to high nutrient density with a very small drag on production. We’re also learning that while grains may have saved billions from starvation due to their store-ability, we’re actually much better suited for high protein and vegetable consumption. Todays refrigeration technology makes a better diet far easier to maintain."

You can completely and utterly obliterate a metropolis with a cupple of nukes, millions of dead, the most powerfull weapons imagineable, on a planet-scale.

"For historical context while we now think of war as extremely bad (I think of it also as one of the worst things humanity can do) at the time of WW1 waging wars was often tragic but a ""common"" part of politics
so I find this an important information to put the actions into historical context 

also mentioning Bosch to explain the Haber-Bosch aparatus/mechanism is also important for context"
"I'd really love to see some deep dives into soil science, microbes and fungi. Maybe a comparison to salt based fertilizers?"
definitely NOT a positive discovery....earth would feel better with 4bln ppl less
Always those germans xD

He is a villain.  In this case he knowingly making chemical weapons and test it.
God bless this man for all his wonderful inventions
"The double edged sword hit me hard in a video game a few months ago 

I had managed to invent a new propulsion type that broke the speed limit of the game letting me outrun anyone attacking me until it was used as a weapon when I wanted to stop a warmongering faction which had been hunting new players down for fun.
I'd done it done by turning the propulsive drive into antimatters missiles which directly ended the war in minutes, but once others started using it too the server descended into chaos resulting in me being martyed and exiled near the end

I had designed a new propulsion type that solved many many hours if not days of travel time but upon using the same invention to solve a different problem I had unleashed a weapon I couldn't take back which ended up in the near total destruction of the server"
what the hell what game are you talking about
"*fake news.

Something smells..."
"Can't choose like that good/bad are relative to the time and place of the person doing the deed, the search of new ways of doing things has the danger of doing some fucked up thing in the trying, atomic energy, lead in gasoline, plastic, AI.. we only know what we know now. Tomorrow our heroes could become our nightmare. Ask any child of house abuse."
Fritz Haber being Jewish excellent brain and solved problems but during the First World war used Chemical warfare. After the war the allies wanted the Nobel prize committee to refuke it .The Second world war follows and Nazi Germany used Zyklon B invented by Fritz Haber to kill Jews .
"Wow, you keep impressed me with your solid story telling."
Awesome video
"This guys life can be summed up with Linkin Parks song ""What I've Done"""
"A decent video on Haber, but completely missing the other major player: Carl Bosch. While Haber made the breakthrough, and proved the process was possible, it was Bosch who made it feasible and scalable."
which is why it's called Haber-Bosch Process!
"Well, the topic IS about Haber mainly. So, it's really logical to focus on him, no?"
20:40 Good question. Unfortunately science cannot help here.
"Fritz Haber was really just like ""And for my next trick, war crimes."""
so basically the dude had the same mindset of the americans that bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki
As much as society might hate or ignore him. There is something beautiful about Haber process that i learned in my high school chemistry. Yes he might have killed some thousands of humans during war so did Oppenheimer using atom bomb but we cannot ignore the fact both modern fertilizer industry and nuclear process are the hope of humanity for our food and energy needs in upcoming future.
Great storytelling!
Well at least he wasn’t a nazi
Made this comment right before the Zyclon B part
Hmm.. Doesn't Ukraine make a lot of the world's supply of nitrogen fertilizer?

Waiting for the Boltzmann episode
"""So the real question is - how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet?"" Today around 75% of all agricultural land is farmed with industrial practices. That 75% produces around 50% of global food production. The other 50% of global food production is produced on just 25% of agricultural land. Understanding the natural processes within the soil is the key to our survival."
1:06 what if you as American citizen found an oil reserve in the middle eastern countries? will you slaughter the people and destroy their house as well? while yelling to the world 24/7 that they they're bunch of communist terrorist lead by a cruel dictator ??
Entropy bad. More at eleven.
No good deed goes unpunished
"I don't mean to go all conspiracy but... it seems pretty suspicious that  Clara's death was deemed a suicide when no one witnessed it? It's odd that she would shoot herself in the chest for one and for two It's very convenient that Fritz took sleeping pills, like this is an alibi to draw away suspicion from himself. This guy obviously had no qualms about murdering people, even if far removed. It seems equally likely that he shot her after the argument, went to bed. Plus he gets on a train the next morning like ""see ya son have fun with your mom's ghost"".
Her letter is also curious. Sure his increasing fanaticism and homicidal tendencies would sully a marriage but it was so glossed over that she was the first woman to get a PhD in Chem. Fritz had Clara to bounce all his ideas off of, or even more likely, they worked together on it. Who wouldn't ask their spouse for advice, especially if the advice is about chem and your wife's a chemist? How plausible was it for a woman in that time to be recognized for a discovery like this if she did contribute? There's also a chance that she became distraught about how ""their"" discovery was being used in WWI and that may motivate her to a) kill herself b) confront at her husband about it.

Anyway I think this whole thing seems sketch and who knows what the truth is.
Thank you for coming to my TedTalk."
Didn’t expect to get vored by Darek at 2:47
"At the beginning of the video, i thought he was the inventor or the perfecter of the lathe, the machine that made possible the great machines we still use and improve to this day and also with great precision that made those machines able to be operated to our desires and needs like farming equipment, surgical tools, but also guns and explosives. but then i thought about it a lot more and concluded that we can't really owe our everything to any one man/woman/group because there will always be something or someone that is crucial or sometimes maybe even more crucial than the thing that comes after it. because that's how history works (it is a causal process).
although, if we were to go with that logic, we should be thanking the first lifeforms that evolved to allow our life and, sub sequentially, our deaths.
heck, we should be thanking the big bang for making anything at all.
(of course, some could say God made it all too).
this way of thinking that one man/woman carried the world like Atlas is kind of backwards in my opinion, since it invalidates our cohesiveness and friendship as a species to work together for making a better future for everyone and instead makes us think that we, normal people, have no effect to that effort as a whole."
there is a striking resemblance between him creating gas to attempt to end ww1 and america nuking japan to end ww2
"While this was a good video, however, there are obvious parallels that people should reflect on when suggesting change or policy.

""Killed Millions and Saved Billions""  Is something that radicals think about things like The Holodomor and The Holocaust.  It's always disturbing when people highlight this as rhetoric.

Many historic villains thought they were the heroes, saving some theoretical future by forcing sacrifice(often culminating in death) upon people ""today"".  This video was about a somewhat innocent scientist, so that makes this somewhat tangential, but worthy of consideration nonetheless."
what a monster
"The worst thing about Haber’s choice to manufacture chemical weapons is that it was very much a choice— he was already a wealthy, respected scholar. He had nothing to prove and nothing to gain except pride in his country by “improving” their chemical weapons. His process for extracting nitrogen may have enabled many of our lives, but his conscious choice to develop some of the most heinous weapons ever used in combat is completely indefensible. He wasn’t even “just following orders”, he did this of his own initiative. He did not deserve his Nobel Prize."
Alied scientists did the same thing and were still rewarded
Excellent video! Thanks for making it.
"Consider: by developing a process to produce fertilizer, billions of “excess” people were fed each year. And they consumed immense amounts of fossil fuels. That warmed the Earth so much and so fast that the Arctic melted completely, and the Antarctic prevented calamity. But the carbon emissions were so great that the immense clathrate deposits warmed and released their methane. Over 1,500 billion added tons of carbon boiled into the atmosphere warming the world so much that over the next several millennia even the Antarctic melted. The oceans rose 280 meters. Most of the species on Earth died. The oceans went anoxic and purple Cyanobacteria emitted huge quantities of sulfur oxides. Yet more species died. The world was made ripe for an explosion of new life. Children, that is how the Earth was made clean again for the rise of intelligence - for us. The apes almost reached intelligence. But they were not wise. And in the end they killed themselves and most species alive - making way for our great civilization."
"I am deeply moved by your video, which shows the tragic story of a man who did great things and also terrible things.
 In each one of us lies good and evil, in brilliant people, that good and that evil can be equally remarkable."
"Huge thumbs up for the video!! Fascinating story, so well told and put into perspective! I loved the ending and how you developed your question for the video. Always a pleasure to watch your content!"
✊🏿 condemn war crimes! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️⚧
"Generic positionless comment on war crime video. This guy is just totally impartial on war crimes. Got nothing to say on the issue, just liked the video is all. War crimes? Interesting."
"Lovely video, but seeing bonds measured in electronvolts is something i haven't see yet."
"What if we counted all the ppl indirectly killed by industrial nitreous salts,water table destruction,rhizospherel life destruction, and people who starved while farming for export? I bet it's more than the poison gas."
"STOP! This ‘offsetting carbon emissions’ are a scam. Don’t promote it, Derek! 

They’ve been revealed that every time you click ‘yes’ on that ‘carbon offset’ charge on airline tickets does absolutely nothing. (And everywhere else). 

What even is ‘carbon offsets’. You think people are out there planting trees? The amount of money donated to all these organisations vs the amount of ‘work’ that’s actually done has been exposed to be greedy shiesters. You think that ‘offsetting’ your emissions absolves you of guilt? It’s a complete scam. 

Reduce Reuse Recycle. It’s in that order because of importance. ‘Carbon offsets’ is nowhere on that list. Better to *reduce* the amount of waste you consume than anything else. Better to reuse what you can and find a secondary purpose for things which you might throw out. Recycling is a scam as well as this mysterious ‘offsetting’ horseshit."
"Love what you do. I’m channeling your wisdom, humor, and knowledge to my elementary STEAM students. Keep it up."
This title makes me think that Derrick is becoming a massive shitter.
Seen it years ago on Johnny Harris's channel.
Not irrelevant... He fed the world and killed thousands with the same zeal... The zyklon stuff is irrelevant as he was long dead when that happened.
"Science, not religions, has saved and developed human being. If there is God, God should be Superintellingence creating universe,  maths, physics, chemistry, biology"
"Putting aside the fact that 'science v. religion' has nothing to do with the video, there's a difference between religion and faith."
"Werner von Braun was an enemy and a hero too.....Nazi rocket pioneer, to a NASA must have that was heavily  involved  in getting us to Luna first....so many tragic  heros throughout  history....🥺"
The saying the road to hell is paved with good intentions is fitting. Most people aren’t straight good or bad. We all do good things but we can also turn around and harm others. He never started out trying to kill people. He was trying to solve an ever pressing issue. The result was something good that can be used for bad and unfortunately was. I can’t fault him for the gas attacks bc all the countries were doing it at the time. Zyklon B was also straight up misused after his death.
To believe that artificial fertilizers is a requirement to feed 10 billion people is a fallacy.
that involved military grade explosives!!
Got real existential there at the end
Once again a truly beautiful video. Thank you for continuing to do what you do so well
"His process for distilling nitrogen has not helped humanity in any way, but in fact has resulted in increase of population beyond the natural sustainable capacity of geological systems. There will be billions of human deaths in the next few decades because of the arrogance of scientists like Haber. Capitalism is a failure"
"That same logic could be applied to anything positive to argue that positive gain never supersedes the capacity of mankind's limitations; i.e. every positive development is a long-term failure. If everyone lived by that principle, we'd only ever have a world of perfectionism where nothing is ever tried or attempted because it has either a short or long-term drawback. I agree that capitalism has its flaws, but whether you're talking about economic policy, nitrogen production, or whatever else- there's always a benefit to be had, thus the point of trying it in the first place.

If you're looking for a world without death or arrogance, maybe stick to fictional topics."
🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
its all poop? .. always has been
"I had the same revelation when studying aerospace engineering. The same technology that can help build rockets to explore the final frontier can also be used to build ICBMs... The same technology can build an efficient airliner, can also be used to build marine patrols or military transports..."
What about his son
I think I have watched it already
The science wouldn't be misused if there's no reason to misuse it. It all falls on the people at the top who creates reasons for wars
Never realized nitrogen had such beautiful poetry behind it. Man can either use its power over the element to take it out of the atmosphere and propagate life or we use up the nitrogen that we have in the name of war. Thank you Derek.
It reminds me of the french video from e-penser on the same subject. It was fascinating.
"Derek, what an amazing channel you created, happy to have found it. It is a great video for many reasons - but you could have made a great connection between A.Nobel, Haber and also Oppenheimer i believe. There must be a moment for all of them, especially Haber and Oppenheimer, when they clearly experienced ""backlash"" from what they discovered. I do believe people would love to see more about that side of science and its unintentioned effects..."
"""2 processes that do this [break nitrogen bonds] naturally"" - pity karate chop is not one of them.  Chemistry would be much more fun that way!"
"Acceptances and understanding.  No more war, would allow progress in one direction. The underlining turning point of science is based on the age-old idea of more power. The world needs to learn how to get along."
"exactly.. everything can be used as a weapon in the wrong hands.. take for example, Chemotherapy for cancer patients, it was derived from mustard gas that was used in the world war.. it took millions of lives, but also saved millions and is still saving up to this day.."
The only way to end war is to end governments.
"14:55 Ah the ol' ""nukes ended the war more quickly we pinkie promise"" train of reasoning."
Oh wow
"Derek, you make very thought provoking content and well thought out and laid out. But chlorine gas is not heavier than air but DENSER. There is a huge distinction between the two. Thank you."
@Mi p exctally heavier relies on volume. The entire body of air in any war zone was heavier than chlorine gas but because the chlorine gas was denser it would sink. This is the distinction. Volume dependence. Did all of the canisters during the war weigh more than all of the air? NO. It is denser you prove my point in your rebuttal but then forget what you said.
"Do you even know what density means? There is hardly a ""huge distincton"" as you say. Density is just mass/volume. So for any given volume, chlorine is heavier."
great title
"I definitely wouldn’t say he was a good or bad person, but he singlehandedly made a huge impact regardless of who he was."
"Derek you are balding, but you have tried to hide that so hard that it looks more weird than your baldness would"
I wouldn't call it saving billions given the billions that will die of climate change in big part due to that discovery....
Edwin Howard Armstrong lived an incredibly tragic and interesting life that might be worth looking at
Can elitist that use their jet planes to spread the “climate alarmist” message use wren so they would also know their carbon footprint impact?
Can't believe I never knew this!
yeeet nitrogen protests people need to be educated
"Wow, are we really finding ways to justify genocide?"
"19:35 What? How is he a hero? He's pretty much single-handedly responsible for the world becoming overpopulated, and overpopulation is cause of literally _every_ problem in the world (I defy you to name one problem we have that it's not ultimately the cause of). Either way, he's a villain, either way, he caused tremendous amounts of harm, either short-term direct harm with his chemical-weapons or indefinite perpetual indirect harm by overpopulating the world. 😠

19:42 The ""someone else would have"" hand-waving argument is very specious. It's not valid because saying that someone else would have done a thing doesn't make it equivalent. Someone else might have done a given thing, sure, but it would have been later and in a different location and the ripples from that difference, the butterfly-effect cause events to play out very differently. In the case of bad things, someone not having done them where and when they did means someone else (might) have done it somewhere else later on, which likely would be less harmful because harmful things happening later are usually less harmful since society will have progressed by then and people will be different.

For example, if he hadn't created those chemical-weapons, they wouldn't have been used in those gas-chambers and by the time someone else had invented them, society might have been more tolerant and accepting enough to end up not having used them like that.

(Yes, you could counter with saying that the bad things happening are a driving factor in changing and progressing society, but that's at least, it not more washed out by the fact that societal change and progression is as inevitable as entropy even without bad stuff, just look at how much the world has changed—not exclusively, but _mostly_ for the better—since the Internet allowed universal communication and made the planet smaller, allowing people to connect and relate to others.)"

Lol wren what a lode
the day we get fusion power is the the that we can have clean power but we can have some wel lets say super wepons that can realy kill all of life easy you get some good but some bad to
thanks for the video
Great use of the Commonwealth pronunciation of laboratory!  I wasn't expecting that with your North American accent.
Derek will you please make a video on webbs telescope and pictures captured by it. You explain the topics quite clearly. Please if you got the time!
This guy was asked the question “would you save the many at the sacrifice of the few” and said yes
Climate action cannot exist within a capitalist framework
"""someone else wouldve made amonia"" is such a stupid way to take credit away where its due. you could just as well argue someone else wouldve used chlorine gas and pesticide to kill humans. what a downer on an otherwise good video"
"I once took a class where we got to design an ammonia synthesis process in Aspen HYSYS, and the operating costs were crazy. Despite more than 100 years of optimization, the reaction only works at ridiculously high temperatures and pressures because of the activation energy needed to break the N2 triple bond. But it's still profitable because modern agriculture wouldn't exist without ammonia.

I had another professor claim that if anyone invented a catalyst that enabled ammonia synthesis under atmospheric conditions, they'd become the world's first trillionaire"
Nitrogen-fixing bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia at room temperature and pressure. Maybe the solution would be biologic instead of chemical.
@MycenaeanGal bruh bet wetter talking about science
@Todd Howard 100% of psychology studettes attend for self diagnostic reasons. We let the batsh!tcrazy treat the batsh!t crazy. Good luck 🤣
I feel like going into the chemistry field just to find a way to harvest nitrogen easily. I’m more into biology and psychology but I could put the work into learning a deep understanding of chemistry.
@cryora another affordable method is by using DBD plasma.
He seems to be an accidental hero but a deliberate villain.

"We should mention that the primary source of hydrogen for the Haber-Bosch process, and the majority of all hydrogen production currently, comes from petrochemicals. 
We are alive because we the long dead, and green hydrogen and ammonia production will be just as necessary for decarbonization as transforming the energy sector."
This is the single most intriguing scientist story I've ever come across in my life.  Thank you.

"""Death is death no matter how it is inflicted."" ~ Fritz Haber"
Let the animators more days to work with
"Haber's life has long been a weird thing to me. I'm coming to the belief that his discovery of nitrogen fixation is also a bad thing. The population growth it spawned has become a big problem given what we are doing to the planet - habitat loss, climate change, pollution of the oceans etc."
This is an interesting time to release this video
Brilliant!
"Of course, a German"
Watch the Dutch news… we have a weeeeeee bit too much nitrogen according to the government.
"On the last question he asks: i think, we need a cultural revolution akin to the scientific revolution we hadin the 18hunreds and 19hundreds. I don't know how it will express itself, but i know that withotut it and the technology that is practiced today and will be in the next decades, we will not have a bright future unless we will change something about how humanity worked for the last 10.000 years. We need to question and conciously alter our believs, culture, education and principles in a way as we changed the way we think and record things  in the scientific revolution,"
"The audio is mixed a bit too low on this one, I think"
I thought the lead in your gas guy was bad.
"Pffffff, those sound like shitty islands to me............"
"Who knew a paragraph in our chemistry textbooks mentioning Haber’s process had left out so much rich history, euphoria and sadness. Thank you veritasium for telling us such amazing stories."
He just serve his country. Nurdy amaricans can't understand that.
@FHZ exactly. You hit the Nail on the Head. Teachers Teach the Test Period. That’s really the problem.
"Science and technology in to many cases end up becoming a tool for perople that already wield to much power for the good of themselves and all people around. A increase of control over ""nature"" result, in the end of the day, in more control of ever smaller elites upon an ever growing majority of people. About 2500, Plato wrote his ""the republic"" knowing it to be an utopy. Thanks to science, tech and the wealth and power amassed in the process, it is no more so."
I’ve heard of the bird Peru poop. I can’t believe I’ve never heard of this guy.
"How can this guy be so smart, but still believe killing the cleanest economy in the world so that the dirtiest take over?"
"Wow! YES let's use chemistry for good. Stop any sort of energy that kills birds!❤ Proper husbandry of the land evolves building bird's homes around the land, bird's help the plants by eating bugs. All NATURE is waiting for us to remember THE SACRED LAWS OF BROTHERHOOD. RESPECT HONOUR GRATITUDE THANKSGIVING 🙏."
"Very moving story, I like your videos x"
"Facts are spot on but very suggestive and manipulatie presentation makes it almost unscientific. Please Derek, change this crap."
hmmm
"Absolutely awesome video. But about the carbon footprint, you need to realize that it's a scheme used by the richest fossil fuel billionaires to make us think we, the workers, are the ones in fault when it comes to global warming, and not them, the billionaires who have for decades profited massively off of global warmming and lobbied the government to invest in their fossil fuel companies more and to ignore actual solutions to climate change, such as investing in renewable energy sources and nuclear energy, public transportation, stopping deforestation, planting new trees, stopping intensive agriculture that's destroying the soils, promoting food self sufficiency of all countries. If you think we don't have the resources to invest in this things, just know one thing: the US's military budget in 2022 is 778 billion dollars."
I think Dr Elaine Ingham is suitable for a nobel piece prize
Is there some sort of logic that a guy who came up with all of these chemical revolutions for good and bad thought that he could make gold out of sea water?  It seems incredibly  foolhardy but there must have been some logic he was operating on.  right?
"I don't care, he's a war criminal."
"As soon as I saw the title I thought, “Probably gonna be Haber” Interesting guy."
"Wow, absolutely fantastic. The pacing was perfect, covered everything we needed to know in a constantly engaging but never overbearing way, and explained with sincerity the different facets of his work regarding both wartime and peacetime innovations. He is surely near the top on the list of most influential humans to have lived, for better or for worse."
"@BINARYGOD no, I don’t mean that. I meant to leave it up to the individual to determine how negatively they weigh his role in war and genocide against his direct responsibility for our collective lives"
you mean for better AND for worse
This video also explains why Dutch famers protested when the government wanted them to cut nitrogen usage...
"Spend less money on space travel and going to Mars and focus that on stabilizing and helping our planet and it's creatures. 
We haven't even been able to survive long term in the South West USA but we thinking about living on mars. 👍"

"20:38 I Firmly believe this is what ""The Great Filter"" is"
Humans are the great filter.
"A monster, is a monster, is a monster.
No what ifs or buts.
btw, africa's population in 1950 was 227 million. Today is 1,426 million, and projected to be 4,000 million in 2100.
How the F! is this a good thing, primarily for them, for the planet, or the rest of us dealing with the fallout of this explosion?"
"When I was studying for a chemistry contest some years ago, while I was reading a Raymond Chang book, I learned about the Haber process. It was a chapter about chemical equilibrium.
It said, that if we were a chemist who wanted to produce Ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, then from paper we would find that the logical and cheap way with most Ammonia gain would be to do the reaction at high pressures and low temperatures (-50°C). 
And it is Indeed, How me make the most ammonia; the only discrepancy with the Haber process is that the operation is carried out at 500°C!. The reason for this, is that at high temperatures, although it's more expensive and the Ammonia yield is low; Production rate is increased.
Thus, faster commercial production is preferable, even if it means lower yields and higher operating costs; so it Became  the most efficient way to produce ammonia on a large scale."
Yo the Dr.Robotnik backstory
...  then they realised deception in the guise of healthcare...was MUCH easier.....hey bill.
he made the best and also one of the worst contribution to this plated.... I have 0 idea what to think about this....
we can't
"This was one of the best videos you’ve made in years in my opinion. I loved every part of it, the animation, the way the information was presented, the narration, even the sponsor at the end. Thank you for taking the time to make this video, it made my day better."
"True, this was not only well made, but also well paced and well explained for relatively dumb people like me."
"And when you read the description under the video, you’ll see a bunch of people names that made it and that’s why this video is go great!"
Absolutely in agreement with your statement.
😌
how didn't I know about this?
Incredible story
yes
His Mustard gas is also used in a refined way as Chemotherapy....thats a big way that he has saved millions of lives too
Why kill millions when you could save…..billions?
"Imagine creating something like Zyklon intending for it to help people grow food, only for evil men to use it to kill millions."
Imagine believing claims that a fumigant was used in a physically impossible way to magically delete 170% of a group and also magically leave about 80% of that group alive
"As is with most scientific advancement (nuclear being the most prominent in this context), we can use it for good or for bad. But expecting all advancements to be used for good is impracticle so we must continue innovating and discovering while hoping we don't end up being the next Haber. Becasue at the end of the day an invention may be used to kill a million but if it can save billions then its worth inventing"
"Hey how about instead of placing a sponsorship ad about viewers' personal ""carbon footprints"" you create an episode detailing the reality of global warming being in the hands of gigantic corporations with zero accountability from governments and citizens."
"So killed millions, and allowed the ability to keep the human populations growing. So, both bad things? The massive increase in population is a key driver of the damage we do to the planet. Increased consumption, increased waste."
"Yup, and i'm all for a pandemic that actually wipes out most of the population. I'm not in great health, i'd probably be culled myself, but that's fine. Death would inconvenience people (funeral costs, dealing with wrapping up open accounts, and for whatever reason the grief my parents would probably have that they shouldn't), so that combined with my cowardice is the reason i'm still alive. Doesn't change the fact that this world could run just fine with 1/10th the current population. Automation has improved enough that far fewer people can produce far more product than in the past (like number of workers needed per acre of farmland is going down, while yield is going up). It might slow innovation, or it could speed it up (at least innovation towards necessities, not entertainment)"
Notice how you're alive commenting this that's a bad thing because humans are bad
10:40 what song is this
Ode to Joy
"Any scientist who enthusiastically works on perfecting mass murder, despite doing good things and maybe even harboring good intentions, is ultimately evil."
Well put !!
So by extention he is responsible for climate change.
That's usually how most illnesses work.
That was one hell of an intro
"The use of mustard gas in World War I was one of the most significant events in history.  Prior to that point, the widespread public view of science was a belief that it could do no wrong, and would lead humanity into a bright and prosperous future free of disease and worry.  But when people saw what mustard gas did, they realized it could be used just as effectively for evil.  That shattered the whole public perception of not just science, but anyone using reason or science in life.  It lit the fuse of anti-intellectualism.  And the rest of the entire 20th century could basically be read as continued misuses and abuses of science and reason to wreak untold suffering and pile bodies higher than any natural tragedy.  And with each one, more and more of the public, at least in the US, came to embrace anti-intellectualism implicitly.  Now, it's the air we breathe and so omnipresent that no one even notices it.  It's not a discussion.  Intellectuals are dangerous, callous, arrogant, uncaring, disconnected, socially inept individuals who will destroy many with their hubris.  It should surprise no one that there is such a large cadre of people who would prefer to tear down the whole infrastructure of civilization and return to living in the mud, killing each other over whose god is stronger."
FRITZ???
"The thing about artificial fertilizers is that they are destroying the soil across the globe and are speeding us towards climate catastrophe, Haber's Nitrogen Fertilizer isn't just a good thing"
"As always, incredible work!"
its crazy how many things exist just waiting for someome to discover it
is human nature to create and destroy including themselves. Science not the one to blame.
By saving billions he also like killed billions by helping us to FAR exceed carrying capacity on our planet.
"Okay this comment will get buried but did anyone listen to the radiolab episode (called ""the bad show"") that told Haber's story? The music is the same when they're discussing the fertiliser issue and they get to the part where Haber figures it out (ode to joy by Beethoven). Just thought that was interesting, the radiolab presenters were quite chilled by the Zyklon B story even though Haber was literally dead when it happened, any pesticide/poison could've been used by the Nazis. But great episode!

Also, Haber would've been a hero to the west if he was American - like others have mentoned it depends what side you're on"

"Every idea / tool has the capability of beneficial use.  How and who it benefits, whether that benefit harms another, and whether that is moral is difficult to measure in the moment and even more difficult to legislate.  For example, in Salem at one time, burning women at the stake was considered a moral imperative.  What we judge to be moral now may equally be seen as immoral in the future.  Maybe the tolerance we treasure today will be seen as immoral.  Maybe feeding the homeless will be seen as immoral.  Consider the recent Supreme Court reversal.  Who was right, when, and how will history judge us?  If this teaches us anything, it is that believing hard and fast is prone to error at best.  We need to remain open to new contexts and new interpretations or our hubris will damn us.  We need accountability, and we need forgiveness, because the most dangerous people are those who feel beyond forgiveness."

Nitrogen fertilizer is only part of why 8 billion can survive on earth. The other part is Norman Borlaug more or less inventing the genetic engineering of plants
"The idea that, ""if HE hadn't done it someone one else, some other scientist would have since, after all, many other scientists were working on the same issues"" is patently absurd. It does not in any way absolve the person who DID do it. His development of nitrogen creation processes was wonderful for the world. His use of that process to also create weapons in support of Germany's war machine was the exact opposite. He should be praised for the good he did, and vilified for the bad he did."
"Someone responded to my comment with a comment of their own, and then apparently deleted it, perhaps having second thoughts about their response. What they said was . . .

""I'm just wondering whether you think the same about the American scientists inventing the atomic bomb. They even used the same argument as Haber: kill thousands to end the war and save millions.""

And I'm thinking that there's a significant difference. Germany was the aggressor in their wars, starting wars against other countries, attempting to take over those other countries through incredibly violent means, killing millions of people simply because of their race. The development and their use of every single one of their weapons, including the mustard gas developed by Friz Haber, were utterly, horribly immoral. The United States, on the other hand, was attacked by Japan and was defending itself against that attacker. Every country has the right to defend itself against military attack. No country has a right to be the initial attacker."
"The reason that extracting gold from seawater failed was that its presence were several order of magnitude less than described. It is a problem of economics, not chemestry."

"This reminded me the true story written by Malcom Gladwell - The bomber mafia. They also wanted to end the war quicker by using bombs of all kinds, including nukes. They killed hundreds of thousands people in Japan alone. What's interesting is that they thank them after the war because Japan wasn't going to surrender otherwise."

Christians loved the idea as science provided the creation of the universe in a moment by God.  But as the priest Lemaitre pointed out, God and the Bible got creation for the days, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 wrong.  As a result, Christians stopped saying Lemaitre's Big Bang provided their was God."

"This is quite the interesting story, and I can truly sympathise with one of your final points where you say that invention and creation like this can inevitably be a double edged sword.
Another example is the drug spice -- a synthetic canabanoid invented by John W. Huffman  in 1995 when he was working as a professor at Clemson University in South Carolina, he learned that there were canabanoid receptors triggered by THC in the body that had an involvement in pain, sleep, and appetite. Because of this he thought he could try and find something that could also trigger this, but wouldn't be an illegal substance (as the common substance that could achieve this, cannabis, was illegal at the time) both for use and for research purposes and he thought it would be a fantastic puzzle to solve.
So because of this, he and his team developed over 300 compounds and in 1995 published their findings and their formulas online. He never tested the compounds on humans, never tested their toxicity, and never planned on them being used for anything other than hoping they could be developed as a treatment for HIV, AIDS, and even Multiple Sclerosis, but unfortunately these published compounds were twisted and found their ways in to the hands of those that would use them to create synthetic, incredibly addictive drugs that would end up ravaging the world, and our local communities.

Sometimes people think the work they're doing will end up helping humanity, but no matter their original intentions, there will always be people out there who will try to find a way to corrupt it and turn it in to a way to make money, or a way to hurt other people."

And you earn an subscriber by your story telling and good editing that served very well to the story.
Haber was a pragmatist to the extreme neither good or evil just did what he believed would benefit the people most when he converted to the war effort I do truly believe he thought he could save people by killing the enemy armies more effectively to win the war faster to reduce the civilian cost yet he failed to see the flaw in the war in the first place.

"I think the lesson from Habers life is that the choices we make define who we are just as much as what we discover. Someone else would have removed nitrogen from the air but Haber did, and someone else would have made chemical weapons of war, but Haber did. And both of those things define who he was."

What a coincidence this sounds similar to the movie Inferno which means hell in Italian. Inferno staring Tom Hanks first celebrity to get corona and it came out on Bill Gates birthday Oct 28th. It's about a virus that threatens humanity. It's all centered around this idea that in the next 100 years we'll be so overpopulated that humanity will start dying off anyways because there won't be enough resources or food to feed 12 billion people.
"This video is going to be controversial because I think the evidence suggest the absolute opposite.  Let me explain, firstly yields have actually started to go down slowly over time, intensive farming requires more and more inputs, eventually at the current state yields are now lower than organic farming.  Healthy top soil with a full ecosystem creates massive amount of nitrogen per hectare.  The further challenge here is that the majority of food comes from intensive big ag.  This is false, refer to Drawdown, this book is effectively a Meta analysis of the data, pointing out several key points, one being that chemical fertilisers atomise into the atmosphere creating the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.  In this video, wrapped into this false narrative is the idea that it’s difficult to feed the human population.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Over 60 billion land animals raised for food use nearly half of all available agricultural land for just 18% of Calories on the plate or less.  This land is used to grow feed and to pasture these animals.  There are only 8 billion humans so do the math.  All those 60 billion plus animals defecate and urinate constantly creating HUGE amounts of nitrates now killing rivers and creating ocean dead zones across the world.  Climate breakdown is an existential threat, and as the book Regenesis points out if we transisitioned off fossil fuels entirely just the greenhouse gases from our food system alone will blow our carbon budget 2 to 3 times over by 2100,:making Fritz Harbor responsible for the end of humanity.  Oh this fires me up so much, there’s a ridiculous amount of evidence to counter the central claims of this video!"
Makes you wonder if the Amish are/were onto something with their rejection of technology after a certain date.

What an excellent video
God bless my bro in zcience mr.Haber ! He was one of my POIs in chemistry and actually we did the guano technique in our yards back when i was in my elementry school ! We kept chicken in our yard and fed them with their food and they would eradicate all sorts of greenary on the garden over the span of a couple of years and after that we dismiss them and bury their feces under the soil and then plant turnips and potatos that are particularly nitrogen consumptive intheir hot spots . Yeah !
He could have mentioned that we have a shortage of nitrogen fertilizer at the moment even if it a artificial one but I could tell from how he is sitting in front of the camera he knows it

Only veritasium can talk about the value of bird poo and the man who invented chlorine gas and somehow connect the two together.
On my opinion it was okay to convert fertilizer industry into gun powder industry but developing chlorine gas and other chemical weapons was a bit over the line.

The double standard is hypocritical
Radio labs version of this story was better.
"Amazing video! Thanks Derek.
It's important to reflect about the way the knowledge is used, in order to improve our lives instead of extinguish them."
"I think that it is wrong to judge Haber for trying to win the war for his country. He was just the smartest of them all and achieved what other scientist and other countries had been trying to accomplish. Does anyone really believe that had someone else, e.g., the UK or France, developed chlorine gas they wouldn't have used it? Of course they would. No side had any regard for human life and the only limitation was technological. 
Germany in WWI were not bad guys, as they were in WWII. They were simply one of the sides in a war in which everybody was right and wrong, depending on the perspective.
The US developed the atomic bomb that killed tens of thousands of civillians, and while I think that the usage of the bomb was immoral, as it is immoral to use chemical weapons, I do not see the same backlash agains the US for that as I see against Germany in WWI for being the first ones (not the only ones, since the rest of the countries caugh up quickly and started to use it themselves) to use chlorine gas."

"It easy to hate him and a no brainer that he was a villain.  He fell so far from grace.  I can't believe he went from solving world hunger, to enabling horrible people to brutally and horrifically gas people to death.  His poor wife she helped him in the lab no doubt, and had to have felt guilt."

"Excellent video, Derek - it covers the whole Haber story very well. Your last point on the Haber process is a good one too. As I have taught my Chemistry students, Haber is a good case of what can happen when a chemist works without ethics. Scientists need to work ethically - just because you CAN doesn’t mean you SHOULD."
Nothing Nothing as horrible as what anthony fauci has done to humanity. God save us all.
I think this apologetic of a criminal war. He did feed millions but he himself not others engineered and supervised his invention to cause damage. Ethics and morals are not algebraic. The good things he did do not cancel out the atrocious damage he inflicted.
"names label people for a lifetime, no matter of their duties or failures."
The answer to the real question at the end is why we need religion. You don't have to prove that God exists to recognize that humanity needs God in order to survive.
Please do more videos in this form! I absolutely loved this mini documentary!
Wow. What a story. What happened to his son?
"Impressive! This is definitely one of the best videos ever made on youtube. Congrats. 

I just have a thought. Perhaps this is not about a scientist who invents an evil thing, but more about society welcoming this evil invention. One of the reasons why Haberman or Germans could use nitrogen in such a horrible way is the collective madness of 1st WW. To do such things one must be delusional in a certain sense. And one man is not enough for this, somebody must approve and grant this project, somebody assist, somebody must authorize the use, public and journalists must support repetitive using. It must be collective madness. But as you said, for example, Einstein stayed out of the war. Maybe it is somehow a personal appeal for all of us, not just for scientists.

One way how to prevent such horrors possibly could be to build a society in which such stupid things would be unthinkable basically for anybody. But I am very skeptical about that. Here is why: Cause, when I see Lenon with his slogan 'War is over if you want it', it is like saying 'wake up, people - look what you're doing'. Maybe we really are a little bit delusional, when we are willing to accept the idea of war. 

I really think about this nowadays. I have a Ukrainian wife, but we do not live in Ukraine. However, my over 80 yrs old parents-in-law happened to be in Russian-occupied territory. As frontline moves, we recently had to figure out how to get them to safety. So, right now they are traveling about 1000 km to Kyiv in their 40 yrs old Lada car with help of their young neighbor who decided to join the Ukraine army. Just imagine these weird three in that Lada on their road trip out - how crazy a world must be!

So, thanks once again. As I said, you did a great job. Really impressive."

dont forget about the billions of people who are still starving lol
"This comment is not any kind of moral judgement of Haber one way or another, but I find it very objectionable that in the video you characterise him as a ""patriot"" in opposition to Einstein. The only principled patriotic stance towards an imperialist war from which only the country's ruling elite stands to gain is to firmly oppose it."

"In the end, he was but a man. Guided by a compass that lead him ever forward in what he believed to be the pursuit of what is right by him and those around him."
"Nitrogen doping for mistreated soil is a hack. We know that now. Haber didn't realize that industrial/chemical farming would be unsustainable, but he should have understood it. Same problem with Norman Borlaug given a Nobel prize for developing high yield wheat that required irrigation and fertilizer to thrive. Both should be remembered as incomplete thinkers, with limited vision about the implications of their inventions.

The world is worse off for having discovered the Haber-Bosch process because it's only helped us to believe we can sustain ourselves with the land we farm through chemical inputs. It expanded to include insecticides, herbacides, and fungicides, thus poisoning all the life away from the farm soil and upsetting the soil food web that would actually reprocess nitrogen from plants back into the soil. 

We now know that sustainable farming must be done with polyculture, crop rotation, returning fodder to the soil (through composting or simply chop and drop) and without poisoning the soil. Green manure is sustainable and will allow us to avoid emissions intensive chemical inputs which are petroleum based (Kochs sold fertilizer not gasoline). Nature always knew how to return nitrogen to the soil. We just farmed like idiots."

Your logic is not just flawed, it's misleading and horrendous!"
Shout out to my man Bosch.
A population growth of this scale was not a good thing. It would have been better if Haber didn't make his discoveries so there would be no overpopulation of the planet and no efficient gas chambers in WWII.
"Seems to me that at the very least, history and his legacy proved his idea that coming up with a way to kill many people faster would end the war was, at best, rather naive of him"

@Gingnose Not really. Most wars are unjustified
"@ashvio Fighting for your country is ""usually bad"" is a overstatement I guess"
Very nice history addition

'the scientist who killed millions and saved billions.' me:logic has failed
"Haber didn't save billions of people. He saved a lot, okay, but the counting only reaches bilions if you count those people who have been allowed to be born as a consequence. But making someone exist is not the same as saving them from stop existing."
"Science is neutral, it's a tool.  In the hands of a surgeon a razor sharp blade can and is used everyday around the world to save and improve thousands of lives.  However thousands if not millions of people throughout history have been killed intentionally with that same sharpened blade technology that has existed as one of our earliest tools.  

In my opinion the ultimate manifestation of this is Nuclear power and Nuclear weapons.  Same basic science but one form can kill everyone on earth in a timetable measured in minutes. The other is literally the safest form of electricity per kilowatt in existence and has containable waste and is carbon neutral."
The benefit of mankind itself is also something very subjective. Just like Haber thought he could save lives by ending the war through mass extermination.

"“How do we keep from destroying ourselves in the process [of increasing knowledge]?”
The best way to go about this is that each person does their best to do what is right all the time.  A single person is not a community or a nation, but a nation and the world is made up of single persons. The fact that we are able to look back and point to individuals of great influence proves that individuals can have incredible influence and not just random movements of nations as a whole.  Each person has a responsibility to use their life and circumstances to do right, no matter which direction the wind blows in their sails."
"@betaich There actually is a way to answer this that makes sense. That's what Buddhism is all about: what does it mean to live a good and moral life? Buddhism starts from first principles, things that are universal to all humans, and then builds up what it means to be a good person and live a moral life from that alone.

His discoveries merely became tools to be used on a universal level, whether good or bad. But... He did actively contribute to the German war effort and innovating chemical weapons, so not much excuse for that."
You should do one on Norman Borlaug. He's another person who's credited with saving billions of lives.
My finger got cut open
"What about Norman Borlaug. His work on wheat is what feeds the world today, he definitely saved billions in India and many other countries."
"This goes on to show that Humans can be good and evil at the same time.
None of us are White or Black.
We all have different shades of grey.
Humans are complex.
The irony in this story is that Haber, a Jewish was a devoted nationalist, and his invention led to the death of millions of Jews.
If there is a God, he/she has a Dark sense of humor for sure.

Also I dont believe for a second that Haber was evil. As they say, ""one man's revolution is another man's terrorism"".
In this case, he loved his country, and used his intellect to defend the nation.
Also, 
I believe his wife helped him in his scientific endeavours and might have felt guilty by the consequence of it. Thats probably why she committed suicide.
Or better, maybe she was the real scientist behind the inventions and Harber was just the face because it was difficult for women to pursue studies back then, let alone do experiments, maybe thats why Haber took the credit.
Or maybe both of them had an equal contribution in the inventions."
"His theory wasn't responsible, another German found out about the neutron of which you can verify Einstein didn't know it's existence of. Einstein did write a letter that it's either USA or the Nazi germans getting first doing this bad technology of destruction. Europa Nazi germans capitulation was only very shortly away from having Europe undergoing the fate of Nagasaki and Hiroshima."
Sorry this was in reply. Posted in wrong section 😐
It's quite ironic that he helped solve mass food production and fed millions of people but he also made biological weapons that killed thousands.
So a Jew killed Jews in the WW is what you're saying?
Why do people pronounce Chile like chili
"Syria's President Baschar al-Assad used a Chlorine bomb on his own people 6 years ago. Many children died a horrible death, you can see the bodies on youtube to understand how the effect on the mouth eyes body in general was"
I hope to one day have a eco company that is actually trustworthy.  Maybe its Wren.  Many are scamming people and just stealing from the latest trend.  Most often in getting people to pay for to protect already protected land or paying for trees that were already set to be planted and funded to do so.
"The first man Adam shaped the world for all humans, including himself. Later, Noah did a lot of good, and helped to offset the harm Adam caused. And not to be outdone is Noah's (many, many times) great-grandson, Jesus.

But you're talking about fairly contemporary people, not historic individuals."
"Very good story! I agree we should take knowledge, products etc as pure, independent of the inventor or creator. That way we can use it for good. Credit is fine, but no single person should be idealized as a hero. Fritz was a good example of someone who did something great but definitely was no hero."
"more eco silliness thinking buying carbon offsets saves us from ""global warming"" planet Earth is not delicate it kicks our ass every day snd it's sheer arrogance by the so-called intelligent enlightened political groups that we can somehow reverse any ""global warming: by our actions. you spout temperature rises in the last 50 years compared to the previous centuries ...when you don't take into account the small sample of global temperatures and their inaccuracies from devices of measurements in those eras and the hand transcription that undoubtedly brought in errors in reporting of temperature not aside the fact of the much smaller  sample of temperature and scarcity of accurate measuring devices 100 years ago the truth is the earth goes through cycles constantly and if we added to it then it will deal with it but thinking we puny humans can reverse the process is just wishful childlike thinking"
"Great. ""This sadistic villain is just a scientist."" No. He's a sadistic villain. Period. He actively and knowingly developed a tortuous way to kill people. It was tested before it went to the field. HE KNEW WHAT IT WOULD DO AND MADE IT WORSE. How tf can you try to paint him as an innocent victim of scientific progress? WTF????? Downvote, do not recommend channel

WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU????"

"""During peace time a scientist belongs to the World, but during war time he belongs to his country.” - FRITZ HABER
"" Nationalism is an infantile disease "" - ALBERT EINSTEIN"
"More than his usual great video, both science and a story.  An awesome,  staggering, very human, story.   Seems to me that it misses the point when you say it would have happened anyway.   Had that little coincidence in finding the catalyst not happened for a couple of decades many people would have died of starvation and it would have been too late to play a part in the WWI.   Developments would also have been delayed perhaps with profound effects also."
its about politics..that is were the decisions are made..morally right or wrong
"As Richard Feynman said, “To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.”"
"I like the moral of this story: he was over-patriotic and very soon his country became hostile to him and used his inventions against his community. It makes you think that maybe you should try to be good to people around you instead of trying to be patriotic.

I'm not saying the two are incompatibles, it's more a matter of pursuing the right goal in your life."
"I dont think it was his 'patriotic'' ideals that drove him into developing a chemical weapon.

According to the video, the man WAS a egoistical fella. 
He was not impressed by the work of the scientists before him, so he wanted to prove everybody else that HE could do better.

And he was right, he did better. But at what cost?"
"""The Scientist Who Killed Millions and Saved Billions"" ... it proves how relative human life is and that ultimately we would be one thing among many other things.
other living species do not have this kind of problem."
These biographies videos are awesome!
Am I the only one who noticed the irony of Einstein shunning Haber for using his scientific creations for war... and then going off to help develop the first nuke a few decades later.
"What a bar-stard, actively created and used mustard gas ? chemical weapons , yes others studied it..but WW1 Allies did nt dare to use it. He enchanced it! Cabron"
"The Allies absolutely did use chemical weapons during WW1. We used many different types, notably phosgene which is attributed with 85% of chemical weapons fatalities in WW1"
"He was not a hero nor was he a villain.

He was a human."
"Okay, men try making this for a hundred tears, but it happens to be invented by a man who just happens to be married to the first woman with a PHD in Chemistry. Who kills herself when her husband uses it to kill thousands of soldiers- boys like her own son.

Me thinks Clara was the real person to deserve the Nobel Prize."
"I really love your videos. I love that you make me think about things differently and that you’re so open to being corrected where there are errors or other ways to think about the problems.

You addressed this subject well, it’s always interesting to consider both the benefits and the harms of what we do and whether that changes the worth of the information which comes as a result. 
Some research seems tainted by the intent of the researcher, but if that research can be used for good years later then why shouldn’t we. In a way we owe it to those who have been negatively affected by a piece of research done with bad intent, to make something good of it. As long as we never use that as justification to embark on a set of research which is ethically dubious."
Zero Time Dilemma be like:
I think this illustrates that Nation concept is a great tool and horrible master. His efforts lead to horrible results for a notion that nations cannot exists without borders. It took decades after his death for federations and trading agreements to form that would eradicate this notion. When the Berlin wall fell we finally showed the world that no force is strong enough to enforce artificial borders.
Social Media is probably going to be the greatest double-edged sword humanity has ever faced.
"I think it's naive to think ""someone else would have invented the haber process"". You could say the same thing about any of the great advances of the last 500 years, but it took thousands of years to get to that point. If it wasn't for Haber, it could have been hundreds of years to develope this technology after his peers gave up on the idea. In the grand scheme science has only recently became fast paced"
killing millions to save billions... where did i heard that before... aaaah Watchmen :D
Rapture is the only Answer.
"You forgot to mention perhaps the most important consequence of Haber's innovations; which, I think, deserves a mention as per relevance: the fact that he had also directly caused the climate crisis. 

The rise of stock farming had been accelerated as a result of the skyrocketing amount of new, decent fertilizer. This means that there were now far more cows today than it would otherwise be possible. As you already know, cows emit way more CO2 than most other stock animals. Here is how you get the recipe for the global warming and thus, the climate crisis.

The same would be argued for other species as well, since Haber's innovations in agriculture benefited every living being in one way or another.

While we could put the blame on the people themselves and not the tools or their innovators, Haber's positively perceived innovations might be on their way to kill more people than they might have saved. Perhaps, one could argue that even more people were killed by these posivitely perceived innovations than his innovations with the aim of killing people (the chemical weapons). 

At any rate, I would argue that Haber's reputation will just decline as the climate crisis proceeds. I wonder your opinion, though."
damn I thought we had our nitrogen through nitrogen fixation
Grüße aus Karlsruhe. The building where he worked at the University of Karlsruhe still stands. Its 30.91 if you check the map of the Campus.
Sadly it's not his fault. If Huber could go back in time I'm sureeeeee he would feel immense guilt to what his invention did to his own people and potentially family
Science is a tool. It can be used for great good or great evil
"The moral question of scientific progress is a hard one, especially in combination with political (or almost any actually) ideology.
The Germans in in both world wars carrying out those horrible crimes against mankind were indoctrinated and thought, they'd actually do good. This does of cause not take the guilt off of them but I think it stands as a reminder, to always ask yourself, where your own opinions come from and what coud be the worst outcome of those convictions.
Every Ideology putting certain humans before others as more ""valuable"" is bound to bring horrors if adopted into political systems.
We should all be aware of that."

"If I wanted to offset my carbon emissions, I'd go out and campaign for people to stop buying electric vehicles.  They are bad for the environment.
(net carbon emissions for a 300 mile range EV over 180,000 miles is much higher than that for an equivalent ICE vehicle)

Note: some hybrids DO have a net benefit, so get one of those!"
Saw the thumbnail and knew it was going to be a banger. Love the animations as well.
"Science is blind to morality. You can paint him as a good or a bad person but at the end of the day the utilization of knowledge comes down to the person using it. Trying to limit knowledge only leads to the potential of abuse. The best approach in my opinion is just to proceed with the scientific method, If something is used for nefarious purposes perhaps the pursuit of preventing it will lead to further progress."
Man it really is hard when the literal same thing can be used to help or to harm.
"Even if he made my life a possibility, I cannot help but to find myself repulsed by his actions. I can understand why his wife committed suicide"

One more excellent video! Thank you

"The epilogue is a bit disingenuous: ""You don't know the outcome of your research or how it might later be used"". Scientists who work on weapons e.g. the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb, e.g. Fritz Haber working on chemical weapons, make a utilitarian decision that the greater good outweighs the evil that they will cause. Which is a bit like playing God ""I am become Death, destroyer of worlds"" Robert Oppenheimer."
"Pshh... people trying to mooch viewers from this comment section.

"Perhaps he thought the weight of the water would make pressure on the glass bottle?😂 I mean think about it, this was loooong ago so their knowledge would've been lesser than today's"
"Amazing video! Just a small correction: the pesticide developed by Haber was known as Zyklon A, Zyklon B being the version without the odor element."
"Ever hear the joke about gaslighting?
No? Yes you have. I posted it on this sub almost a week ago and you liked it. I know you did, I saw you do it. I had the notification and everything. In fact, your friend told me and you the joke the day before I posted it here. He may not remember, but I do, and you were there, you heard it, because you laughed."
"Science, technology, and scientific knowledge are tools just like any other.  These can be used for good or for ill.  The difference is the intent, will, and wisdom of the human heart."

Carbon of-setting like wren is usually a scam... They will simply put the money into forests that already exist and call it carbon of-setting. Has happened with other companies before and will happen again
Haber increased the population of the earth by 4 billions so that all of them could experience the horrors of holocaust and death.
"Theres a claim that it was Haber's  Wife who solved the problem but the scientist took credit for it.
I dont know about the legitimacy of the claim.
But it could be true since women back then didnt have the freedom or you could say that people might not have believed that a Women was capable of such an invention."
Consent factory go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
"20:46 - banning religion… all religion would be a huge step towards ending wars. Look back in time or even at the present day and see how much death is caused by fighting over which version of god is real. These are tribal actions, left over from a time where we understood little of the world - and persisted because we are afraid to be alone - afraid that there is nothing after we die and there is no grand purpose. If we want to succeed in using science to improve lives and avoid killings ourselves en-route, we need to let go of our fear and accept that we just are."
"Very true , same thinking as me , ... But religion is not the only one , over-patriotism( or imperialism) for his/her nation is also a factor of violence
However I believe that ,we humans will continue to find another reasons to fight each other , its just the way we are , maybe its all a self destruct mechanism planted in us"
Without religion the world would be a much worse place
@akshay raj that's so true
"Banning religion is the same as imposing atheism. This isn't about passing laws regarding religion, but we humans should respect each other. Sure, opinions might differ, but no one has the right to harm anyone. Scientist Abdul Kalam said this "" For great men, religion is a way of making friends. Small people use it as a fighting tool."""
You didn’t mention that the chlorine gas shifted with the wind and killed German troops too.
His justification for the development of chlorine gas is the same as the American justification for the nuclear bomb.

"Imagine being her and your friend dies in your husband's lab, your husband becomes responsible for the gruesome painful death of millions, and your social circle begins to shun you and your husband. Also your passion in life becomes impossible to pursue anymore because you have to look after your child. It is sad she killed herself with a son, but her husband failed their son as well. His wife commits suicide, his son witnesses her death, and he leaves to go to work? I don't know if I could stomach being married to a man responsible for the death of millions either. 

He seems to have quickly moved on from his wife anyway. He married 2 years after her death. He might have been a scientist but he was no family man."
"@Honourable Doctor Edwin Moriarty Ohhh, so that means Haber loved his wife, but his wife wasn't loyal. 

I mean why did she marry him, if she already knew what was gonna happen. Seems like she expected to get fame out of him. But he was too busy with his job to care."
"​@Maria Manson Because that was what was expected at the time. Haber was a socialite. In the social circles he traveled in, a successful man's wife did not work outside the house. She took care of the kids and assisted her husband with his job. Haber might have loved his wife, but he kept to the social norms and expected she would as well."
"@Honourable Doctor Edwin MoriartyI don't believe that's true. Why would he do that? 

Haber loved his wife"

"I argue that he didn't save any lives and only doomed/ killed. To save lives is to prevent people from being killed or dying. He simply enabled the population to increase by way of increased food production. That is not saving lives, it is enabling lives to be lived. I regard him as only a killer. Pesticides, chemical weapons, and more gunpowder for guns only bring about death. The true way to harness the energy of nitrogen is through enabling bacteria that live in soil, not circumventing the bacteria and doing it ourselves. Pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc. are all killer compounds which shut down bacteria and other soil life(like worms) from being able to do their job. He helped produce food in a way that only further degraded the land being used to grow it, even more so than the practices being used before him. His impact was equal or comparable to Thomas Midgley, but far more deadly."

"4 billion people who could easily not exist, the smartest, most apt, will always find a way to perpetuate themselves, but the welfare state and ""nice"" scientists end up helping to proliferate the weakest, causing more problems, sabotaging natural selection, Today there are billions more people than there are, who see no meaning in life, are mediocre, dumb, lazy, easily discarded, full of psychological problems, mental illness, who serve as cattle for politicians and to be exploited by the sharks of the industry."

My highschool chem teacher made us have a discussion about Haber when learning about the Haber process. It was really eye opening abouy the importance of science and how it can be misused.
"Every action creates a reaction, this is all part of life."
"Patriot Haber: Invents cheap process for production of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and pesticides
Pacifist Einstein: invents nuclear bomb

Science is neutral, humans are not...and once the genie is out of the bottle...like a freight train, science is accelerating forward, faster and faster...but only history can tell us what it's effects on mankind were..."
Keep telling yourself space is a vacuum and the earth is just dirt…..
"Hard work, physical and mental.

"You asked how do you stop the science from being used incorrectly and how to use it for understanding and progression 20:30 ? I believe that lays inside us after we discover the real meaning of Consciousness. Whether its the Penrose, orch or theory or something new. Mixed with things like philosophy from ido portal, saying life is about play. Or from the DMT research at Harvard. If we accept we need some random to experience play and love, we can accept that in life its about being a combined effort to contribute to the greater good. If we were born from an eternal life it would explain all religions, no sloth, no covet, treat others the same. Those are just ways to convey what the message is. Maybe if people realized this was true and our memories are erased on purpose so we can experience this life and this random to take back with us in the eternal life or even within the 4th physical dimension if you want to go into that realm of math.

"now i did a projekt on ww1 in the gymnasium i was attending, the projekt primarily focused on why and how ww1 turned in to ""the chemist war"" and apparently it was the French that first used chemical weapons during ww1 agianst Germany which understandably pissed them off for good reasons but... now the chemical weapons the French used were non-lethal but it should not had been allowed by anymeans as in the hague convention it also stated that weapons that caused unnecessary harm was banned.

Super interesting figure and topic to cover. Great job
"Whether someone else would've done this or not, Haber did it. He appears to have deliberately chosen to use his creations to hurt others. He didn't have to do that. That decision significantly outweighs the good that he did IMO"

"I'd recommend doing a video on Norman Borlaug, the father of the Green Revolution.  I'd argue he's as responsible as as Fritz Haber for billions living since it was his agriculture discoveries that combined with the fertilizer that allowed the world's population to skyrocket, but it's came at the cost of everything used to produce said agriculture, such as so much water being used for food which causes droughts and the widespread use of inorganic fertilizer with its own issues."

"I will ask this one question.

How would the threes live if we were to get to zero carbon?

In my biology class I was taught that plants needed carbon dioxide to make oxygen in their process of living.
So, is this an effort to suffocate the earth or to suffocate humankind?

There will always be a need for carbon dioxide for the survival of plants and humans alike. 
The question is. 
Will you continue to buy the lie of global warming when God the creator has already flood the earth once. It cannot possibly flood again. He shows us this in every rainbow that is put in the sky.

"I was not expecting this video to make me somewhat emotional, but it did. This piece was well done. Not only is his life story tragic, but it highlights the duality of a genius mind. Solving hunger, making chemical weapons, eventually it led to a destruction of his personal life. Ignorance is truly bliss. The more you know, the more you ask, the more you spend time searching for answers that might never be found. The more you are able to provide, the more important you become to those around you, soon after which you feel haunted by the amount of responsibility. I respect him and his accomplishments. Even the stuff that led to the harm of many, it's hard to judge him for it when he felt he was doing it for his country. The human mind can't be painted black or white, good or evil... It's amazing how complex we are, and what we are capable of is terrifying."
He did it for he's country and Karma came back to haunt him when he was Jewish and the Nazis got him.
Is there any accounts of her suicide? Seems odd to me.
just because someone else does similar research does not mean they will find a solution. Humanity researches nuclear fusion tech for years and we need it asap yet no one found a solution. Also Hero or villain depends on once perception. he was simply a human with ambition.
I can tell your ads are becoming WAY more interesting!! But in general this whole video was a masterpiece.
"This was great, you could do so many more like this.  Galois for example had a fascinating life story, and was massively impactful in mathematics."
He was indeed awesome
You could argue that making it possible to be more humans is he's biggest crime.
I half way through the Alchemy of Air. incredible piece of history
Just as a sidenote the Ammonium nitrate that exploded in Beirut was of a higher concentration. It was never meant to be used as a fertilizer and most likely was being smuggled out by militias to manufacture bombs.
But does he Hab any Fritz or no?
"5:12 - people all over the world ARE dying of starvation while 40% of Americans are obese and complain if the exact thing they want is not available instantly.
Typically, this video speaks as if everyone has food security and the addition of 4 billion people is sustainable - perhaps without the breakthrough, more might be starving… but please don’t speak as if the problem has been solved"
Was it guano or saltpetre the war was about?

"And now the Dutch government is going after farmers out of concern for nitrogen levels in the atmosphere, best of luck to those that end up on the wrong side of the 50%."
We don’t view the people who worked on the atomic bomb the same way we do Haber. But the only difference was that they were right about the fact that their violence would be intense enough to end war.

Anyway, you can be part of the solution by simply not killing the clovers growing in your lawn. Clovers capture nitrogen and improve the soil, helping to replace the nitrogen you carelessly throw away when you mow your lawn and throw away the clippings."

"The ""saved billions"" is a complete logical fallacy.  If he did not invent the process some one else would have soon after.  If Einstein never existed someone else would have discovered the same theories in time.  If Hitler was killed in WW1 then Germany would probably have still started another war that would have gone slightly differently.
Edit. I'm glad Derek mentioned this at the end.  Shouldn't have commented before watching the whole thing."
Really? MY carbon imprint???

"Well... his invention and other inventions before and after him led to the still growing overpopulation like it is today. Today most ecosystems are already devastated and hundreds of thousand of species are going extinct due to the impacts of so many humans living at the same time. Thats the really sad part for me, the earth is constantly loosing and has already lost many of its treasures. Many years ago humans hunted many big species to extinction and weakened the ecosystems that were now deprived of the keystone species. Nowadays even the basis of the ecosystems, the rich life of arthropods, plants or fungi is dying out faster and faster. This process is speeding up rapidly, and future populations will not even know or care about what once existed..."
"He created something with the power of creation, but also with power of destruction."
"I miss in the story a mentioning of the problems fertilizers cause, more then a last sentence at the end of changing the atmospgere and causing global warming. In the Netherland, which is a delta region and a very intensive  agricultured area, we have big problems with too much nitrate and ammonium for our nature and our waters. We should keep the nutrientcycle more closed and not add extra nutrients (It also doesn't work if we keeping shipping cattlefeed from South America to the Netherlands and use the manure in the Netherlands). Also the ratio from nitrate and phosphate is a problem. For good growth you need both in a specific ratio. And phosphorus is still mostly won by mining and is a limited resource and we are nearly at the point of running out. Phospate is also causing big environmentall problems with algue bloom and dying of fish, waterplants and macrofauna. So fertilizer is absolutly not only a good thing."
I don't think he cared about the impact he would have. He just cared about the science. He just wanted to succeed as a chemist
"Politicians in the Netherlands, who are banning certain use of fertilizers need to see this"

"This aged well...  Here in the Netherlands they now want to ban farmers and any other NH3 producers, no matter the cost in the future, because who needs farmers anyway when you can just buy your food in the store, right? 17000 farms are now under threat of being run out of business by insane plans by politicians."
"The way people were talking about ammonia and the decades of effort that went into it reminds me a bit of fusion power. Hopefully one day we will crack fusion power too, and hopefully it won't be used for weapons."
"In The Meaning Of It All, Richard Feynman, asks ""Is science of any value?"" then he answers the question by recalling a man once telling him ""To every man is given a key to heaven. But the same key can open the gates of hell"". I thought it fits the story of Haber very well."

Thank you
"Highly dissapointed in your choosing of your sponsor. I would have thought, you of all people would know 'reducing your carbon footprint' was disinformation."
When you did the video on Midgley Jr. I knew it was only a matter of time before Haber had one too
I've always read that iron is used in the Haber Process. Maybe someone found out it could be used too and iron is more abundant than the first element they used
"I was making a PB&J Nature's Own Sandwich with Onion Slices to kick in the flavor as I was getting so engaged on hearing about Haber's history that I gotten a little hungry and needed something tasty to snack on as I really ENJOYED this documentary 101% Ve! ^.^ 

Not only I was shocked to hear he's the reason why half of us are alive today due to us humans having wheat to grow our food which explains why I have to thank him for me being able to eat PB&J sandwiches but also how he's practically the Deutsch version of Genghis Khan! It totally explains why we're having such a high population growth in human history as we're supposed to reach 8 billion by November this year or somewhere in late fall but how us humans are having longer life-spans as well due to healthier eating habits. 

I immediately started to cry for Haber's wife that commit suicide @ 16:32 as I can't bare to imagine all the guilt & stress she has to go through with his ammonium invention as it seemed that it turned out for the worst for the Nazis to take over East & Central Europe at the time. I can't even bare to feel all the severe trauma Hermann has to feel either as I'm sure it really affected his future to see his mother dying on the ground like that as I really wonder what has happened to him if his father abandoned him to get revenge on the Russians during that following morning. 

Never knew that's how people commit suicide back then as in Japan for example, they commit suicide by stabbing themselves with a samurai sword which I forgotten the term which makes it even more bleak to think of. 

Just by reading Clara's first sentence of her note *What Fritz has won during these 8 years, that and still more, I have lost.,* was really chilling down to my spine as he has became one of the world's most important people to be alive in human history as he gave life to so many of us, and yet, has created a disaster without him knowing it when it comes to these World Wars to occur. 

It goes to show you that there are certainly downsides when it comes to inventions & ideas outside our control as you have Steve Jobs for example, that has invented the iPhone for us humans to stay in touch with one and another in just a tip of a finger to do a phone call across the country. Not only us having smart phones is a downside for mental health & serial killers being born to spread death threats to dozens of people but also how it affects on the younger generation as well. 

Just had to share how I feel as your videos never fail to disappoint me as it's an exercise for my brain to learn so much from them beside Kurzgesgat whom I also enjoy watching as well. ^.^ 

Sorry Ms. Sanders from 11th. Grade in Chemistry Class from 11 years back. I learn so much more from Ve's videos than your sessions when it comes to learning about Nitrogen & Ammonium that you haven't taught us about. xD"

"that study you referenced concerns me, are we not just going to tear these polluters down and wait for sone scientific breakthrough to save us??"
I love this channel so so much
"Haber personifies the ""Dialectic of Enlightenment"", as Horkheimer, Adorno called it. Rationality is blind regarding its aims. Science provides fertiliser and poison, scientists are bright and dim simultaneously. As an emancipated Jew in Germany, Haber was irrationally loyal to his bloody emperor, yet part of a generation of ultra rational scientists in Germany. They came close to winning the war for Germany and were later murdered by those they wanted to assimilate with, even then furnishing the murder weapon."
If he were a practicing jew he might have known about the legend of the golem...

"I think the answer to your final question is that ultimately we have to believe and act as if there is more good in this world than evil. We have to believe that good will prevail and that none or very little of the evil use of the potential knowledge will occur. Believe that the friends, coworkers and family of the potential evildoer will bring the situation to a stop in one way or another before the goal is reached."

This was a very different video than what you normally do. Almost documentary type. I like it

His cause of death is ironic in a way. You could say his heart already failed when he decided to use his ability and knowledge for mass unaliving or maybe when his wife’s heart failed when she unalived herself

"“During peace time a scientist belongs to the World, but during war time he belongs to his country.""- Fritz Haber"
Hmm interesting
"@LC 17 said the guy who promoted research on the atomic bomb. And the justification for the two weapons was the same, to save lives by winning the war more quickly."
@Juan Diaz literally this comment thread 😂
sometimes the hero of the story could also be the deadliest villian! 🥲
"The greater good theory, nice"
A useful takeaway from this video is that it is another example of scientists mistakenly predicting a calamitous decline of civilization because of humanity's mismanagement of resources. This view consistently forgets the ingenuity of people to solve problems and the incentives that markets provide to find creative solutions.
"Honestly to tackle something as globally impactful as climate change we have to have a global response. But we are all divided into various countries, ideologies, religions, histories, people have wronged others and never made any attempt at making amends, thousands and thousands of years of impacted grievances mixed with misinformation and lost information. The problems of the United States or Europe are just mini examples of the overall division between the human population on what we should do, if we should do anything, etc etc. people might just be too stupid."
"So you think Haber's invention of an artificial fertilizer was saving lives of billions? You could be excused for thinking that now that some major exporters of fertilizers are at war and there seems to be a shortage of nitrogen fertilizers. But at the same time Dutch, Belgian, German and Italian farmers are protesting, sometimes to the point of violence, because their governments say they release too much nitrogen into the environment and so are their activities harmful. I have a problem reconciling those facts. And besides, why is a world's population of several billions such a good thing?"
"Just wait until World War 3, when Einstein gets blamed for the deaths of billions due to his discovery that E=mc2."
one of the few times that I actually have some knowledge on the thing he's talking about
"Great story, Derek.  I’d be interested in more like this. ‘The History Guy’ for science."
DOITSU NO KAGAKU WA SEKAI ICHI
I find it a bit hypocritical that Haber is often pointed to as a villain for inventing chlorine gas while we say nothing about all the physicists who worked on the Manhattan project.
"This is a really fascinating video, with a really important message. The key is that morality is irrelevant to science, what matters is how the knowledge discovered through science is used. It can often be used in morally good and morally bad ways, and honestly I'm not sure how we stop those bad ways from occuring. While there is so much good in humanity, unfortunately there is and seemingly always will be a lot of bad too."

"""Fritz Haber was in a superposition of either a hero or a villain."" ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ"
"The story told here is a simplified version of what is told elsewhere, for instance on Wikipedia (at least in the German version). You just left one key character under the table and that character was Carl Bosch. Haber developed a table-top device that should how ammonia synthesis can work in principle. However, that device had to be turned into a gigantic industrial machinery. Among other things, Osmium was not a feasible catalyzer for an industrial-scale process.

The person who created that machinery was Carl Bosch who also received a Nobel prize, in 1931, for his developments. It was Bosch who extended the ammonia process in such a way that nitric acid resulted from it, which was the substance from which Germany produced explosives for their war effort. Haber had nothing to do with this.

The process for synthesizing ammonia is therefore commonly called the Haber-Bosch process, to give du credit to the second contributor.

I would like to add that so far, I had immense trust in information provided on this channel. This video, however, has caused me to have a much more skeptical look at other videos that have been or will be published on this channel."
"@zelthar Yes, I read that too in the book by Thomas Hager. My main point was, and I think I did not bring that across, that it was not Haber who had made sure that Germany could produce explosives but Bosch. He entered into negotiations with the government and offered them to deliver nitric acid. Haber had nothing to do with that. He concentrated on the development of poison gas."
"Yep, Bosch ran 100's of tester units to try and find a better/more common catalyst. I think they ended up on a Iron alloy? Not as good, but far more common and cheaper to scale. Also just the scaling of this was a massive challenge. Especially dealing with hydrogen embrittlement."
WTF..... I own my life to a GERMAN
Ja
"except it wasn't out of Habers control how his research was used. he made the choice to convert his factories, and his choice to develop horrific chemical weapons. he knew and was surrounded by people who disapproved."
i cant be the only one who read it as the scientist who killed minions 💀💀💀
Good video
"History is written by the winners. If the atomic bomb were to have been created in nazi germany, then the scientists that made it would not have been seen as the heroes they are now, but as enemies of humanity, as they would have been responsible for countless deaths. Scientists are people, and some of them will try to help their nation win a war. This means that they will use their intellect to do what war does best, kill people. In the same regard that I admire Oppenheimer for his scientific work on the bomb, I also have to admire Haber for his achievements, or maybe even more so as, during peacetime, his impact was even greater. If people want to blame someone, they should blame the ones who started the war, the ones who profited from the war and most importantly the ones who cause unnecessary suffering for no real cause (see Mengele)."
"@veritasium. Who are you to defy history and the source of which it came, say it is irrelevant and ignore mans true nature of both good and evil. It is a foolish and childish attempt to say someone else would of discovered it eventually, while being so grossly indifferent to the fact you and I would not exist if this were the case. 

Just because someone could or would, doesn't mean they will do. And only when we apply the measure of time can people like you and me be so privilaged to then argue or discuss if it had the most impact."
Fantastic video
He poisoned many billions of humans and not sure how many animals and organism in the ecology of the earth were affected adversely by him... and probably he contributed somehow to human overpopulation precipitating all that is coming from global climatic changes and so forth.

Unbelievable video 👏🏻
"For me to poop on

"That assumption, that someone else would have split  nitrogen, etc, is a false assumption. It's a very real possibility that today, without Haber we still wouldn't have that process. Same assumption could be made of Einstein or Newton, but it just a false assumption and a lame argument to make."
1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry but says 1919 in the picture?
In a very real way most humans are synthetic.
"This is the reason that ethics classes are mandatory in most post secondary science-focused education. Be it Chemistry, Engineering, Biology, or even Software, the power to modify/create/destroy needs to be used responsibly."

"the question is no longer how can we control nature. we're well past the point of overcontrol. we literally cannot reverse our control. the question is whether people even realize what's going on right now. spoiler alert: they don't.

many of the superpowers - especially china - are invading the natural resources of other countries using money and political power and will eventually deplete the most important resources we have left. most notably, the amazon is on a death course. china is paying for that. they're already building dams on the amazon river. who knows what else they can do at will. the countries responsible for their share of the amazon forest have sold it. they don't have enough money to stay afloat, much less drain their economy by rejecting all the investment projects that are causing mass deforestation. countries like the US, who are so far in debt to do anything about china, are also too busy arguing about whether climate change exists, despite being able to see the destruction of all life happening right now."
14:50 same was said about the first nukes.
Wow.
"I will buy a subscription to wren for a full year if you can explain exactly how a carbon footprint is the excusatory method used by large corporations to shift the blame from them to the individuals of the public in one of your videos. Here's the first thread to follow for your research: BP first introduced the concept of individual carbon footprints. Yes, I do mean British Petroleum, the petroleum giant, who's annual emissions are around 374 million tonnes. (And assuming that after putting all that research together you still feel that the carbon footprint of the individual matters, of course.)"
"Should we try to control the ""natural world"" in the first place? 

Also I'd prefer we not talk about ""the natural world"", as that creates a sense of separation between us and ""nature"". When in fact there is none. There is no ""natural world"", just the world, that we're a part of. And our insatiable need to control it is destroying that world. 

Fertilizers are a good example. Using methods like crop rotation produces nearly as much food for a lot less nitrogen dumped into the environment. But because we crave ever greater profits and control over the processes of nature, we dump immense amounts of fertilizer onto fields and severely damage the whole local ecosystem in the process."

"Yeah, read about Haber a while ago. His life just went full circle, pain all the way at every stage until the end."
This delayed the malthusian catastrophe by 150 years or so... But made it much worse.
"Well the argument that he is irrelevant because someone else would have done those inventions is a cheap excuse for everything. It’s the same as saying, if I don’t do it another one will. If everyone thinks this way, then the world becomes a terrible place to live in. And you can never be sure if inventions really would be done by others. Check south American early civilizations. At the same time other civilizations around the world had waggons, they did not even know the wheel! 

Sometimes it also takes a long time that another one makes an invention. Ancient Greeks already had some steam powered bronze apparatus. A metal ball there would spin by the pressure of steam. But it took a long time until someone figured out to use the power of steam to build machines that will use power to drive wheels and tools. Chinese already had a printing press with single metal letters before Gutenberg invented this, too, in Europe. Maybe nitrogen fertilizers would not have been invented by today and food crisis and wars would have ruined mankind by now."

"My great-uncle was a driver in the U.S. army during WW II and as it happened drove Oppenheimer to the site from which the Manhattan Project's lead scientist observed the first atomic detonation. So he would later enjoy claiming that had he NOT delivered the team leader, the test most certainly would not have proceeded (or at least not on time!) ...and without that first detonation there could not have been subsequent detonations... and so it was that my great-uncle liked to claim personal responsibility for ushering in the atomic age. 
Of course it's pretty obvious that no matter his best/worst  efforts, Hiroshima was effectively a done deal. None-the-less, thanks to this video, I now can now think of my great-uncle's historical irrelevance as at least placing him in good company! So thanks!"

What’s wrong with the sponsor? It allows you to see what you can improve on while simultaneously paying to support efforts that can save and improve the quality of human lives

"The truth is: if you abuse of your soil like a brainless zombie it will finish the nitrogen and you need to provide it in some way, but if you use the brain and the natural enrichment of nitrogen done by a lot of plant types you don't need to buy anything, your soil will stay healthy and your plants too :)"
"“The Alchemy of Air” is a wonderful book that covers this topic and a bit of other closely related things about nitrogen such as gunpowder and rockets by the Chinese to this South American desert where factories distilling nitrogen would pop up. It’s a great read and also touched upon someone influential enough to be named in the process as well: Bosh(the full name of the process is The Haber Bosh process). Basically Bosh owned the company that commercialized Haber’s process because they provided large amounts of funding and help to the research process and it’s actually where a lot of fundamental parts of modern chemistry descend from! So as a fan of living, history, and chemistry, i wholeheartedly recommend “The Alchemy of Air”!:))"
"Actually, Bosch did not own the company. He was a chemist by training and took over the task to turn Haber's table top device into a large-scale industrial process. He also founded an experimental farm to study how to put fertiliser to good use in practice. He also proposed to the German government to produce saltpetre from ammonia for the war effort. After WWI, he became the CEO of BASF. After WWI, Germany had to give all patents for ammonia production to the victors and BASF needed a new business idea. Bosch saw an opportunity in synthesising automobile fuels from coal and invested gigantic sums in production facilities. While this was not a commercial success, it allowed Germany to fight WWII. 

In my view, Bosch is the person that had more influence on the fate of humanity during the 20th century than anyone else. He not only created a completely new technology for ammonia production which then allowed the world population to grow to today's numbers. Without his plants for producing saltpetre and synthetic fuel the two World Wars would have been over after a year or two, each."
"We have to come up with a new solution for fertilizer. Even if we had endless amounts of oil and natural gas, we clearly can't use it forever if we want a comfortable planet to live. I mean, just look at the impact of the war in Ukraine has affected distribution. Let's hope climate change doesn't drop yields too far. That said, most is probably going to animal ag, so that's probably a better place to start."
"cant look at him as a villan because he saved billions

cant look at him as a hero because he killed millions

Alfred Nobel invented the Nobel piece prize because his invention of dynamite was negatively attributed to military explosives. The award was designed to give people a second chance.
Great video. Didnt know about it. Epilog justificiation was unnecessary. Let the viewiers jugde themself and be the science channel. Not opinion-forming channel. My little request. Great video again :)
Why does it say 1919 on the wall in the first shot in the video?
"according to bhagwat githa lord krishna says what haber did is perfectly good, he just helped his country thats his path of duty, if hes smart there is nothing wrong in playing unfair in war..."
She’s seem like a bitach any way some people can’t be pleased.
I'm by no means part of the cancel culture. But people please discuss with me how you feel about removing Haber's name from the Haber Process and other namesakes. His despicable actions to me don't deserve the honor of having anything in science named after him besides anything demonic. We may as well use a more descriptive name for the processes.
"he should be remembered, because of this chemical knowledge we saved billions but also killed millions, and that's the price which scientists are potentially paying for each new discovery. of course they don't know it, harber went after a salvation and he got it but it also meant the doom of other people and he didn't know it at the time.

like veritasium said, any information in the chemical word, be small or big, can be a double edged sword, and you don't know what other people can do with your work. it's a life lesson for us"

Alfred Nobel had the same idea of ending wars faster with more devastating weapons. He even foresaw the peace nuclear weapons would bring. Let's hope they keep being right.
Good thing we want to reduce the amount we put into the soil. Just talk to the dutch farmers.
"If you want to read a fascinating book that elaborates on the life, discoveries, and interesting implications of Fritz Haber's work, as well as other notable 20th century mathematicians and physicists, I recommend picking up a copy of ""When We Cease To Understand The World by Benjamin Labatut"" It's by far one of the most interesting books I've read in terms of it's unique genre status. The book breaks convention and fuses history with fiction in a compelling and gripping way. Hope you have a good day and perhaps a good read!  (if he mentions the book in the video don't come for me. I just came to leave this comment)"
As a chemical engineer near retirement I spent much of my career fixing problems created by the previous generation of engineers. Sure Haber was brilliant but he failed to honor the code of ethics for chemical or electrical engineers.
"These episodes feel so much like a continuation of the 2014 Cosmos series -- Educational, enlightening, beautifully animated & great narration.
Thanks for making this!"
"@Rupesh not that I'm aware of, no 😪"

Yeah good ol' memories
"Great video! However, we cannot speak of Haber's contributions to nitrogen chemistry without mentioning Carl Bosch! The process is actually called the Haber-Bosch process to recognize Bosch's contributions. 

Carl Bosch led the team of engineers and chemists at BASF that made the trickle flow of Haber's table top prototype ammonia oven become the factory sized ammonia river that has fed the world's fertilizer and weapons needs ever since. This was no easy feat- without the successful scaling up of the process, it would never have been possible to commercialize and thus economically unviable to operate. You can make a small pressure oven relatively easily, but to make one the size of a house? Its like making a 1920's airplane versus a modern fighter jet... Or maybe a sailboat versus an aircraft carrier. Same working principle, huge difference. It took tremendous amounts of pioneering engineering- the science of how to make chemical reactions possible on a large scale under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure- which laid the foundations of the field we today call chemical engineering.

Bosch eventually became the director of BASF and then (when BASF merged with other firms) the conglomerate IG Farben, after which he was retired from his position, due to poor health and resistance to Hitler's policies. He shared the Nobel prize in chemistry (with Friedrich Bergius) in 1931 for his contributions to high pressure chemistry."
"@J. E. H. It was actually the team led by Alwin Mittasch that found the iron catalyst (specifically magnetite). Initially, as Haber found, osmium would work, but osmium is super rare and very expensive, which would matter when BASF tried to mass produce ammonia. Then someone found out that uranium would work, which was better, because its plentiful, but it wasn't perfect. Finally they found that iron would work just as well as osmium when mixed with other substances like aluminium oxide and calcium. These secondary substances are called promoters and the search for the perfect catalyst opened a new era in catalytic chemistry with an emphasis on promoters instead of pure elements."
"Indeed, credit always has to be given to the team that manage to turn the prototype into a usable concept."
"It's necessary to consider Bosch as an important figure; his legacy is one of the largest engineering products companies in the world. But truthfully, I think handing him the Nobel in conjunction with Haber was simply the committee trying to save face.

Carl Bosch was an excellent engineer, but he didn't do chemical discovery. The process on an industrial scale was, indeed, the scaled version of what Haber had discovered; never since nor before has a chemistry Nobel been given to the industrial engineer who scaled up the production.

Bosch was necessary to the commercial production, and in many instances he was an experimental chemist, but the politics of the time suggest that he wasn't even named in the process technique until after the Nobel was awarded."
Thank you for this information!
"There was another guy that i forgot the name,but a british one that came up with the design for one the most important parts but he is rarely talked about too."
thank you forthe closing staements - that is what thinking is about
saved billions and tried to help his country win the war. nothing wrong with that. if he didn't use the gas attack first then someone else would have used it on them with time. as is the same for all weapons.
I dunno. I bet a lot of people died of good ol ignorance throughout history. True story
"Ok, but what good this really is, if nowadays we still have people starving all around the globe? We always had enough food and resources for everyone, producing more is not the solution. If humanity were less greed, we wouldn't need this fertilizers. Now, imagine the damage we're going to do in the next centuries, exploring other planets."
"People starve today in underdeveloped areas that would benefit from fertilizer and modern agricultural science. The fertilizer isnt the problem, the availability is"
"Einstein struggled with the double edge sword of his discoveries too. E=mc² was what Lead to people further developing nuclear bombs BUT also nuclear energy. Which sure it's gotten a bad stigmatized reputation but it honestly can and should be the power source of our future. We can harness it much safer and more advanced now with our technology and knowledge, and safety measures. We have new options, new designs, so much that could improve the global energy options and emissions output problem. We can do better then the Human errors of our past."
He just want to be noticed for good and his country
"The book ""the alchemy of air"" talks about him very well"
"Incredible storytelling combined with interesting information, what an amazing channel!"
"One of the most despicable people in recent history. The NH3 production could have been done by anyone with basic chemistry and physics so his benefits to society were minimal. Unlike the great Einstein Haber lost his humanity in scientific curiosity making him a super-villain. His willingness to inflict cruelty and his early volunteering again shows his disgusting philosophy. Einstein is above all other scientists in his era as he also saw the philosophic and human sides of physics. Can't stand the guy, vile creature.

Excellent video as always Derek."

"""The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interrèd with their bones."" - Julius Ceasar Act III, Scene 2 by William Shakespeare.

I've heard it said if Haber were really repentant, he would have followed his wife's example, but I think after all that the last thing we needed was yet another death. No amount of science or chemistry can cure the darkness that ails the human heart."
"Would have been interesting to see a mention of climate change and the fact that the energy used for fertilizer production is a large driver of agricultural GHG emissions. From killing millions, to saving billions, to making the world less habitable for those billions."
"he fucked us, imagine the world with half the population..."
"Think a quarter of the worlds population with starvation and malnutrition as the most likely cause of death in every country.  A world without nitrogen fertilizer would not sustain 3.5 billion people.  In the world you want, there would be soup kitchens serving watery soup instead of food banks, food would be tremendously expensive, and malnutrition would be the norm for poor people in every country, and having a bad month financially could easily put you into debt or kill you.  Probably a lot more violence, uprisings, and crime too."
"@14:53 That is the same logic that was used to excuse the use of atomic bombs in Japan. Utilitarian bull****.  And @19:50 there is the other frequently used excuse ""if not him (or me), then someone else would develop e.g. the deadly weapon"" etc.
But thank you for your great video, I learned a lot. And it is interesting, that there are always Jewish people in science and literature and politics etc. that do something for the good of humanity or for the bad of the humanity. Very biblical. The LORD Jesus Christ was a Jew. And the coming Anti-Christ (False Prophet) will also be Jew."
"I love this video, but I feel as though you could get a bit more technical if you wanted to. I’m sure your audience must have a relatively solid background in science, hence their interest in watching videos like these, so why not sometimes go a bit deeper in explaining stuff? Like on 08:30. Idk just a proposal."
That's where you are wrong. The audience isn't relatively strong in science.

"Great content. History, science, drama, happiness, sadness and love; everything in one video. Thank you."
"cana't believe scientists can be this dumb, did  he think the mustache man would stop?"
he died before ww2 even began
The reason he was hated is unfortunate because he loved his country and fought for it and they lost therefore he was ridiculed for helping wrong side. Its like american soldiers from vietnam coming home and greeted with eggs and tomatoes.  Ultimately he did save human lives more so than he killed via his inventions. He did more good than harm.
ironic the guy with no heart died of heart failure
Aka. chaotic good.
Thank you for this video!
"What an absolutely wonderful video! From what I've learned, I feel that Haber care strongly for his nation, but was betrayed by his own hubris in the end. A man of science that believes himself above the world is ironically buried within it. Perhaps we should remember who we are as stewards and guardians of this planet, instead of its conquerors. Thank you so much for the amazing video! ☺️"
"Take E=mc squared as an example,it was a very simple equation which explained a lot but Einstein did not knew that this could be used in warfare"

poignant episode ! ...thank you for this video 🙏🏼
I personally would never be able to aid any government to advance militarily. It’s just too risky to trust any institute that has legalized killing for itself.

6:50 😒
"19:30 Damn well said. This is something I've thought about a lot in the past a hobby historian. The World Wars were a horrible thing, and yet between the two, they catapulted science and technology forward 40 years in a mere 10. Everything we learn can be used for good or bad. You can never have one without the other. We just have to do our best."
"Haber's excuse for using chemical weapons is exactly the same excuse Americans use on why they nuked Japan, twice. It's kinda hypocritical to call him a villain when the US claims it was a hero for doing that."
"Great video. I don't care at all for Wren, but your videos are amazing.  Thanks for your work!"
"A person, who with long and hard work invented a way to feed the world, also easily invented a way to kill many people brutally. And after his death his invention was used to almost eradicate his own nationality.
Truly, it's hard to do good and very easy to do evil."
"I love your presentation and passionate telling of the history behind things that are part of our human story.  I believe the spiritual realm of life helps to explain why man ultimately fails in doing total good and, I believe, that rounds out the whole story of mankind.  Apart from the influence and care and love of God, man will always be subject to falling toward an evil bent."
"Yes God, the person who has murdered thousands of innocents, has never done an evil thing in all of existence......"
The best Veritasium video so far!!
I was expecting some kind of answer or at least any hints to the final question
"i knew that Einstein had a big fallout with Haber and other scienctists who stood by him.

Then again, spare thought for Oppenheimer, Teller or Feynman who are respected scientists, because they developed their WMD (killcount about 200.000)  for the good guys.  I'm all in favour of criticizing scientists for making weapons, but then please all of them. That is also true for other major hypocrisy targets like Wernher von Braun."
Bro wtf. This is why i didnt pay attention in school. If you want to really learn something randomly specific. Which is honestly most things. People like this gut are the way to go about it

"The story hasn't ended yet. Yes, billions of people are fed through synthetic nitrogen fertilisers, and yet that is not a sustainable method of growing food. Soils are depleted and eroded to the extent that more fertiliser and more room is needed. Where does that end? Perhaps if those fertilisers had not been invented then another process might have taken its place, or perhaps humanity might have kept its population within the bounds of what the soil can provide without being squeezed."
"@Dark Wing that's quite a different claim and one which is not altogether supported by evidence. Yes, very often people make people without much thought, but some people (namely women) put a deal more thought into it and in places where women have access to financial freedom and contraception we find a dramatic decrease in the number of children women have. There are many mechanisms which can and do lead to people having fewer children and there's no need to resort to extreme scenarios of population decrease through starvation."
@Stuff and Nonsense I claimed nothing of the sort.  People have children without regard for the resources available.  They do this now.  They've done it in the past.  And they're likely to keep on doing it.
"@Dark Wing At no point did I suggest starvation as a way to save the environment. And I'm afraid your children point still doesn't add up. Are you really claiming anyone could have any number of children and it would have no impact on the resources available?

Also, it very much depends on what you mean by starvation, but if you mean having no food for an extended period of time, then I do in fact have some idea of what starvation is like."
"I didn't say that at all.  Maybe you will have less children because it's unsustainable.  But you are outnumbered 100,000 to 1 by people who will have children for many other reasons.  And right now people in famine-prone countries have children who may starve to death.

You don't know what it's like to starve.  I do.  So I found your original post which seemed to tout starvation as a way to save the environment incredibly offensive.  Your reply not so offensive since you believe that people would actually change.  But there's no evidence at all that they would."
20:15 but this scientist kept working on war...not just his invention was used for destruction by others!
crazy choice of transition at 2:45
I think you missed a massive point here Derek: the role that centralized state government played in this tragic story. Science may be neutral but centralized state governments are not. And they routinely employ the use of science and technology to inflict damage and destruction on a massive scale. Haber made choices that resulted in death as well as life but he was merely a cog in the military machine. The takeaway here is that centralized state governments cannot be trusted with the power that science unleashes. The common people of the country must have the vested control of the means of scientific advancement and production. It is the only way to prevent mass destruction in the future.
@Bryan Day what are you thoughts on Libertarians and AnCaps?
"@Michael Michael yes it is absolutely possible. Human nature is decentralized power since we all like to have autonomy. History has shown that we naturally select leaders for their vision but the general trend is to keep the productive power decentralized. The massive centralized governments of the last 2 centuries, which have controlled policy and advancement, have been a complete disaster for the planet as a whole."
Is it possible to have a decentralized government?
"Pick up your cross and follow Jesus! The world is quickly headed for destruction, and sooner or later you will have to sit at the judgement seat and give an account for your actions. Belief in messiah alone is not enough to grant you salvation - Matthew 7:21-23, John 3:3, John 3:36 (ESV is the best translation for John 3:36). Call on the name of Jesus and pray for Him to intervene in your life! - Revelation 3:20. 

Contemplate how the Roman Empire fulfilled the role of the beast from the sea in Revelation 13. Revelation 17 confirms that it is in fact Rome. From this we can conclude that A) Jesus is the Son of God and can predict the future or make it happen, B) The world leaders/nations/governments etc have been conspiring together for the last 3000+ years going back to Babylon and before, C) History as we know it is fake. You don't really need to speculate once you start a relationship with God tho.

Can't get a response from God? Fasting can help increase your perception and prayer can help initiate events.  God will ignore you if your prayer does not align with His purpose (James 4:3) or if you are approaching Him when ""unclean"" (Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 59:2, Micah 3:4). Stop eating food sacrificed to idols (McDonald's, Wendy's etc) stop glorifying yourself on social media or making other images of yourself (Second Commandment), stop gossiping about other people, stop watching obscene content etc and you should get a response. Have a blessed day!"

"Once I inhaled chlorine gas and it sent me to the ER.  Even in minor amounts, it was the most unpleasant experience of my life.  I can't imagine a death from it."

"It is a kind of poetic justice in a sick way isn't it? He used chemical weapons on many for the sake of the german state. And that legacy continued beyond his control.

Maybe he should have practiced his faith. Then maybe he would not have misplaced it so throughly."
"Veritasium your cartoons are wanky and lame, other than that I Admire your videos, please don't do this to my eyes!"
"i don't really agree on the last point, scientists who do pure reaserch or scientists who are studying someting that is then repurposed for a nefarious purpose can't be blamed in my opinion as there was no intentionality, and indeed, as you say, predicting the uninentended (good, bad, neutral) consecuences of reaserch is like playing the roulette.
However if you are researching something with an application in mind, let's say chemical weapons, and something comes out of that reaserch, then you can be blamed for the consequences as there was intentionality
in this case in particular the guy is to blame for both the good and the bad stuff, and in general i think defining people as ""saints"" or ""demons"" is really oversimplifying reality"
the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

"Makes one wonder if this is true why are the Netherlands, Sri Lanka and other governments banning nitrogen. 
BTW -  Co2 is plant food."
"In the 90s, after the fall of the wall, BASF invested heavily in Siberian methane extraction and building pipelines.

BASF has some murky financial ties into Nordstream 2. What happened to its ""loans"" now that this pipeline is defunct is not clear.

In 2015, 1 year after Russia invaded Ukraine, Wintershall sold off its german gas storage facilities to Gazprom, in exchange for more russian methane. These gas storage facilities are 25% of all gas storage facilities in germany (270TWh), and it was exactly these gas storage facilities that were deliberately left empty in the summer and fall of 2021. Wintershall was/is a 100% daughtercompany of BASF.

In the past 30 years, BASF has lobbied German and European politicians extensively to increase Europes dependency on methane. Plentiful methane for energy, means cheap methane for the Haber-Bosch process that BASF makes so much money on.

With the advent of the ""Great Coalition"" of catholics and socialists in 2013, the expansion of renewables in germany was stunted, and Russian gas imports were increased. Today, we could have had 75% more solar and 25% more wind generation capacity installed in Germany, if expansion had kept the same level as their respective peaks in 2012 and 2017 (wind has about a 5y delay). This lost capacity is measured against flatlined expansion, and not the exponential growth we were seeing before. Just when massive german taxpayer investment from the previous 10-15ys started to pay off, all of the german solar and wind manufacturing industry and the whole economy around it was wiped out. Renewables were working, and threatened the future of fossil methane, and therefore it got dispatched.

Thanks to the lobbying of the likes of BASF, the CDU/CSU and SPD made Germany extremely dependent on russian gas, and this is one of the key enabling factors for the current oligarch regime in Russia, and thus the war in Ukraine.

Haber-Bosch requires hydrogen. This hydrogen is mostly created from methane, through steam reforming. Producing fertlizer, through SMR and Haber-bosch produces 1-1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

BASFs Ludwigshafen plant has a direct pipeline connecting to the rest of the gas network reaching all the way to Siberia. Actual data is hard to come by, but BASF's ludwigshafen plant alone is claimed to use 37TWh of Methane in 2020. 2.1% of all of german methane imports, or more than 6% of the part of methane imports not used for home heating and electricity production, or 14% of the capacity of german storage facilities.

The SMR process (Steam Methane Reforming) is about 74% efficient. I found one paper estimating various energy sources and the energy overhead these various sources incur, and it guesses that getting methane out of Siberia into Germany wastes about 20%. This means that getting hydrogen out of Siberian methane is 61.67% efficient, which is an efficiency that is achievable with electrolysis, when powered with excess renewable energy. But that would mean that BASF would have to invest heavily in its infrastructure instead of passing on massive profits to its shareholders now.

German households had their gas prices hiked up 50% already, and that's before the full cost is allowed to be passed on to consumers as that is legally limited at this time. The cost of methane for consumers has already reached a level where a heatpump only needs a COP of 3 to be on cost parity using grid electricity. In 2021, BASF had its revenue rise by a third, to 78B EUR, and its profits doubled to 7.88B EUR. And yet germans are supposed to turn down their radiators and take colder shorter showers to help save on gas to help sustain such companies.

Between BASF and Bayer, between indiscriminately chemical over-fertilizing and chemically killing everything, we have turned our farmers into lazy chemistry applicators and turned our soils into toxic deserts. No life remains, neither microbial or anything higher order, and the organic matter is disappearing fast, removing the ability for soils to retain water and nutrients. This in turn pollutes water everywhere, etc... Dead soil? That doesn't matter, just add more chemical fertilizer!

Despite such a damming history, the german gouvernment now pivoted to building LNG terminals double time. Not a word is being said about moving SMR based processes over to electrolysis. There is no mention of retrofitting 90% of german biogas plants to produce biomethane (we basically waste 90TWh worth every year).

So even with the greens in the german gouvernment, the tentacles of the fossil methane lobby still have a stranglehold on the world.

Unlike with Robert Midgely Jr., Fritz Habers gift to humanity just keeps on giving."
"It always troubles me how , most especially in today's times, we judge people and their actions through the eyes of today rather than the realities that existed in the past.
If Germany won the first world war ,which very possibly would have meant there would never would have been a second world war (no holocaust, no nuclear bombed Japan,no pearl harbor, no invasion of Russia, etc) would this man be considered a hero ?"
@nick leback I think you mixed up ww1 with ww2? 🤔
"We learn and grow based on the mistakes and successes of the past. There is a saying in engineering, “rules and regulations are paid in blood.” The whole point of that saying is to point out that a lot of things change, and a lot of knowledge is gained through unknown mistakes or misunderstandings. In science, it is no different. When something is discovered, you don’t know the effects that may come about. They could be good. They could be bad. But we do not grow and develop if we do not come across both. 

Look at nuclear power and radiation. It has both good and bad, but key and very important advancements have been made in science and engineering thanks in part to the atomic bombs and the disasters of nuclear power plants. Such advancements are proving useful in our exploration of space.

Let’s not belittle the cause for the blood, but instead understand WHY there is blood, and how we can fix it."
Yall all blaming Germany meanwhile an unemployed Austrian started WW2.
"@nick leback Germany was the agressor in WW2, thats right. But Germany was certainly not the sole aggressor in WW1. The alliances prior to WW1 were most certainly the deciding factor to ""kickstart"" the entire war. If there was no alliance between Russia and France to encircle Germany this would have only been a war between Austria-Hungary and Germany vs Serbia and Russia. The moment France was in the War it was over. Germanys plan was to bypass the Franco-German Border-region by going through Belgium but they refused so Germany declared war on them (the only Real aggression by Germany in this War up to this point), this called the UK into the War because of their guaranty of independence for Belgium. This was the final step into a real WORLD war


Long story short: Germany is no the sole aggressor and ""bad boy"" in this war that the Treaty of Versailles wants you make to believe.

And the argument ""reducing the total number of dead by using the nuke"" can be applied on the german gas offensiv aswell. One big breakthrough on broader line could have been the final blow to knock out France and the UK in the West and shorten the duration of the bloodshed of trench warfare"
The difference is that Germany was the aggressor while Britain the united states etc were defending their homeland and allies. Also an invasion of japan would have resulted in even more deaths than the   atom bombs.
"thats gotta hurt, a jewish guy invents a pesticide, Zyklon B, and the nazis then use that pesticide to kill a load of jews..... ouch"

"His story is another classic example of scientists never asking themselves if they should, only if you could."
"I truly enjoy this episodes about how the science relate to human development through mostly 'unknown' characters for the big majority of us.

Die from suffering starvation is more peaceful than dying from suffering chemical Gas or explosions
Leave out the music ffs
I regard his initial discoveries as heroic but his later actions as evil. Overall he shows the danger of blind patriotism when mixed with genius.
Great story 👍
You think that fertilizer allowing 4 billion more people to exist is a good thing. It’s not. That overshot will cost us soon as we’re slowly less and less able to get enough fossil fuels to produce enough fertilizer. This dude has doomed the whole human race.

"How? Easy, abolish capitalism and sorts of hierarchical system and we all contribute not for sake of money or power. Mass production is equal to destroying planet and eventually we will run out of resources. Rather wasting the earth’s precious resources to do the same on another planet, let’s focus on our planet that is so unique and incredible."
What a stupid patriotic bastard... that's what he was!!!
Just bruh
"Definitely got that title wrong. He didn’t save billions. What he did basically created billions. Billions of people that would have never existed without his work. He really just caused a bunch of gruesome deaths. His wife absolutely killed herself because of what he created. If she wasn’t already happy, then that certainly made her feel much worse. Seems he was more interested in chemicals than her."
"Well, Obama won a nobel prize too so who cares."

"The climate problem is not too much carbon, it is declining rates of oxygen in the atmosphere and pulvarization of toxic chemicals at high altitudes like strontium, baryium ans aluminum. Only trees are able to produce oxygen."
Easy answer. Stop been patriotic or having a religion.

I want to know what if we could use 100% of energy from sun that falls on earth. What will happen to the planet? It will continue to heat up slowly but surely.

You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
"Previously the Birkeland Eide process created ammonia by drawing air through an arc in 1913 which used a lot of power. The Haber process is more efficient.
The Haber process was eventually replaced by the Solvay process.
By the way I think the company that made light bulbs using osmium is called Osram. Eventually it was decided tungsten was better, by Thomas Edison."
One of my favorite German 🇩🇪 scientist
"I love how everyone talks about 1933 Germany without mentioning what happened in 1932 Germany causing increased support for NSDAP


Also, the US used Zyklon B on mexicans as a de-lousing agent, in the camps Major Miller also found that gas was never used to kill people but to interrigate them (this is how the initial claim of all camps being extermination camps was disproven).

The only standing claim of gas being used to kill millions comes from Soviet held camps which were not investigated by Miller or the Red cross, 80% of the Soviet leadership at that time was also Ethnically Jewish so take from that what you will."
"Jesus, are we still arguing this? WHEN are you gonna run out of tinfoil to make hats of???"
Its fun how a great mind can be used in a great way to help us all and on the other hand that same mind can be used in a terrible way and ruin us or our planet
"I think generally I regard him as a patriot with love for Science. He made the world better by discovering how to get nitrate and the reason WW1 started is so ridiculously stupid, it’s just unfortunate the countries had to battle each other out and he just wanted to support his home country. Although the Chemical weapon did horrible things! Tho I see why he would only see his country on the winning side"
The problem is nationalism if people dont regards those outside of an arbitrary border that different they wouldn’t be led to commit atrocities towards each other.
"Sold his soul to support German ultranationalism/imperialism, only for it to give way to Nazism and the mass murder of his people. Just goes to show that nobody is safe once you start down that road."

"Im rly glad you explicitly mentioned the allusions between their gas weapons development and the manhattan project. Your description of it alrdy had made me thinkin of the horrors that became possible due to the manhattan project. Particularly his line about how they wud save so many more lives by using these wpns; that was the exact same reason the allies were usin to justify their own wpns dev and the reasonin that wud be given for justifyin droppin a nuke on Japan, twice.

In every case, that justification stands on very shaky grounds at best, but there will always be someone they get to do the job. Haber just happened to be a convenient pawn for the war of empires with no regards for their citizens, as all who work for military industrial war machines end up being."
"I just talked about this in my speech for the World’s 50 Best Restaurant awards 50 Next event. Technologies are neutral, but the politics that fund them are not. We’re also paying the price for chemical fertilizers in other ways today, and will be in the future if we keep treating our soil as a deed on paper instead of as the living system . What we do with what we’ve got makes all the difference."
"In reality he didn't SAVE billions ,he just made it more possible for them to survive ,resulting in the over-population of the world which is the real number 1 problem as dwindling resources are used up at an ever increasing rate."

Who else interpreted the title as killing millions of people but saving billions of dollars?
"Funny how being identified as a patriot or a villain only depends on which side you were on. Fritz Haber a villain  but  Richard Feynman ,Robert Oppenheimer defined as patriots just as all the unnamed scientists nowadays  working for big military tech companies. I would love to watch Veritasium telling the story of the man/woman or team who developed Agent Orange.I suppose it also depends on if your weapons were used to defend and promote democracy or not."
@Marcos Burgos just by the name I can tell Oppenheimer was german too (or at least from german descent)
"@thezfunk 
""promote democracy"" is the american go-to to explain and rationalise any and all military escapades they might be having."
@Danyel Nicholas The Kaiser was not worse than English or French leaders of that time. You can not compare him to a dictator like Hitler.

"""How do we do this without destroying ourselves?""

We don't. We are destined to die."
"Fritz Haber like many of us failed to understand we all live on this planet together, for better or worse. His actions caused the death of million including his wife. ""History doesn't repeat itself but it does rhythm"" (Mark Twain). My question is: when will we learn the lesson?"
"In response to your final question ( a good question):  ""How indeed?"""

If he is a villain so every other engineer who is working for Military-industrial Complex.
Fritz Haber is a villain though. Thinking of him as anything other than a “Nazi before being a Nazi was cool” means you’re just wrong.
cry about it
"How (to increase knowledge w/o destroying ourselves)? Just don't destroy ourselves. If you see the danger, then don't do it. Don't I, as a human being, have control over my actions? Nobody can force me to do anything that I don't want to do. Can't you see this?"
Worth waiting for the video
"Que história triste. O cara inventa a tecnologia que salva bilhões e faz a humanidade crescer e extinguir milhares de espécies. Aí ele inventa um pesticida que é usado contra o próprio povo. Triste demais. Imagino quantos milhões de pessoas hoje trabalham com os mesmo conceitos, fazendo pesticidas, venenos, fertilizantes polêmicos. Fazendo o melhor pra pátria no momento e não se preocupando com o futuro"
"As Clapton did sing: ""It's in the way that you use it!"""
"Wow! What a great video. The quality, narration, and topics are phenomenal. Really love Veritasium!"
A very fitting and earnest conclusion
Nitrogen Fix. Dad joke?
This story perfectly shows that the road to hell if paved with good intentions. And sadly this is true for most stuff.
"""How do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on this planet in the process?""

Do away with greed."
"Imagine what would happen when they find out that raising the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere up to 950 parts per million makes plants grow three to five times faster. And that doesn't kill anyone. It also doesn't appreciably raise any temperature.
If you will take the time to actually research weather, you will find that we are having less frequent and less severe heat waves. Please quit saying s*** that you haven't looked into before. Because I have looked at the records. And I wasn't stupid enough to only go back to 1960 or 1950. Like many are doing!"
I’ll gladly look into it.
"Do you have a source for that? No, really. I’ve seen different models for greenhouse effect with different magnitudes of heating and different types of secondary effects.  But I’m not sure that I’ve seen one that predicts no appreciable temperature changes."
"Mugged up the harber's process for a whole year in chem for nitrogen preparation, but never knew it was so important 🤣. Thanks. 👍👍"
"The man used chemistry for survival, there is nothing wrong with that."
"The man was rightfully shunned. He went way over the line with chemical weapons. That was his choice to do and he knew he gave thousands a horrible death and just continued on. He might not have been the only one and he might have done good to, but a Nobel price was not right. But those things are wit often given to people I have doubts about."
"Science does not have intentions but scientists do. Haber chose to use his talent for developing chemical weapons. It's not like he made some innocent discoveries later found adverse effects. He should be held responsible for what he had done. 

On a related note, major AI/ML confidences these days started to require discussion and disclosure on ethics and social implications for each submitted work. Authors are encouraged to acknowledge potential harms of their work if it is used unintentionally or maliciously, even they may have started from a good place. This won't solve all the potential problems but it's a good thing that the research community is taking measures to make sure we do good science and keep the potential bad under check."
I Enjoyed this.. What a Knife's to Walk ....even After your death .. how your research.. Inventions can be utilized in a way you did not predict or perhaps want... What a Fantastic Species We Are.. Both TERRIBLE AND GREAT! HOW WILL WE FAIR IN THE FUTURE TO  COME...? Will we disappear like Atlantis.. destroy OURSELVES to the point that the NEXT INTELLIGENT iteration of Us can Barely find any confirmed trace of our previous existence? What a wonderous thought.... we can be SOOOO MUCH.. and at the same time do so much harm to ourselves. How will we fair? I'll see you there..! Thanks for this. This made me More Intelligent.

Here enters Carl Jung....
"Germans are the greatest at all things, it’s the only reason the usa is a super power today. If it weren’t for all the Nazi scientists and Japanese from bio germ camps our county would be just another one of the 195."
He was a Germany born Jew though
"Such a sad story.  It's hard to say whether Haber truly believed his toxins and explosives would end the war more quickly, or if that was just an excuse to exercise his nationalistic/imperialistic pride, but at the end of the day he still resigned from his prestigious position when his jewish brothers were being fired.  I hope his descendants remember the good he did, and don't solely judge him for the atrocities committed with his discoveries."
"It s definitely arguable to say that the inventon of the formula to extract nitrogen out of thin air was a good thing to begin with. Most of the added human lives were/are painful, w/t hope. For the few that were indeed more enjoyable, they paved the way for a darker world. All in all, this is arguable."
This is the best case thats shows that raw intelligence alone will not make you a good person. No science textbook can teach you the immorality of nationalism.
This video is classic misinformation / fake news.

"For humanity to succeed, we need to convince people that they should be patriots for humanity, not patriots to countries which come and go and ultimately are meaningless."
More murderer than scientist if y’ask me.
"I mean, what if he really thought he could save more people from dying by stopping the war? Like the US succeeded with the nuclear bomb. They're considered the heroes today, but killed civilians too, not just soldiers on the battlefield."
"When everyone hates what you're doing, you're probably doing the right thing for humanity."
"I had lost my trust in Veritasium. But this video was undeniably educational, moving and thought-provoking. 
Good work."
Why?
"It would be nice if every scientist on the planet stopped developing weapons, but that’s never going to happen.

If only the good guys stop developing weapons, and the bad guys don’t; the result isn’t world peace, the result is the good guys lose."
"To say that someone else would have come up with the process for making ammonia is to discount the brilliance of the person who discovered it, after all as you said he succeeded when so many others had failed.  There are things we don't have now, like stable nuclear fusion or a universal solvent, but maybe it just takes the right mind in the right situation to crack the problem.  I once read a book about hiring people that said that you can hire 1000 composers to write music, but none of them will be as brilliant as Mozart."
"Very moving video.
While inhumane the ultimate goal of most of scientists developing weapons isn't really evil. Manhattan project was pretty much the same. Really inhumane way of potentially reducing lives lost by either ending the war quickly or making it unthinkable.

Really the only difference is that German Empire lost the war and by definition if you make losing side stronger without turning the tide you making war bigger, not smaller.
...But who can predict the outcome, not to mention realizing he's on the loosing or bad side"
"Everything is grey, no black an white"
Not satisfied with your conclusion at the end. You can definitely predict the impact of your scientific work. Just some are willfully negligent in the face of greed or power.

fritz haber? what did he habe?
Why does it say 1919 at the start of the video?
He's a true hero. Putting his country first.
"and it's important to note that he wasn't a nazi or wanted world domination, it's not ww2"
"I think it's not right to deem Haber irrelevant just because someone else could've figured it out. We don't do that with Newton, Einstein, or anyone else. He deserves recognition for what he did, both good and bad. Not irrelevancy."
The only thing that can save us is wisdom.

"What a truly dark and tragic twist to this story. Stunning video quality, as usual"
"Amazing, *riveting* video, Derek!! This reminded me of Kyle Hill's half-life series. Glorious, tragic, and everything in between"

Very true.."
"„Im Frieden der Menschheit, im Krieg dem Vaterland.“- Fritz Haber
(In peace for mankind, in war for the fatherland.)

Ammonia synthesis is very inefficient. Despite high pressures and catalyst only around 20% of the nitrogen reacts to form ammonia. Because of this, and because of the importance of nitrogen fertilizers, humanity spends 1% of global energy production on this process. 1% to power a single chemical reaction."
I appreciate that you visualized the force needed to break bonds by karate chopping molecules
7:00 Don't forget about nitrogen fixing crops that take it from the air.  Cover crops may be the next thing that saves billions when hydrocarbons start becoming too costly to make nitrogen.  The real problem is phosphorous and potassium tho. Better stock up now it will be gone or too expensive in 5 10 years at this rate.
Sounds like Dr. Fauci... but without the saving lives bit.
I bloody love your videos! Made my Friday!
Eutrophication is a big Problem too
"As Richard Feynman said :

In a Buddhist temple in Honolulu, the man in charge explained a little bit about the Buddhist religion for tourists, and then ended his talk by telling them he had something to say to them that they would never forget — and I have never forgotten it. It was a proverb of the Buddhist religion:

“To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key opens the gates of hell.”

What, then, is the value of the key to heaven? It is true that if we lack clear instructions that determine which is the gate to heaven and which the gate to hell, the key may be a dangerous object to use, but it obviously has value. How can we enter heaven without it?"
"I thought it was one of the rationalistic aspects of Buddhism that it rejects the concepts of heaven and hell as figments of imagination, hell being on earth anyway and paradise would be non-existence?"
"Woooa man the ending was superbe. Freat work man.

Hope you will achieve whaterver is your objective"
"So haber being a German patriot helped his country in the war. And then ironically his country repaid him with the holocaust.

The older I grow, the more I realize religion and patriotism can turn good people into bad. The only allegiance should be towards morality, humanity, fairness and justice."
Always love the presentation of this channel. Especially at the end when he explains how science is caught in a dilemma to move forward and also to retrain itself.

"Why see him as irrelevant when he didn’t oversee the usage of Zyklon-B in concentration camps. Arguably he had done what was right. The only negative thing aside from his invention leading to the creation of ZB is his chemicals being used during the 1st World War, but they were used majorly on combatants, and any usage on civilians was accidental. Trying to say “Someone would’ve done it anyways” is the most negative and lazy thing to sum up his story."
A NET positive
"Haber should have known, that to achieve the Haber-Bosch process, he has to work together with a man called Bosch."

"In the end, Haber did more good than harm."

@Fabian Huber yeah cause America could never commit a war crime

Your animation style reminds me a lot of The Armchair Historian I'm pretty sure it could be the same exact style.
He knew in the grand calculus of the multiverse their sacrifice means far more than their deaths.
"Every time I watch your videos I question myself ""how that information is not going to mainstream?"". It would be nice to have a portuguese subtitles."
"20:11 Also this presumes that your ideas of what is ""good for humanity"" is the same as the scientists' ideas. You could give that instruction to the Nazi scientists who used Zyklon B in gas chambers and those who bought into the Nazi ideology would consider the Holocaust to be good for humanity"
Et n'oubliez pas d'e-penser!
"The ending reminded me of Teslas quote we„may live to see man made horrors beyond our comprehension“. Its has a similar philosophical background, as to how use our knowledge and inventions for good and for humanity, instead of death and destruction."
"This video was fascinating, but the conclusion seemed intellectually lazy. Disregarding Haber as “irrelevant because someone else would have invented the same things” could be applied to any inventor in history. Haber did a lot of good and a lot of bad. It’s okay to stay in that tension and resist the urge to put him in a “good” or “bad” box or dismiss him altogether. Humans are never that simple."
"Funny this comes up, right as countries across Europe and Asia are shutting down fertilizer production."
Scientists really do have tragic lives
"Bit off-topic but... The old US island-claiming law reminds me of another old law that is still in effect to this day. I heard somewhere that there's an old Danish law that says that if the sea freezes over and a Dane sees a Swede crossing the sea towards Denmark, they're legally allowed to beat them to death with sticks. I went to verify with an actual Danish person I know and they corrected me... they're also allowed to use muzzle-loaded firearms (like muskets). TMYK I guess xD"
"Like any other invention, it brings power. And power without wisdom is dangerous. We should be really asking ourselves how to be more wise in managing these almost Godlike powers."
"That someone else might do a thing does not obviate the responsibility of, or credit to, the person that did the thing.
Haber was not a hero or a villain, he was both. We tend to view things in black or white and as zero sum. Life isn't like that."
"The Haber Bosch process to create fertilizer may in time be humanity's greatest mistake by vastly expanding our ability to impact our environment detrimentally. Zyklon B and explosives were intentional creations, environmental impacts are unintentional and potentially far more devastating. Failing to observe this and hailing fertilizer as 'good' is a curious bias by omission. To answer the last question posed....it's called 'the precautionary principle', and perhaps we should try it."
"yeah, double-edged sword, but he WILLINGLY did his job for destroying people lives.
that's why he's a crazy sh**ty pesron, who accidently was first that invented ""haber process"""
"Regardless, I am still grateful that he invented the process at that time and not years or decades later. saying he is irrelevant is like saying your life is irrelevant cause other sets of humans could be alive instead of the one we have now."
"he obviously was a villain cause he used it in his patriotic stupidity to gas enemy troops. so i dont really understand why u made that argument at the end of the video?? some of the things uve said obviously were right.. and u made a lot of videos about similiar things, so i give u the benefit of the doubt that u mean it in a general way! but it was not AT ALL true for that guy! he was an absolut 100% villain and coldhearted massmurderer and of course his wife killed herself because of that! cause theire last argument was about him killing people! for example: if i save 1 million people... that doesnt make killing 100.000 people, cause i dont like theire skin colour okay in any way... -_- it still makes me a super-villain! if you accidently develop something that later is used to kill people we are morally talking about something totaly different but not in his case.. i wished his wife killed him and not herself, cause she seemed to be a good soul!"
"I finally understand why so many planets in Star Trek seem to have small populations and one-world governments. If you didn't discover nitrogen processing at the right point in history, your culture would end up normalizing population control and rationing.

(jk, it was just easier to write alien worlds as simplified humanity)"
"The title of this video isn't accurate, technically speaking.

His discovery didn't ""save"" billions [of lives], it ""allowed for the sustaining of future, as yet unborn"" billions [of lives]."
"„An employer Otto Hahn expressed his discomfort about this weapon.“ Funny that this is the same man, who discovered nuclear fission a few years later, which was used to build the most horrible existing weapon…"
yeah and the US became the hero of ww2 for using it 🤦‍♂
Only Thing That Stops A Bad Guy With A Gun Is A Good Guy With A Gun.
His chemical findings and scientific work are as amazing as his moral can be despicable.
"I mean, the US dropped the nuclear bomb and ended ww2 that way, they're considered the heros, not the villains. That was also his goal. He wanted to end the war. It's hard to argue with that kinda 🤔 it's difficult"
How special relativity makes magnets work ≠ The big misconception about electricity.
"Industrial fertilizers are responsible for bacteria, fungi, and nematode die off, which is a massive problem today. All Haber did was to postpone the problem ... and increase the number of people who will suffer when we eventually hit the limits of the environment. Now extra billions are going to die of starvation unless we get smart and decrease our population, and get back in balance with nature. Yeah, we may come up with another temporary ""solution,"" but ""what will be the answer to the answer, man!?"" For as smart as people are, they sure are stupid!"
Q
I wish he was never born.
Was the scientist hitler
"it's a simple answer: thought has inveted everything, thought is the acumulation of knowledge, thought also has invented the I, the self, yet thought has no place in the human psyochological realm. 99% of humans identify with this I, the ego, the image of oneself, the nation etc., and this form of identification is based on a fiction: thought sees it's own impermanence and out of fear seeks security and hence the inventions of weapons. if a clear mind would see the utter stupidity that security is not killing, there would be the begining of intelligence, love and compassion"
carbon footprint is a hoax created by big oil industries to make you feel responsible of what they are doing.

"Hold up, that element breakdown for the human body is literally impossible..... isn't it?
Human body: ~60% water
Water molecule: 66% hydrogen
50kg human = 30kg water = 20kg hydrogen and 10kg oxygen. 

For the human body to even be primarily oxygen, you would need at least 10kg to be pure oxygen, making pure O2 20%+ of the human body?
This is just to make oxygen the majority, if we look at this pie chart at 2:56 it shows oxygen as ~60%.

What am i missing?"
"@Vendelín Lužbeták I knew i was doing something stupid, but you won't learn if you don't ask. Thanks!"
Oxygen atom has almost 16 times the mass of hydrogen atom.
"It's ironic that people even choose to receive a Nobel prize in the first place, Alfred Nobel was the inventor of nitroglycerin, which was used in dynamite and killed many people. It was only after false news of his death spread that he saw what others thought of him through newspaper obitruaries, realizing the horrors of his invention which drove him to try to clear his name. The same goes for a lot of scientific discoveries, but why do we blame the people who worked hard to bring these discoveries into fruition instead of those who choose to use them for malicious purposes? Of course Haber wasn't right to push for the mass production of explosives and chlorine gas but it wasn't his fault there was a war in the first place, plus patriotism tends to blind people from their morals. I like what Derek says about the fact that most discoveries are double edged swords, even the water that gives you life can drown you."
"geology: a new island is formed when a volcano erupts
birds: are you sure about that?"
"Not us! We just go straight to spraying the soil with just the chemical nitrogen, which is definitely super good for the soil. Its a good thing we all play along with the corrupt bankers instead of living off the land like sane people. Nope we traded our sovereignty for... safety?"
"The moral argument against him does not stem from what he invented, he only made a tool
It comes from his intent, he intentionally made chemical weapons to directly kill people, with fully knowing how horrible they ar and that they should be banned
And no other scientists doing it does not exempt him from the moral responsibility"
12:02 yep they blew us up
"what i've noticed is we put too much weight on the first discoverer of the idea  when too often than not they are usually the one we decided to credit for the process and not the first person to have the idea.  At the end of the day, there would have been different scientist to discover that method of making fertilizer."
Lies God does this through his son. Does it through the wind rains and Earth and atmosphere. Everything circulates.  Scientists have always been silenced.
Bittersweet fits him well
Awesome Informative video! 👍🏻👍🏻
Not a villain. Just a man facing harsh circumstances.
Innumerable human lives could also be saved if the powers-that-be gave a war and nobody came to fight it for them.
"Not government, thats for shure."
"in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, there is a scene where John Galt's captors don't know how to fix the device they are using to torture him, and so Galt must tell them how to fix it. It seems pretty contrived but reminds me of the use of Zyklon B, a chemical created by an ethnic jew, to perpetrate the holocaust."
wow
Solar power + wind power being used in processes for carbon scrubbing might be part of the way..
Why can't we just make more lightning
"Didn’t think you guys would top the lead poisoning video so soon, happy to be proven wrong. Some of the best content on this platform, feels illegal to watch this for free. Absolutely incredible work to the animators, editors, writers, and everyone else who puts work into these <3"
"His heart was in the right place, but he was blinded by patriotism. No country is worth inventing deadly weapons to."
What an excellent video! Thank you!
"wait, i just watched a history lesson and liked it"
"20:17 What is this all about? Right now you are going off on a tangent that has little to nothing to do with Fritz Haber.
Haber was the one who invented the process to create ammonium nitrate fertilizer and later used it to create explosives. He was the man who took it upon himself to become the chief inventor of chemichal weapons in Germany. This is not a case where some piece of highly beneficial knowledge found by one scientist ended up beeing used for violence down the line. Fritz Haber did all of that himself. It is around here that you should have brought up his most famous quote:

*During peace time a scientist belongs to the World, but during war time he belongs to his country.*
_-Fritz Haber_"
"He didn't 'save' anyone. He made our population growth possible, not even close to the same thing. He's a villain. His wife knew it."
"@Baggerbegger it wasn't an invention, it was a discovery. And as mentioned in the video, and as is the case for discoveries generally, someone else would have discovered it. He saw how poorly chemical weapons we're working and designed a much better one. One that caused a horrific death to many in the first World War. His process was later used to perpetrate the holocaust. Would be ironic, seeing as how he was jewish, if it weren't so horrible. One of his coworkers had the moral fortitude to speak up. But he did not. Remember that poem that starts off with, first they came for the Communist but I said nothing because I wasn't a communist.. kind of sums all this up. And as for making population growth possible, millions of people starve to death today while we produce excess food. His Discovery does not get credit for saving people, though it did make larger populations possible."
He saved lots of people who would have died early without his invention. Growth pf population comes on top
"The message of this video is: Don't be a patriot, just be a human being."
wait i thought it was an attack on titan joke
"What he thought is it will stop war faster, that's a wrong notion at that time. Scientists make the things for good reason, but they will turn into bad."
"I mean, the nuclear bomb definitely stopped ww2 faster, and the US is considered the hero of that war. He wanted to achieve the same."
"ahhhh yes I know where this is going. Great vid bud, thanks."
"14:44 it’s funny because it was initially Otto Hahns discovery that lead to the invention of the Atomic Bomb

(Yes he opposed the atomic bomb, but still pretty ironic haha)"
Love your channel.
What I take from this entire video is “people”
"The title looks like something a marvel super villain would say, “saving billions by sacrificing millions”"
"Saying that we cannot feed 8 billion people without the Haber-Bosch prozess is just false. Stop feeding so much cattle and consuming so much  meat that it gives us cancer, stop using corn to produce ""green""fuel, and tadaa, you can feed everyone quite well with a balanced diet AND a normal sustainable farming system"
"@Baggerbegger my point is : you can feed  everyone on this planet and even more WITHOUT the Haber-Bosch process

Than we can discuss other points separately if you want

I'm convinced that we can reorganise production and the whole society to feed 8 billion AND live a simple but comfortabel life without fosil fuel. We have come a long way in the last two centuries, science, efficiency, democracy... we just have to come out of our teenage years and learn moderation"
"You say the blast could be heard hundreds of kilometers away. How much is that in REAL units of measurement, i.e. Miles?"
@Candice Joergan That didn't sound very abstract to me
"@CodeKillerz A real unit of measurement is what real citizens of the United States of America have used for years. I don't consider any person who uses anything other than the Imperial System of Measurement (feet, inches, pounds, etc.) to be a true American. Simple as that."
"@Candice Joergan What is a real unit of measurement-- you know, in the abstract?"
@CodeKillerz Read what I wrote. Miles. Any other unit of measurement is inferior.
What is a real unit of measurement?
Ah so the inventor of chlorine gas didn’t like Nazi’s and resigned out of solidarity. Interesting
"If it was in 1918, why does the sign say 1919?"

"The idea that someone else would have invented it I think is a terrible argument. Everything has improvements and reimaginations, only the initial and major leaps should be recognized. He achieved those and should be recognized and honored. He had noble intentions with most of his inventions and the good overwhelming outweighs the negative. We don't blame the inventor of the TV for 16 and pregnant. He didn't know what people would do with his creation"
SABATON - The Attack of the Dead Men
"Wow, this video was something else..."
This is so close to RadioLab’s podcast “the Bad Show”
"Typhus was hard to control back then, as lice, rodents could detect the smell of the pesticides, therefore it had to be removed to be more effective. Zyklon b did somewhat help. Typhus epidemic hasd a death rate of 50%, it probably caused millions of deaths of as it was amplifed by the war."
"Hypocrites. The left is nothing, but hypocrites."
"Science is neither evil, nor good. He developed a gift that helped feed millions, used that tech to support his homeland and kill thousands through the most horrid means, and in the end died before seeing his own creation repurposed to kill millions of people he knew were innocent. Call him evil if you wish, but to be completely honest I feel like he already had his punnishment."
"Why do people who do not practice the Jewish religion still place so much importance on being Jewish? Most everyone is appalled by white supremacy, but honestly I get the same kind of impression from the way some Jewish people mention it so often."
"A lot of new tech comes from the desperate need to win a war that later leads to good inventions as well. Sometimes it goes the other way, originally he did this invention to solve the problem with lack of fertilizer then war comes to his country he obviously wanted to fight for his country the best way he found possible, he didn't start war, although maybe a bit heartless weapon inventions..."
"When I started watching your video, thought I was watching some netflix documentary, hats off ,, for this wonderful video.."
"So basically nazis didn't kill the Jews, birds did with their poop"
Thank you once again for an amazing video!!!!!
"Derek showed us the answers of questions, which suffer us before sleeping. Thank you, Derek, for interesting and cool video!!!"
"Derek, I can't agree with your conclusion as it just ignores the fact that behind scientists' choices of what to research (and what gets funded for that matter), there is a historical structure of colonialism which exterminated millions of people because of the greed and lust for power of white european men. Behind the choice to use extensive agriculture allied with fertilizers and pesticides (green revolution), there is the extermination of millenary indigenous cultures, practises and environment. There is no such thing as neutrality as the way we see concepts like nature, progress and evolution shapes the world around us."

Having RULES in WAR makes absolutely no sense. If you're AT WAR are you really gonna make decisions based on the idea that your enemy will honor those rules? If you're wrong it could cost EVERYTHING. There are NO RULES. ELIMINATE THE ENEMY.
"This is true with two great powers are at war, but most wars aren't great powers fighting. The way you should think of them isn't like laws, there more like playground rules. You won't be punished when you break them but the other players will hate you. This becomes very important when is comes to the biggest challenge in war, logistics. Keeping people feed and moving is difficult as a small nation. You need some allies to support your goals. 

The other reason it that there is a time after the war. People will remember the crimes committed and will judge you accordingly, as a small or new government this will be a challenge, you need the support of the people. 

War crimes are really nothing more than politics and they can really matter, sometimes they are what decides if you win or loss a war."

"A carbon footprint ad? Are you kidding me??? The ""carbon footprint"" was a media stunt created by BP Oil to distract tree huggers and global warming activists"
"I could imagine him seeing his work intended to save, being used to kill, and deciding there's no point in avoiding it.  Somewhere deep, deep down, I imagine he too was disappointed in the death his discovery caused."
"Loved this video. I remember my chemistry professor in college teaching me about Fritz Haber and the Haber-Bosch process, as well as the dark side to his life as a scientist. Thank you for making videos like this."

You are a master of story telling. Thank you!
"Thank you for recognizing that science advances without the individual scientist.

JFC…. There’s no hero or villain here… This is nothing more than an Unbelievably sad tale of human tragedy
It is dishonest not to say that the French were the first to use gas
"Yes, I think it's unfair that Haber got the reputation he did when all sides were equally as bad as each other in that regard
It's strange that Richard Feynman and his colleagues on the Manhattan project don't suffer from the same damaged reputation as Haber, despite them producing the Atom bomb which  killed civilians (up to 215,000 died in those bombs), and Feynman himself regretted this"
The video hasn't started yet and saving the earth basically has to be a huge lie.
Haber: now lets make some bombs out of this soil fertiliser shall we?
Veritasium is supposed to be about truth. The Zyklon B = holocaust connection is not factual.
It seems to be
Make a video on James Webb telescope
"He's absolutly a hero. It's hard to overstate just how important amonium nitrate is.

As far as the gas is concerned, do you hate people that invent bombs? Rifles? Pretty sure the guy who made the standard firearm of a side in WW1 ""killed"" more people than Haber. Strange argument to begin with, did Nobel kill everyone that ever died through dynamite?"
14:50  U.S. had same attitude at the end  of world war 2....they also killed people and many still suffering...they also did it in the name of peace
I love science and history!
why is the human such a brutal species?
"So like, we uh produce a lot of nitrogen the same way that birds do. Artificial fertilizers are still leading to soil depletion.

But still, this is pretty cool. It's a shame that nitrogen makes great explosives.

This guy isn't tragic. He's a criminal."
"Really wasn’t expecting this to be a veritasium video, need more content like this"
"There was a fantastic book about him whose name currently escape me. I think it's ""Earth from air"" or something similar."
Damn! Humans and their experience on this Earth!
"i constantly go back to what spock said: ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" killing millions to save billions seems fine, unless those millions were killed in horrible torturous conditions then of course thats not ok at all. not that murder is really ever ok lol. i do hate when we mess with dangerous stuff to try and make humanity better. i dont think anything deadly can really be helpful. i mean yes to learn about it so we dont hurt ourselves is fine but to actually work with it to make it not deadly is so dangerous to do."
Cool Guy
The title seems so click bait lol but then you watch the vid and it is not at all click bait lmao.
"Somebody else would have solved the nitrogen problem eventually. 

To knowingly develop weapons that killed in such appalling ways requires a total lack of empathy. He cannot of been other than a complete sociopath - which goes a long way to explaining his wife's suicide."
"war is war. is there any honour in killing others? both sides were experimenting with gas, Haber is no different than anyone else fighting that war, and certainly he's better than those who targeted civilians in attacks in WW2, Nanking, Vietnam, Syria, Ukraine etc. etc."
"Is it really accurate to describe Haber's legacy as ""tragic""? To me, that would be more apt if he had nothing to do with his creations being used for the awful wars they were used for, but if anything, he actively worked to ENSURE that they would be. Feels like tragic is a bad descriptor here and takes agency away from his bad decisions."

This video was fifteen minutes longer than it needed to be
fantastic video
"Whenever I teach the unit on ethics of science and scientists I always love using Haber as a subject of debate, he is such an excellent case study to deep dive into."
"The Manhatten Project would definitely provoke productive discussion, though probably from quite a different direction, and even that assertion - there are some cases where the mortality is easy to identify - becomes a case for introspection. *Why* might we feel there is an objective delineation between the two? All excellent"
"Nah, the Manhattan project's sole purpose was as a weapon of war. Nuclear power is uncommon so yeah."
What about the Manhatten project
"@Truer words have never been spoken, My Princess! And this is exactly why he's such a good case study for this kind of ethics discussion, the point you make - you should not be responsible for an immoral application of a well intentioned discovery - is the perfect point to interrogate, and regularly broached by the students. It's a great jump off point when starting to discuss the responsibility of the scientific community and where individual researchers lie in that, personally, politically and globally. It's all fascinating to discuss."
"It's not his fault that people forced his invention into weapons. He wanted to make more food so people wouldn't starve, this man is a hero"

He has
"It's controversial whether he should be labeled as a hero or a villain, but why label him? Volunteering to research military weapons is bad, but the intention of helping his country is good. So there's the facts: you should not help in war, but help all people globally in non-violent acts. And checking out the sponsor of this video is actually a great way as it shows you what can be done to reduce your carbon footprint.
I'm not paid to promote his sponsor, I just want to stimulate the readers of this comment to help everyone."

Science is not biased...
"@levk What would ""Science is not the way I want it to be"" mean?

In my mind, science is not a discrete noun that can either be biased or unbiased. Science is a *process* that is conducted by humans-- humans who invariably inject bias into their methods of reasoning. 

It seems impossible for this process to be totally unbiased, but that doesn't mean it's not the best thing we have, and I stand by results that proceed from its principles."

"@Bart Zuidgeest I wasn't giving him PRAISE.  I do think it is important that people like Oppenheimer and Fritz aren't swept under the rug though.  Since they developed things that STILL hold Existential Risk to our species - yeah... it's important that we understand their work and what lead them to that work in the first place - right?  How else are we to learn or develop better, less catastrophic ways of acting in the world and dealing with problems?"
"@Bart Zuidgeest Yeah, but you said someone else would've found out his process anyways, so he doesn't deserve his merits? I agree what he did is horrible but his good generally outweighs the bad."

"Stories like this really make me feel like human beings are a mistake, just too much collateral damage inflicted to our own existence by virtue of our mere existence.  It seems inevitable that any true story involving human beings will only have a tragic ending, every time."
17:23  Modern translation for all you young viewers:  He trippin' n I am sad frfr.
"Criminalizing someone is usually in the hands of those who have a louder voice. In this regard, Einstein could be held responsible for the A-bombs dropped on Japan and the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people. But, why isnt he held responsible for that? Well, because the media is under control of whoever used the A-bomb and won the World War and imposed its hegemony all over the world, controlling economies, media, policies of most countries in the world, either via the stick or the carrot."
That's a pretty heavy Epilogue...
"I just read Wikipedia Fritz Haber. Cause I find your documentary to confusing and taking too much time, clickbait and storytelling to just tell what he is and what happened and why. Why so complicated when it’s possible to educate people easier?"
Mustard gas also became an early cancer treatment.
the Haber process
i feel like i just watched a video about this topic lol
"Not evil nor good, just the first to be correct. Yeah, he could have stopped and make the moral decision to only use it for beneficial purposes but as Derek says at the end of the video, someone else would have simply used it for evil anyway."
"But mustard gas was also used in WW1... And it's arguable worse. Mainly because:
1. To protect yourself against mustard gas you need full NBC protection. Not just a gasmask.
2. It solidifies at 13C, sticks to surfaces, is transparent (invisible), lingers around - potentially for weeks. These properties makes it very easy to carry it with you on your clothes.
3. It is cytotoxic.
4. It the perfect war gas because it does not outright kill, it makes people incredibly ill - large exposure kills after a couple of days - this puts pressure on the war hospitals and soldiers who need to transport their fellow men.

All in all, it's just worse. And because it's worse, it was used more. GO HUMANITY. YAY"
Ozymandias
Well not many hate Einstein so why hate this guy?
"I am indifferent to Haber personally. My carbon emissions? Hey, I use public transport on a daily basis to commute to work. I also drive an electric car. At the same time, I realize that in order for the car to be actually better for the environment, I must make at least 160 thousand kilometers on it, because of the environmental impact during its production. Based on my driving, it will take another 14 years (I own the car from new, it is 2 years old). I do not have an AC in ma flat, even though I suffer 31°C temperatures in my flat during these heat waves. Which give me sleepless nights. I separate all my trash. I do not buy a new phone when a new model comes out. On the contrary, I use it until it breaks. My computer is from 2014 (desktop system) and although I was about to upgrade it, I did not do so. It was not the most powerful back then and today it is obsolete, but still it manages to do what I need of it, even though one game has low FPS). What I dress is being frowned upon by peers, I am not ""modern"". That does not mean I wear dirty things, nor that I smell bad. I take regular showers, although not every day (OK, now in summer it is more often than in winter). I try to save water. I was myself in cold water. Not because I do not have warm water running (I do), but because I want to save energy. I am still privileged to live in a developed country in central Europe. I am not feeling bad about myself, even though I have a feeling that I consume more energy than the average human being. But I am still aware there are millions of humans whose impact on this planet is even worse. I would never want an SUV. I have a little city car and that is only because of my own comfort and laziness. I am guilty. I know. But I do not feel bad. I forgive myself. I grew up in a society, a culture, which was build around ""plenty"". At least my ancestors did not colonize and conquer other, less lucky people. In fact, they were serfs and only wanted to be free, to live on their land and provide for themselves, not exploiting others. We were being viewed as ""lesser"" people by Nazis. We still are viewed as poor 2nd class Europeans in the minds of ""the west"". I remain indifferent towards this observation. Because human history has always been about ""us"" vs. ""them"". The narrative is deeply rooted in our very species. But not only in ours. There are other species capable of what we call Holocaust. They just do not have the knowledge, science, technology, resources to utilize it. Practically all life is a ""disease"". What is its purpose? To survive? To thrive? BS. The only ""purpose"" (if you want to call it that) is to accelerate the disorder of the universe. All our energy basically exists because there is this energy potential, or difference, that we can tap into. And life has found ever and ever better means of how to do it, to get an evolutionary advantage. It is absolutely natural that we exploit the resources we have at our disposal. Every other living creature would do the same, if it had science, technology, resources. We are inherently flawed. And so am I, just one member of this great set of people. But! I am an evolutionary dead end. I will not reproduce. But at least I will use up a significant amount of resources on this planet, because I am quite lazy and want to live in comfort. Not it a cave. It is not that I do not want to reproduce, but finding the proper mate has been unsuccessful over more than two decades. And now I am too old. And cynical. And maybe that is for the best. Here, world, have me. The unwanted man, existing as a parasite of life. Or better would be the nowhere man. Making all my nowhere plans for nobody. Writing this comment for nobody. I do not expect anyone to read this far. Heck, I do not expect this comment to be actually displayed to anyone other than me, when I am logged on. Because of hidden censorship on YT that I have witnessed much too often. Why bother with pressing keys with my fingers....? Hmmm. To waste even more energy? To add to the increase of the entropy of the universe by a tiny amount? At the same time, I feel no existential dread. On the contrary. I feel free. Free. At the cost of being alone and lonely. My freedom is my ultimate prison where I remain isolated from society. I am worthless. Everyone is. Nothing matters. There is no free will. Superdeterinism remains wrong though. And even if, knowing the final answer to a thousand of years old question does not change the reality. People believe in so many stupid things. Which brings us nicely to their ignorance of their own impact. Because it is natural. It is expected to abuse everything we discover, just to put our existence into more danger, even though we achieve some temporarily advantages. I do not feel depressed. Nor happy. Nor euphoric. Just acceptance. We are what we are. At least we managed to find out so many things. Amazing things. After all those dark times, ruined by superstition, religion and fallacies. Yet we still are as we were. Stupid apes with oversized brains who think too much of themselves. But other apes are orders of magnitude stupider than we are, so... So watch out. There is way much more of here on the planet than you. What a ""nice"" observation. Right?"
I'd argue that even the first invention was bad. Mono cultures destabilise complete systems. Producing more and more people could lead to a disaster
Had the best chemist alive on their side and still lost the war 🤣 also well deserved that no one showed up to his celebration how do you go from trying to save the world by inventing fertilizer to exclusively inventing weapons of destruction and horrific ones at that.
"This is a tough one.  There are a LOT of patriots to any country.  They honestly believe they are doing the right thing and trust their government for better or worse.  It's no different today.  I don't know that I can see him as a villain in that regard.  I'd need to get inside his head to make that kind of a judgment more accurately, and even then it'd still be questionable.  I hate looking for the worst in people.

On the other hand, how often has, ""for the greater good"" been used, even with integrity, to the actual greater good?  In the long run though, his discoveries did actually serve the greater good.  His life seems like something from a Greek tragedy to me.  It leaves me with a lot of mixed feelings."
Eh you could argue the billions we have are causing a serious problem that threatens our entire civilization....
"So not only did he make weapons for Nazis to destroy lives on the ""small"" scale he also contributed to the massive overpopulation that will eventually destroy the planet.  Nice man."
"Derek, you are truly truly among the few who contribute immeasurably to the internet.  You are educating the planet and making us think critically.  Thank you thank you for engaging so many minds and inspiring so many."

Watch Veritasium: A story of YouTube propaganda by Tom Nicholas.
Id love an Oppenheimer Video
I was pretty scared I knew this guy before even this video….
Really well done. Definitely gives one something to think about.
"It's not the chemistry that is evil or good, but how it is applied by others (usually) that makes it appear so. Haber was a bit of both, he needed to work out processes for an application (nitrogen fixation for fertilisers) but also applied the knowledge gained from that to make chemical weapons in WW1, and indirectly a major tool used in the holocaust in WW2. I'm still unsure how he personally felt about all of this, either from 1st or 2nd hand sources"
I see nothing wrong with what Haber did. He was a patriot for his country. No one calls the scientist who worked on the Manhattan project evil even though over 100k people were killed at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. This man saved way more lives with his invention than he took with his other. If he is considered bad or evil so should Einstein and Enrico Fermi.
HIstory channel who???
"You could consider a video on the risks of a solar flare to our power grid.  Apparently, the risk is enormous and could be fairly easily prevented (if we focused on it.)  Bret Weinstein did a talk on Triggernometry where he talked about the risk to nuclear reactors if the power grid was shut down by a solar flare."
This intro: WOW.
"I'd say he's neither a villain, nor a hero. He's a human. None of us are fully good and fully bad, that's not possible. Even the most horrible people had at least some good qualities and even the best of us have done terrible things. ""Good"" or ""Bad"" is not a binary thing, it's not black and white, it's a grayscale that moves from one to the other side."
"gotta take away greed. never going to happen under capitalism. need unlimited food and shelter. as long as people have a want for something they will resort back to the ""every man for themselves"" mentality. it's like brining food to class. it's not an issue for you, because you have food, but it creates a problem because now you're the only one in the class with food. not sharing makes you the villain. people are petty and jealous. you need to have enough to share with everyone, or things can get nasty. as much as people have been brainwashed to hate communism, it really is the only way to live in peace. you can have a classroom filled with unhappy people and a king who gets to enjoy his food while everyone else starves, or you can have a room full of equals where everyone gets to eat and everyone is content. people naturally seek out communism, but they have been brainwashed by people who want to exploit them under capitalism, by making the word communism feel dirty. the root of communism is community. community is everywhere around you. community centers, community workers, community programs. humans want community. to help each other, rather than fight each other. greed wants capitalism. people like the idea of capitalism so they support it thinking it will make them rich, but only 1% of the population will actually be able to enjoy the benefits of capitalism. mostly because of gatekeeping from the wealthy people who make the rules that keep them rich and keep the poor poor so they can keep their imaginary power. the rest have to sit there without food and watch the one kid in the class eat. the problem with communism, is it means that everyone also has to do their share of the work, and humans aren't just greedy and petty, but also lazy, which is why capitalism works. it allows those who want more and who are willing to work for it to obtain it. so maybe laziness is really to blame. if people weren't so lazy we wouldn't need capitalism, because work still needs to be done if anyone wants to eat. chicken > egg > chicken > egg > chicken > egg"
What a horrible man. To think he made it possible for so many humans to exist. At least he tried to fix his mistake in the army but millions is not billions. smh.
A moment of silence for those who died in the poop wars
Thank you for showing me this. Ive never knew this  but now i do and im thankful.  I would say its good that he lived even though he took lives.

@Jeff Morris I learned something in this video. ☺️
"@Fabian Huber The point is, everybody already knows technology is neutral.  Complaining about it doesn't help.  Neither does ""having a conversation"".  All it does is breed nihilism and negativity.

"and if you don't have a solution, you can't voice it."
"The real question as you put it, is what makes any of us think we're in control of anything let alone the Natural World of all things."
"I just rewatched Genius season one last week and this video came out, perfect timing."
"If he is a villain, the one who invented gunpoweder is the darklord. Still kills thousands each year, and hundreds are just shoping or attending school then a psycho path pulls the trigger."
"Since sooner or later most things get discovered it doesn't matter much who does it, take for example nuclear weapons, they could help redirect an incoming meteor"
This is the dilemma scientists and researchers face constantly. Alot of them just want to make the world a better place. Sometimes though they are forced to research or develop something that goes against their own ethics/beliefs.
"I'm not sure if its Foucault or someone else who said ""when you invent the plane... you invent the plane crash...""  it always stayed with me..."

"Wow, unbelievable video! Thank you."
Let's do some on Indian scientists.
"This story reminds me of Wernher Von Braun. A brilliant scientist who designed the spacecraft that would eventually land people on the moon and so much more than that, basiclly kick starting NASA with the help from Walt Disney.
But he also created the first ballistic missle for the nazi's during world war 2, the V2 killed thousands, if not millions and made the precursor to today's intercontinental ballistic missile. When the first V2 hit london Von Braun said, ""The rocket worked perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet.""

Good and Bad, but when it comes to mathematics, Negative always beat Positiv."
Imaginary wins
I’m a chemistry professor and I got extremely excited to see this video. Thank you for telling this complex story
"""Science and Technology have improved our lives immeasurably"" Are you sure about that? Is it so bad to live life with nature and a little less comfort/convenience?"
"You either die as a hero, or life long enough to see yourself become a villain"
goosebumps
Science really is a genie in a lamp. It is not good or evil it's merely an extension to the will of those who wield it.
Can someone tell me the name of that Opera playing when haber created ammonia
"What you said at the end about looking at Haber as insignificant because someone else would have just harnessed nitrogen from the air or created the chemical weapons makes me think about a lot of the “heroes” and “villains” of history. We know Christopher Columbus was brutal to the natives when he arrived and caused their death through disease, but without Columbus the new world would have just been explored by someone else causing the same result"
"Great Video Derek.
I think Haber was not a bad man because he fought the war. He didn't cause the war, he only fought it(figuratively). He was a soldier (again, figuratively). 
His case is not too dissimilar to Oppenheimer's, yet Oppenheimer is regarded as a hero and Haber as a villain, despite the fact that Haber's discovery had a far bigger positive impact on humanity."
His a hero in my eyes
why shun Haber & not the scientists of Manhattan project?
Why it seems like that I have seen this video a long time ago
Netflix level quality no big deal
Artificial intelligence is the last thing mankind will ever invent.
"If there was ever a first-rate example of the universe being a prick, Haber’s laboratory developing Zyklon-B a decade after his death is near the top of the list."
"I really thought, you were not being serious, when you started talking about the bird poop 💩"
Carbon offsets are a SCAM.
"Point To Be Noticed: These People Call Themselves Civilized, The Protector of Man Kind but in Reality they are the murders the most terrible people in the World, they used chemical Weapons, Nuclear Weapons, Colonization on the Rest of the World and now they are accusing other of their own action...🤐"
Some plants sequester nitrogen from the air
So he is responsible for overpopulation which in term could lead to the total extinction of human kind.
"""So, the real question is, how do we keep increasing our knowledge and control of the natural world without destroying ourselves and everything else on our planet in the process?""
Two options.
1. Sufficiently protect this information from those who would seek to abuse it, or convince those who would seek to abuse it, not to.
2. You don't."
I'm gonna watch this every time I feel like a failure in life
Maybe we could call this the Haber Effect and use it as a lesson of caution for Bio Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.
"Werner Von Braun, similarly exemplified the very best & worst of hummanity."
"Derek Muller, millions thanks for mentioning My country Perú ❤️🤍❤️"
"I actually find it funny, the restrictions on war."
Its a sacrifice I’m willing to make
Earth's atmosphere is about 80% nitrogen you would think everything could just find a way to get all the nitrogen they want or need from the air alone....I'm sure I'll find out why not if I keep watching 😉
By understanding that control is a myth.
"While watching this video I was thinking ""I NEED those magnets to teach about bonds and atom interactions"". And BTW, this reminded me of that recent Vsauce video saying how people used to look older."
@Veritasium Thank you!! They will be very useful for my physics and chemistry classes
Snatoms - I created them some years ago. You can find on Amazon or DFTBA (best for US) or Snatoms.com for international
"I knew all this and more but that amounts to nothing, in today's world money is the only worth of ppl, so Mr. Haber maybe did it bevit made him money, and gave him status, his cunny wife died pining for those things"
I think we should regard him as a human and nothing more
"As a person who studied chemistry, this scientist should be scorned.

He made his name using high pressure osmium catalyzed ammonia production. This gave him clout and promotions, which inevitably allowed him to use his knowledge to make money by making unethical weapons.

Not a hero. First pride, then money were his reimbursements. Not a fan.

Good video though."
Recommed Vsauce video on Alfred Nobel the merchant of death.
Indian farmers uses Cow dung for the same purpose on their farm land.
What a ghoul.
"He was a good scientist not so much a good person, although its hard to be a good person!"
"Although Wren has pure intentions, indiduval actions will NEVER solve climate change, not when 100 companies are responsible for 71% of fossil fuel emissions. The most we can do is activism, going vegan or forgoing plastic straws will hardly have _any_ effect on saving our planet!"
I would love to see a systemic solution. One of the things Wren invests in is lobbying for policy change.
She sounds ungrateful. Was probably her choice to marry him.

Me 10 seconds later: this introduction really sounds like the inventor of the dynamite, but that was nobel so I'm confused.
Tl;dr: just watch the video instead of guessing

Edit:mid video me now. Well what would you know I was right. Wrong war and wrong order but whatever"
"While the invention of artificial fertilizer was ground-breaking, I still believe that anyone who uses chemical weapons or designs them is evil. It's one of the worst deaths out there, much better to just take a bullet to the head on the battlefield than be caught in a gas attack"
I gotta say I absolutely love these old inventions deep dive videos.

Great video Veritasium !
"Carbon offset garbage is a scam. If you want to advocate for reversing the effects of industrial pollution, you can't just plant a bunch of trees. You need to first stop the wanton pollution. Carbon offset stuff is just enforcing austerity on, and punishing, regular people–instead of the industrialists who caused the problem in the first place."
Fantastic!
"Wow! This should be shown in every school. The combination of so many subjects explained in a relatable and understandable way is extremely eyeopening. Imagine a day where you watch this video and discuss it in different classes: chemistry, history, biology, ethics, physics. You could even relate it to art with painters like Otto Dix. 
I think that's what's missing a lot at ordinary schools: A tangible well connected story, making one understand why this knowledge is important and useful.
Great work, Veritasium-Team!"
I studied this in chemistry in school
It's taught in schools. High Schools and Universities
We did learn all this historical stuff in chemistry class.
"It is, well not the video, but his achivements, good and bad, as far as I remember."
"Yes, as a year 11 I noticed how things I’ve learnt in History, Chemistry and Agriculture all tied together really nicely along with big world events like the Beirut explosion."
What a heartrending tale.  Thanks for another powerful and beautiful video.
"There is a decent book on the subject called ""the alchemy of air"""
what a hero! awesome
4:16 Does anyone know where this is?
That is Machu Picchu
"Hey, we learned about this in school (in Germany), but only the chemistry aspect"
Ace ventura pet detective Jim Carrey knew some with bat guano
"Fun fact: Crop rotation with certain cover crops and plants like green beans can prolong the fertility of soil by reintroducing nitrogen into the soil. However, doing so reduces efficiency, which is why many farmers split their farms into separate zones, farming, raising and growing a variety of crops, animals and byproducts. This diversifies their sales, increases the market value of their farms and in many cases, can even reduce the cost of running those farms, even if the labor increases and changes more regularly.

Raising cows, chickens, pigs and many other barn animals grants access to dung, guano, regular graising to reduce the chance of weed growth, and meat.

IDK y I decided to write this, I just felt like it. Please enjoy this food for thought you never asked for."
@D Landry yup :3 gotta love it
Regenerative agriculture…
The last bit of information ran through my bones ☠️
Fritz Haber was a Nazi
Great retelling and excellent concluding moral.
i'dd think that clara killed herself to show fritz what loss is so he know what his invention does to people.
this is BY FAR your most interesting subject/video for me. truly amazing topic.
"As my father would say, should you ever have to take a life, remember to do your best to make more better...

I believe our chemist here while having the order reverse deserves a pass, he clearly believed in his heart that what he was doing was right and just, he probably believed with chemical weapons he would shorten the war and thus end it sooner with less casualties overall, cruel as it was, he paid a personal price for his cruelty and so I hope at the end of his life he found peace with all that had happened."
"Clara ended her life due to severe depression, being in Germany during wartime didn't help. There's the fine line between genius (she had a PhD) and ""madness"""
"Clara Immerwahr was a very depressed woman, because her career as a chemist was over after her son was born. This is the more probable cause of her suicide."

Let's w a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his contact to entertain..❤️🙂
"I'm sorry but a bunch of plants can pump nitrogen from the air and fix it in the soil for others to use. This is one of the basic principles of permaculture. Chemistry wasn't and still isn't the solution for feeding the world, good agricultural practices taking care of the soil are."
"He was neither a hero nor a villain, he was a scientist"
"Brilliant content as allways - i hope to see more science history like this on the channel, love the context it brings. It feels almost like when i was young and watched Connections. Well done you - now i need to watch it once more!"
History and humanity are messy and complicated.
¿Scientific?
"What about the scientist that created nuclear weapons used in WWII dropped on Japanese civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Would they be regarded as heroes or villains"
"The man who killed Lincoln was a genius. Well...I don't mean that, it's just a sneaky way of preparing your battles."
very interesting topic and great video but don't do 2:48 again please
I read the scientist who killed minions…and I was happy for a second. Damn.
I actually worked at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin for a year
"""I cherish peace with all my heart. I don't care how many men, women, and children I need to kill to get it."" - Fritz Haber ca. 1915"
"So this is the man responsible for fostering overpopulation and excessive consumption.  We wouldn't be in a climate crisis now if it weren't for the population explosion, and subsequently resulting in excessive carbon production and food consumption."
It is impressive how he never took no for an answer and used his brilliance for revolutionary ideas
"Have you done one on Einstein? 

I think it’s sad how he was rejected early on and it was only later in life that he was seen as a genius 

And then I can’t imagine his horror when his theory of relativity was used as a basis to make one of the most dangerous weapon ever known to mankind"
The Weather control device ?
"@Veritasium , the only way is thru good ethics, well mannered, humane minds. Unfortunately, when something is discovered by a scientist, it easily falls into the wrong hands, usually politicians and warmongers, who are looking for profit and revenue. With a knife, one can cut meat to feed the hungry, and with the same knife one can kill an innocent human being. The difference between the two is the hand holding the knife, is it ethical and humane, or greedy and inhumane.
The only way that humanity can prosper is thru wishing and doing each other good, not having in mind that every act must have a corresponding profit. Sometimes, good must be done because we are good, not because we want anything in return."
That thumbnail reminds me of Gorogoa
"Bro turn to Jesus man I be telling y’all he loves u sm man he gave himself up for us and our sins, he paid the fine that we deserved because we broke the law (Ten commandments ) ““For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” John 3:16) ““"

Fritz Haber Did nothing wrong.
"It could also be said the explosion of the population from fertilizer was for the worse.

Letting Einstein sleep over was a bro move though."
He Derek! I've seen your last few videos ( the epic math dual; the man who killed most persons on earth) and it seems to that you are getting inspirations from COSMOS SERIES and its great! I loved that series too! And I appriciate your work for making science more interesting!🥰

I think the artist spent three days on it. Beautiful work!
"""Science and technology have improved our lives immeasurably, but they have also given us ever increasing ways to destroy ourselves."" 
Like Richard Feynman wrote “To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell.""
Science is this key, and it is up to us to decide which gate we open."
"Pick up your cross and follow Jesus! The world is quickly headed for destruction, and sooner or later you will have to sit at the judgement seat and give an account for your actions. Belief in messiah alone is not enough to grant you salvation - Matthew 7:21-23, John 3:3, John 3:36 (ESV is the best translation for John 3:36). Call on the name of Jesus and pray for Him to intervene in your life! - Revelation 3:20. 

Contemplate how the Roman Empire fulfilled the role of the beast from the sea in Revelation 13. Revelation 17 confirms that it is in fact Rome. From this we can conclude that A) Jesus is the Son of God and can predict the future or make it happen, B) The world leaders/nations/governments etc have been conspiring together for the last 3000+ years going back to Babylon and before, C) History as we know it is fake. You don't really need to speculate once you start a relationship with God tho.

Can't get a response from God? Fasting can help increase your perception and prayer can help initiate events.  God will ignore you if your prayer does not align with His purpose (James 4:3) or if you are approaching Him when ""unclean"" (Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 59:2, Micah 3:4). Stop eating food sacrificed to idols (McDonald's, Wendy's etc) stop glorifying yourself on social media or making other images of yourself (Second Commandment), stop gossiping about other people, stop watching obscene content etc and you should get a response. Have a blessed day!"

So he has a mixed reputation. His partner in science made the E=MC squared discovery that led to the Atom Bomb.
Idk why I thought of Attack On Titan when I saw this video recommended 💀
This is why I maintain a healthy biosphere on my yard with lots of bird and bat poop. EDIT: and wash my crop before eating it!
Great video. I just read the book Alchemy of Air and the video follows the facts in the book exactly.
"""from bread out of the air to bombs out of tge air. 😂😂"""
"Cyanide-based  pesticides were used to kill fleas, lice and chiggers preventing the transmission of typhus which killed tens of millions of people. People were dying in WWII German work camps where prisoners of war and opponents/enemies of the leading German political party were kept. They performed manual labor for the German war effort. Many had initially declared war on Germany in 1933. Cyanide-based pesticides were used to prevent the illness from spreading in the camps."
I love this channel. Thanks for your amazing content.
With great knowledge comes greater responsibility.
"Your comment about nitrogen depletion in soil at 3:28 has me thinking it would be interesting to see you do a video on some farming practices, maybe talk about the differences between monoculture and polyculture techniques. Just cause I'm a nerd, and I also think it would be good information to put out there as climate change continues to affect agriculture around the world. I know monoculture is the way most of the world does it, but I think techniques like regenerative farming and food forests have real merit and should get a spotlight :)"
"@Marco Ferrao The fact is that ""ecoagriculture"" has not showed the capacity to achieve similar yields in a global scale. I am pretty sure that has good things to offer now and in the future but in the present it is too much expensive for underdeveloped countries..."
"@hinenik Both crop rotation and polyculture have their issues. Crop rotation is usually done to an extent on most arable farms, but to have a system with no artificial fertiliser inputs would mean growing a lot more lower yield peas and beans and a lot less high yield cereals, overall you'd grow less food and less versatile food.

Polyculture in general suffers from one big problem, it's difficult to impossible to mechanically harvest. It works fine when 50-70% of your population can drop everything to collect the harvest by hand, but not 1-3% who use giant machines. Really the only practical solution to harvesting polyculture in the modern world is small scale agricultural robotics, but those are still decades away from widespread use."
"​@Ralphie Raccoon There are ways of fighting pest and diseases with polyculture. Let's say that you have one pest that attack just one specie (like corn), it is less likely that it will spread when you have multiple species that complement each other in a field. If you just have corns in your yard it is easier to get a huge plague than with polyculture (so less pesticides needed).

Also, there're ways in which you can contribute to add Nitrogen to the soil (there are plants that do it naturally, like some legumes), you just have to rotate the crops and make a good planification of how you want your land to be. There are even plants that can help to avoid pest, that you could plant around the field. And like that a lot more examples...

Can you feed the whole humanity with just eco-agriculture? I don't know, I don't know the topic enough, but that's a huge possibility. There are new techniques and ways in which we can handle our food, but we're usually too focused on monoculture and the industrial process of it. If we had more an more trained farmers, less food waste, and more subsidies and projects for eco-agriculture and its variants, maybe we'll be able to feed humanity.

Be as it has to be, we have already disrupted the Nitrogen cycle; desertified and destroyed usable lands and abused of ecosystems too much. It is not about IF we change or not our way of farming, it is about WHEN we do it."
"@Pablito Tio ,
The issue isn't an individual User... eco-friendly systems are better for the single user.
It is the impossibility of upscaling these systems to support billions of users, sadly.  

The systems we currently use, these synthetic systems, where the solution we found to the problem of more eco-friendly systems not 'carrying' enough population load.  As we reach the carrying capacity of synthetic solutions, we are going to need to find even more answers that allow is to expand our growing areas, produce food outside the climates  natural environments, and expand on our diets to include easier to produce food stuffs.   Think solutions such as Artificial Lights, CO2 enrichened and pressurized environments,  GMO crops and soils, as well as outside-the-box food like insect derived proteins.  

One of the sweet things to keep in mind about this 'Commercial Farming' mindset: 
Some of this technology will be down-scalable, but only invented due to the large agro-companies needing to increase carrying capacity.  I doubt grow lights would have come this far without some serious input from companies looking to increase growing capacity using indoor methods.  Other tricks will be found, just wait till we get bio-engineered bacteria to add to the soil, that can then be used by us smaller growers to better our own yields.  

It has done me wonders to begin my growing season a month early by just using grow lights and living soil...."
"It's likely impossible to achieve similar yields on a global scale without synthetic fertilizer. Even using ""natural"" alternatives like manure often rely on synthetic fertilizer to produce food for the livestock that shits it out, which allows for a greater stocking density, and therefore indirectly use synthetic fertilizer but less efficiently.

Not to say there aren't advantages to polyculture in other areas, such as pest and disease resistance, and the challenges for mechanical harvesting that hold it back. But I think in terms of nutrients, there isn't any alternative that doesn't result in more land needed to grow less food. Unless someone creates GMO wheat and maize and can fix its own nitrogen, but that's been a holy grail of agricultural science for decades, and nobody had cracked it yet."
"FYI: If you have sufficient rainfall and utilize cover crops and crop rotation, you wouldn’t need to add extra nitrogen to your soil or use polycultures or permaculture techniques to limit inputs (NPK and all your -cides) while maximizing output."
"PS: We also use peas a lot here instead, as that gives a crop and adds nitrogen to the soil, so it's a double whammy for farmers."
great work !!
"I was just telling my brother this 2 days ago! I've also pondered if a similar chain of events would unfold if clean energy becomes cheap (demand soars, we become dependent on significant quantities, leading to an overstressed grid, etc)

It may not be too far in the future either. In the 70's we were only 30 years from commercially viable fusion. Now, we've progressed to the point that today we're only 3 decades away!"

Derek you should also do one for Max planck. His life is also very tragic but very few knows about it.
That has to be false. There was no time in history when you could trade 4 pounds of fertilizer for 1 POUND of gold. 12 troy ounces! That kind of money could have bought a whole farm and a couple horses to go with.
"@Veritasium my comment keeps getting deleted because of a link I'm trying to provide to a washington post article, but that article states in 1856 the price was $50 per TON, or 2.5 ounces of gold. That makes more economic sense. No way for a farmer to turn a profit at 4 pounds for 12 ounces of gold, it's absurd just think about it."

This man's invention made it possible not only to feed humanity, but also is in great part responsible for the decreasing number of poverty in the world. The stupidity of people, in the name of a questionable enviromental agenda, is taking steps to stop the use of fertilizers (such as sri lanka). Let's not starve people  in name of a stupid ideology (not science... ideology. Science requires debate, wich enviromentalists refuse to do)."

"Fun fact, he was a friend of a fellow Jewish chemist Haim Weizmann and after fleeing Germany he proposed to Haber he should relocate to Israel to help found a science institute there. Haber agreed, but passed away before reaching the holy land. The institute was later named after Weizmann himself, and is one of the top scientific institutes in the world. There is a building named after Haber there to this day."

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't the french the first to use gas during WWI? 

Besides, it's hard to not feel the urge to help your Country during war as a patriot. Sience can achieve great things, but can also be used to advance war. Technologies can only make wars more miserable, because the most efficient ways often disregard decency and also damage the environmemt greatly. In the long run advancing war tech can only bring more suffering, as inovations spread and become the norm begetting even more necessity to adopt and counter offensives, which after a certain level can only be achieved by destroying your enemies first to the point where it becomes possibile to bring total anhilation instantly, a world with no safety. Although I think he can't be blamed for sharing his tech and helping his Country, his was a noble intent however unfortunate it might have been, if not him other would have come up with similar solutions and potentially bring the same misery against his own country, it is always a matter of preservation of the species/nation, such needs of security can't simply be fought back."

"It's weird to think that a man whose chemical weapons inventions ultimately killed millions, still saved far more lives with the ammonium nitrate process he invented."
The man did what he has to do.
What the math teacher means by making profit:
"Haber did not ""save billions."" That's like saying the Republicans would be ""saving millions"" by outlawing contraception. He developed an energetically-costly method to get ammonia from air. You can use that as fertilizer, and cheap food resulted in a population boom, but it's not a free lunch. It relies on fossil fuel energy, it's in no small part responsible for the current environmental catastrophes, and a whole lot of that fertilizer goes toward growing luxury goods for rich people while people in food-insecure countries continue to starve for lack of investment in agricultural research for the public good."
"Wow, people wanting to distance themselves from someone who eagerly developed horrifying ways to commit mass murder. How shocking.."

"@Spaceman   First: The soviets committed themselves in an earlier conference to engage in the war against Japan no later than 3 months after the surrender of Germany, if it would still go on. They did it on the date (05/08 until 08/08), so it was expected. Second: there were more options than just those two. Japan offered negotiations about surrendering, but got blocked off. Unconditional Capitulation, like  in Germanys case, isn`t the standard. 
A capitulation would have been possible without any bigger invasion.
The bomb could have also been dropped on less dense populated territories to intimidate the enemy. But the gouverment chose to attack an until then untouched cities to demonstrate their destructive power and scare off the soviets (although this cant`t be proven).
The view of ""there are only two possibilities and one of them kills less people then another probably will"", is just not enough in that situation."
"@Helios2110 you do realize that the soviets declared war after we bombed them for the first time, and we were either going to invade mainland Japan or use nuclear weapons. An invasion would just add more American deaths to an already large amount or Japanese deaths that were always guaranteed."
"@Spaceman   It didn`t, at least it`s not clear. Japan was about to surrender and the  soviet started to engage into the war a day before Nagasaki. The war probably didn`t end quicker with the bombings. It killed hundred of thousands of people instead. Nobody knows what would have happened without them, but to claim it definitely saved lifes overall is more than far fetched."
"Except that actually did save many lives, Cl gas did not"
"There is a big gap between inventing something that can be used as weapon and inventing weapon. Einstein is not responsible for development of nuclear weapon because he didn't make his theories to develop that weapon. But Haber had deliberately and wolontarely works to make weapon to kill people in very painful and nasty way. Good deeds and evil deeds don't negate each other. It's irevelant that mass murderer is perfect father and husband, he is still mass murderer. That's why Haber can't be call a hero."
"Hobber was an optimist, far more dangerous than a villain. Since humans will find a way to utilise any invention as a way to kill each other."
"""But George Washington Carvers research on legumes should have fixed the depletion of N in the soil problem...?"" The viewer may ask. First, good on you for thinking that and not thinking he invented PB... because he did not. Second and to the point... yes and no. Yes to the fact that it does help to some extent. But no, to it being a fix all solution. Crop rotation with legumes is slow and takes up space for more profitable crops. Farmers are going to go with the quicker option that is concentrated into bags.

Also his research was two years after Habers in Tuskegee in 1911-1912. Even though the Tuskegee had tolerant vibes... this still was a time in the south's history where rascism was rampant. Because of same closed minded farmers, the practice had some time to catch on.

that last little question had me stumped and i almost cried when u left it open ended  i was thinking about that the entire episode wow beautiful work
Been a while since you've released a great top tier video like this. Almost cried thinking about how awful of a story that is and your conclusion that he's neither a villain or a hero but is instead irrelevant. Powerful conclusion.

knowledge withouth wisdom is a lost cause
"I'm sorry, but to put it quite bluntly, scientists do not make or employ these inventions in a moral or social vacuum.  Every time a new weapon of mass destruction is employed, it is employed on the orders of military and/or civilian authorities who, despite their whingeing after the fact, were made very aware of the destructive power of said weapons beforehand.  Haber invented new types of poison gas, but he is not the one who knowingly and willfully unleashed it on its victims. I am not saying weapon inventors should be completely released from all responsibility, but never mistake the creator of a weapon for the people who pull its trigger."

"I find this video kinda weird. It’s like it’s trying to say that Haber was a complicated character. If he is a good or bad person is just based on your own opinion, and every opinion is valid.

And I feel like that narrative combined with the title of the video creates a weird misconception in comments. People act like Haber killed hundreds of thousands to save billions. But that is clearly not the case.

The fertilizer and his murdered’s where 2 separate choices, with no connection besides that he was able to do the murders thanks to the knowledge he gained from the fertilizer.

Just because he saved billions does not excuse the murdering of people in one of the most inhumane ways possible.

We wouldn’t tolerate a doctor who murdered people.

I get that the lesson was “Every bit of information is a double edge sword. You don’t know the outcome of your research or how it might be used” but I feel like that doesn’t fit with most of the video.

The Zyklon story seems to be the only story where you could derive that lesson from.

This is just a story of a man who did a great thing, than decided to use all of his knowledge to murder people."

"Spoiler alert, he was a scombag. It's one thing for invention to be misused by others but he committed to the naz1sm. He chose poorly.
I have tried to instill moral discipline in techies and there seems to be some winning sentiment in avoiding working for militaries, directly or indirectly. I observe that fortunately there has been relatively little progress in military tech in the last decades, even to the point of recession. Putin being a super scombag, s4tan has a bit of a field day so it's important that we choose a better way than to indulge weapons arms race and not respect putin's existence but instead eliminate him and the evil in china and north korea to have a world of peace instead. We are entering a future of such potency that there cannot be a putin or anything close. AI will have power in excess of nuclear weapons, able to end the world faster than the speed of light which is not long in human reaction time scales. The world seems to have nice potential for peace if only supernitwit putin was eliminated and the same super scombag spirit of china. Those gone makes the relative super id1ocy of republ1cans a small problem. Actually easily solved by confronting the super id1ocy of wokeness. Without which republ1cans have no objection and s4tan has nothing to bind them with."

I should point that the voluntary decision to do so is fine, which is the case that the video hopes for."

"I don't like the idea that someone else would have developed the weapons. Science ethics is something every scientists needs to follow and if indeed every scientists follows it (or at least sufficient number of), weapons will be created far slower. If the weapon is only finalized after a war, it is not going to do any harm. Just think about how much earlier the nuclear bomb could have been developed if Albert Einstein participated in the Manhatten Project? (Without judging whether this would be a good or a bad thing)

Thus, yes Haber is the unethical person here. He is (partly) responsible for warcrimes. He is (partly) responsible for the death of millions."
easy answer on your last question: we dont
Our German History is so twisted an broken. So much light and so much darkness go hand in hand.

There are a set number of molecules inside so how could the pressure increase? The only thing that comes to mind that could change the pressure is the decreasing temperature in the depths of the ocean, which would actually decrease pressure within the bottle. I feel I may be missing something here, is someone able to explain it to me?"
"""To every man  is given the key to the gates of heaven.  The same key opens the gates of hell.  And so it is with science.""  - Richard Feynman"
"I think that what Einstein and other scientists did by not attending at his award, is part of the message that wasn't stressed enough. 

Yes, there is a question of how tools given to us by science are used (whether for good or war), but when someone goes out to willingly develop a weapon.- he should be ousted from the scientific community. Science is not impartial and should have a moral imperitive guiding it. In the end, his patriotism and willingness of haber to participate in war gave the Nazis a tool they used to commit genocide. 

Yes, it may have taken the US or possibly the world longer to achieve some of the technologies we have today, but the cost - Nuclear weapons used on crowded cities and now perched on ICBMs ready to end the world - may have been avoided. The question is not just what is possible but what kind of world would we like to live in. 

Part of the discussion should be the fact that often militaries have resources available to them far beyond what they should have and militaries are not moral establishments. We've seen this throughout history. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that what the scientists did - shunning scientists who iwllfully contribute to war and weaponizing discoveries - is the propper way to go. 



Imagine if all the world defunded militaries in favor of science. We would be in a better place. War is not endemic to the human condition. it is something that we are taught to believe is necessary or unavoidable - but it is not."

And if there's one man who stands out as being painted the hero it's not Roosevelt or Eisenhower, it's Churchill. At least that's what I feel is the general opinion. When talking about the US they're talked about as coming in and helping at the end of the war in Europe, and bombing Japan with a horrific weapon.

The path to hell is paved with good intentions.
Mostly because the people who invented hell don't want you to do some good things.
17:47 the utter sadness on that mans face says more than any death toll or story could
"Excellent video Derek. I've been working at defense/weapons companies for most of my career and have always struggled with knowing that the work I do, while advancing the boundaries of engineering, is also used to the purpose of ultimately killing people. Your video provides a pretty valuable perspective and I'd really like to share it with my colleagues."
This guy is like the anti-thomas midgley
"In our chemistry books there was just a reaction named Haber's process, never thought of it having a dark side"

I make better content than veritasium 😎😎😎😎
Never thought I’d see alt-right dog whistles on this channel
"@Veritasium at 11:47 you state ""Unlike pacifist Einstein, Haber was a patriot."" The assertion that pacifism, and being anti-war, is antithetical to patriotism, is one of the more perverse and disgusting allegations I've heard in a long time.

Some food for thought:
""Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger.""
-- Herman Goering at the Nuremberg trials"
That is very interesting and has a lot of truth to it! Nevertheless Germany was fighting a defensive war but I completely agree with the statement above about pacifism and patriotism.
"Can't believe I was just randomly talking about this man with my friend, at exactly the same time that this video was being uploaded. Mind blown."
"Haber feed half of humanity.
Haber defended his fatherland.
Haber stood with his Jewish colleges in protest against Nazism.
All my respects to this man. He killed noone, soldiers know their work is about death. He just stood with his country, there is nothing wrong with that."

“Farmers noticed adding guano to their soil made their crops grow tall” lmao some crazy old farmer just threw a whole bunch of bird poo in their crops they were gonna sell to people lol
"1:06 Isla de Aves (Birds Island) in Venezuela was claimed in that way, exploited and latter abandoned in hands of Venezuela at around 1978"
"If anyone is interested in looking a bit further into the first part of this video about the guano islands and the us claiming them, I highly recommend the book How to Hide an Empire by Daniel Immerwahr.
The author is actually related to Fritz's wife Clara."
Jules Verne painted a graphic picture of imperialists using slave labor mining nitrates on these islands as inspiring Captain Nemo to develop what for all the world sounds like a nuclear-powered Nautilus designed to sink their ships.
Great work. This is one of the best channels on YouTube. It has been awesome to see it grow over time. The question at the end is very poignant
I really appreciate that you put your advertisements at the end!
"The truly poetic irony in this story for me is the fact that Haber, who created the deadly yet indispensable nitrogen compounds, was awarded the Nobel Prize, created by Alfred Nobel to try and do good after inventing dynamite, which killed his own brother.

Edit: People have pointed out that the invention of dynamite was after his brother died, so I stand corrected there, but I feel like my original point still stands since dynamite was also a compound that came with great progress and simultaneous evil"
"@Mr techno Okay, I understand your point but, why it is more important to protect a flag that your race (humanity) from a form of disaster that the same invented?  Wars are not it. They are entirely irracional."
"To me it aint irony, when he saved billions with that nitrogen compound and only killed hundred thousand in WW1 with that toxic gas. Isent dynamite preatty old invention and it didnt do that much bad things, when in war it can be used to brake buildings or bridges, but then dynamite is great use for making tunnels underground."
"@Sacc Listen when it's comes to nation nothing is more important ( I mean nothing ) and that man try to help their country. second thing, no one can think that we are wrong when it's war...."
"@Mr techno Yeah, and what? We are talking about WAR in general. And we are talking in a context in which Germany was one of the REAL threats for other countries and even itself. This is ridiculous."
"@Sacc USA is the GREATEST threat to the world. USA initiated 80% of wars after the Second World War, that led to humanitarian

disasters:

1950 - invasion of Korea,

1958 - intervention in Lebanon,

1959 - participation in the war in Laos,

1964 - invasion of Vietnam,

1965-occupation of the Dominican

Republic,

1967 - participation in the war in Cambodia, 1977-participation in the war in El

Salvador, 1980 - participation in the war in Iran,

1982 - invasion of Lebanon, 1983 - invasion of Grenada,

1986-first invasion of Libya,

1989-invasion of Panama, 1991 - Gulf War,

1992 - invasion of Somalia,

1992-bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina,

1994-intervention in Haiti, 1999- invasion of Yugoslavia (Kosovo),

2001-invasion of Afghanistan,

2003- invasion of Liberia,

2003 - invasion of Iraq (under false

pretenses)

2004 - participation in the war in Pakistan,

2011 second invasion of Libya,

2015-missile strikes in Yemen,

2015 - military operation in Cameroon, 2015 - and again Libya, another

intervention.

USA is the REAL THREAT. USA aged politicians, who's mentally anchored in XX-th century ""cold war"", continue aggressive politics, making Russia, China, Middle East, and Ocean region countries enemies instead PARTNERS.

TOO MUCH IS TOO MUCH!.  Now is that's enough for nurdy or you want more??"
I remember studying about Haber in 8th grade. The guy was always more of a hero in my eyes than a mad scientist making TNTs
Maybe it's not for us to see ourselves as God. God created nature and science not for our empowerment but as a sign of God's love.
Things used to grow food can also be turned into explosives. Remind me of Nuclear.
you should have made this before my chemistry exam lol
"SPOILER alert:
Its so strange to know that Haber a jewish scientist immensely helped his country Germany in war by making explosives and later his own country blamed the Jews for losing the war, and killed them by using THE poisionous gas manufactured in Haber's own institute."
Excelent video as always!
Guano! Guano!! Guano!!! Guano.
"I feel like this video should've investigate, at least in part, the viability of non-monoculture farming. It takes for granted that any of the incentives to reestablish colonial hierarchies could have been avoid by alternative farming practices."

"Science is neither good or evil, it just depends on how you use it in the end. Its a similar story with nuclear energy."

tragic life O.o
"Beautifully put together video, and I support the idea of using chemistry for life-affirming purposes!

While we (as in humanity as a whole) may not be able to control what scientific discoveries could potentially be used for, we can certainly manage what is engineered with that knowledge. It is a *choice* to apply science towards the manufacture of weapons instead of the production of food.

Interestingly, we are all united by the fact that every human being requires food to live. It seems that sincere attempts at fulfilling each other's basic needs in mutually beneficial ways can create a long-term peace, whereas fighting will always fail in doing so."
"@Delta B Yes, I have heard. I'm not surprised many farmers are rebelling. In my opinion, while it is important to lessen pollution and food waste, this is a transitional process that is better served by increasing sustainable agriculture on the local level, not by suddenly implementing restrictions on production before those systems are in place.

Likewise, just as it is a choice to apply science towards the manufacture of weapons, it is a choice to use genetic engineering to make sterile crops that are heavily dependent on costly fertilizers / pesticides / herbicides / etc."
"@Gabor F Thank you for taking the time to read my comment. I sincerely wish you well throughout your circumstances. 

Generally, I don't think conflict is an inherent part of our nature because humanity has evolved the capacity for empathy and kindness, as well as a sense of resilience under stress. Even with all of the turmoil in the world, certainly we can choose to be motivated to explore and create for constructive reasons (e.g.: supporting each other's lives in joy), rather than destructive ones (e.g.: trying to harm and kill one another out of fear)?

It seems to me that war usually:
*is used to take something through might, rather than to create an abundance of resources for all
*is used to force others into submission, inducing a sense of vengeance across generations, not a lasting peace or safety

International cooperation towards the scientific development of sustainable food production for everyone's benefit (none excluded) really is a worthwhile endeavor in my opinion. And further, I am personally happy to work together on that goal with anyone and everyone who is interested."
Food production is currently being shut down in Europe and Asia to meet environmental quotas.
this would make a brilliant HBO show i feel.
"it's almost as if capitalism and nationalism are destructive. it's almost like we should structure our economic systems to bring out the best in science and technology. we need to unite as one family and change our values. capitalism and other systems that use money as a form of trade where people can have way more than they need or have ownership of critical resources used to exploit others, and have things like copyright laws where people can own ideas and artificially restrict the growth of others unable to pay to take advantage of those ideas. it's divisive and destructive over time.

The vast human knowledge we have obtained is the common heritage of all people, yet we still act like some people are entitled to it more than others. And earth is a finely balanced ecosystem that requires a sustainable economic model in order to thrive upon, not one which exploits earths resources to their breaking point.

But, as usual, these videos end off trying to sell you something instead of just existing for the benefit of everyone, instead of pointing out those critical flaws of our economics. Cause capitalism sure is great! amirite!? sell sell sell, that's how you survive in this world, be it your soul, or your body and mind."
Is this another episode copied from the Cosmos series?
"It's worth noting that this guy wasn't fighting for Nazi Germany. He wasn't trying to take over the world or commit genocide -- he was trying to defend his country, same as any soldier, same as probably most of us would. He just had the know-how to be extremely deadly about it."
Imperial Germany was evil. Look at what they did in Africa.
"@Vidvid15 
Exactly."
"Ist was WW1 not WW2, he fought for Imperial germany not for Nazi germany."
Dr. Fauci right? LMAO 🤣🤣🤣 killed millions!!!
Your videos are as entertaining and interesting as they are educational. Thanks for the effort!
good history class
"Inaccurate! at 3:50 it's explained as if it was inevitable that the soil would lose its nitrogen. It isn't!  Reality is completely different. Microbes and plants together fix nitrogen in a symbiosis. Fertilizer increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil. However it kills Microbes. As a result plants can not absorb as many minerals as they should. The nitrogen  makes plants grow faster. However the more you use, the more you need to compensate for the loss of microbes. A result of this is that our soils are void of minerals or rather, the plants can't absorb them at their rate of growth. Without fertilizer and without monocultures, your soil would never really deplete. Monocultures matter because some plants fix more nitrogen than they use and others use more than they fix. A mix keeps it in balance. Minerals slowly get depleted however in nature you simply poop them back into the system. Any minor amounts lost to rivers etc would get replenished by dust from for example deserts! The planet is amazing and even deserts have a vital purpose. Would be great if you could fix the video because it is a massive issue that our food has lost very significant amounts of nutrients and thereby leads to a calorie dense diet, we need to eat more food to compensate for the loss of nutrition. EDIT : NVM the part about bacteria etc was mentioned"

"Fritz's son, Hermann, would also go on to commit suicide like his mother did."
He is like the ideal German scientist from a show basically
"They were right to shun him. It isn't that he invented the process. Inventing the process is fine, and would always have been done anyway -- it was that he enthusiastically contributed to war with his knowledge. He didn't need to make killing people any easier on purpose. By mistake or incidentally or forced against your will are all different to doing something on purpose.

Also going to be honest, but as a scientist myself, reading the comments and seeing the indifference of some people in assessing his life and behavior is why I wouldn't want scientists to be in charge. As great as that would be for things like climate change or pandemics, doing something just because we can or because someone else will do it at some point if we don't, is not a good way to make moral choices. I've seen this disconnected attitude in much of the scientific community and in some contexts it scares me. Such a mode of thinking could easily one day be our species' undoing."
"This is a great video, showing both sides I a portrait of a man, who's story is a story of the early 20th century"
Science is quite the double-edged sword...nice video!
"I don't believe one thing veritasium said that, if he did not invent the process then other scientists would have invented it.

"Peak phosphorus is becoming a thing now.  Thing is though, phosphorus, and neither does nitrogen, vanish once it has been consumed, it goes somewhere, often into the ocean from sewage, causing huge algae blooms.  Something I think technology should focus on is the ability to recycle nutrients from “waste”.  Also it is cases like these that make some people wonder, if it’s worth having so much control over the natural world, and while they may be regarded as luddites or backwards, sometimes they are like more like Cassandra’s prophecies.  Right now, industrial agriculture actually makes an enormous surplus of food, but most of that surplus just goes to waste or is consumed by the wealthiest people in the world.  Meanwhile many people throughout the world continue to starve because of the socio-economic problems they face, often coming from the legacy of colonialism."
"I don’t think you should call him irrelevant.  It is very disturbing when people degrade someone by saying “if he had not done it, someone else eventually would have”.  You are stealing a persons legacy.  If you want to play that game, you can take every single accomplishment committed by anyone away from them.  I have noticed this being used a lot with the political left recently.  They feel they have the power to take anyones accomplishments away and rewrite history.  This is truly dark.  I don’t think he did anything wrong at all.  He designed weapons…..so what?  War is a part of life, he was only trying to help his country.  Should we take away Einsteins accomplishments?  Designed weapons far more destructive that chlorine gas.  Ok let’s just do that, Einstein was an idiot, someone would have made all his discoveries eventually.  I think you should actually edit your statement about this from this video, as it is more evil than you think.  As for the scientists that shunned this guy, how many billion people did they save?  Most of them probably didn’t accomplish anything."
"incredible video, as always."
"Great video, as always! One note, the Richter Magnitude Scale, an earthquake measurement method, is no longer used, but the Moment Magnitude is the current standard.

Transitioning to different scales may make a good video topic."

"I think most scientists have to deal with this. I do research in robotics, and we develop autonomous systems mostly under the umbrella of search and rescue, construction, agriculture, etc., but we are all well aware that this could easily be repurposed to kill people in war. I feel like most scientists are aware of this but rarely bring it up, because it is an uncomfortable truth. However, whenever people visit our lab who are not scientists themselves and ""just"" part of the interested public there is a good chance that they will bring it up.

Overall science itself is neutral. We simply derive actions from it based on our own believes and morals. The best example for that is climate change. Human-accelerated climate change itself is simply a fact. Droughts, hunger, floods, etc. are made more likely by climate change. All of those are simple facts but our own moral and believe systems tells us that this is not ""right"", and that we should act based on this information. There is nothing itself in science that tells us that we should do something, and I think it is important to keep this separation. Science tasks is to tell us what is, and the society is tasked is to use these facts to make decisions - whether good or evil is all relative and independent of science."

"Great video, learnt a lot!"
"Waaaait, he purposefully built chemical weapons! After that the labeling is easy to me. Good and bad actions do not cancel out. It's not math, it's morality. He was clearly a gifted evil man,  IMO."
"I'd argue that Haber will also (indirectly) kill billions, because most of our current environmental crises are either caused or exacerbated by the overpopulation that he helped make possible. In other words, Haber proved Malthus wrong only temporarily (for about a century), but Malthus will eventually hit us with an even heavier blow than he could ever have foreseen."
"I don’t think he can be called a villain. Yes he made weapons with the intent to kill. But he made them to end the war too. 
We don’t regard bomber pilots or those that worked on the Manhattan project as villains all the same. And they killed people knowingly. He didn’t create the gas to kill Jews knowingly."

There's an important follow-up story - the negative effects of nitrogen fertilizer: 
- uses a huge amount of energy 
- led to chemical-based farming, away from more natural methods. Soil degradation, addictive, N pollution, etc.
- enabled a population explosion which is bad for the environment  (and ultimately bad humans). It's not sustainable."

Thank you for that last part. In reality if he wouldn't have did it somebody else would have figured it out eventually it was a worldwide problem. You just did it first. And eventually somebody would have realized that you can use it to make bombs and everything.
Kinda like why there cant be peace in the world.. humans need to evolve .. AI will take over the planet at somepoint :) I hope it will allow humans to live :) but fact is that some people think we need AI .. I can see the good it can do for humans.. BUT i surely can see the bad too ..
I don't see the doubling of the global population as a great thing. It's neutral at best.
It’s fitting that the man that started a foundation focused on peace and prosperity out of guilt for the destructive nature of his invention would then award a prize to someone making the same mistake.

"What we can maybe learn from Fritz Haber's life, is that that nothing in science is either all good or all bad.

I'm for sure on the side of Haber being one of histories greatest monsters. Population growth is amoral itself but the use of chlorine gas is one of the most horrifying choices ever made. It's not as if Haber created the process and then the German state used it for chemical weapons.
Why do so many revolutions come from singular people.
Ya he did a great thing inventing fertilizer but when he made the gas and used it I don’t blame anyone thinking he was a terrible person that’s my opinion

You can't really blame him for the holocaust. The Nazis would just have used one of many other poisonous chemicals. Even then he left his position in solidarity with the persecution.
You can't blame someone for something that didn't happen. 🤷‍♂️

Fascinating  story
"I think the final point is the most important of this video - the point that these processes would have been found by someone else if not him. Thinking of the world in terms of heroes who revolutionized agriculture or villains who revolutionized chemical weaponry hides the reality that the world is governed by systems which pressure humans more than by individuals themselves. These advancements weren't made because this one man was born, they were made because generations of scientists were given the incentives to make them.

Great progress doesn't happen by waiting for the right person to make it, it happens by creating the environment to foster it. Likewise, great harm doesn't just happen because of one person's actions, it comes from a world that encourages it."

So this is why we jeetards are made to learn about Haber's process
Notification Squad!  :)
"We are all humans, we make right decisions and we make mistakes."
"Saying He fed the world is so wrong! as if he gave a way food for billions for free, NO, we worked hard put food on the table, we don't owe it to anyone but to the Earth and God"
"first he helped in overpopulation of the Earth and then he killed millions with cruel type of weapons, indirectly killed his wife, aaand is invention was part of holocaust...he is evil to me..."
"Nice overview on Haber's story.

The passage at 9:50 seems odd to me. Ammonia NH3 is a gas (boiling point: -33 °C or -28 °F). I doubt that they cooled the gas to such low temperature to make it drop and instantaneously evaporate. Liquid ammonia that we can buy in stores is an aqueous solution. Are there some details missing in the story like mixing with water first?

Another point that I don't understand is about Zyklon B having a barely detectable odor at 18:55 . Cyanuric acid is easy to smell by most humans at a ppm level (smells like bitter almonds). Does anyone know why pure cyanuric acid is smells strongly but doesn't in Zyklon B?"
"@Georgio Nicolas I know that ammonia is processed to make ammonium nitrate after. I simply meant that in the story of the video, Fritz Haber ""saw a drop of ammonia"" coming out of the cooled reactor which seems unlikely because it would be gaseous."
It’s sold as ammonium nitrate
This was a phenomenal video
Much better then Lysenko. Who only managed to do the former.
"I think the ""evil"" from Haber is not the discovery of his process, but his own want to utilize it to produce chemical weapons. It isn't the process it's that HE was the one who supported turning it into mass death, all for nationalism. I agree someone would have eventually invented it, and someone else may have turned it into a chemical weapon, but (again), it isn't who made the original process that is evil, it is the intent of the use of that process. If it's for fertilizer, big thumbs up. If it's for chemical weapons, very bad."
"A complete hero!
Hero for food production.
Hero for the good of the world."
9:57 brilliant detail in his eyes
It feels like so many discoveries simultaneously make the world better and scarier
"knowledge is a knife, if it is in doctor hands it saves life and if it is in thief hand it kills life...

That's where I believe, knowledge is classified"
I didn't know I needed/wanted these science/history videos...keep them coming.
What a great story!
"An interesting recap of Haber's work, showing the usefulness of science as well as its abuse."
"There is no good or evil. And the victors will always be painted in good light. Fritz was just a man.

- Corny McCorny"
"I believe it's possible by saving billions he might've doomed more to suffer the consequences of ecological stress from the population of mankind & it's larger impact.  Granted the butterfly flap of a  agricultural revolution without synthetic fertilizer is unknowable.  Perhaps it would've resulted in food wars which would've turned our entire planet into wasteland.  Perhaps it would've made sewage a valuble resource.
Instead of trying to distill gold from seawater Fritz should've been working on a better way to extract freshwater from seawater.  Granted that wasn't seen as great a shortage as today.  Our crops are again under threat from water shortage thanks to climate change aggrevated drought & water mismanagement.  Also thanks to the current war in Ukraine we face shortages of the various chemicals exported by Russia used by farms lost to the market.   Unfortunately since harvesting removes all sorts of nutrients extracted from soil we need fertilizers to replenish them.  Either all of our sewage both animal and human would need to be captured & returned or industrial chemical processes like the Haber chamber will always be needed."
If he was on the other side of history regarding the weapons he made we would commemorate him because the victors write history
"no, villain is right."

"Errrr... I'm no historian and only a little bit of a scientist. But, from what I understand/remember Haber ""only"" invented zyclon A (A and B being a measure of the dangerousness of the stuff)..."
his activeness in developing methods of killing people en masse I can understand would make him a pariah
"Knowledge is not the problem morality is.
CO2 climate alarmism is a scam. CO2 is plant food, plants are OUR food. CO2 makes plants drought resistant. Green the deserts and feed the world. Cooler deserts from plant cover will bring rain to speed the greening. More water in the atmosphere will increase cloud cover to reduce extreme temperatures and will grow glaciers and polar icecaps. That in turn will eventually lower ocean levers.

"I have been learning about Haber process and production and use of ammonia since class 9, and it was a topic which has been a constant in our chemistry syllabus for years now.
To hear the tragic story behind the process and its creator, as well as the implications  has given a completely different spin to my perspective on the matter. I will definitely not be seeing the p block chapter in my chemistry in the same way again😅😅.

"@Veritasium the title of this video is VERY misguided. When you say ""And"" you imply some level of cause. Like ""she pulled the trigger and died"", dying comes off as an effect of pulling the trigger. So, it's like you are saying that killing millions of jews in WW2 saved billions of lives, like one caused the other so it excuses the holocaust. I think a better title would be ""Scientis who saved billions, but also killed millions"", I'd guess it separates better the two scenarios and doesn't sound as a nazi apologist."

Amazing video
"Great approach to the ""Haber culpability issue"" - that he's irrelevant. It doesn't alter how one might judge him after evaluating his actions, but puts that judgement in its proper place. It's personal to him, not of universal scope. And yet his work for the good and for ill both had an important impact. That's how history worked out. Subtracting him from it is counterfactual. In fact, there he was; that's what he did. So the (probable - if counterfactual) irrelevance of his self to this all taking place at some unknowable future time, after he actually did what he actually did does count for something - as the cautionary statement you end with. Your own research might be irrelevant to its future causal chain of consequences (because ""it was going to happen anyway"" - perhaps) ... er, sorry, that has distracted me ... _but perhaps not_ - that's how counterfactual non-events go. The thing is it can help us be aware of standing somewhere in some causal chain. What we do now might have effects (if what follows follows from what we did, it is a fact that ""we"" ... one-of-us ... changes the world at that point. In  a sense it's irrelevant, too, that the actual agent of change acted within some or other context. Every context has many possible outcomes. ...

Sorry, I'm floundering here, but let me struggle on, and hope someone can make head or tail of this. Think of something like the walking frame elderly people use to support themselves all over the world today as an example of the importance of what actually happens (and thence the ""irrelevance"" - maybe diminished relevance? of the context - enabling all those things that might Possibly happen). It's this: Someone sees the old folk struggling to walk with walking sticks (maybe), and improves the walking stick to give it a broad base of support. ""Problem solved"". And then I would guess that has determined the future of such mobility aids for maybe 30 years? The problem is ""solved"", so there's no point in seeking improvements. 

Why solve a ""solved"" problem? Well that's why I chose the walking frame as an example of how we stop thinking as soon as a problem is ""solved"" (thus becoming at least temporarily relevant to how the future progresses). Consider the walking frame for maybe a month or so (in your spare time, not as the main focus of your life). I think you'll find the solution has some imperfections. People learn to live with these, but they also mean that the problem isn't really ""solved"". One of the set of solutions has been found, and those who take care of the mobility of the elderly have settled for that is ""good enough"". (And no elderly person has tried to come up with something better - maybe because that's an unusual trait in the elderly, more than it being an acceptance of the frame as ""The Solution"".

It is possible that industrial ammonia production would've taken decades to be discovered, were it not for Fritz Haber. This still makes him ""irrelevant"" (I still agree with how you state it - in that this is the essence of it all, even if it doesn't cover ever aspect ...)

Hmm ... and after all that, I think probably what I've pointed out doesn't matter. :-) Oh well ... Good.

We're all part of processes that almost drive themselves, but our input at least puts some ""rudder on the ship"" if it's something important like fertilizer that results (instead of long strings of words that walk a verbal circle like above). I think the solution would lie in the way we learn to manage our Values. Whatever we do is driven by what we value. If we value junk, we'll bring junk into being. If we value just short-term things, we'll be short sighted. If we have a deeper set of values that we put effort into actively maintaining, maybe we'll one day catch ourselves (this process we're in might be driven by summed values - or ""evaluations"") before we fall the next time? We can't foretell the future, but we can be careful of what we respect and disrespect, for instance.

We have this monkey impulse to respect the monkey who's the best at fighting, biting, destroying, for instance. It's probably a good idea to be a bit more human (""human"" being an ideal here - something we can become, rather than something we complacently imagine we already are) about respect for bigger monkeys with meaner temperaments. To be more human, it might even be necessary to learn the art of deliberately Disrespecting that which shouldn't be respected? We should definitely not treat our respect as cheap currency to just throw away on junk people. 

I had a reasonably comprehensive set of personal thoughts about this Values issue when I was younger, but a lot of them seem to have leaked out of my head. Luckily for you; otherwise I've have been here all night shouting at these walls."

"so he invented fertilizer, making it possible to have cheap access to food but he also very enthusiastically used his invention to kill - idk kinda invalidated the ""good deed"" imo. not very nobel behavior."
"So if he makes bombs and chemical weapons for Germany ""to end the war quickly"" he is a villain, but the scientists in the Manhatten project making a much more devestating nuclear bombs for the US are heroes?"
"The difference is that the US won the war while Germany didn't. History is always written by the winners.
So basically, the question if you are called a hero by the history books doesn't depend on how heroic your behavior actually was. It depends on how useful you were to the countries that won the last big conflicts in the world."
your last take to think of haber as irrelevant is very weird. “someone else would have figured it out”. what a dumb dumb take. this means that any human achiever is irrelevant because someone else could have figured it out
He'll always be my hero forever.
"Food for thought for sure isn't it!  Intent is a huge factor for me, as well as ""turning a blind eye"" to things.  Also, is it a good thing that we have these fertilizers?  It is at the root of why so many humans exist on this planet and the number of humans existing has a direct effect on climate change and the elites wish to survive so who knows what they will do to eh, um, uh, you know, get rid of people?  

Don't think so, really?  People are capable of terribly selfish behavior as well as terribly evil behavior and that is a horrible but undeniable fact, and that means you and i are both susceptible to this under the right circumstances.  think you would never shoot an innocent, pregnant lady in the head... yea me too...

Science is but a tool. An incredibly reliable tool, but a tool nonetheless, and like any other, it can be used for a wide range of things.

My answer to your question at 20:38 - Utopically, everyone is versed in critical thinking, reasoning, logic, and with a basic level of scientific literacy.

There would still necessarily be diverging positions; right leaning and left leaning, whatever that means in your country; people of all sorts and background thinking fallaciously because.. We just do.

There would be many issues left, as there is no one solution to many problems, but I have little doubt we would much more easily make INFORMED decisions as a species, and be less likely to be conned, manipulated, scammed - and maybe less of us trying to do it in the first place.

I also think it's hardly feasible to have >90% of the world populace educated in such a way, given the vast difference in educational systems thoroughout the world and ineffectiveness of so many of them.

But we can always keep doing our best to educate ourselves, become better people, learn that saying ""I don't know"" props you up, and leave this place even just a tiny bit better than when we found it.

TL;DR - Better education systems that include critical thinking curriculae and some degree of scientific literacy would go a long way to help us make more informed decisions about a tangible world we all share, whether we believe in it or not."
That guano was insanely important. You needed to have that to have a population and be able to grow crops. We wouldnt have nearly as much food without the invention of fertilizer

"Pick up your cross and follow Jesus! The world is quickly headed for destruction, and sooner or later you will have to sit at the judgement seat and give an account for your actions. Belief in messiah alone is not enough to grant you salvation - Matthew 7:21-23, John 3:3, John 3:36 (ESV is the best translation for John 3:36). Call on the name of Jesus and pray for Him to intervene in your life! - Revelation 3:20. 

Contemplate how the Roman Empire fulfilled the role of the beast from the sea in Revelation 13. Revelation 17 confirms that it is in fact Rome. From this we can conclude that A) Jesus is the Son of God and can predict the future or make it happen, B) The world leaders/nations/governments etc have been conspiring together for the last 3000+ years going back to Babylon and before, C) History as we know it is fake. You don't really need to speculate once you start a relationship with God tho.

Can't get a response from God? Fasting can help increase your perception and prayer can help initiate events.  God will ignore you if your prayer does not align with His purpose (James 4:3) or if you are approaching Him when ""unclean"" (Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 59:2, Micah 3:4). Stop eating food sacrificed to idols (McDonald's, Wendy's etc) stop glorifying yourself on social media or making other images of yourself (Second Commandment), stop gossiping about other people, stop watching obscene content etc and you should get a response.

"You're forgetting that humans are naturally greedy, its not sciences fault; but the human that musters that malice. He definitely wasnt a good human for supporting the German affairs."
"I think you let the guy off too easily at the end. Just because other people might have succeeded at the same thing doesn’t mean we can’t hold him accountable for succeeding himself. He was responsible for an amazing discovery, and then he knowingly used that discovery to kill people. Pretty cut and dried to me."
"Nitrogen is critical for plants to grow... so carbon dioxide too. If we deprived our crops from carbon dioxide abundance they have nowadays then our crops would not be as big as today. With lower crops, amount of animals and peoples over time will decline. That is why they want us to take part in our self extinction because the goal of those in power is depopulation."
"Remember folks, ends *never* justify the means."
Good music to talking about poop

"and he caused overpopulation and killed the planet Earth in the long term, because Earth can't sustain 8B population which is only growing. The size of population is is cause of high pollution and using all the nasty synthetic preservatives in food and all sorts of chemicals in agriculture."
"I love the statement that if Haber did not made the invention, someone else would. That is just inevitable part of human progress."
"Raidolab from NPR did a show about him so I knew all this info allready, but you video was still very interesting and I watched the whole thing."
"Same old story.. you can use a hammer for something good like pounding in a nail, or use the hammer for something bad like making an egg sandwich.  It's not the tool..  it's how you use it."
People killed more people than science and religion put together.
This suggests Thanos could just use the time stone to go back in time on each planet and kill the guy who invented commercial Ammonia instead of killing half of the population.

"i made a comic about fritz haber (actually it mainly focused on his wife) in  my freshman year of highschool called ""my chemical tragedy"" for an assignment about the creation of weapons of mass destruction so i love whenever people talk about it because i find it fascinating"
In 9. grade I held a presentation about Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch. It's really nice seeing this video and noticing my mistakes haha. Good video!!!
"""You don't know how knowledge is used"". True, however Fritz knew exactly and went on to use it, I think that says enough."
It is impressive how he never took no for an answer and used his brilliance for revolutionary ideas
@Gregory Fenn  neat
Hey!! I used to watch some of your competitive pokemon stuff back in the day!
Science and morality. About this there is also something in Islam named hagh o alnas(English isn't my native so I don't know of any English synonym) meaning the right of other (people) meaning everything we do we must consider it's effects on others in it. In the end science doesn't have morality it's beautiful and dangerous. Healer and killer. That is why it is a responsibility for scientists to seek knowledge but always account for morality.
As someone who loves learning it was always a joy to know about those who helped humanity but the fine line of morality and how easy a blessing could turn into a curse petrified me with fear
such cruel murdering can’t be justified no matter what
question is: was it bad to stop ww2 with the nuclear bomb? 🤔
Can't contain my happiness when I see new Veritasium video.
I heard 1% companies make 90% of carbon di oxide or something. Can you do a video on that.
"Just seconds into watching the video, I already know this is going to be about the Haber-Bosch process. I wasn't really a big fan of chemistry back in my school days but when we actually talked about this, it stuck for some reason. Now I'm actually vegetable gardening on my balcony and rediscovering what tremendous importance ammonium nitrate has in all of agriculture"
Now I know why Niter adds food to a tile in Civ 6 even though its used to create firearm units. Good old Nitrogen doing its work.
Super cool
we used to learn about the Haber process during my A levels. Never knew he was also responsible for chlorine gas

"Thank you for the informative video Derek but your sponsor is just another one of the greenwashing ways companies put the blame of emissions on the working class people and every day citizens.

This video is basically a nazi apologist
"Just to clarify - volkisch movement  did not consider German Jews as Germans. Hence one may say that Haber could not find this movement attractive. The thing is he considered himself to be a German - and throughout his whole he fought to be considered as such.The moment when despite his merits (regardless of how we see them) for his fatherland he was treated like an alien parasite must have been crushing. 

But it might have been a new opening for Haber who accepted directorship in an institute in Palestine from Chaim Weizmann.
Haber died while travelling to Palestine - had he lived longer he could have survived Holocaust in British mandate in Palestine .
Would have he considered himself a German Jew or a Jew at that point  ? It is something we  will never know."
"Why ? Haber was by all means German nationalist - perhaps even chauvinist. Given a chance he would probably assist the Third Reich in the next war - but he was not given that chance and had to emigrate. In a twisted sense of humor you could say he was Nazi's victim  (twisted because the roots of Nazism - the volkism is something that obviously appealed to Haber as well).

Defenitely a complicated historical figure - but by no means a Nazi apologist."
Clickbait title does a disservice to Haber and this channel also
"Same can be said about guns. It's a device that can be used to stop bad people from committing crimes. But this only works in countries where they have strong laws that make owning one extremely difficult and only allow police to have them. The US is not one of those countries and as such, the use of guns in the US has resulted in far more deaths of those who have not committed crimes than those who have. The easy access to guns in the US has resulted in more crime than preventing crime."

I read the Alchemy of Air in a college class. Fascinating book about Haber and Bosch.
"Now even if you do something right in this world, then people will say wrong because that thing is happening to him in a wrong way. ."
So he developed chlorine gas and caused overpopulation.
He decided to turn himself to evil. He is a villain and should be remembered as such for the evil research he pursued.
@Gus Grich Gates and other accomplices. Evil never works alone.
Each of us decides to educate or to destroy our neighbour.
"If nobody accepted to work for evil, no evil would exist."
"Reminds me of Bill Gates – not that Gates discovered something genius, but on how he quickly turned to the dark side of research."
"I imagine he was ""forced"" to use his knowledge for the war but I agree it was only up to him to agree and even go the extra mile. Evil guy"
Fritz Haber singlehandedly destroyed Chilean economy for roughly the first half of the 20th century so yeah we also hate the guy for that
"I would highly recommend the book ""The Alchemy of Air"" by Thomas Hager for anybody who wants to dive into this story a little more."
"Anybody recognize its is HABERS PROCESS in chemistry ammonia  preparation in 12th jee

"You made such a dramatic intro about a scientist and people boycotting his award. Come, tell us already the synopsis! No. We have to watch the whole video to know what it is all about.
I stopped your video at 3:16 and just googled Fritz Haber. I found EVERYTHING I wanted to know in just the header or Wikipedia article. If you did give the synopsis early - I would be interested in watching the whole video. Now I'm just mad at you.
I hate people who write articles the way you made this video. I double hate people who make videos the way you made this video."

"​@SlappyTheClappy​ I think it's been mentioned that saying ""Richter scale"" helps people understand what is being talked about.
It is often added in by media even if it was never mentioned.

People don't actually know what the scale implies anyway."
Yeh bit the richer scale is more known than the newer method. People understand it better than the newer method
It's surprising to see that most people don't know about Fritz Haber
We need to ban mad scientists.
"We stopped prizing wisdom over technical advancement. If we don't refocus on becoming wiser, then we will likely re-perpetrate atrocities upon ourselves. Aside from Jesus Christ, both a historical and religious figure, you might be right. That said, what say you about the govt of Netherlands ordering their farmers to stop farming in order to stop using nitrogen fertilizer, ostensibly to _reduce_ nitrogen? To this layman's mind, it seems like a not-so-subtle way of culling humans off of earth. Forced population reduction squared. Natural diseases, fatalities as a result of every day life, and the weather do not seem to take enough of a toll on us in the eyes of some very wealthy and overly influential individuals who refer to themselves, openly, as the elites. (It happened at a WEF/Davos conference, spoken by a woman speaker whose name I can't recall, into a mic, with a totally straight face.) I appreciate your sincere concern over climate change. However. Most science successes are the result of trial and error and climate change science is still in error mode."
"This is just mere conjecture though. In actual fact  it's probably less than that. Food shortages affect them to. Why would they want to pay more for food.

"Wow  ^ ^ this is really an amazing video!

it's hard to believe that someone who was focused on feeding the world became focused on destructive things in the war.. But I  guess he just thought he was doing what was right.

If he had been a little wiser and reflected upon what his actions might cause and what the future of the world might be due to them, Maybe he would have made a different choice."
His reasoning was to end the war by his side winning and saving his friends and family at the expense of the death of the enemy.

did he make more chemicals or was Zycklon B his final solution?
I'm pretty sure Haber's wife was also a pacifist and her having a PhD in chemistry tells us that she understood part of her expertise in the area of which he had twisted into a weapon.

"I never imagined that the topic of guano would be a segue to the life and work of Haber. Also, I would not want to label him as irrelevant, because he did what he did. History is replete with such controversial characters who have existed on both ends of the ethical spectrum simultaneously, doing unbelievable good whilst committing inconceivable crime. He must have been a judge of his own character, and could have been penitent during his decline later in life. If anything, he could rightly be placed in an ethical grey area, and it's wise to know his history but refrain from judging. This practice should be followed for other great men too; we can know of their lives and yet not judge them for their many questionable actions, because we might have done the same or worse had we been in their shoes during their times."
"@joniro jonironin yeah those people are also wrong, in both cases its just an excuse to justify atrocities"
"I'm often disgusted at people's desire to avoid truly discussing such important issues when it's The Most Obvious Thing what happens *because we avoid it.* I had versions of this discussion twice in the last 20 hours, & no, I'm not kidding.
One person used the example of sitting back and watching any evil being like sitting back & watching an adult ""do violence to"" a child, the other one said they used prayer as a strategy against evil generally. Both of them gave these examples without me pushing.
Now try to picture someone refusing to physically try & stop the first situation & just praying *instead of* attempting to stop it. Not good enough? Okay. Make the aggressor Kim Jong-un & make the victim anyone you want.
There, that's it entirely. When we make the *aggressors* someone we don't regard suddenly the issue becomes crystal clear. If your best friend sat back & prayed *instead of* stopping this, you'd lose all respect for them. It's *only when* people make the mistake of conflating ""what a person means to Me Personally"" that it becomes confused.
Now: who here has the courage to discuss holding any supposed ""great men"" accountable for any of their evident crimes you would not hesitate to act against if perpetrated onto people you know by Kim Jong-un? In the reality of today?
Miutch McConnell illegally used his power in congress to block Heroic First Responders who made less & than him & never did him any harm nor offer him any threat from getting needed medical aid. He did this to enrich himself personally through his public office which is The Most Obvious conflict of interest in existence. It's illegal even for *a president* to do this. 
For obvious reasons.
No possible moral _OR_ legal defense. You'd have helped these people if they has asked you. If you caught *your own father* screwing them over like this for $ *he **_didn't even NEED_* you'd be disgusted. Yet we regularly refuse to stand up when there _no_ grey area.
So why bring it up?"
"@Gayatri Savarkar There is a little catch though, Feynman was American, the country that proclaims the right of being the world's sheriff and has never lost a war. Haber on the other hand, hailed from historically infamous Germany, which lost both world wars. Had Haber been one of the scientists of the Allies, how mired would he be in shame? Laurels are always lapped up by victors, who restructure the subsequent history, and those who lose are left licking their wounds. Here's my unsolicited take on history.😅"

"What it shows me is someone who cared little about human life. Don't forget the natrium was highly profitable and had something to prove apparently. Feeding people seemed like an happy accident to me. Some chemical weapons are discovered by accident, he made them on purpose. He had a dedicated lab for it. It was his choice to kill people in horrible ways. That does not seem Nobel worthy to me. Natrium production might show he was smart. His life choices show something else."

"Wow, I only learned from this video that sea birds actually grow their islands taller by pooping through the eons. Could this have actually helped some of these species survive rising sea levels over deep time periods or is the phosphate resistant enough against the rising tides?"
"@Fred Werza Humans don't need to spend an eternity building poop towers, we have land moving machinery and construction technology. 

I was just wondering whether this trait has enabled these bird species to cope with rising sea levels in the deep past. 

If it is a survival mechanism, it would be one factor behind these birds choosing to nest on specific islands through countless generations. But it can also just be a byproduct of the species nesting on the same islands over these time periods too of course. 

It seems to give them an advantage in any case, as the solidified poop increases the island's surface volume over time and thus provides more nesting space for the species."
I'm not sure I wanna live in a world where humans need to stack their own poop hundreds of feet high just to survive the rising ocean levels

"The end question presumes a moral absolute that is universally true, and not colored by your basis on a modern western moral framework.   What is moral to one person may seem immoral to another.   Fritz Haber acted on what he felt was moral, his love of country and people (The people part further reinforced by his resigning in solidarity with his fellows), and wanted to end the war quickly rather than having a long protracted war that young men get thrown into like a meat grinder.    The same reasoning as to why some including myself would say that the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan were moral and justified, without which Japan never would have surrendered and the war could have gone on years longer, maybe over a decade, with many countless additional lives lost both in war itself and to suicide as people throw themselves off cliffs rather than surrender.    Granted,  Haber wasn't against Japan and Japan's culture was especially resistant to surrender.      But it's still none the less the comfort of modern retroflection that can too easily condemn the actions of a man in the past living under a different moral framework, and experiencing immediate present dangers and decisions.  

And no, not just anyone can invent something.   There may be countless civilization defining technologies that have been skipped or lost because of failed opportunity,  and in many cases it may take years to decades before even a needed invention might come to fruition.   Haber was in a unique position to discover his process.   Without him it could have been a long time until someone else finds a / the same way.  


If Germany won WWI Haber would unambiguously be called a hero today.    And WWII wouldn't have happened, Nazi's wouldn't have existed, Germany wouldn't ever have been taboo in the first place."

"The judgement is clear in this case - you made chemicals to help starvation, good but you also tend to build weapon of mass destruction - which makes first part of sentence meaningless."
"One of the biggest misconceptions in chemistry is that FORMING a bond releases energy, not breaking one. Once you introduce nitrogen, it's game over..."
"There's a correction needed. When diatomic nitrogen forms, it releases a huge amount of energy, but that's not what causes the explosion. When solid ammonium nitrate is fused, it forms nitrogen gas, oxygen gas and water vapour. A huge volumetric change happens in the container where solid ammonium nitrate gets fused and this expansion of volume is what causes explosion."
"Derek, please expand upon possible answers to your final question in future videos."
This needs to be a new series documentary about significant scientists.
"Science is the discovery of powerful tools.  Ethics is the discipline of using them.

As Derek hinted rhetorically, we have a solemn responsibility -- individually and as a society -- to apply good ethics to our technology.  Our survival may depend on it."
"12:48 about that explosion back in the 1920s at BASF in germany. they had (and probably still have) GIANT silos to store their fertilizer, a mix of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate. quality control wasn't very good back then, so the ratio of those chemicals slipped into a range where the stuff turned explosive. the problem was that the powder (or granules or whatever it was) had a tendency to cake together, so they used dynamite to break it apart again. one day they did just that, and the whole silo, containing 1000s, maybe even 10s of 1000s of metric tons (yes, those silos are THAT big!) exploded. the explosion was heard as far away as munich, which is 400 km (250 miles) away. needless to say it caused severe damage in oppau and the surrounding area.
at BASF they have a road called ""trichterstrasse"". for the longest time i thought ""trichter"" referred to a funnel, something that is used all the time in the chemical industry, but then i learned that it actually refers to the big crater left by that explosion.
19:53 you don't need a chemist to grab nitrogen out of the air. there are plants that have been doing that long before any chemist even thought about the problem."

You need a higher theory, one which actually relates to material conditions rather than metaphysical speculation. 

The demand to find an alternative supply of nitrogen and to construct chemical weapons came from the material consequence of industrialization and development of capitalism causing the overfarming of land and intense competition between companies and countries for resources. 

Only once you understand these larger context and relationships of material history can you actually answer the questions you ask, like the questions in this video."

Task failed successfully
"Irrelevant? No. I'd use the word insignificant. No matter how great his invention is, used for prosperity or warfare, his life in the context of him and his family at the end was insignificant. I am obviously using his wife's suicide for my theory here, but he was a man capable of creating and causing great things. A hero or a villain. In the end it depends on who tells the story and truth is somewhere in the middle."
I knew about how the nitrogen cycle worked in a scale to feed billions. I loved the combined history and chemistry lessons.
they don't teach real history like this anywhere.
"The conclusion can also be reversed. Scientists working on nuclear weapons gave us the nuclear plants too, they are maybe the only reliable way to have energy without destroying the environment as much as fossile fuels today.

The net result of science and technology is still positive, there are more humans thanks to it, there would be certainly more risks in stopping them than letting them move us forward. That's said, scientist's ethics must be checked, they should not be more free than other citizen to do immoral things just because they are the ones who know more."

"If Haber is demonized for chemical weapons, then Einstein should also get demonized for Atom Bomb, afterall he begged for creation of Atom bomb to Roosevelt which led to Manhattan Project. History is really unkind to some."
"This is also really suggestive to what happened during that period in Germany.

Pre World War 1 a truely patriotic, love of country nationalism swept the country into a brutal and horrific war. The after 20 years of suffering for that mistake, that sadness turned to hate and you had even greater horrors in the second world war. Haber had a beautiful life, and he, and the rest of the nation threw that a way indulging something in themselves they shouldn't have been indulging. He got off the train when the Nazi's came too power, and many Germans did. But by that time, it was to late. What happened to Haber happened to millions."
"Yeah people mix up ww1 with ww2 a lot. 
Today usually we're not angry at the people that build weapons for Ukraine to defend against russians. 
WW1 wasn't a war like ww2 where we had a clear villain. The Nazis weren't involved in ww1, there was no holocaust either yet. The Germans weren't really the bad guys there and didn't even really start the war. It was just a bunch of nobles that fought about who has the bigger cake, which took the population with them and escalated."
"I thought they mistitled the video, when they spoke about the most important nobel price winner and shortly after about bird poop."
"Why does people in the past quote in letters, rather than saying something properly?"
"The key word is ""intent"". That's why Fritz Haber remains known as a scientist without ethics, for being the inventor of the trenches combat gas, while Albert Einstein remains known as a lovely genius, even if he participated in the creation of the atomic bomb and can also be indirectly linked to hundreds of thousands of horrible death."
"Whenever I hear stories like these, both of Fritz Haber and Thomas Midgley Jr. from the lead episode, I always think back to an English chapter I had in my school of Bertrand Russel about Knowledge and Wisdom. It is such a profound thought process anyone ambitious should pause to think about"

Interesting. You said that someone else could have eventually discovered the way to make amonia from the air… but when? Is the important question. And would that hypothetical person be supported to develop that technology? I have been saying for three years that the spectrum of light can be explained with the RGB model and no one has listened. Will someone else discover that in 50 years?
Too bad the planet is overburdened. Discoveries like this unfortunately contributed most to overpopulation. It would have been better if all those had starved or never been born

"It's not like I didn't realise this strategy before, but it still terribly unnerving to be told in the face that professionals all over the world were on a race to invent chemical weapons that was great at killing off massive number of people swiftly; and they believed that the use of such weapons was ultimately beneficial in the way of ending war more soon.  If this logic/strategy was put onto simulation, I believe the result would be a wipe out of the majority of lives on earth.  To dominate opposing countries by means of exterminating their people with extreme efficiency is terribly short-sighted and ignorant and inhumane.  How could anyone claim this to be insightful and problem-solving.  How dare they did."

""'Is science of any value? I think a power to do something is of value. ... 'To every person is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell.' And so it is with science. In a way it is a key to the gates of heaven, and the same key opens the gates of hell, and we do not have any instructions as to which is which gate. Shall we throw away the key and never have a way to enter the gates of heaven? Or shall we struggle with the problem of which is the best way to use the key? That is, of course, a very serious question, but I think that we cannot deny the value of the key to the gates of heaven."""

If the number of deaths tallied in total should be how much you are villainised, Einstein and all others in the Manhatten project would be the worst beings ever to exist. Demons, even. Yet the nuke was used due to the exact same reason: this could end the war and save much more lives than it could take. What happened to him wasn't uncalled for, but the folks here ignorant of the fact that the winners get to write history is appalling. I'm not saying he's right: he killed millions, and one is already way too many for anyone. But the man was just serving his country, even though he was irresponsible and shortsighted about it all.

Ammonium Nitrate is a common commercial explosive, but nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose are made with nitric *acid,* which made with different process.
His work on chemical weapons is less defensible, though it's interesting to note that his premise was arguably correct. A sufficiently horrific weapon *would* make war such a dangerous prospect that empires would actively seek to avoid it. Chemical weapons just weren't sufficiently horrifying.

Don’t want to be a bother but if going down to 2.7 has so little impact at a global level, it makes climate deniers seem justified in their claims. 
And don’t give me that “well lower emission countries would go up” crap since india is at 2 and china is at 7 and most of the countries with low emissions have tiny populations so them increasing could be cancelled out by the US alone."

"""Innumerable human lives would be saved if the war could be ended more quickly in this way"" isn't that the SAME excuse the USA used for atomic bomb?

Help humanity... what does that mean?
Te scientist who discovered that by washing his hand he could prevent innumerable lives, increasing the live average live span of humans significantly... was that to help humanity? or longer lifespan, means more human, meaning faster nitrogen depletion of the ground, meaning famine, meaning less human.

Is it helping humanity to kill 1 in order to save 5?
Is it helping humanity to save 1 if it result in 5 death?

I think the best illustration I have come from Darkmatter2525 ""If man Obeyed God"". In this parody, he talk about an alternate universe where the christian Bible God exist and Adam and Eve didn't eat the forbidden fruit. So human remains immortal, no need to eat, no need to breath, and simply reproduced non stop (nothing else to do) and about 100k years later, you have a layer of living insect, a layer of living animal and a layer of living human (immortal so unable to die) and Adam and Eve walking on top of that layer (riding a dinosaure) talking with God...
Paradise as imagine by the bible writters, paradis where death, pain, hunger, do not exist, ultimately become hell. So death, pain and hunger are present to help humanity.
Even if this comical sketche is bases on religion and the math might be a bit off, the concept remain real.

And maybe our obsession to reach that immortal state (ever increasing our lifespan, reducing the pain from aging, making sure everyone got enough food, basically removing hunger etc...) will lead toward a fate worst then hell.
We started as insignificant animal with barely an impact on our environment
And with each new technological discovery we hit a new ""population wall""
Small tribes moving around cannot grow very big, so if 90% of the babies dies, it's a good thing
we got bigger with sedentary, no longer need to move we can have sturdier shelter for better protection against weather and predator, but then as population density grow disease and virus start limiting our population
we discover medecine, allowing us to grow even denser
We discover washing our hand, allowing use to grow even denser, but now we start depleting ground
We discover nitrogen, breaking that wall and allowing us to reach 8 billions
what will be the next wall? Energy? Land?"

It is in my view that the first world war is fundamentally different from the second world war, in that instead of being a battle of good vs evil (Nazis and Japan vs everyone else), it was instead simply us vs them, Allies vs central powers. No side was either good or evil, simply 2 opposing alliances. As well, war was something still romanticized and not fully understood and developed at the time. Haber was simply making new weapons to bring an end to the war which was crippling the german economy and its people."
"Also u forgot to add that Haber himself was Jewish,but still loyal towards Germany"
"There's an argument to be made that things would been better if this hadn't happened.
Millions would have died from starvation, but our population never would have soared to almost 8 billion in a century. Fewer people means we'd have a smaller impact on the planet.
A smaller population is much more sustainable. Industries would've been much smaller, emissions significantly lower, we'd have been able to stave off climate change for several more decades, possibly even centuries."

And it's so sad that whatever good science will achieve, there would always be a dangerous side to it. And we will have to make a choice then. But I truly hope that we will choose the good. That people will place humanity above all.

"The answer to the last question is that we all need to develop an ethical and moral framework.

"the answer to your question at ~20:40 is morals/ethics/community.
The desire better others aside from yourself will lead to outcomes where humanity grows kinder and better. The desire to better yourself alone leads to theft/murder/rape.
Faith is generally a useful tool to this end. Especially for those with lower intelligence. As such it's best to start with faith early in one's development, so regardless whether they continue to believe in adulthood, their worldview will only stray from the faith while keeping the distilled morals the faith meant to instill from the start."

Shall we throw away the key and never have a way to enter the gates of heaven? Or shall we struggle with the problem of which is the best way to use the key?

"@Filipe yeah and we have to note that Haber wasn't a Nazi, they weren't in power yet back then. There was no holocaust or world domination fantasies. He wanted to end the war same like the US ended ww2."
"Underrated comment. First thing that came to my mind. We never hear the tales of how the project Manhattan's scientists peers rejected them. In fact, I often hear the same explanation of how 'those deaths saved many more lives'. I'm not defending the morals behind the Axis in WW2, but it's saddens me that the death of so many innocent people (including children) can be held in such a different light nowadays compared, like in this case, the deaths of soldiers in the battlefield. Haber may have been responsible for the death of many, but he was doing what he thought was the best for his country, despite it being a very bad thing. To me, Haber is as much a villain as Roosevelt, Truman and all the members of Manhattan Project. Truly the history is told by the one who wins the war."

"@Ali Eren Wow, you worked really hard to be so categorically wrong.

""warfare technologies"" HAVE to be developed otherwise someone wins that will put you into a concentration camp.

During WW1 it wasn't known wether chemical warfare would be effective or not, but they certainly thought it would be. Meaning anyone not doing it would outright lose.

So no, that's not murder. A Soldier isn't a murderer and neither is the person developing their weapons.

The reason certain actions are classed as warcrimes is because they're both cause unnceccesary suffering and are not aimed at winning a war, meaning they're ineffective.

Gas was found to be so later, which is why it wasn't used in WW2.

If you refuse to kill someone in war you lose, meaning those with less moral scruples win. good job. lol"
"@Freemind He is dead, it doesn’t matter whether I blame him right now or not. 

The fact is, he has made an active effort to improve the German military’s efficiency during his lifetime- pretty much the entire way through, and he explicitly admitted that the faster the German army can roll over nations by committing mass atrocities, the faster the war would be over. He explicitly admitted that he wants to improve weaponry to kill more people, faster. So weird to act like this isn’t as clear-cut of a moral dilemma as it gets. 

He incidentally came up with a method that would benefit humanity (which in his absence would have been discovered sooner or later regardless) and then spent the rest of his life perfecting weapons of mass murder. 

I do not see the gray-zone here."
"@optimchs1 No it wasn't incorrect. I was not endeavouring to articulate every single killing during wartime - I was generalising. However, bear in mind, that ALL ""laws"" definiing a lawful killing are simply made up, which is why America refuses to be held accountable to international war crimes tribunals. Ultimately, ""murder"" is simply a definitional act, not the act of killing itself."
"@Nonya Bisness I love how you wanted to sound smart so you started talking about definitions in law, as if you know anything about anything, but you still ended up being entirely and unambiguously wrong. 

For one, laws as we understand them today, are informed by morality and a collective desire to survive as humans. The most fundamental laws that we commonly have consensus on are informed by societal utilitarianism, we technically limit freedoms by introducing laws as these are, as a whole, beneficial to the broader society. In a morality scope, development of warfare technologies are by all means murder as much as stabbing a random person outside is. 

But leaving the prescriptive statements aside, chemical and biological weapons  are war crimes. They are by definition unlawful if that is your metric of what constitutes a murder."

"@Kent Detrick Haha ok. I was half joking. I think it would probably be even harder to get a highly enriched uranium from a molten salt reactor, it would be very hard to separate the material from the molten salt, no?"
"@werr kowalski The short answer is, this is highly unlikely.

The long answer... Uranium can be used in a bomb. The fuel salt will not be used in a bomb. You could process fuel salt to make a bomb maybe, but I have heard you can make the plant design highly resistant to this. I am not an expert in nuclear weapon proliferation however. I can say this is a major consideration that engineers intentionally take into consideration in their plant designs. The NRC will not likely approve plant designs that do not meet the safety requirements."
"@The founding titan Eren Yeager At this point, the roadblocks overlap so much between the applications I can say I am working on both! Uranium will likely be developed first because we already have the experience and some infrastructure for it. Then thorium will come after. It's possible that some plant designs will be able to run on either one, but this is less likely. Thorium will likely have some extra salt processing steps and design quirks that will make it different enough for a unique plant design."

"Every time you hear predictions of doom and gloom, remember that an ever growing population eventually produced the mind who solved each such crisis already.

None of humanity's ""existential crisis"" points have ever come to pass.  If you think about it hard enough, you'll realize that this must be the case.

Given humanity's record of unbroken victories over existentisl threats, should you really fear the next one, be it war, aliens, viruses, ecology, whatever?

The scientific evidence has zero data points for you to fear, and infinite evidence you should not live in fear."

"it is dumb to say fertilizers have added 4 billion more people, humans have sustained without artificial fertilizers and pesticide for millenia, and we see today how their excess usage has eroded all nutrition from soil worldwide and also they are biggest of environmental pollutants

intelect is worthless without wisdom to use it!"
Oh man! I know what this is about before seeing the video and it's exciting!

"@Pluviophile I can't remember honestly if it was actually in my syllabus. But I wanted his biography to be featured in like English prose, so that many ppl could learn about it."
Haven't you heard of Fritz-Haber process of extracting Nitrogen.
"What we can maybe learn from Fritz Haber's life, is that that nothing in science is either all good or all bad.
Science never carries intention, only the search for more knowledge. 
It is then up to society as a whole to decide how to use that knowledge, to make the world either better or worse."

"@Eduardo Zardo Aer you kidding me?

Do you think a terrorist thinks his fight is bad? Do you think an Antisemit thinks the Holocaust was bad? They justify the cruelties with a ""greater goal"" and so even murder becomes ""good"" in their mind.

Good and bad only depends on the persons point of view and might differ between people."
@Agilemind I don't know much about Haber but I guess he was just doing what he could to help his country win a war --- same with Oppenheimer
14:55 same as the atomic bomb
"you could say that hes responsible for billions of people being born, but all that does is lower the value of labor. im not saying we should kill off billions of people, but having billions of more workers means wages go down significantly. allowing the ruling class to not only have all the labor they could ever want, but also have it be as cheap as they want. the reason american politicians dont want abortion rights, and want to demonize LGBTQ people is because the birth rate is too low to maintain the population, meaning less and less workers are being born in america, meaning soon theyll have to raise the cost of labor. They want more and more workers in order to keep the cost of labor down, and they will demonize anyone who refuses to make more workers for them."
"​@Chris Johnson  Nup. Prices since 1920 have multiplied by 13.5, not by 87.2.
13.52 times $0.17/hr = $2.30/hr

If you want to start labelling people you had better first make sure you have your facts right."
"@Godfrey Pigott you're arguing semantics. Labourers are workers, theyre literally synonyms, and i dont need to factor in those things because they dont matter. For instance, the average hourly wages for your average worker in 1920 was 17 cents an hour. With inflation accounted for that comes out to $14.82 an hour. And while the federal minimum wage NOW is $15 an hour, thats just for federal employees. Most states still have a $7 minimum wage. And you may also say that the average citizen in the US makes almost $30 an hour, those numbers account for EVERY citizen, not just your average employee, it accounts for billionaires aswell so thats not quite a good statistic to use, so if we look at the average hourly wages for employees that number comes out to $10.86 as of last month. Idk about you, but $10.86 an hour seems quite a bit less than $14.82 an hour... but go on, continue with your BS, I love to watch clowns."
"​@Chris Johnson  I specifically said ""labourer"", not the entire population. 

Also you didn't factor in the reduced number of average working hours since 1920. Anyone who chooses to work the same hours as a century is earning heaps of overtime which is not accounted for in your figures. I see how that might confuse ""people like you""."
"@Godfrey Pigott actually when you account for inflation, the average annual income has lowered by a few thousand dollar since 1920. In 1920 the average annual income was $3,269. The average annual income now is about $45,000. When inflation is accounted for, however, that $3,269 is the equivalent of about $48,000 in today's money... so, we're making less money. Theyve not only stagnated our wages, theyve found a way to use inflation as a way to make people like you THINK that we're making more, when we aren't making any more than we used to, and are arguably making less."
The average labourer is earning *much* more today (in real terms) than they were 100 years ago.

It's not fair to use the same title for a video about Thomas midgley and Fritz Habor. It's just undermining the IQ of your audience
I really like how you pronounce the German names of people and cities. It really shows much efforts and I appreciate that!
"i can't think of another nation who is responsible for so many technological and scientific innovations in the 20th century and especially during the world wars and the interwar period out of necessity. jet engine, synthetic fuel, delta wing, modern submarine, fuel injection, rocket technology, glider, nitrogen procurement method, you name it. some of these the Germans didn't invent but perfected to the extreme limit."
"The research that you have been doing for the videos is amazing .. . which includes a list of scientists , mathematicians and people who people generally overlook. . !!!
Great Work. . .👍👍"
German science is a land of contrasts
WHY EVERY REVOLUTIONARY SCIENTIST CAN BE TRACED BACK TO GERMANY?!
"Science is indeed a double edged sword, may it be Fritz haber or Alfred nobel"
"thanks for such an eye opener video,
it's quite funny how after explaining the strength of nitrogen bond he broke it by just a punch.
may be boxers would have found the nitrogen first :)"

"Buy local, try to grow your own food."
Almost as if world is not black and white...
"I was first introduced to this character/scientist in ""GENIUS"" series and felt bad about his tragic death"
Wow
"Great video as usual.

But the outro was a trying a little too hard to be politically correct in my opinion.

""If he wasn't going to invent chemical weapons, someone else would have"".
Well then can't we can paint any corrupt action into gold with this logic?

In my opinion, he was a great chemist for sure, and done his best for the good and the bad.

Who are we to judge?"
"@SuperCrazyfin ofcourse, but that would be an entirely different variant of human history and we can not speculate if it would have been better or worse for the universe. Hence ""who are we to judge?"""
"No? There are many actions that are unique in history and many that are inevitable. If humanity continued research into chemistry theyd end up creating something that we consider a ""chemical weapon""."
For every good there is more evil.
Insane ! This guy is probably the reason that i’m alive and he is also contributed to the death of my people in the holocaust !
Bro that intro was crazy
"Scientific discoveries aren't a double edge sword, its  a single edge, and the wielder chooses how they want to use the sword. If we want to end the self destructive nature, we need to stop thinking of war as an opportunity to experiment and discover better methods of killing each other."
Oklahoma city was a fertilizer bomb
Great Quality Video.
"""someone else would've done it"" — is a logical fallacy. Try to think beforehand about your doings. Yes, none of us have prediction powers to understand that a fertiliser would be used in war. But developing an awful deadly gas? The outcome of this is quite easy to predict."
"So albert einstein hated war thats why he wrote to america for atom bomb.....
And this poor chap ised amonia in war so he loved war...."
"The 2022 economic collapse of Sri Lanka is directly related to their disastrous and sudden move away from modern fertilizers. Their food system collapsed.  Millions of people could still die.

""Innumerable human lives could be saved if I make this weapon that will kill and maim innumerable enemies of my country"".   Ah. Killing makes sense because if we get good enough at killing we'll get what we want and then the killing can stop.  Ah Fritz."
I don't think I'd ever heard about Haber before. What a fascinating and tragic story.

I like your channel it is amazing!
Very cool video! I hope you keep on uploading content about unknown but interesting people :)
"""So why did people want poop-covered islands so badly?""

Derek finally asking the right questions"
"You know the whole colony of roseate spoonbills story was a cover up. Real reason someone was interested in the guano island is, let me quote Wikipedia on that, ""working with the Russians and has built an elaborate underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral"".

That's it. It's not about bird dung, or endangered birds, or even the dragon living on the island...

In case you missed the joke, it's the plot of Dr. No, the Ian Fleming novel that served as bases for the first Bond film."

I appreciate the nuanced view on scientific discoveries that are used for both good and bad. Thanks!
I knew Haber's process is important for exam but I didn't knew it's important for our life also 🙃

"I watched the video till 1:39
And I can bet 10000$ it's about an artificial fertilizer"
@Maksiks sheesh
"Ha, I was right"
Demented sociopaths.
knowledge without empathy for humanity often leads to disaster and death.
"Nothing wrong with scientific discovery, it's self-serving politicians that are the problem."
"now i tought thanos as a hero, far better than other....."
"Unfortunately he solved the wrong problem, by allowing unsustainable farming practices that deplete the soil to continue unabated, to support an ever ballooning human and cattle population that the Earth cannot support without ecosystems collapsing within the coming years; we now are in an untenable position where every option results in massive die offs, both of humans, and animal species.

He ""saved"" billions by subverting the need to change our farming methods and practice proper societal planning, thus dooming us all. Combined with legacy energy titans stymieing transition to renewables (in energy and packaging), and overfishing, the ecosystem will take millions of years to recover from the ""advances"" of twentieth century industrialization.

In the end, the chemical weapons were the more minor evil."
"It's ironic isn't it? This guy is responsible for the deaths of thousands, but also responsible for having food in our plates. He kinda damned us and also saved us. Don't know what to say"
I was struggling about if I am a good or a bad person and then I learn about what Fritz Haber did. I came to the conclusion that there is not good and bad or black and white but something in between. Fritz Haber was good and bad. A hero and a villain. And that is ok.
quite a feat to influence history centuries into the future with a risk-taking invention.

I actually did my Internship at the Fritz-Haber-Institute in Berlin 3 month ago
I am sick of youtubers using a dude not many people know of to gain curiosity and attribute him responsible for something extremely huge. Just a few days ago there was a video about an American guy who killed the most people in the world.

"What a person to be proud of as a german, and what a person to be deeply ashamed of as a german"
"11:00 Lol, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute has an actual Pickelhaube helmet."
"If Fritz were born American, or French, or British, or as part of any country of the allied forces, he would be regarded a hero."
"@Sixtus 95 dude. Which number you had your ticket to the show does not mean much when you consider what happened before and after assassination. Go read Germany's activities before the war and right at the beginning of it. They actually pushed Austria to go to the war. They had been itching for a war for so long. There were many points the war could have been prevented and at each step Germany made sure those efforts would be futile and sabotaged them at every step. 

If you are really curious there is a podcast. Great war. Go listen to it."
"​@arnoldhau1 But why did Germany start it though? They were the fourth party after Russia, Serbia and Austria to join. Why stop there and not after the fifth?  England and France joining made it a world war, openend the western front"
"@Sixtus 95 Austria declared war on Serbia and Germany decided to honour the alliance and join. Yes it exploded because of all those alliances but that changes nothing about the fact that Austria and Germany (or technically Austria) started that war and not the other side.

It was well known to anyone this will explode beyond a regional conflict most likely. Especially in Austria."
"@arnoldhau1 no they didn't. War started as a regional conflict between Austria and Serbia?. Russia wanted to protect it, so did Germany with Austria. So did England and France for Russia. So in the end everyone is to blame because they hold their word of alliance."
@Sixtus 95 well Austria and Germany started that war
"""[a catalyst] Lowers the amount of energy to split diatomic nitrogen"" 8:21

is that right? I feel the amount of energy to split a bond must still be the same, otherwise you could form the bond again without the catalyst and get more energy out?

I thought a catalyst just increases the rate of successful collisions so that the reaction takes less time for a given temp and pressure."
"@Tony Dai Right so normally you just lose some to heat pushing it over the edge, I see thanks."
"The starting and ending energy is the same, but the energy needed to get there is reduced.

Think of it like climbing up a slope to a plateau, and there’s a rim on the edge of the plateau that goes further up.

The catalyst reduces the height of that rim, but the plateau height stays the same."
"Well, if it takes less time for a certain amount to be produced, then you've used less energy overall for that amount of product."
"I often remember about him! Unlucky guy, but good man!"
biotech is now the double edge sword that could cause the end
Tough comparison between Haber and Midgely Jr.
Same as Enstein and the nuclear bomb.
Let's all take a deep breath and think about the fact that people went to war for bird poop. Tell that to someone without context.
Thank you for doing a video on Dr. Haber.  He has been one of my favorite figures from history for more than two decades; you do not truly appreciate the breadth of what it means to be human and the profound irony of history until you understand the life of Fritz Haber.

"He killed the earth's soil.
NPK stops plants from gathering their own nitrogen via mutualistic root exudations (a process which builds soil carbon and fertility). The constant, increasing application eventually kills the soil as we are seeing all across the world since the ""Green Revolution"". 

Trying to understand the complexity of soil by studying chemistry alone is like trying to understand Shakespeare by studying the alphabet."
"Is this a *""punirne uno per educarne mille""* reference?"
Can we maybe get a follow up with the other two ppl who got a Nobel price for this? Bosch who scaled it up and that guy in the early 2000s who found out the exact mechanism used it this synthesis.

If my teacher taught me Haber's process like this in my class i would have never forget anything. Btw gonna remember the process thanks for the video 👍
"Guano, fertiliser, nitrogen?"
Seriously... Just now I was studying about Fritz Haber 🤯🤯 coincidence 😱
Here before this blows up
"he was jewish, not german"
As you confuse race and nationality.
"are you trying to copy the show ""dark matters twisted but true"". it had similar topics and format."
Bring indian scientist in your videos please🙏🙏🙏
"So he single-handedly is responsible for the massive overpopulation we find ourselves in right now, resulting in staggering amounts of pollution and climate change. Yup, I'd say that is pretty impactful."
"anyone from india who remember habers process studied in class 12 ncert p block
for jee board or neet i do"
yes
i do
"Oh good, Now I know who to blame for over population..."
Swede here. Nobel gave the Norwegians the right to give out the Nobel Peace Prize. And ever since then they've only given it out to war criminals. The head of NATO is a former Norwegian social democrat politician. I bet watching the current events right now Nobel would be turning around in his grave.
"It's staggering to me that there were people who could think that out of the box and came up with such brilliant ideas. Simplest chemistry to me is a mistery yet our spiecies was so knowledge hungry that it could produce such extraordinary ideas out of nothing. It's simply said, Wondrous
Edit: God I'm such an idiot that I wrote the comment before finishing video. Obviously I didn't mean chemical warfare that was developed by Haber is great invention, neither is posion gas that later was used to commit holocaust. Like the creator said, this inventions can be both used in a good way or the bad way. Guess that's a price for progress, nevertheless I think it is job of us all to at least try paying attention to the new technological inventions and try remembering that they can be very dangerous if in wrong hands. Thanks for reading and sorry for my carelessness."
I make better content than veritasium 😎😎😎😎
"Regarding the holocaust, if only people listened to what the revisionists have to say about it..."
"Nah even the weapons are genius inventions, only the purpose is deeply wrong. You can create masterpieces of the mind for really bad purpose. Even really awful things like nuclear bombs are still genius pieces of engineering. Engineering is about reaching a GIVEN goal in the most efficient and elegant way but does not care about the moral of the goal that much. If the goal is to kill millions of people, it will still give you the most efficient and elegant way to do it. Thats why we should put at least the same amount of energy into developing our wisdom (purpose) compared to the energy we put into increasing our knowledge and power"

I am quite sure guano was a  bad example as it’s benefit is mostly the phosphorus which ecological circle has no part in the atmosphere.
"I have a question about Hildebrandt's experiment with attempting to form ammonia under the ocean. You said that his goal was to increase the pressure, meaning that the molecules would collide more often. However if there is a sealed amount of gas inside the bottle, then submerging it in the ocean would only increase the pressure outside of the bottle, correct? There are a set number of molecules inside so how could the pressure increase? The only thing that comes to mind that could change the pressure is the decreasing temperature in the depths of the ocean, which would actually decrease pressure within the bottle. I feel I may be missing something here, is someone able to explain it to me?"
"Maybe he just thought, if nothing else works, may as well throw it in the ocean."
"@Danyel Nicholas thanx for the update. I thought if I don't look it up someone will correct me. I was hurrying doing meals at the time I posted. Couldn't even pause it, I was engrossed."
"@Paul Eckersley 1) did not exist yet, 2) is brittle. Hildebrandt died in 1808, Bakelite was invented around 1909. A piston would make more sense, but maybe a bladder would be conceivable."
"@Sudazima This would work in theory, but it would be so difficult to keep the opening of the flask parallel to the ocean's surface that I think it would be impractical. The bottle would eventually just flip over and the air would escape."
"@guppy719 I don't know, seems like you're really selling modern education short here. Newton's physicist contemporaries were by all standards super geniuses of their era, but a 16 year old from 1850 could have told them that a pencil will fall as fast as a hammer and they would have been laughed out of the room. Allegories for the same exist for any interval of time. 

Our education builds on the shoulders of these giants, and many discoveries that seem trivial matters of course, like pencils and hammers falling at the same speed, are in fact radical thought to folks of that era."

"6:00 - Aren't you a chemist? Using eV for bond strength is, lets say, unusual ;) kJ/mol please :)"
"@Disciple Peter I know that eV is very common among physicists. And in that context it often makes sense to use that. But this is chemistry - you will never encounter a single molecule, so there's absolutely no use in using a very abstract unit like eV. The relative sizes of the numbers can be understood either way, so I would have guessed a chemist would use a more useful unit that's understood by more people. Of course kJ/mol isn't understood by everyone either, but it should be more universal than eV."
"He was only talking about one molecule of each, so eV is a very reasonably sized unit. Plus I don’t know about chemistry, but in physics at least eV is a super common and useful unit."
Never been sooo early
I love your videos
"So glad to see our boy Tom from Ex&F mentioned, such a great thing they worked together! And a great video, of course!"
"As a chemist who is working on electrochemical water splitting, I Just got goosebumps throughout the video. Maybe because in my childhood Haber's process was my favourite, simple yet extraordinary. Thank you for making this video. It felt delightful."
"if you making hydrogen- electric engine to make that hyundai concept car, thank you for your service, lol"
"@arkatub this is called ""high-throughput screening"" and some scientists do specialize in that for catalysts (though it's more common for drugs). Random gases and pressures don't make sense. We know what reactants are capable of forming what products, you will never get ammonia from oxygen and chlorine. We also generally know whether we need high or low pressure from L'Chatlier's principle, so it's not ""random pressure"" so much as the ideal pressure economically."

I don’t think most soldiers full this metric?"
"@Hi i am Elecktro By this metric, every person working in any military is a monster. That is, by far, an overstatement"
"@Hi i am Elecktro Well, he did it with noble intentions. You have to remember that the war was killing thousands, sometimes even tens of thousands of men a day. If 100.000 have to die miserably to end that, then one could argue that it's justified. Of course, it wouldn't work out that way, but Haber didn't know that. Calling him evil is, in my opinion, unfair."
"I feel like this is a weird thing to say about a man that caused the death of 100k people in one of the most inhumane ways possible.

Like, sure he was really smart, but I just kinda think that that’s a very weird thing to say.

I hope we can agree that he was a really bad person. (Regardless of intellect)
I would even consider him a monster and I find it weird to complement a monster, even if the compliment was true/deserved."

"Would be interesting considering Death Cab for My Wheelchair Steven Hawking was fascinated and a bit ridiculous with his use and interpretation of Planck's distance and so on and so forth to ends that were philosophically and quantitatively more problematic that say, perhaps, in terms of theoretical physics. Theoretical physics has become the modern metropolis for intellectual waste and nihilism - an atheistic breeding ground of male surnames and a clearly perceived air of chauvinistic antagonism towards anybody who dares to have the nerve to question the preeminent surnames and schools of the modern day! Let them be anathema, even as they despise how religion has been historically ""responsible for so much evil"" in their delusions of knowing and false impressions of history as it was lived out in fact, in objectivity by humans capable of recording behaviors and abstractions of apprehension and cognition as observational and self-reflective or reflexive beings in relationship to each other and the Other.

"So we owe over-population to this guy? Yeah, thanks Fritz."
"@Bill Magundie Ah yes, jokes can be difficult for some."
You can say the same thing about literally any technology that increases life expectancy or agricultural production. I don't know why you would blame the tools rather than the people using them.
Cue Ace Ventura

"enjoying the trend of videos, with the Thomas Midgley video and now this one"
"He saved billions, and I've never even heard of him. The only news we ever hear about, is bad news. 😞"
"He was on the losing side of the war. Compare to Albert Einstein who did write letters to the president to make nukelar wepons, AND was on the wining side."
I love your videos so much! THANKS FOR MAKING SUCH INFORMATIVE VIDEOS.
I was waiting for a new video from veritasium since the last video. It felt like i waited a thousand years.  Love your videos❤
Attack on titan Fritz?

Damn I caught this fast
Born Harber process
The interlude of bird poop talk confused me so much in the beginning
"Honestly, this is next-level, apex-mountain Veritasium."
Haber
"...I thought guano is bat poop
huh"
May be he is the real Ozymandias of Watchmen
Weird how life does this from time to time.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos — 🟥

I love you @Veritasium
that’s mad
It never stops amazing me how videos of such high quality can be uploaded so consistently.
Жду перевод от Vert Dider или Voice power
Name a character who has suffered more than Fritz Haber.
diavolo
Westley in the Princess Bride is said to have felt ultimate suffering
And they called him a madman!
"When i saw Guano, i inmediately thought of Ace Ventura 2 😂"
These historical videos are amazing. Thank you!
Being early to a veritasium video is very epic

Yay! My day always brightens a bit when a new Veritasium video drops
Few things pump me up more than a video of Derek waving an American flag
he's the opposite of Thomas Midgley Jr. lol
a scientist criminal who became an uncriminal for saving billions of people
Great video! They’re always so interesting.
I love this :D
Haber. man who made lightning in a bottle.
Was just thinking Veritasium has not uploaded any video in a while and for this a minute ago !!
Grow good dope with that stuff.
Joe Rogan's head just exploded.
How is this in my feed so fast ..it's not even in your video page
"Scientists who bootlicked, copied other, and self promoted have become famous .. there are 10000s of guys who have been the game changers but , their ideas and worked stolen !! We only loose good ideas/discoveries/inventions to plagiarism"
Love to see your posts. This will be fascinating to watch.
