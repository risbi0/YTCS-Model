UgxGPPv71UrOWTFjAoR4AaABAg,Best display smartphone under 30 k? Plz give me a reply bro
UgzmkbERvUo9LdSr3Pp4AaABAg,"OnePlus 6T is by far the best phone I have ever owned.  The company today has lost its way, the new phones are nowhere near as nice as the vintage models were.  The idea behind Nothing is that the founder knows how to make superb phones and offer things that nobody else can offer (like oxygen which allowed Oneplus users to avoid the annoying google gesture UI if they wanted to.)"

Ugyjq9jWLQYWaDyjW7B4AaABAg,It looks very very similar to an iPhone? Like I get all top notch phones look similar but this one is basically an iPhone. Surprised Apple is not suing them for this.
UgyY2C9QksFDaqXaVc54AaABAg,"Conclusion: The nothing phone is utter trash that can't even stand up to other phones in benchmarks. Can be absoluteluy trashed by a budget flagship killer at half the price. The chipset is old,slow and obsolete. Buy a xiaomi,poco,vivo,realme or oppo instead. Carl pei is essentialy operating a chinese phone company but wasted all the budget on marketing and useless back leds. Shame on carl pei."

Ugy9Qz4qzWyzOz7SF3l4AaABAg,"It‚Äôs actually quite cool. I saw this on my O2 app when I was looking to upgrade yesterday (what brought me here searching the phone). I already knew what phone I wanted, and nothing was changing that (iPhone 13 Pro Max. I know the iPhone in and out. And that‚Äôs very important as I use it so much for work and normal life, I need to know the functionality, which has been learnt over many of year. Furthermore, the size of perfect, design etc). I rang to upgrade, but as I went to check for accessories after, earbuds. I saw this. Seeifn this video. This phone does look really cool. Definitely a good move to the future. The design, and snd the cool, and very useful features (if they actually end up working as suggested here. Even if they don‚Äôt, in use the bugs will get reported and it will get developed and fixed). Having colours on the back of the phone to light up, and go with the ringtone, and what you expect. Looks very ‚ÄúCyberpunk 2077‚Äù. Very futuristic, but futuristic with a very useful purpose, and not just for the sake of it!"
UgyyqMaBaR915pwEZ0N4AaABAg,I loved this futuristic phone in white color ! I wonder why other manufacturers don't make such an example ?

Ugy5fA2DV979Fw0j7sZ4AaABAg,"What they primarily need to focus on their Nothing Phone is change the phone design completly. For a person who doesn;t kno of Nothing Phone, if those people see this phone from a distance in daytime they gonna see a apple iphone x with a custom cover...nothing else and flashy lights which "" looks cool "".  Standing out in this market doesnt necessarily means to put cool ringtones with flashy lights designs and a "" good "" camera."

UgwOXQed3rPAgqeL19B4AaABAg,"Nothing is a whole marketing bullshit. The damn thing is another Android phone as the rest and ‚ÄûNothing‚Äú more, ha ‚Ä¶ ha ‚Ä¶ ha ‚Ä¶.

And then they claim to deliver ‚Äûthe extra nothing feel to this‚Äú.
This is a perfect example how to manipulate the dumb mass and how to make money out of it, only with marketing and not a good over the average line product.
Don‚Äôt be so silly and buy this thing only based of the marketing they make. They are laughing at the consumers."

Every time when you need to read a message, you have to turn around ! After reading it, need to turn to back again ! You also could accidentally scratch the screen if your table got some tiny sand, especially having lunch or dinner outside with friends. Look Cool but not practical to use."

The reason which I switched to iOS from Android is lots of shitty apps and bloatwares in Chinese phones and their custom ROMs. India is full of Chinese smartphone shits, Nokia and Motorola might have Stock ROM but their camera is not good and for brands like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Realme they may come off with pretty decent cameras but lots of bloatwares and unnecessary apps. On the flip side even though Oneplus features are top notch when it comes to camera and UI but I didn‚Äôt like the fact they put some Custom UI skin u might get a feel for Stock ROM but being a Motorola Moto G2 User once I feel something is lacking in these Chinese phones they don‚Äôt have Google roll outs for new versions and the look and feel for stock androids are way higher. I genuinely miss my Motorola Moto G2 which was a 3G phone and it is obsolete now.

We always tend to fall back to the basic usage of the phone ( although the term basic can vary from person to person ) the point here is, all we want is a phone with good hardware and software quality but in cheaper cost, only if OEM's try to reduce the profit per phone ratio and actually build phones for users maybe it can help both the customer as well as the company.

I considered oneplus again but their new OS sucks. I considered xiaomi again their OS is bad. I don't want iphone i don't have that kind of money.

Ugzue84O_YswjRHhlLt4AaABAg,"Yeah, it's all a huge gimmick. I have a OnePlus 8 Pro & the hard notification slider on the side of the phone is something I use every day. It's so much more efficient & easier to keep my phone's screen facing up to see what phone calls/emails I'm getting throughout the day and have the phone instantly be put on silent via the notification slider if I'm in meetings. These LED lights on the back are distracting at best.

Overall very disappointed, they could've made a product superior to OnePlus's appeal to the masses. Oh well, I'll hold out hope for a competent phone with a notification slider for now."

UgwpzueCg-rusdvcQ-R4AaABAg,"It cool but I think colored LEDs would be better. On my old galaxy s8 there was a small led on the front of the phone and it would light up certain colors depending on which app I got notifications from (Snapchat-Yellow, messages- blue,etc) and I loved it.

I don't see this excitement when Sony, LG (used to), Vivo, Motorola try to bring some real change and technological advances (variable aperture, moving lenses, wing, folding screen, cool software features). Your lack of excitement for those features and nitpicking and highlighting on some negative features instead, calling them niche (didn't hear for this knock-off tho!), and not recommending them for people led to the death of LG phones (üëè).

To be frank, I think, after few days of use, most consumers (if not too young - teen / teen+) would, without much cry (if not too expensive), get over such 'slick', glitzy (!), razzmatazz  hardware (if just seen the back portion). Additionally, sometimes these lighting options may not be proper for users needing the much needed battery charge when one is outside and / or with minimal chances of finding a charging outlet. 

Also, the jiggling action to check how much is charged could easily give the much needed scratches (pun intended) on the screen (as it may not always be possible to charge over a smooth surface)."

When someone designs a phone that is like a stick, could be like a nVidia Shield Pro remote..., and you unfold it to get to the bigger screen, but has notifications and stuff on the sides of the folded phone, then we start taking about something new.

Ugx272NfGnqY1e_SPVV4AaABAg,"Why does this feel so much like a paid promotion. You showcased and talked about exactly what they asked you to, without being able to talk about the specs, screen quality, gaming performance, battery life (which will be abysmal for a phone full of lights), what exactly was the point of this video other than to create hype for the brand. Totally unnecessary video without any information on what actually matters which is what is inside the phone.

the fact that they obviously didn't want you to talk about the rest of the phone suggests that just like their headphones, this is another form over function product that will be similarly overpriced and over hyped."
Ugx272NfGnqY1e_SPVV4AaABAg.9cmjWjhkUoP9cpeCXaXV_8,"@Nothing As I made clear in my original post and in my reply, I know what an embargoi is. Also In my original post was the point I made that this video was completely pointless other than to do the marketing and create hype for the company. I understand the company, what I said was that making a video on behalf of the company while missing out any information that might actually be of value was pointless and that still stands. Your replies have been equally as pointless as I already addressed everything you've brought up in my original comment."
Ugx272NfGnqY1e_SPVV4AaABAg.9cmjWjhkUoP9cnG_EJ6Ob2,@Beep_Boop_Beep Lmao my account was created before the company in case you didn't realise and also this is industry standard embargo and obviously a company will want to market something as amazing even if it is pointless?

Also, read my comment again, i already said all that, I work in Tech, i know how the industry works. What I said was this video did nothing (get it) to tell me about the things that matter hence it was completely pointless and just playing into the companies hands. The phone will be mid range trash like the earphones but here it is getting all this hype for some RGB that only has one colour lol"

UgzXW4WhuKZrvoMLL2V4AaABAg,I kinda like this design. The main reason why I haven't upgraded from my s9 was because it is fine the way it is. The led let's me know If I missed something and is a reminder of what I forgot. Not many new phones have this and they don't have the headphone jack and that is a major reason why I can't upgrade.

Ugy4KfKziCTksHcEKK14AaABAg,"It looks neat. But I have the notifications in my settings locked down so much that I just don't need another avenue to see them. They're few and far between so I know an app based off of the sound. The software is what I am interested in, especially since the company is a startup by one of the former OnePlus creators.

UgyDDNAMoTZ1fOr3EoB4AaABAg,from afar thoguh it looks like an iphone with its glass back broken and didnt want to go for repairs
UgyLRW5LEYzzCB8mADR4AaABAg,"Pitch this story. Some random person presents a phone to the other random person who bought the phone of nothingness. They decide to show the phone's backs, where some random person's back of the phone is full on glass similar to iPhones, but then the other random person who has the phone of nothingness strikes back by showing it's back of the phone and saying ""The phone you're showing me is NOTHING like mine!"". The person who owns the regular phone is like ""Oh really? You wanna durability test it?"", and in the process they durability test their phones at head high. The story ends with the regular phone valiantly surviving the durability test with the phone of nothingness showing (insert random word here) results. 
Fact - The phone of nothingness presented here is Nothing Phone 1 in case if you are confused."

UgzaDJ0DdG0Aq5XTC9V4AaABAg,I loved your last comment of losing the actual Fan Base and the brand philosophy while trying appeal more and more and more people and end up making a phone which doesn't stand out amidst the crowd. Which actually happened with OnePlus so I hope Carl Pie this time try make their philosophy more broadly accepting and appealing rather than losing their own image trying to be more mainstream. Like Apple which makes things popular the way they want rather than trying to replicate what Samsung does. In the End it's Samsung who ends up copying iPhone again.

I LOVE IT !"
UgwuH2Fh25aDRC7Cdvd4AaABAg,"I think what it would really take me to switch would be an alternative OS based on it‚Äôs own development; like some kind of fresh take on a smooth interface with an underlying UNIX/Linux based phone or very different take on the interface and app offering. Basically, something to rival iOS that isn‚Äôt just another repackaged Android setup. 

Android seems sad, generic, and really stale most of the time. The best execution of it I‚Äôve seen is actually from Google, in the Pixel phones. All other implementations seem broken or not unified enough in the experience their design offers. 

At the end of the day, hardware features are interesting, but it‚Äôs the actual system that most users gravitate towards, and that‚Äôs the most compelling thing for me.

Something entirely new like this would be very risky and take a lot of work, which is probably why we wont see anything like it anytime soon."
UgxW3C1Ekvtti3WxMoN4AaABAg,Nice of you to talk about and show a phone that the company has no intention on launching here in the US.

UgwbDUTWjTWN8PVHdTp4AaABAg,Someone needs to innovate. It still looks average. Someone needs to make a glass phone with micro chipping inside the glass . A battery that‚Äôs has nuclear energy without the radiation so it could power it for long time . I dk something great. Those phones are so boring now
UgyzsRhXsyRsbzXKcR94AaABAg,This reminds me of Teenage Engineering's design code and features quirks.

UgzbINclHr1RWtLp_gN4AaABAg,Phone looks great but unless it have some sort of protection bezel(like we have on classic watches) on the front side I have no idea how to use the phone which intended to be carried caseless because I believe screen is far from sapphire on Mohs scale so it makes it extremely easy to scratch
UgwA0kWW6KUzAnOaKfF4AaABAg,"About time , phones get leds agains....but wtf is that shape ....why the side is not light up ??? Wtf is that 3/4 circle"
UgyvoJ4RrEune-uXCIp4AaABAg,"Here's what we need. Unlockable bootloader, not voiding warranty for flashing a custom ROM, and them releasing the software that runs the LEDs (and all software they develop, ideally) as open source.


If they do that, and it's a decent phone, they'll have my money."

Ugx67T1YCSyAZPc1Fyp4AaABAg,"You'd legit have to be nuts, bat shit crazy, to buy a phone from these clowns. It's been a year and my ear (1) STILL don't work 80% of the time. Right earbud rarely connects. Gotta put it back in the case and take it out multiple times before it will. Heaven forbid your bud start slipping (which happens with wearing masks) and have to push it back in your ear during a phone call, cause it'll end the call 50% of the time. Your settings in the APP lose sync with the earbuds saying ANC is on when it clearly isn't. ANC seemed alright when I got them but many updates later the ANC really impacts the audio in a negative way. Zero response from multiple support requests on their website. They 'sound' fine, when they work. But worst buds I've used from a usability standpoint. You really think their phone is gonna be better? Good luck with that."

UgzSJK4HDMACaqlNaL14AaABAg,"As someone who became a OnePlus fanatic when my Galaxy S6 broke and I was convinced by the value prospect of moving to the OP 5 and just fell in love with Oxygen OS, the alert slider, customization options, and just making the right choices on where to skimp to make a cheaper flagship that didn't feel like you were missing out on a single thing... I am SO excited to see where Nothing goes with this. Still rocking the OP 7 Pro, the only downside of which is the lack of 5G compatibility, but it was also the first phone I ever bought because I was just so excited about the generational leap that it represented with higher refresh rates, that curved screen glass pebble feel, incredible haptic feedback improvements, etc., rather than buying one because my last had broken in some way. Still holding on to my old OP 5 as a backup in case of whatever... But since being swallowed by Oppo, OP has lost its individuality and become just another flagship phone with little to differentiate itself from Samsung, Google, LG, whoever. Sure they're good phones, and the 10 Pro certainly is top of the line and offers just about anything you could want in a flagship, while still trying to make use of that Hasselblad colab to catch up in the camera/photo processing sphere. However, OxygenOS is quickly morphing into the Oppo ColorOS, the price tag no longer gives it the ultra-competitive appeal it once had, and there's even been word of them moving away from the alert slider, which would be one of the dumber moves a phone maker could make. More phones should be trying to adopt that, not less. 

While Nothing will need more than one attempt to really hit the nail on the head, I'm desperately hoping Carl Pei gets a real chance to break into the market for a second time. And the super customizable backlighting, with actual functionality rather than just being purely a gimmick, is the first big shakeup the smartphone market has seen in some time, which may just give Nothing the solid footing it needs to build into something great, and special, and a place for the enthusiasts to look beyond the handful of options geared towards the masses. Of course details on the specs, pricing, and availability are still needed to really imagine it's path forward, but it took OnePlus a number of phones to really find it's niche in the market and become something special as well. I think I was lucky to happen to become in need of a new phone right as the OP 5 came out to be able to experience what may be one of the only true flagship killers in the smartphone market since it's inception. The OnePlus 7 Pro I believe still fell into that category, though the price gap had become less noticeable, and it was only a generation away from falling into line and grasping a generating more mass appeal by emulating competitor stylings, giving into the IP rating certification demands, and emulating competitor camera software while trying to ride on the shoulders of known camera makers rather than finding it's own new path for innovation going forward. Anyways, rant over. Fingers crossed. Hoping shopping for a new phone will become truly exciting once again in the near future. 

As it stands, I honestly may end up being swayed over to the iOS ecosystem which would be a first for me, and unthinkable until maybe the introduction of the M1 across devices. Still would like an iPad Pro with an M1 whether I end up deciding to make the big change in ecosystems fully or not. Please Android, even if you can never truly compete in that specific tablet market, please save me from being pulled all the way into the dark side."

UgzSJK4HDMACaqlNaL14AaABAg.9cgTLPQ61w39cnVYf3BJ1L,"@M. Milo Yes, because I added an original comment to a YouTube video unprompted. Unlike... every other original comment. There's something hilarious about replying ""TL:DR"" and then immediately replacing it with a complaint about not having enough content. ü§£

So far this comment that takes maybe 60 seconds to read has garnered 10 thumbs up and several responses about how it shouldn't exist by folks who didn't have to recognize it's existence in the first place, but instead invested more time into complaining about the time they spent reading it. The Internet is a hell of a place."
UgzSJK4HDMACaqlNaL14AaABAg.9cgTLPQ61w39cnROoOq6fE,"@Brenden O'Sullivan he was commenting because you posted a massively long diatribe via a medium that is DEFINITELY not meant for that (YouTube comments), unprompted, with very little actual content. You‚Äôre far too long-winded for YouTube comments, and all your replies come across as out-of-touch and slightly pretentious. So chill out."
UgzSJK4HDMACaqlNaL14AaABAg.9cgTLPQ61w39cnHKhtWuEl,"@Afnan Bashir You know, I have dismissed most of the Pixel line since it started because it, while also being more competitively priced against Samsung or Apple and obviously offering that stock Android experience I like, placed a huge emphasis on it's camera setup/features and photo processing software. To keep that pricing competitive though, they've just tended to give up way too much ground in too many other areas. I should preface this by excluding the latest gen, as the Pixel 6 Pro especially finally made a ton of improvements, but my main OP fandom is also based on earlier gens so that's where I've been comparing apples to apples. When it comes to power, the Pixel lineup is usually lacking the latest top of the line Snapdragon chip, or releasing just before becoming outdated, and severely lacking in RAM in many cases. They also seriously lack when it comes to screen quality, both in terms of resolution, refresh rate, and color gamut, where I think the 4XL was the only one I've seen manage to reach QHD, and of course total screen real estate with even the XL versions and I believe the 5a only reaching like 6.3"" while my OP 7 Pro has had a ~6.7"", 90hz, QHD+ display since 2019. The overall design has also always been less than inspired, sticking with relatively thick bezels, and rear placed fingerprint scanners. They even released as recently as the Pixel 4 with a base model that only has 64GB of memory and no expandability, which is the kind of annoying thing Apple likes to do, before adding a nice price hike for 128GB, which really should be the minimum Sure, Google and Apple both heavily push cloud storage but still. While the lack of power of course doesn't demand a massive battery, I still think they've put some smaller than necessary batteries in most models, and have been a bit slow to get into the fast charging game. All of these areas are the places where OnePlus has excelled for so long, with the one real shortcoming being camera quality, and combining those savings with the savings that come from a lack of official water resistance certifications for so long, even though breakdowns have shown the same waterproofing measures as officially certified phones, and there have been plenty of home test videos to alleviate any fears of real vulnerability.

Personally, the shooter setup on my phone is one of the least important aspects when picking out a new daily driver. That's purely personal preference of course, but while it's definitely handy to have a camera quickly available whenever the need arises, if photo taking is the objective and picture quality is important enough for it to be one of the main deciding factors in choosing a phone, I think keeping a dedicated camera nearby in environments where you anticipate needing one is the best option. Some phones' picture quality HAS definitely reached the point of being considered exceptional though, particularly iPhone shooters and of course the Pixel lineup. But, for the most part, all major flagships have reached a baseline picture quality that's more than sufficient for a quick pocket shooter, and I think they reached that point awhile back. At least good enough to virtually kill off the budget/mid-range digital camera market that made the small pocket shooters that were really popular after the turn of the century.

All that being said, I finally took a good look at the current Pixels which I had taken my eye off of thanks to your comment, and going forward there may be hope with the Pixel lineup. This latest gen, mostly speaking of the 6 Pro specifically, finally got a big lift in design points, as well as screen quality, finally ditching the rear fingerprint scanner, and offering the high refresh rate, big QHD screen to match actual flagships, including the LTPO OLED tech that allows battery stretching thanks to majorly variable refresh rates. The Google tensor chip has also finally added the power that the entire lineup has been sorely lacking since the start, with a decently sized battery to match. Of course, all this comes with the same higher starting price to match the OP 10 Pro, but it maintains that dominant picture taking experience, and most importantly it offers some hope for the future in terms of creativity variability. Haven't looked too much into the upcoming generation as I'm not in need of a new phone right now, BUT if they are able to build on the huge leap they made with the current gen, and improve on the in-house chipsets, they may actually become something to watch that distinguishes itself from the majority of standard uninspiring Android flagship lineups!"
UgzSJK4HDMACaqlNaL14AaABAg.9cgTLPQ61w39cn2Qj_j4qF,"@Emmanuel Egwere I mean, it wasn't advice. It also wasn't a comment on the content of my statements, not even tangentially related. It was just lashing out at the existence of someone's opinions in a space that, while it doesn't impede your access to or enjoyment of MKBHD's content in any way, you clearly feel should be limited by specific constraints. A glance at your uploads is a good indicator of the kind of constraints you'd like to see in place.

Moreover, though I am a subscriber to his channel, I was brought here, along with much of the other traffic for this video, by the chance to get an actual look at the Nothing phone in action, for which open information has been intentionally extremely limited. 

You are actually able to ignore the comment section entirely however, if you would like to see nothing besides exclusively MKBHD thoughts and opinions. That would be a bit of actual advice, to help you achieve your goal of limiting your exposure to only the information you came to view. Take it or leave it, but good luck finding the information you're looking for either way!"

UgytzTdmdkl5m0t8goR4AaABAg,"Another piece of glass to break. LED's are a Gimmick and not a very good one.

Nothing is the dumbest company.
And to be clear, I was sold on the company when they ""released"" the earbuds.
Until I couldn't buy them 3 ""releases"" in a row.
I am still amazed the amount of credibility Nothing still has after how crappy they have decided to be regarding availability."

UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg,"The reason I loved the Oneplus One was that it delivered such great hardware for a very low price. They did this for marketing, making little to no profit on their first phone made people buy it because of the great value and love it for that reason, and they went in with the same mentality on newer phones even if they didnt follow the same strategy. So for me, that is the key thing that will flip me into buying this phone or not. Do i get a great phone for a great value, or not. Price will be the deciding faction for Nothing phone (1)"
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9dI_D9BdbQX,@Sonal Kashyap f3 : am i ajoke to you?
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9dGgYdd7Ad6,@Sonal Kashyap i didn't even changed Battery my phone working like gold.
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9d0b7-KQSyo,"@Sonal Kashyap I still have One Plus 5. Still so fast or faster than new ones throught this 5 years. And I Switched just for whim. I think One Plus one could still rock nowadays.
Nothing is pretty amazing, but just medium one. I prefer to pay 200‚Ç¨ more and get a flagship killer.
So I must still wait for ... One Plus 10 T, Samsung 2023 or iPhone 15 (cos 14 its the same than 13...)
I think that my One Plus 5 must stay 1 year more when the Phones really Will made a difference. New era."
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9cziUWDhdWC,@Alessandro Zanardi Still using F1. No other phone in poco series came close. Still enjoy the camera quality and 845. Just changed batteries two times..
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9ctw9Gl3A8b,"@Alessandro Zanardi poco is owned by xiaomi, they got resources and r&d from their parent company."
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9ck0ODYWd80,"@_HMCB_ of course it isn't sustainable in the long run, anyone with half a brain knows that. But it is a great marketing tool. It will add a reputation of great value, making people interested in it, and then they can slowly increase the profit part of the price. OnePlus did just this and very successfully, they issue is that they went too far, the greed of bbk showed."
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9cjttw3jx8L,@Yusef isn't the poco lineup doing the same thing? Look at what the F1 did and what the F3 delivers today...
UgzAlkyYglg8wCo2wjB4AaABAg.9cfHTvpVzTQ9cjjSrBu6M6,"@NITIN RANA that pricing isn‚Äôt sustainable. Just watch. R&D isn‚Äôt inexpensive; especially if they want to bring leading software & design to differentiate themselves from Apple. With small margins, investors will get inpatient and they won‚Äôt have enough __net__ revenue from sales to sustain that pricing model. Not with other budget-phone companies vying for the same market."

Ugy5rCgmZXRBOhiK9lp4AaABAg,"In everyday use, I don't think the leds on the back are useful when you have a big screen and maybe always on display feature too. And you will need a transparent case to protect the phone and to still see the leds. Idk, but for me, this phone is just a test subject, to see what people think about it, so they can come with more improvements."
Ugy5rCgmZXRBOhiK9lp4AaABAg.9cf4mf8CNGu9cle14V-wfV,It has to be a gimmick. The old bedazzle trick. The front screen can very well do what the back lights can except lighting up the room.

It is hard to not depend from your phone on these times, but I appreciate the time to be disconnected."
UgyOevPqdyCovfB__hB4AaABAg,I Feel it similar look like IPhone 12 designs

Ugwb6uHyZJC7d41NjsF4AaABAg,"Sound familiar? Yeah, OnePlus sucked me in with the 7 Pro because it was that or have a notch. Couldn't transfer anything from my previous phone for over a year, so went back to Samsung"

UgyYmbO7p62ho24uo6d4AaABAg,This may not look too impressive for now.. but this could be future
UgyrXZIQrASB6tQa3_l4AaABAg,"Why since realme using same 8 mp ultra wide camera and then no one will ready to talk this issue even their flagship mobiles no morethan 8 mp only 8 mp camera and when all brands will remove weird useless and irritating 2mp cameras I've been using realme 7 pro since 2 years and i didnt move up to 2 mp camera i tried to hide with those camera to use some stickers üòµ

When mobile brands will remove notch and punch hole and weird displays because I need atleast 6.7 inch with full view flat screen display mobile and why still apple hanging with their notch because they can change the hole display industry but why still they didn't and they moved to mini or micro led displays

Why suddenly disappeared pop up up camera mobiles in mobile industry and why need rollable or foldable or whatever folding technology will comes to mobile but no one look the werid punch hole displays any way ...
I request please make video about this issues"

Ugyu7S5Jn4MRSuePEwB4AaABAg,One thing I don't understand is who keeps the phone down with its the display facing down. They should put the notification LED's on the front.

UgwGZJxPGq65Iw0tep14AaABAg,"If you remove the phone and cameras, what you get ? An electronic device for apps, its stupid invention you could own very easily an old Nokia from 2002 just to do phone calls üòÇ and Sony DSLR pro cam for photos maybe videos and action cams if you're an adventurous person smartphone is a distraction from reality, they could make an electronic device just for apps,üòÑ or to microchip you to control everywhere where you go. Nintendo that small pocket crap is a good for playing games underway even Sony PS had that small version just for games so why do you need smartphone if you have smartphone your stupid 100%."

UgwpAnHHw49dF2dZ7-t4AaABAg,"Maybe they should have just created an interesting flagship with a headphone jack, IR remote, expandable storage and removable battery.

All the Nothing Phone has is some fancy LEDs in an iPhone body."
UgwpAnHHw49dF2dZ7-t4AaABAg.9ce3mczQipg9cmsCVe49zL,"@Joby Sam Jacob Hotswappable batteries are still 1000 times quicker than charging, no matter how fast the charging. Also, removable batteries mean that you can be sure the phone is actually off as well, not a bad feature for privacy in an age where we essentially have none."
UgwpAnHHw49dF2dZ7-t4AaABAg.9ce3mczQipg9clq6uMiKno,"Headphone jack? YES!

UgxoO2jRB-HYsn2CK-94AaABAg,"Great Review MKBHD..love the shots fired at the end...hehe definitely sounds familiar, and hope they can break the loop and give back to the community wht was promised to Never Settle. Seems like Carl left cos of how the company was becoming mainstream, forgetting that they became huge cos of how they ""Never Settle""d. Hope Carl can do this with Nothing and More. Kudos to him and the Team and you for the honest review. What im really looking forward to is the operating system, and if its similar to the revolutionising oxygenos of ye old days. wht u think?"
UgzZqPGmQufGpJjo3p54AaABAg,"Marques (Ending): Sound Familiar??
Me: I felt that for the One Plus people"
Ugwi4ICP3iRy_wWyKJx4AaABAg,This reminds me a Nokia phone from many years back where it lights up to the ringtones. Good to see this feature again in smartphone generation.

Cool back design though!"
UgznqWAUP4Js879mk3l4AaABAg,"If talk about design and unique, I think Sony Xperia had the design that always unique and different and not follow a trend like other brand in any generation. üòÇ This Nothing phone I think if not a see-though on back it very familiar."

Ugy9fT0CjVz6ASzr7814AaABAg,Poor battery
UgylVylxyV3_BI1TZIh4AaABAg,So disappointed to see a mega youtuber put out a whole video just showing some lights in the back of a silly phone that dances to a rythm or some sort of weird pattern. HELLO my 1 dollar christmas light can do the same but better. Should i scream about that from the top of my terrace to the entire world now. MKBHD you can do better man. Don't put out such trash content. If you can't make proper content just don't waste our time with this videos.

UgwIrcBVonTSdmo0i9p4AaABAg,If Nothing wants to be successful it should focus on Indian market .  Pricing is very important if they launch this phone under (35000-30000) range it would be huge success. .

Ugwsw4inZIHWbAf7qEV4AaABAg,"Maybe I'm missing the point but don't you get all that stuff by just leaving your phone screen side up? Battery life? Check. See who's calling? Check. See notifications? Check.
So the only point of this feature is that you can leave your phone upside down and still have some of it's normal functionality. IDK if that's enough of a selling point for most people. Does look neat though, if it compares well with others in its price range the glyph stuff could tip the balance."

UgwykAClwVd1wz8_EtF4AaABAg.9ccpezwsT2M9czwJdA4g9J,@Krrish Lots of people leave their phone face up too. If you have a case the camera bump is irrelevant.

UgwykAClwVd1wz8_EtF4AaABAg.9ccpezwsT2M9chGDXkp_yb,Well you can‚Äôt be able to have those cool lights while using the phone. It could also lead to display burn in if you have concentrated light strips on a display that‚Äôs always on. You also can‚Äôt use it as a soft light for macros or when you just need a softer light than the flash. Also looks cooler imo
UgwykAClwVd1wz8_EtF4AaABAg.9ccpezwsT2M9cgYOCxMaAT,"@Krrish Yes, yhat makes semse too, but most people slap a case on it anyway and have it screen side up, from what I've seen in my country."

UgyUJgymAqNWLWprsvh4AaABAg,"This could be a hit phone now all they need is to hit the ""sweet spot"" meaning the phone has to have good enough hardware to compete in the current market, working software and the most important is reasonable pricing. If it's going to be way more expensive and less capable than the current generation high end phones the design and uniqueness will not suffice sadly. 
I love the design and the led effects for notifications and all. If they can release a flagship and mid range version of these then I think they can be very successful!"

It looks/feels like what people in the 1980s imagined future phones would look like.  I feel like people will want to program the lights to do something more than just flash... like respond to music, indicate a direction to go, etc. Sometimes we can't have our full attention on a phone so having a simple elegant indicator that is easy to interpret just by glancing rather than reading carefully declutters a lot of our visual space."
Ugw9rMaNLrFYTQ2WZGB4AaABAg.9cc_A2DE4IL9dDawJ2o3pu,@Super knullisch you just made me rethink my life choices
Ugw9rMaNLrFYTQ2WZGB4AaABAg.9cc_A2DE4IL9dDaOjzE-w-,"@Tsuppi desu! Please continue practise your English, punctuation and grammar, because it's barely readable.."
Ugw9rMaNLrFYTQ2WZGB4AaABAg.9cc_A2DE4IL9dDYGcCbrWr,"No offence, but it sounds like you got way too much projects, work, and responsibility on your hands, to be honest. And may I add.. if your everyday default position is.. ""Sometimes we can't have our full attention on a phone"" - Then you seriously need to stop for a minute and consider what kind of life, you're currently living, imho. I might be wrong here, but it sure sounds more like you're living inside of your phone, rather than in real life, using a phone when needed. And only briefly, once in a while, during a normal day, manage to get distracted enough, to actually forget about that damn thing for a min or two. Nothing in your life, other than a newly born baby, should have that kind of attention occupation. So, with that said, it really should, rather be.. ""Most of the time I don't devote my full attention to my phone. In fact. I almost forget that I have one, sometimes. And thus.. I need to have a good indicator, if possible, preferably an elegant discrete one, which brings my attention to it, from whatever, much more important aspect of life, I'm currently devoting myself too"". 

Because that's how it used to be, remember? You know, before smartphones, and arguably before GSM and NMT network cellphones, too! How often did you find yourself actively ogle at a landline phone while not using it and actually doing something else, completely non-related to the phone? Maybe, once in a while, when expecting an important call, or perhaps when noticing that a friend didn't call for a week or two, which either usually called more or less every other day, or at least once or twice a week. But yeah, I know.. you can do a thousand things or more on a smartphone, since it's a small handheld computer with a call (and text) function as a well, essentially. Not that I need to enlighten you, nor anyone else reading this, about that probably, but you know, just for the record and arguments sake. Anyway.. since that's what a smart phone is, more time will naturally be spent on it. And that I'm neither against, nor am I telling you, or anyone else, that they need to drop everything, and especially not their phone right now and just walk off into the nearest wilderness, lol no! 

My point however, is this.. Instead of having a device that calls on our attention, because someone is trying to reach us, be it a company though an app, via notifications, or a direct call or a friend. We now let the phone/communicator/computer, aka the smartphone, dictate if any time and attention, can be devoted to something else too. Because it has now become the default beacon for almost our whole attention, when it comes to quite a lot of people, especially in the young generations. The only clear disrupter to this phenomena and addiction, now sadly, only seems to be, going to work. Sorry for the lecture.. But this phone addictions is a true plague and one of our times most serious societal hazards. And I just wanted to give you and others that presumably are younger than myself, a heads up, since I'd argue that I have a pretty honest and clear view of what's going on and what we are transitioning to. That's all. 

Oh and am.. if you want to call me a boomer, feel free to do so! Even though I was born in 1984.. ; )"

Ugwwy7bLfwKLH4EXpVd4AaABAg,"I think most people have been used to rest their phone on their backs since the phones having a big display at the front. If people hold on to their habit, which is very much likely, the back led panels of nothing phone will be useless. I think nothing should have come up with a more different design to lure loyal customers from Apple. I think led lights at the sides would be more preferable than at the back. By the way amoled displays offer notification lights a comeback with some help of apps, since it works pixel by pixel. Notifiation leds won't make much difference to my opinion. Asus  has already sold anime matrix at their laptops. Honestly that thing will easily put out these leds on the nothing phone. If nothing makes anime matrix like customisable led arrey, i would consider the brand. 
   And the ringtones are aweful. Sounds like the phone is about to get sick or it is showing some warning before it goes off."

UgzfoaS5rPxroEMnVWN4AaABAg.9ccRde-Gy6a9ciTYPKXAfr,The millions of tiny LEDs in the front of my phone is certainly way more than enough for notifications and I don‚Äôt need to have it facing down while charging which means having to flip the phone when you need to use it :P

UgzBLa8HPnpk8jmQddl4AaABAg,"Honestly, I don't understand the mostly positive comments here under the video. This phone just looks like another unfinished, over-hyped scam. Design is iPhone 12 (which isn't necessary a bad thing, when done correctly). Most of the features presented in the video are useless gimmicks - those ringtones sound just like static noise, terrible. Weird led strips on the back - who the hell needs notification leds on the back? The only time I turn my phone display down is when muting a call/alarm. Besides that there is absolutely no need to turn the phone - so some notification led on the back is just plain dumb. And the gimmick showing charge percentage when charging - freaking stupidity - why should I charge the phone display-down and wobble the phone display down, to see the charging percentage? Most useless feature of the year. 
With no word on display quality, camera sensors nor battery capacity, only these useless gimmicks have the main marketing focus. It's just stupid and unnecessary. 
And those promises of ecosystem? Well they could build an ecosystem on OnePlus phones, instead they just crippled the brand and now we should trust them to do it differently? Besides, creating an ecosystem isn't done overnight, we can observe that Huawei makes some progress in this regard, but it's still far away from Apple - difference is using opensource or proprietary systems. So no  enthusiasm in this regard either. 
The last thing will be price. Should it be priced near 700-800eur, there is virtually no reason to stick with Nothing phone, when we just have flagship alternatives in this price range - iPhone 12/13, Samsung Galaxy s22. And I don't believe Nothing can cut the price down, in todays situation when electronics components are just too expensive."

UgxmgKKYN5UWj7xmP2l4AaABAg,"I actually really like the idea behind this device, tho 1 small addition could be like 2 more camera sensors because a strong macro lens can really use those lights well. And maybe the LEDs in the back could be RGB set from the software.
It could also make telling different notifications apart from each other based on the color (Like the Galaxy S5 did) and the LEDs could also provide some more finetuning for closeup photos with different fill light colors and color temperatures for white led.
I hope they'll also support custom Android development and provide the neccessary drivers needed to build something custom to it cause imo, this already pretty different looking phone is awesome and is a breath of fresh air compared to the 20000000000000000000000000000000000000 almost exactly the same looking device we have nowadays."

UgwugsZo0uofhDymtWB4AaABAg,Marques please stop doing these if you consider yourself a genuine reviewer. This embargo shit just builds unnecessary hype which leads to people spending money with preorders on subpar products when they actually do come out. Nobody wants to see just the back of the phone. Mrwhosetheboss has stopped doing these and time you do too. Don‚Äôt let the Industries control the narrative.

Ugy2w10suWH94s4Iv0J4AaABAg,Not sure who is the target customer for this kind of flashy LED back. Some kind of attention grabbers would like to flash and distract everyone in public transports  or airports or cafeteria with this LED show going on. Most people would like to disable the feature or cover the phone in a non transparent case to avoid embarrassment.

UgzbKWAs_g5VAEjdZ9d4AaABAg,it looks like iPhone 12 and 11
UgxgTdMscACIkkmoIlB4AaABAg,"Cool gimmick but I don‚Äôt buy a phone purely for looks, to earn my loyalty you have to be able to support your product for many years ongoing and not abandon the concept immediately. Nothing has a real possibility to break into the electronics markets IF they play their cards correctly and not go egotistic like other brands. In an industry where there is brutal competition, you have to be different such as LG but what kills a product faster is dropping support right away days, months after the initial release."

Ugz_-7aTp5M53GeI8vV4AaABAg,"To me 5:40 just seems stupid. It sounds like they're putting all this effort for what? To mimic something that a cheap case can do? Special packaging despite it will either be thrown away or thrown into the closet? All to steal away what you suggest is a small proportion of the user base of another company?

I mean it's great they're doing something different bit the effort vs reward scaling for them seems skewed. Hell, how is it any different to a big company like Samsung and their BTS collab? Or Apple with the separate color launch? (Both of which will also be made redundant as soon as you put a case on the phone)"
UgzinaRtxu1832F4w0x4AaABAg,DBrand should make a nothing skin that we can slap on the iPhone.

(Rogphone also got backlit but it's not using it well)

(And absolutely agree on working on different design. I appreciate iPhone's design (well it works & kind of signature), but for other brands' replica/similar designs really got me bored. That's why I was quite excited when S21, Pixel 6 series (maybe Flip3 too) was out coz they just hits differently.

UgxbHxSifHq3lynjA5J4AaABAg,"As much as I‚Äôd like for there to be more competition in the industry, this is just a plain stupid, gimmick of a phone.

And when these ‚Äúreviewers‚Äù agree to follow an embargo, you know they‚Äôre being just another shill.

How can they not be? They‚Äôre clearly agreeing to generate hype for a product, which may turn out to be absolute shit. People really pre-order stuff based on it. So, it‚Äôs outright misleading and unethical.

What baffles me is why these top ‚Äúreviewers‚Äù would agree to do sth like that, and then pretend to not be a shill. They could easily buy the latest tech that‚Äôs rolled out with all the income they generate themselves, and do an honest ‚Äúfull review‚Äù of it then, so that their viewers could actually make a fair well-informed decision.

Yet they continue to pull off shit like this, and continue to get away with it. Money is indeed the root of all evil."

UgzZBDr55yS1AfbDCwx4AaABAg,I hope they have a slightly pimped android as OnePlus has. I miss a lot of features which my current stock android doesn't have. and I miss the dnd button instead I got a very annoying assistant button I have to switch off to be a usless button.

UgwlkB-lGL_PYZui9PZ4AaABAg,"I don't know about this one. I don't think I'd buy that just for the LED notification system alone. It's cool for sure but at the end of the day, there's a far better alternatives that does the same thing better. Smartwatches. Keeping up with notifications is one of the main uses of a smartwatch. That ringtone LED pattern feature is the same. Looks useful at first glance but when you think about it, every phone released within the last decade lets you customize ringtones and vibration patterns for each caller. But do you even use that feature? No. Because there's a better alternative. Smartwatches. You don't have to remember which caller has which ringtone or in this case LED pattern when you can just look at your wrist and and see their name. These features would've been game changing a decade ago but not in 2022 where even a budget smartwatch would put this entire notification system to shame."

Ugw6HB6Yi6GbUkCPAN54AaABAg,"I won't agree that it looks like iPhone 12, because at the end all phones looks like that only. Some will have less or more cameras, a little different position, but at the end it's almost same thing."
UgxKEI54jFVjuIpwDAF4AaABAg,"The Nothing Phone is NOT being released in the United States according to the news today. Yet another phone where the only way you can buy it is if it's imported, and you get no regional support of any kind if you do. I know, I have a Poco Phone."

UgyjkKLPiLALUFZE4jB4AaABAg,lights ok but battery backup?
UgxN4dcQhS2KaLSZtqB4AaABAg,"Not very ground breaking. Anyone remember the Nokia brick phone and how you could get custom made shells with lights that would light up when calls came in? This is like that only a lot more intricate. The whole thing seems so gimmicky and actually tells a lot about the consumer landscape - that aesthetics trumps practicality and function. It is like an iPhone with a clear back. Is there anything deeply different about this phone that‚Äôs worth investing in? I feel smart phones have definitely hit a plateau in their evolution. Unless smart phones finally find a radically new form, they‚Äôll keep relying on glorified bells and whistles till then."

I wish them luck but they poured substantial resources on a gimmick. Again, the patterns could‚Äôve simply been shown on the display.   
Yeah it‚Äôs technically different from other phones, but the difference is far from meaningful.

UgyOE7NF2Nu6SqOSx554AaABAg,"Okay, Marques... Just so I understand correctly: This new smartphone, which you promote in your introduction with the fact that all other smartphones always have to serve a mass taste, which allegedly should not be the case with the Nothing-Phone, has on the whole the same shape as an IPhone (which you find ""actually cool"", well, I'm not such an iPhone fan, and what is ""cool"" is always in the eye of the beholder) and a few ""different"" features, which are mainly limited to beeping and flashing funny... so, to be quite honest, I don't see much that is really revolutionary new here. Same old stuff in brandnew drags. It might be possible that really useful details will be presented in the final release, but if the Nothing-Phone will then possibly be located in the upper price segment without offering real innovations apart from pure design aspects, I will certainly not become a customer. At the moment, it all looks like a big announcement with little substance. So the brand name may be appropriate..."

Though Marques is not allowed to speak much about the phone, it was clear he is dying to tell us there is something up with the software side of things, while not being able to say so explicitly. The way he mentions ""make another average phone"" (0:39) right at the beginning of the video is a clear indicator of that. He again said that the Nothing phone looks different ""no matter what happens with the rest of the phone"" (5:12).
I don't think he is impressed overall. Lets wait for the full review."

I have nothing against ""nothing"" (hehe) i just want to give my opinion on the matter, Though i find the device cool from the 'oOOh its has lights"" perspective it still doesn't appeal to me in the functionality department, also TBH its kinda ugly from the back, looks like someone dropped the phone and the backglass peeled off (i realize this is due to the fact that its transparent)."

UgwrEF-isc4CGMZshbB4AaABAg,"Personally speaking, I would prefer to put my phone facing with its screen facing upwards so all the notifications that I want to be reached can be seen clearly and promptly. Such LED bands are nothing than a useless and annoying add-on. 

The Nothing ear(1) is pretty cool cause you can get a pair of earbuds that has good ANC, sound quality, tiny little latency, and even volume control on the buds. These are the real things that make ear(1) stand out. The transparent part is more of a design signature. 

But for the phone(1), according to what we can see now,  it is more like a narcissistic design from the company that intentionally tries to make a difference but there product managers are out of real idea"

Yeah it does. ONEPLUS, from flagship killer to pocket killer. Name another one? Pixel phones. 

Name another on a different category? Poco... It was once a flagship killer with the flagship SoC. Now it's either cheap trash or expensive trash.

Basically every company does that or eventually will do. Sooner or letter. Don't be loyal to brands, just like the product and what they got to offer. First they will show you something shiny to attract and the next is to make the brand a money pumping machine."

Ugw8Tlhi9OnHj-YIyuN4AaABAg,"One Plus came at a time when phones had huge scope for improvement, and they rode that wave brilliantly by being able to cram top notch components at low price. Right now, good phones are a commodity, regardless of the price, and an enthusiasts‚Äô market doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. That‚Äôs why in order to stand out the only thing you can do is put some fancy LEDs in the chassis to solve a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist (I‚Äôll keep the screen up if I‚Äôm bothered to know who‚Äôs calling). In my opinion, this shows how dumb is to put money in the smartphone market as a startup in 2022."

UgxKKeQPEbrzcFUcprh4AaABAg,"I personally think they should've just silently released it. 

Doesn't have much of that x-factor for a first gen phone (maybe it does, but we can't see the rest of the phone). All they've done is draw too much attention to themselves which I personally think is not a good idea for this phone.

UgxnbaqkEEzvqAugNMt4AaABAg,"I thought it was an iPhone 12.. Seems kinda similar, like a customized iPhone"
UgxWDTLssmqkTwdRy354AaABAg,"I heard the earbuds were a major flop because they didn‚Äôt live up to the hype. The audio supposedly was pretty lousy, and they ultimately were not totally clear as promised ‚Äî but they mostly failed due to the audio being worse than headphones costing around the same price or less. 

I worry the phone will fall down the same landfill chute as the headphones. There will be people who will try it, but I don‚Äôt think there will be masses of people clamoring to get their hands on one like the major players. 

I know it‚Äôs a startup and I commend them for trying to do something unique . . . but looks and flashing lights alone won‚Äôt sell phones. It needs amazing audio and speakers, a super hi-res screen, top quality cameras, and battery life. The cameras on the back are already underwhelming. They don‚Äôt seem to look special and I can almost bet they won‚Äôt be as good as most cameras out there. The lights are cool, but it would make more business sense to develop cases with visible electronics that feature a light system like this and slap them on iPhones, Samsungs, etc. People would be more likely to purchase that.

They overpromised and undersold on those earbuds. I have a feeling this phone will fall to the same fate. I could be proven wrong, but somehow I get the feeling it‚Äôs not going to turn out as good as the hype like last time."
UgzLHB1ec5nw8kMiMed4AaABAg,11/10 OnePlus burn.
Ugyh6PIaQgoIVMlH2Px4AaABAg,"Essentials had a great run, but somehow they failed. Their PH1 was probably one of the most aesthetically pleasing phone to look at and hold. I still had compliments about it back when I had it, way pass when they announced that they would shut down.

Ugyfvay1L18oJQx8_414AaABAg,"I am definitely impressed with that there is genuinely something new, and my gut reaction is to bee excited to have the flexibility with visual notifications that have existed for decades with ringtones, but it's still very unlikely to be something I buy.

The teardown look would be cool but it's too white for me, at first I thought it was cracked glass to be honest. I don't know if the LEDs on the back are bright enough to get my attention compared to what my current iPhone flash does. I also can't imagine going back to a phone without a case, the last time I did that I owned a Nokia, phones these days are just too expensive, breakable, and necessary. But fundamentally I'm so entrenched in the Apple ecosystem I was never gonna be a realistic customer acquisition anyway."

UgzLB-AkC7JS-ZxOBvN4AaABAg,"Initial OnePlus phones were hit and they were and are budget friendly phones. Carl Pei has made really good OnePlus devices in the past. After he left OnePlus, OS has slightly become bloated with changing the dialer to Truecaller and many more. Carl's last device in oneplus was 8 pro. After that OnePlus is just copying Samsung designs and making os uglier. They just want to replicate what Oppo is doing just by tweaking the software to make it look like a flagship. All of that sucked because OnePlus after Carl left has been losing the OnePlus feeling. I have been using OnePlus since the OnePlus 1. Related to Nothing I can see a sense of personal touch it has to offer. Well I see Carl as a visionary because he knows how to make things just good for the masses... Not considering Nothing phone till I don't get its hands on experience but I think it's going to be a phone that will make people switch."

It's no Jon Ive being inspired by Bauhaus and Braun designs. Its a gimmicky ass phone.

UgyTURO_GtolX_GW0Mp4AaABAg,"While the LEDs are a novel idea, it doesn't cut it for me. For all the hype created around it, I would've loved to see something new and revolutionary with maybe the display, the battery life, the design of the phone (transparent doesn't do it), camera or speakers even. This, I feel they've just slapped on a transparent back on to a regular iPhone lookalike and called it a phone (apart from any insignificant minor modifications they might have done). My tip: don't go against something like the iPhones or the Pixels unless you're bringing something huge, a game changer to the table. 

Take Pixel. Pixel truly had a revolutionary camera (+the clean, stock build)  that set it apart. iPhones are well known to give a consistent, high quality user experience. What does Nothing bring? LED lights? I'll pass. I was really keen on Nothing delivering on their hype as it's time someone disrupted the big players in the phone industry by giving us something new (like Tesla did for cars)."

UgyYXO6ufMifYrhOhWt4AaABAg,"They will do great if they get the software and the price right at launch. In my opinion, there are a lot of people who can still live without a complete ecosystem, they don't have the needs for a smartwatch for answering messages or things like that, or the seamless switch of the earbuds between the phone and the laptop, and these people are more than tech enthusiasts thinks. Even if, today more then ever, working or studing has became almost impossibile without a Pc, certain features like Apple has, or maybe even Samsung, are ""useless"" for the average user, and that's why i think that Nothing is a little bit late but still in time to became what they want to (sometimes when you saw how and where other companies have faild or what they could have done better it's ""easier"" to start and go in the right direction). They have sold more then 400.000 pairs of ear1 headphones in less then one year despite be a completly new company, bearly known, especially outside the tech industry. They know how to market things, they know the audience they want to reach, and they will, because they know how to comunicate, and Carl Pei showed that he can do things like that like he did with OnePlus before, making the brand one of the most loved in the Android world (until the ColorOs thing). So, as i was saying, they still have time to build their own open ecosystem (whatever this means) but, even without it, they can sell a lot of Phone1 (if it will be good) like they did with headphones, and, i'm pretty sure that a good part of the owners of ear1 (and also OnePlus users that feels let down) will think about buying this as their next phone because they don't care about a complete ecosystem and, unlike a lot of others android phones, it looks great with the same design lenguage of the earbuds :)"
UgydVFi0SKg817b9v5R4AaABAg,"the real benefit I think this would offer is finally normalizing putting phones screen down. I already hate using my phone (yeah yeah call me a boomer) as I just hate being *_that_* available, but even though recently I have had to start using it more, I've found even just leaving it face down on my desk helps far more. While this term is overused as fuck, it's a nice ""mental health"" boost. I think for me personally that primarily comes from simply not being available all that much because as aforementioned that's my main issue with phones in the first place, but I could easily see how simply not having it be there is a nice benefit. Can't really speak to that though, because I don't really have a solid contrast point, basically all of the tech I own integrates seamlessly when off aside from my actual computers, I've just always hated cluttering my vision with screens unnecessarily."

Also side note I just feel the white LED on a white phone was an underblow, might look cool during the night time but not so much during the day. A different darker color back for the phone would've put more emphasize on the design feature they are actually pushing for (but then that's just my POV).

UgxIm-ABfJH57gowVk54AaABAg,I will never buy this. Why? Because I never put my phone screen face down like this. Why? Because any slip or accident touch or sliding etc.. will end up the disaster!
Ugzlbt6jTjYX2qDygOt4AaABAg,I can see the light being useful for macro
Ugyx_AhB0m7el5xTEwJ4AaABAg,"I never keep my phone face down, so led in the back doesn't make any sense for me. It looks cool though and will be fun to show off. But if the battery backup isn't enough, led will always remain shut, just like 120hz display on my s20 Fe."

UgxStaXeN4NfM-ONsiZ4AaABAg,"No impressed with LED lights. Need some honest reviews on if the phone is worth that the price will be.

UgzPTsuxZZd4kMJzm0R4AaABAg,Sounds familiar. Thanks for pointing out apple
UgyCo0p_1jY4vYTegAp4AaABAg,Foldables are the next iteration of smart phones. There is nothing revolutionary about this phone.
Ugwqpl7iJ8c1BEQKGox4AaABAg,"It looks like a cool phone, but two things prevent me from buying it: cost and size. I couldn't spend $2600 on a phone. I just don't have the money for it. Two, it's just too big for me. I currently have a phone that is over 6 inches diagonally across and it is too big for my smaller hands. I really like the concept, but they're definitely not aiming for affordability here, which is okay. But if they get off the ground, they should certainly look into that."

I was fans of Oneplus for quite longer time  but the new design really lost design direction & very exclusive phone..ever.   hopping Oneplus  won't end up like HTC..
Ugx7d2_a3OPHxEAfMot4AaABAg,"Feels gimmicky, even if it ""works"". It's not disruptive enough, imho.

UgzttUNRFZu7LWd5JCN4AaABAg,"I see it can be quite irritating with the lights when there are notifications coming in. Looks like the smart phones market is now too overly saturated and companies are starting to play with other parts of the phones like LEDs. It will only be interesting if users can customize the layout of the LEDs, or replaceable LED back covers with different patterns, or maybe aRGB LEDs? I will not buy this phone just for the sake of having LEDs at the back. I mean, how often do I even look at the back of the phone everyday right? I would prefer having the notification LEDs at the sides of the phone rather than at the back of it."

UgxJih3-ZHfWpNuiYvx4AaABAg,"damn... this makes me wish Apple didn't have such an awesome ecosystem. I love my iPhone, but it is the quintessential ""glass slab with a camera cluster"". Just that battery charge indicator, alone, makes me want this!"
Ugw05K9SOznNGBMQOHV4AaABAg,Nothing has everything.
UgyovQYsmn-9DtTgXZ94AaABAg,I've been looking for a decent alternative to Samsung.   I hope this one makes for good competition.
UgyovQYsmn-9DtTgXZ94AaABAg.9cZHpBLngPN9caAIbqYK7b,"@franz no, My first smartphone was a very early Android and it was terriblely unreliable so I switched and then I had an iPhone for quite some time.   I wanted more freedom to side-load apps, change the theme, have expandable storage (which is slowly being taken away).   and as a Windows and Linux user, I hated iTunes.  It never seemed to work properly for me.   So it was a matter of filling the needs and wants I had.  If Apple would become a more open system I would consider switching back.  But until then Android seems to be the option most suited."
UgyovQYsmn-9DtTgXZ94AaABAg.9cZHpBLngPN9cZLnQmZhg-,it's either you just hate apple for no reason or you're an android fan who would choose anything over iphone.

UgxGFBMqIlV3tlbBBNB4AaABAg,Waiting for iPhone to copy that and the legendary line comes out - its only available on iPhone - Steve j
UgxqOPGx8VMJ9qCUk8l4AaABAg,"I'll tell ya what. it's been so boring lately with alot of the current smartphones out there. They all look generic. Big camera setup on the back and plain back.

However, Nothing is very unique and I quite like it. And actually new functionality that's refreshing. I've always been a die-hard fan of the Pixel phones. However they've just lost their way I feel

Might actually switch to nothing. it just depends now on UI Design and Camera quality, as well as other features it may have and the chipset. 

Definitely a contender tho I feel, for people who want a little more uniqueness, than a boring Iphone or Android."
UgxKoQnBV-4ch_7JW9t4AaABAg,"Nothing about this impresses me......cool, a clear back. The light having different functions is a straight gimmick. Either a phone is in a pocket away or you always have your phone facing down to. The wiggle to see charging status is the only practical thing I see. A promo phone to show people that a phone has lights on it. Its iPhone XR with a whole punch and thick bezels."

in war, you need a staging ground before an actual invasion assault..
I mean, if they want to take on Apple, they should start on where Apple presence is ""weaker"" first and build a staging ground on those market.. there's no point doing a paradrop on strong Apple markets without their own established market on other regions to support their company's continuity.. if they only sell em on EU and US, their adoption rate will not be high and probably disappear like Essential Phone

while they're just a startup company, Xiaomi is no different when they started out with their MiUI theme app.. but Xiaomi targeted the right market first when they build their phones before expanding worldwide and into other stuffs like TV and Vacuum Cleaner.."

UgyWGMR7yiB3dyA04tF4AaABAg,"This is one of those products that gets points for trying to be different and build its own character but isn't very pretty and attractive. The back of the phone isn't very harmonious, it's a bunch of shapes thrown together, so having it be transparent and seeing those parts that are primarily like this for practical reasons is kind of unnecessary, you know? I'm all for personality and character but we hide electronics and internals because they aren't meant to look a certain way, it's all practical.
Now granted there is an effort here to make it presentable but would you really want this as your phone over what you have right now design-wise? I don't think many people will go get this because of its looks. Just screws, notches and clearly indicated areas for parts on the back, looks forced.

On top of that, why are the LED's so buffed? A stronger and bigger light has more use cases I guess but if you want them just for notifications aren't they a bit too much? A scenario keeps popping up in my head, that of being in a movie theatre and keeping notifications on because you want to and the light being too distracting to you or others. I saw the options to lower its strength but those are still a lot of lights.

Design-wise I think it's definitely ugly, sorry. I don't get the company's direction of having devices be transparent but not clean. Some people apparently like what they're doing, so good for them. I don't get it since the company could really hammer it in and go bonkers with the concept but right now it's an awkward mix of trying to be different but also the same, with an ugly result that appeals to neither.

And yeah I don't like the ringtones either. Pretty much all of them are obnoxious and ""sting"". Weird direction."

UgxZJERJ8v_iwMyCvJh4AaABAg,It‚Äôs a very neat and interesting concept and for those who love to dabble into technology and want something that sets their phone apart from everyone else then yeah this device looks appealing!

The lights in the back and its features are interesting, though, and I feel like other phone companies may ""take inspiration"" from it."
UgxIHUgnuLtEiQCw16h4AaABAg,"That hint to OnePlus at the end may be more significant than we think. The starter of nothing was a starter of OnePlus so they may just become another flagship maker.

UgyOm-za6dZGuvCLDVV4AaABAg,"I love the design! However, it seems like all the innovation is on the back of the phone. The only times I want my phone turned on it‚Äôs back is when I don‚Äôt want to be distracted by notifications. All the those lights at the back defeat that purpose. Most of those functionalities could be achieved by just turning your screen into a minimalistic notifications center - light up a small part of the screen when you have a notification while the rest of the screen stays off.

Ugwb9Ma1rNWH-uXa5Y94AaABAg,"Haha... Taking a jab at One+ ü§™üòÅ
I guess big part of their success or failure will hinge on the price. Not many people will buy it if it's gonna be in the flagship price range.
And the Individualised light patterns will probably be more confusing then helpful; kind of a more is less kinda thing.
Also being to different might prove to be boring in the end because due to it's transparent back with lights, you'll only be able to have it as is or with a clear case which won't change the look at all. So the current boring phones will actually have more customisation options starting with the different colours then lots of case options or custom skins..."
Ugy4B--O--tWkAmKYfd4AaABAg,The one thing that kinda kills this phone's design for me is the fact that the front bezel is black instead of white. And if it also had an under-display camera on top of that it would be the most futuristic phone to ever release tbh.
Ugy4B--O--tWkAmKYfd4AaABAg.9cZ40-ZP8hk9cZN3EWFE24,"Also the cameras are black

We really need something more then just a slick design and led's and that's a whole new, privacy related, OS on our mobile phones. Which is really open source and ready to make it or brick it. Because Apple is going full on AI related shit which is nothing more then a full time scanner on OUR phones which tries to seek for any suspicious activity. Because their AI already is scanning our photos. And Android is nothing more then Googles (also AI scanner) profiler and ad marketing plug which nest itself deeply in our lives."

UgzBvVx0-11UyoQ8OvF4AaABAg,"While admittedly a very cool design quirk, it's not gonna be enough. At the end of the day it really boils down to how much value it will be, so its pricing. Look at Sony. There's no such thing as a bad product, just bad pricing."
UgwSWqJRBOU079RowyF4AaABAg,"I think it is definitely a phone that would become a talking point when someone sees it's features in action. Much like the ZFlip3 or the Fold, people don't see it everyday so when a feature like that is shown it will draw a crowd and gain attention that way."

UgzRgiV96WTc_bK657l4AaABAg,"Doesn't really do much for me looks like every other phone with some lights on it. What we want is removable battery, headphone jack, sd card slot, usb ports, etc. This is an everything phone lol"
Ugwim8McDA_HB0LXnqh4AaABAg,I feel like the lights are a pretty cool accessibility feature for the hard of hearing. Like they would be able to distinguish diff ringtones for diff people.
UgyvfrP70Zz_vo4fmzZ4AaABAg,Surely some of the surfaces at the back can be transparent?

That light notification, i think nokia 3220 do it better?
Their mission is to beat apple , but hey , try beat samsung first. Im using s22u , but the light show cnt attract me"
UgwEb1C5-EB54PJ4mHx4AaABAg,The thing is nobody keeps their devices face down....so what's on the back of the device isn't relevant at all. We spend 100% of the time looking at the front display. Its a good tihng Pei left One Plus...because this device is DOA!
UgyorsWha7OPbvUx6gJ4AaABAg,"Weird decision though it's not RGB. I think for like the charging indicator it would be cool to color it according the percentage. Plus that would helpful for notifications too. I can imagine I can indentify the application based on it's unique main color, like discord blue vs skype blue."

UgwNmKcyMKt84ns3XaB4AaABAg,"One thing they do actually better than apple, the phone does not have a notch"
UgyJOa-3o5HRoMaq0114AaABAg,"id get it, to keep the consistency between apple and android devices inside hand and pocket. android unique selling point is past beyond powerful chipset, biggest ram, largest camera sensor. brands need to come up with new strategy, or some distinct features but not niche enough that be able to hook the masses. a close example would be z-flip and alpha/pro camera, one managed to find the stable footing while another isn't."

UgxmCV3QSfMJcwitaCh4AaABAg,If nothing can keep on time updates and actually have strong support on the device I think this is a winner in my book.

Ugz6aJraOgAyiaFXqr54AaABAg,"It's really very cool, and the glyph system is doing a lot more than I expected, but instead of thinking ""Maybe I should switch"", I'm just wondering if Apple would ever do something like that (Answer: ""yeah nah"", but that's the thought process as I was watching- sorry nothing!) üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

OH AND PLEASE, I AM ON MY KNEES BEGGING FOR THIS.  Please add a decent DAC in it with a headphone jack.  Even if the headphone jack has a little white rubber seal thing to sort of hide it when not in use.  Pretty please?  I really want to rock at that awesome AUX party man.  Please please please, headphone jack.  Don't care if it's a V2 that costs more, I will wait for it happily. :)"
Ugw5lkMS-DLKobLB15V4AaABAg,It looked like an somewhat transparent iphone to me

UgyVJpe3ITVscBqszmJ4AaABAg,Bro this is an stripped iphone ü§î
Ugy1qbPLi0ACfRE3D0B4AaABAg,The only thing that matters is privacy and security going forward. The data extraction from users has to be ended and the only way that happens is if people switch to privacy respecting phones and OS's. Apple and Android are NOT private. The best option as of right now is grapheneOS on a de-googled Pixel.

UgycuxYTrrgUZ0J6zJh4AaABAg,I want it
UgzX9siJXfcF4KlyC8B4AaABAg,"Looks like a nice phone. Based on the OS presentation I was expecting an anime matrix like thing on the back, but still looks good.
Hope they make it and within a few years achieving a coherent clear aesthetic among the ecosystem. I'm a sucker for clear products so that's enough for me. I don't need a revolutionary proposition to be aboard."

UgwF_S31iMYRgdzAt3N4AaABAg,"Looks too cheap for iPhone 12, maybe android remake of iphone XR."
UgxgYzFd33zq3qrZ8lF4AaABAg,I don't find myself laying my phone screen side down very often so I don't see how this would be very useful to me personally. I do miss when phones had notification leds on the front though like my galaxy note 9 had.
Ugz6ClqyusHGZz96uHJ4AaABAg,"I'm in the Market for a new phone, So I'll give this one a look and I can say right now, if the Software works like it's supposed to, I'm in"
UgwsKQvwhmegxSphisl4AaABAg,"Honestly, this phone brought back my passion for innovation in the smartphone industry which was long gone since the ages of the Galaxy S7 and OnePlus 6. 
Nowadays it's all just the same designs and features in every phone year after year, all brands and models. All the same glass and metal bricks, with a screen on one side and cameras on the back that allows you to work and browse through social media. Since it's already a normalised and stablished industry with very little room for exciting innovation in technology, design and wow factor, a shift towards emotional design had to be made. A way to appeal to people's identity so they can express themselves by owning something different and unique that stands out from the crowd. Just like those collaborations between brands are trying to do or the iPhone with the new personalized lockscreen.
I'm really excited to see what comes next RGB lighting coming for sure. Bring back that notification LED so I can assign a color to my favourite contacts like the old days."

Ugxe7T5KZD3qkfYKZJZ4AaABAg,"Well I‚Äôve had the Ear 1 for a year and what I can say about Nothing is the following :
Their products are really nice looking, with good features and not too expensive. Only problem I had is, the earphones died twice in less than a year (I had to use the warranty twice and replace them). So I‚Äôm a bit worried about the quality of their production. I really hope they can step up, and that way it will probably be a success on the long run!"

UgxXFuIDD9_j9XD8y6J4AaABAg,Imagine it had RGB
Ugzj473BaIL3Q0PTNwZ4AaABAg,"Personally if I had to choose between an iPhone and the nothing phone, appearance-wise I'm gonna go with the nothing phone.
Now from the software perspective I don't know, I don't own an iPhone, only had cheap androids.
I now have a mac and I get why everyone likes the ecosystem, I can see the potential without even having an iPhone.
That said, those lights on the back could be enough so that if I had to choose between iPhone and the nothing phone,I'll probably go with nothing phone."

Ugy2Velr1qwxWNvXGUN4AaABAg,"I dont get what is the big deal about this. So it has cool lights on its back but everything else it offers is pretty much the same as any other android phones out there. This is just another iphone copy, design wise, with android OS."

Look at me sleepwalking everyone into complicity in human rights and labor rights violations. Look at you being tricked by LEDs measured through with all sorts of scores on all sorts of variables like kids tricked for candy.
UgzPe5-PKVFOrfTzUvB4AaABAg,If LG couldn't do it and it had great innovation. Well this phone won't make it with just extra lights nahh.

UgyEUdysts4cf0vWkv54AaABAg,"If they had tried the full screen display with an under display camera, my interest would have been piqued. There really is a lack of OEMs pushing that in the NA market which is a shame esp if Nothing is meant for enthusiasts. As it is, it def just looks like an iPhone 12 running Android. The whole lighting gimmick is cool for the first 5 minutes you are using it until you realize you would have to always leave the phone upside down on the table for it to even make sense. Still waiting for full screen display‚Ä¶"
UgzfdMIkVRKLaAtAaKR4AaABAg,I actually really really like that phone. I just hate android unfortunately and I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs running. So I wouldn‚Äôt get it solely for that reason. I do realllllllly like it tho

UgwpXmetYru0QaUiTtt4AaABAg.9cYupd364hQ9cZ3K5RBQwB,"I agree, the ringtones were frustrating, let's hope that there's atleast some good ones that actually make good use of the glyph"
Ugx4ReeDqYalCALS6sh4AaABAg,"idk why, but I kept thinking nothing and essential were the same brand..."
UgweTsESVQhEdX8wELh4AaABAg,Well... That's something
Ugz12rfSt7aO-7_cNbB4AaABAg,"phone looks great honestly, but i do wonder how much those LEDs effect battery life, since theres a large number of them. if it's not significant then im all in for the design."
UgwiQeMaCPPNsAwSh0Z4AaABAg,with the thumbnail of the video i thought it was a clear iphone 11üò≠
Ugxr8c4h0YS6378bYiN4AaABAg,"People would just slap a case on it, and then the lights ar covered..maybe a clear case would do.."
Ugye1K1VgNRYl6rRHRB4AaABAg,"With OnePlus dead, we need real flagship killers in the market."
Ugw3xQssbgM0oZyeSyN4AaABAg,Just need a black one with the ability to choose the LED color! RGB selection!

UgyfPRj3k8cbVF8QLtd4AaABAg,My only consider at the moment is... How much does the use of all the led lights uses up the battery consumption
Ugzb7zRC5h4y83VRrfl4AaABAg,This looks really cool and innovative. I hope they can stir up some trouble.

UgyKAN-XIqDs6oAZwz14AaABAg,yeah we know this is just iPhone-ish but much better
Ugwo84vBg0FBg5GLSzt4AaABAg,This phone is super sleek and I'm a sucker for an led for notifications and that light design on the back sold me. I think the only thing that might hold me back would be the eventual price. I'm not super cheap I own an S20 Fe so 700 dollars is reasonable but I don't think it's different enough that I would spend more than that

UgzULYLZ2Y-iYKKHCOV4AaABAg,I thought the notifications were moved form a small led to our wrists with a hefty price tag
Ugz4JF0hR00K4Vj9NpN4AaABAg,It looks like a recycled iPhone
UgxgTNn1p2zPc7FrLbF4AaABAg,"so its still a regular phone???  iphone design with android system, not to mention the earbuds copied a lot from airpods pro and jbl pods, definately not a unique company at all"

UgyHp0hOZ2nMLE0_IXh4AaABAg,Usually 99% iphone users put thair overpriced toys into the bumper! So all this led lights useless. And they are useless - just draing the battery life

UgyWf5jDUlbue3oh9f54AaABAg.9cYtAoWxSPe9cYtJtfk2A9,Won't be long till you come back with one I suspect.

UgzSam0PJKo435KZHid4AaABAg,"The camera's probably gonna dissapoint me so im not expecting much from a new phone company. But i hope they should make the camera more like iphone or google pixel, not like the usual chinese oversaturated looks"

UgzO1S1-b6ZKFXhk4YR4AaABAg,"Underpainted glass slab: Bland.
Glass slab you can see some painted electronics and LEDs underneath: Innovation.
I wasn't sold on the Ear 1, I'm not sold on this. They're trying to pull another OnePlus, and the current market has them having to try to stand out even more than OnePlus did back in its hayday."
UgxHdtCIKIS7zpVyMph4AaABAg,I don't give a shit about the phone Unless I see nothing's business plan for the future. As mkbhd asked when is he going to sell the company ?
UgwnguixIMHT_M8tGl54AaABAg,Nothing gonna be the next OnePlus
Ugyce25BvVzZF_DDhSV4AaABAg,So no one is gonna complement the symmetrical bezels?
UgyADy1-YVry-PCMg8Z4AaABAg,All Apple has to do is add a flashing notification light to the next iPhone and this company has no USP and will fail lol.
Ugz_1eCF3JXrx9X0zvp4AaABAg,Different? Looks like a magsafe case... haha
UgxYkZ3OgMoL8Ik_t7h4AaABAg,I remember on my Nokia N900 I could set color and blink patterns to any kind of notification in a pretty complex UI. You could basically morse-code the whole Bible if you wanted to. I just used it to dim the charging indicator LED at night. The N900 was way ahead of it's time.
UgxCyRQkhWtKXIjyPUJ4AaABAg,"The design of this phone, looks damn near perfect. Its about time 'phones were fun again'. If it had a headphone jack I would buy it in a heartbeat"
UgxCyRQkhWtKXIjyPUJ4AaABAg.9cYsdzTAOPL9cYxeqqdO9A,They already have wireless earphone so no hole
Ugz1IxVefBXTDW38Lgx4AaABAg,That shot at OnePlus hurt me personally lol.
Ugxg2taPnBDDLVxA_2V4AaABAg,"I think the lights are cool, I also think that Google perfected this back with in nexus lineup. I'd much rather have different colors for different notifications than different patterns. I really do miss that feature. Just my two cents.."
Ugxg2taPnBDDLVxA_2V4AaABAg.9cYscEc3gsK9cZadvqub2Q,Razer Phone 2 did this. I had the original and the 2. The 2 was so much more refined. Unfortunately it all stopped there and I went back to OnePlus. I also owned the essential phone ph-1 which I definitely miss.
Ugxg2taPnBDDLVxA_2V4AaABAg.9cYscEc3gsK9cZUGjMsaO4,"@Kalliste  i think the phone1 has the fingerprint in the unlock button because in the first seconds of the video Marques unlock it but there's no icon for the fingerprint on the display like other phones, but who knows, maybe he has disable it."
Ugxg2taPnBDDLVxA_2V4AaABAg.9cYscEc3gsK9cZTPrWygwA,Yup loved that color notification LED
Ugxg2taPnBDDLVxA_2V4AaABAg.9cYscEc3gsK9cZMT1Ei4vm,One of the things I missed the most going from Nexus to a new phone too. AOD helps. Nothing phone also needs fingerprint scanner on the back. It's far more natural than on the screen.
UgxvpQfGwcuViUjrx8N4AaABAg,"looks like iphone - same fat borders, same frame which is not suitable overall - NOTHING special. Everything secondary. Oh - led lights...AMAZINg, ringtones - anazing is this NOTHING or another apple presentation - when sone old fart selling outdated crap for overprice?"
UgwfNTx2eVf8BMcl8MR4AaABAg,Why should someone place a phone on a flat surface with the screen facing down?
UgwfNTx2eVf8BMcl8MR4AaABAg.9cYsYu4K3Uy9cYtYT64K5Y,Valid point!
UgwVcIFCvUOzx9VPkqV4AaABAg,Is it just me or does somebody else see an abstract apple on the back?
UgyvPIp-HHv2RkGnHLZ4AaABAg,"real strategy really, you know that's not happening why would i buy a phone with only gimmicks I'll soon get bored off üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
UgzL4rchBWwLJyBgItF4AaABAg,"If they were gonna go with a DBZ collab, why didn't they go with a Capsule Corp theme? I get that Goku is the face of the brand but he's also the ultimate luddite. Naruto is in a similar vein. And while I like the look of the LoL one, it looks like the Cloud9 Halo Infinite skin. They should've gone with a Hextech look."
UgyzC05KnsAnFOcdRhN4AaABAg,Marques are you an investor in this company?
UgwSEisSG5unLC_rd9Z4AaABAg,You have to bid on a phone??? Just checked the website. Last sale was $2651. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª

UgwWnTcozaitTOV-4aZ4AaABAg,"Honestly I haven‚Äôt even watch this video and this seems like a generous tutorial for a vintage look phone.  I know is weird cause this is not common on phones, but who remember back in the days electronics with transparent covers and so on."
Ugw7vl3KOiQFkq7oXzJ4AaABAg,How repairable though
Ugws4BWd3oL-uGvZi0x4AaABAg,Looks literally like an iPhone 11 Concept

Ugw3u5rr5nlNtzk6uNp4AaABAg,"Did you just spell Samsung? :)"")"
UgwXATWcQHz1J6YweUp4AaABAg,"Very gimmicky to say the least, unless it is very efficient those LED's will just eat away the battery. To also appreciate and take advantage of the LED's you will need a clear case or no case as mentioned so that's a for me. I'm looking forward to the full review tho..."
UgwOBEAlvC3O7V2H6SB4AaABAg,It would be nice if its rgb which could turn those led colour it would be awsome like cyberpunk phone üòç

Ugz-BURetIYDjefEf0B4AaABAg,"As far as branding goes, I really like Nothing. They're stylish dudes who bring some cyberpunk-ish/industrial vibe to boring tech. I'm an Apple boy, but something inside of me wants to buy Nothing products."

UgyViQMUBCFbJ1rGvXV4AaABAg,4:12 that ringtone reminds me how my old speaker tells me when I'm about to get a phone call LOL
Ugwl-f1cvF38mmRGsHh4AaABAg,"Well we can say, ‚Äúnothing is different‚Äù"
Ugydom22HbIhJgGaSKZ4AaABAg,"To be honest, I don‚Äôt find any brand replacing apple. I had high hopes on HTC and OnePlus. But I don‚Äôt see them replacing what apple stands for. Surely, android did change a lot over years but innovations in smartphone space has slowed down. The questions is always always what‚Äôs next big thing. 

With HTC nomore, OnePlus taken over completely by Oppo and Phones from Samsung and Chinese brands being just fancy phones with buggy features doesn‚Äôt make up a great deal for the future. Hope this can gives us more from what I can see now."
UgwnDtN_nHn0KOvOLpJ4AaABAg,"Thanks for the review.

UgxvRY9IA6kq5fQBVDx4AaABAg,"Slap a skin on it! Just not covering the lights.

Imagine a black phone with those lights"
UgyP_drCxU3XVvLNJet4AaABAg,"Not gonna lie, they've managed to pack way more functionality into these leds, than I've thought. It's enough for it to be more than just a gimmick. It's nice not to be disappointed for once."
UgyP_drCxU3XVvLNJet4AaABAg.9cYrmffkXmD9c_OMcHI6p2,"it's true but the question is how well it will be adopted. if the themselves treat it like a gimmick, they're not gonna put too much effort in it and it will not go much further than what we already see here. Also depends on how accesible it is to App devs"
UgxV1W9tRMSjGPE8HEZ4AaABAg,I think in black that would be sick with the LEDs

Ugz-kH0FZy18GT2R9LR4AaABAg,It sounds like One plus for me... And maybe the nexus line up
Ugydfqw0LDGarD-ZddB4AaABAg,Anyone notice how the LED‚Äôs on the back are in the shape of the Apple logo? Including the bite and the leaf?
UgxanYCRYfChUUfc0ox4AaABAg,A nice little pinch of salt to OnePlus. Delicious!

UgxYkFvneYpJjulhzth4AaABAg,"This is super cool.  It‚Äôs quite similar in concept to the OnePlus, and as someone who owned the OnePlus One, and OnePlus 6, if I was still on Android, I‚Äôd definitely consider this guy as my next daily driver.  I love Nothing as a start-up and will likely support them if they do Apple compatible accessories.  Would anyone else buy a blutooth iPhone case with the same light feature?  I sure would!"

UgzqnSsnlnkzIjqfkuh4AaABAg,I got the reference (1+) at the end of the video
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg,"It looks absolutely amazing, i guess the main thing for me would just be the fact that i'm not a person who ever puts their phone face down. All the notification functions the back LEDs serve is what i use always on display (with phone laying face up) for. It's been beaten into me from the days of easily scratched screens to never put my phone face down on basically any surface other than like my bed. Now days i know it's mostly ok to put your phone face down since the glass is better, but that's a habit i would specifically have to change to get any use out of the LEDs on the back of the phone. 95% of the time i would never see them."
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9caYZd9C0MU,"@VMYeahVN okay, you're right üòîüòî"
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9cZxPc93pfp,@alnexus Flashing LEDs on the back of the phone is more of a distraction I would think lol
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9cZwzxo3kcO,I think that was their objective. Putting your phone down makes the phone less of a distraction for most people imo.
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9cZnMt1fhAo,@Ankit Same here lol
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9cZa5GY_tJL,Maybe u don't use glass guard i m more afraid of my camera lens getting scratched üòÇ
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9cZCmA_OdxL,Agreed. I never put my phone face down for the same reason and I also put my phones through a substantial amount of wear and tear so I buy a new phone and a case at the same time. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a naked smartphone. Unfortunately that doesn‚Äôt leave me with much reason to get this one. The design is dope and caught my eye though. Maybe in time they‚Äôll add more hardware features that will have wider applicability.
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9cZ94ScqREd,@TBD I really don't think it would unfortunately. I wouldn't stop using Always On Display. So I'd still always have my phone face up and would never see the LED lights on the back. I kinda wish they figured out a way to have a cool version of the light on the front somehow.
UgyJUyYhdmZwQUKu6MN4AaABAg.9cYqU0J3thx9cZ8cjTve7j,You would though if you became their customer; by which their product would change your habit of doing so.

Ugzupjh54R3E5aEsMY14AaABAg,"As a long time android user this is something I have really been hoping for. While apples software is personally too limiting for myself I have always liked there design ethos, which is essentially non existent in the android market.

UgzP-0qI0x8I1IZhmeV4AaABAg,I smell a lawsuit brewing..
UgxEwwI__GqPRaHJgrR4AaABAg,"Oh look it's an iphone that runs Android with a light design. 

Seriously? This is what perks your ears? Lights? 

What happened to phones like the LGv20 that could do everything this phone could but then times more? Why do you people seem to care about pretty lights and lol, ringtones?? Also those ringtones all sound like garbage."
Ugy8_IJ51Iv3kZimXSJ4AaABAg,"Main factor to switch will be the OS. If they are targeting the android audience these cool features comes with cost. Market leaders in android might be Samsung, Xiaomi but majority of them doesn‚Äôt own a thousand dollar android phone compared to Apple. Unless they come out as $400 android phone they have less chance to succeed. 
About the led lights. 99% of the time user will be facing the screen while using the phone or in pocket while ringing. Are they really dumb enough to spend on development just to serve very tiny percentage of users who keeps their phone upside down on a table in a meeting just to show off? ü§Ø."

Ugyy1ks81zDsakvWtIp4AaABAg,"the thing that makes or breaks this phone for me anyway is going to be dev support. Do they allow the bootloader to be easily unlocked and the phone to be rooted like Oneplus used to or do they keep it locked down and an absolute nightmare to do anything on it. I guess time will tell.


full disclosure I haven't looked up anything on the phone if they did say they would allow easy bootloader unlocking/rooting i may be very interested in this device"

Ugzyxw9vmbOp5ONPJf14AaABAg,"""sounds familiar?""
Who is he referring to?"
UgwNck7_5TbXHDRhqtt4AaABAg,in my opinion the phone is already dead and isn't gonna take off simply because the main gimmick doesn't hold up to daily use led notification functionality just isn't that practical the extra light for taking pictures and video i could see working but only to a very small group of people
UgxDp5yPWn19pCEfSE54AaABAg,I can see light sabers ring tones.

UgwVRxTOOru0R8fYMbt4AaABAg,"I'd love to see a feature than makes it so the back lights can change colour and indicate different apps you assign.

UgwVRxTOOru0R8fYMbt4AaABAg.9cYoM8jO62T9cZQOQMYYju,I think it has to do with Nothing's minimalistic approach that they didnt add RGB.
UgwVRxTOOru0R8fYMbt4AaABAg.9cYoM8jO62T9cZLaBBHA2o,@Aniket Acharya with Samsung you can still change the edge notifications and color assign notifications for each app. I wish there was a RGB LED for color coded app notifications though üëç

Ugwo8XCV7AEiYta_KM54AaABAg,Nothing exciting here (Get it?).  Its basically looks like an iPhone 4 with a custom back plate.  We have seen this before years ago.  Only the battery progress bar is a neat idea.
Ugwq5mDN6su_ppRmpLR4AaABAg,That's so dope!
UgwfrXZcgzc36k67WaN4AaABAg,Apple: For $50/month you can rent our iOS and put it on whatever device you want.
UgwJSz5KVTgWIdgA7MV4AaABAg,I never understood why no backlit logos/lights on the back of the phones. It would be a killer feature and useful also like in this case probably will be. Especially for the fruit company it was their theme for so long for macbooks so weird they didn't go this route...
UgxLulXuLr8yjyJwtxl4AaABAg,"Would not buy this, even if I am in need for a new phone. My experience with Nothing ear buds was so bad (a buggy mess), I shortly ended up buying Oneplus earbuds pro and I didn't regret that. This phone could end up like a Google Pixel, with a lot of bugs.

Ugxk37aQRrjnaRf2IKV4AaABAg,It looks different? No it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs an iPhone with a weird pattern on the back.
Ugz49dSec_WmBm_bQo14AaABAg,"Is it just me, or do the LEDs on the back kiiiinda look like a Google G and an Apple apple got married in wireframe?"
UgzYu58WSoNthbDpWgp4AaABAg,"I had expected way more than what is demonstrated. Phones today are the centre of everything for us. 
You want your phone not just to look good, but also to 
- click good pictures: I know most of the game happens in the software domain, but I hugely doubt if Nothing have invested so much on the software aspect since they are a startup, plus haven't seen anything being advertised about it, the embargo to only show the back suggests that only the back is the USP and NOTHING else. 
- A smooth immersive screen: the screen of the nothing is no different, it has a punch hole. NOTHING different there. Even if it has fast refresh rate it is already something that we have seen. 
- Quality sound: just from this I mean media consumption experience. Quad firing speakers that if were collaborated with Dolby to provide the best phone speakers ever. That is disruptive. But NOTHING here to suggest that aspect too.
- Processing: Do you really think there could be a game changer thing that a startup can do here other than providing the best processor? It would be present in other phones as well. NOTHING extra ordinary here too.
-Security: It's just as secured as other android phones. 

Conclusion: High ambitious approach to disrupt the market but NOTHING that stands out other than the perception that the founder carries from OnePlus. 

Nothing that currently suggests that it would be a disruption and make everyone go for it. After sales service and other aspects too need to be considered, where NOTHING is clear."

UgzbMNelNPljaDyAArp4AaABAg,"I like those  lights, it would be hard to switch a pattern if you take someone out of your faves tho.

UgwRCZmG3CBwt8e301h4AaABAg,It‚Äôs been a long time since I seen a new phone that was doing something different that made me say wow that‚Äôs awesome and something I have always wanted. A clear phone lol. I know it sounds crazy but it was something always though android would do hence the name. I‚Äôd buy it. I am one foot out of the apple ecosystem anyhow.
Ugw5Y6qE4Q665XT3FaR4AaABAg,Oneplusssss üòÇ
UgyxnRDVMqlWS-rjjoF4AaABAg,Put iOS on it and i'd buy it üòÇ
UgyQ6iHFbTLgEhP_9YF4AaABAg,Can't wait for the review
Ugw1mp8c9f8W8o3-4BN4AaABAg,Bro can you review the Zenbook 17 fold pls I wanna know how good it is
Ugxws37bOmwGMjPOuqN4AaABAg,Uhmm that‚Äôs a Apple Logo sir
Ugw9BAjGNk37H_A8lrd4AaABAg,This is the coolest phone ive ever seen... And the design is super cool yet formal like iphone and balance bezel.
Ugz-eJ4PMHAd5f2e1Hd4AaABAg,"I want that, literally."
UgyZTRVhoBl2Yj5TKSR4AaABAg,"Nit gunna lie. If the software is good enough and the price doesn't smash the ¬£1000 mark then I'd give it a go. It looks awesome and I love nifty features like this. How much do u guys think it will cost ü§£, my guess is between ¬£/$700 to ¬£/$1,000"
UgzTCb2jZy-MCakbJTp4AaABAg,I'm sorry it's not different enough why would I want that thing on the back I like a nice smooth sleek back
UgxzPBVvhUO9tw8pQm14AaABAg,"It‚Äôs pretty cool, but I‚Äôm all about ecosystem. If Nothing manages to get people out of Apple‚Äôs hands, it will be very few as most are in it for Apples ecosystem."
UgzsMZI1Juz3JjUiLpV4AaABAg,Yeah looks good but don't expect me to not put a case on an expansive item
Ugyy-aoVlkGGgnIgbwF4AaABAg,I‚Äôm sorry but this things has the look and feel of the misformed baby of an iphone 8 and an iphone 12 with the front camera of an android.
Ugwjrh64aCq7ZUlfxtN4AaABAg,"No matter what time, what video, or what it's about, Marques always has to mention the iPhone üòÇü§¶"
UgzVY3VHi_xRHh1s3wl4AaABAg,"Since Apple Watch release, I don‚Äôt care about ringtones. But it is cool."
UgyaBiT1Zo-twXC7s_N4AaABAg,"What this Phone needs is: good battery !!! A thing, that only iPhone is the best."
Ugx3XyqSz-CI1k8F2xt4AaABAg,"Fun fact : only mkbhd got the real nothing phone 1 IN HAND,  others just use posters and clips from internet to speak about it.


That's the power of MKBHD"
UgzsW68gSiUiSmb3YiJ4AaABAg,"0:18
Bueno, parece una copia descarada de un iPhone xd"
UgzIJB2cU5nOnf2NdMR4AaABAg,those ringtones!! üòÇ back to nokia 3310 i remember we use to buy some sticks with led lights that use to flash every time you was receiving a call.
Ugw7KiFGiSC5CYJp1s14AaABAg,"This is what i imagined future phones would look like, sick design"
Ugx84L0r9JlcROrseId4AaABAg,Design is real nice! First andriod that's peaked my interest in a while. I hope it's not too expensive!
Ugy1CsF_UE2W43K560l4AaABAg,"So cool, I love it"
UgzASK9yDlb5vVqvdGx4AaABAg,The total absence of room sound makes these videos nauseating to watch

UgxZk3FMvSkudFzKnSp4AaABAg,I‚Äôd love a deep dive in to the OS. That‚Äôs all I really care about when looking in to a new phone
UgxZk3FMvSkudFzKnSp4AaABAg.9cYkrqPSCgE9cZ21_30fGx,"Just checked on their website and it looks like they have their own launcher so you can get a preview of the OS. (also means it is just an android based phone, which was to be expected)"
UgxoMb2IniCYafgLJa54AaABAg,You know when innovation in phones is fucked when a youtuber this big has to talk about lights on the back for 6 minutes
UgwKYzfoexBBuMJskUV4AaABAg,The leds are a good idea and every phone should have something like this! But the shape of them is weird tbh. üòÖ
UgyrGdaJHCHWzxOBvr14AaABAg,Who is watching this video in iPhone 12 ?
UgyjHzsd3R6TBeC-XN94AaABAg,I'm buying it
UgwxwLttGbhV1aG-ekJ4AaABAg,Nothing did actually spend some time developing this time.
UgxZFUK732wm8MRKOAd4AaABAg,i am 100000% going to get this phone
UgxZFUK732wm8MRKOAd4AaABAg.9cYkfNWfvXi9cYlBZ9LaY1,Me too!
UgxkNRnEKNFCEAZC3oJ4AaABAg,Would be so slick in black with the white LEDs..... Now that's something. The led logo looks a bit like a simplified Apple logo. Imagine cracking the back glass and the LEDs get damaged... Better have some strong backglass
Ugwg9W3eQx90x_s3Al14AaABAg,Pretty cool
Ugxy-Ei0edofhtRj6yh4AaABAg,This is a complete gimmick. No surprise seeing all the fake comments from their pr team ü§£
UgzhZqZRmaUAGcisceZ4AaABAg,The nice thing about the lights on the back of the phone is that its very good for people with hearing impairments. They have to rely on flashing lights and customizing them makes it very easy to screen calls.
UgzhZqZRmaUAGcisceZ4AaABAg.9cYkNRvdkK59cYuCnMSyiZ,"@Chris Black I might be missing something, but isn't this just about leaving the phone always facing up? Like you could do this ever since phones had OLED panels."
UgzhZqZRmaUAGcisceZ4AaABAg.9cYkNRvdkK59cYtNprvSYo,@Facundo Montero This can do it on both sides so it‚Äôs not missed. That‚Äôs what makes it nice and it‚Äôs why I commented on it. I have friends that are hearing impaired and it does make a difference.
UgzhZqZRmaUAGcisceZ4AaABAg.9cYkNRvdkK59cYsc2xMs6U,All of which an OLED panel can do just fine too so...
Ugyx71eZDgItdHNZqH14AaABAg,"I mean... you can have this done much better on front of the device with oled screen.
Who puts the phone screen down ?!"
Ugx352OsopJuVgexPQN4AaABAg,If I was apple I would sue them for the design.
UgyqKfFpl37f-Sb-f054AaABAg,"Oh my gosh I love that look, it‚Äòs like a 100% my style
Which actually makes me pretty sad because I‚Äòm certainly not going to switch to that phone and unfortunately it doesn‚Äòt make any sense to buy it anyways just because it‚Äòs pretty damn cool"
UgyqKfFpl37f-Sb-f054AaABAg.9cYkHkDXqLA9cYpg7oas6K,What phone you use?
Ugwq64qqDaxX02Os2p14AaABAg,We are up in for another OnePlus.
UgyUDRQEBceJnMY8dWJ4AaABAg,Screams gimmick
UgyRmFiBVgcrvrsMzgB4AaABAg,Features that nobody asked for.
UgzJuhNs_MFgo-AA63t4AaABAg,"Very interesting development. I wonder what influence this will have on the ""mainstream"" manufacturers."
UgzRqUWvPduDZnbuEJZ4AaABAg,Mr. Nothing.... TAKE MY MONEY
Ugw3xpgqGj-meJpPiBJ4AaABAg,is the dragon ballz one world wide yet?
Ugz6a0IkvU2mvPAyjeh4AaABAg,"That's cyberpunk as hell and if it's actually a good phone, I'll buy it."
UgxSGDxLrxshwg3VzXd4AaABAg,7 hours 1m viewsüò¢
Ugy7nG-DfksXxvNr5h94AaABAg,I think it looks nothing like I ever seen before. But seriously the mobile market is so cluttered right now it could go unnoticed
UgzFLEv5DPbcHYJuiQJ4AaABAg,"One question ...why not a dark room for a better video/point? as comparison, is like Edge screen from Samsung but more practical because is on the back off the phone, I think, correct me if I'm wrong"
Ugy2NUVc9H4YXZ_-19Z4AaABAg,"Nothing phone, something phone, whatever phone, no phone, all good name spinoffs"
UgyLjQTp04usRgfvR_d4AaABAg,"It's really hard to be excited about this. I'll give them the compliment for their creativity, it looks interesting, unique and they've integrated actual usability into it 
But.....
I don't see how LEDs on the back of the phone are meant to excite me when their function is done by the front screen in better way. Rather than assigning different ringtones that flash different to contacts to be able to recognise them, I can just look at the screen and see who's calling. Instead of wiggling my phone to see how far it's charged, I can just look at the battery percentage on the screen.

I just don't know how often I look at the back of my phone to care about having stuff there"
UgyLjQTp04usRgfvR_d4AaABAg.9cYjx3_-nRT9cYlSBo4jV7,exactly bro!
UgwNpnAbtKz-R8HXoDp4AaABAg,Wow
UgzfUcMGoiKuFUzAtbF4AaABAg,Goofy ahh ringtones üíÄüíÄüíÄ
UgwjRmG_228nFegsyUl4AaABAg,"I would love if companies that makes cases would make custom cases like so that you can see LED lights through tiny holes on the Nothing Phones back. Example... a case where you can see progress bar indicator for charging, the bottom holes would have an battery icon that lights up 0-100% on the case, which is important. Other light parts whatever comes to your mind. Maybe notification icons like messages, calls, emails on the top right corner, that lights single LED light for those icons? hmmm"
UgzNVwAaIXcDthS4Fz94AaABAg,"I like the idea that there going for but I need

Ugxz3SuYaqfhQFgR0054AaABAg,I thought you were Re reviewing the iPhone 12 for a second
Ugz1KrqZYVq1SgA8pR94AaABAg,I really like the look of this phone. But as you asked ‚ÄúWill it (the light features) be enough to compete with others brands‚Äù. My answer to that will be determined according to the PRICE.
UgzIrsCiPo-x_vBBGCV4AaABAg,finally a worthy opponent for the nokia 3220

UgzfxYDMckkLe9vIU_p4AaABAg,Those are some cool sounds and light effects
UgyYFPa8tW7kG3tcdtB4AaABAg,That thing looks awesome but what the hell are these ring tones??
UgxQeokss67SKxJpnG94AaABAg,All hype
UgzJYoDAybZnZ6ZBi1Z4AaABAg,Yeah thats cool but software and features has to be par with apple features and more.
Ugyq_iIogMTZpt-dL354AaABAg,"the lights reminded me Siemens m55 and m65, which had light indicators on their edges strobing to match a ringtone. It was pretty cool back then, one of the few features a phone of the time could possibly have, unlike now, when a smartphone can do so many things their owners don't even know about"
UgxeR7X_dt4DJ0FmNnh4AaABAg,Pointless for my use as I'll most certainly want to put a cover on the phone
UgySPyLSFtwW1pP391Z4AaABAg,Yeah thats cute but  aoftware and features has to be par with apple

UgxOECwQVOCe1qL4Ixt4AaABAg,"Personally I find that there is ""nothing"" new,  with an always on screen we could do the same thing (and this is useless with all the smartwatchs). 
Foldable screen or AR glasses (with option like DEX or continuum) will be the only real/next evolution of the smartphone."
Ugxo0cYuuPb2TDw6eAd4AaABAg,"Ok, this *IS* cool but.... It is a question of how deep into Android that they had to go to mod in this functionality. Two... Heat. For the quick flashes that they got going on, I am sure it is fine but a few of the functions allow the LED's to be on for a sustained amount of time. That does makes me wonder about how it is going about cooling, assuming that it is."
UgyTe4EolqJHTPBKTGB4AaABAg,How much did he get paid to publish this video lol
Ugz8vy-ziqSnWPuLP9F4AaABAg,"I would +1 your last line, since i know exactly what you mean. XD"

UgxnfP3gMX3yU_m7gYJ4AaABAg.9cYjFPzqUBi9cYzx8c4yzb,hi cuckoo!
Ugzw9Y-UrcLMs1gwAJ14AaABAg,Phone cases are a thing... I highly doubt many companies will (oh my God those are the most annoying ring tones wtf) bother making a clear case for that. Weird gimmick. And not a great start to have a start up controlling these types of videos right now. Didn't y'all make a video with Mrwhostheboss where you said this type of limited videos are bad

UgxudnDns4OZe03PVWB4AaABAg,My hope is that one day in the future we have other companies allowed to incorporate iOS into their phones. Imagine a Samsung phone within the Apple ecosystem. I would 100% more likely buy experimental phones as long as I had iOS in it instead of Android.
UgxudnDns4OZe03PVWB4AaABAg.9cYiZW9JzjS9c_9wY-KcYm,"@I reply to dumb people No hate? That's the most BS thing I have ever heard, iOS is targeting a different auditory, Android another one, even though most manufacturers want it to look like iOS."
UgxudnDns4OZe03PVWB4AaABAg.9cYiZW9JzjS9cYmA1DCv1B,Why would you want ios in Samsung? Android is a much better os than ios. No hate on Apple but ios lacks even the basic android stuff.

Ugw449PyosSE70UfJ_Z4AaABAg,"As much as I love their Aesthetics, and I really do, when it comes to an android phone, I'm really only looking at three things, battery, camera, and how smooth the OS is. If they can hit those, i'm in."
Ugw449PyosSE70UfJ_Z4AaABAg.9cYiN6IExT69cZ9LKA43zr,I think they'll maybe hit 2 out of 3. With how much a camera being good is based on the computational image processing. I doubt theirs will be good right on the first phone. It usually takes a while for phone companies to dial it in.

UgyQvU0B94BnkEJVxfl4AaABAg,I‚Äôm curious how many people naturally sit their phones with the face up or down.  Seems like the major selling point is contingent on consumers placing their phones with the screens facing down.

UgzKHPfCVWXuvQvWgYh4AaABAg,"The hard part is that if this style becomes popular and apple sees people want the product like this, they will just make it for their phone and make it better and more consumer friendly and than this company becomes obsolete"

UgyxRrSL_VGI59TQfA14AaABAg,Itll be cool if the next phone they release the LEDs are rgb and you can set different colors to apps or contact notifications or ring tones. That would give so much more customization.
UgxF8axiGObJIf82Ga54AaABAg,Ok wow this *just* might steer me away from the pixel 6a for my next phone
UgyvEMzAG6QrpKMSxE94AaABAg,"The look of this phone and the glyph thing is very appealing to me and i imagine to a lot of people out there. Now nothing just have to deliver in terms of software and software support. If they don't skip on popular and now essential things like stereo speaker, hdr amoled display, 120 fps adaptive refresh rate, atleast 4500 mah battery and their commitment of longer software support + bug free stable firmware, they are set for a great start, i just know it ! And on top of that, if they could include micro sd card slot and 3.5 mm earphone jack while keeping the cost down, they will become the heroes everybody has been waiting for in the smartphone industry !!! But i know that's asking too much from a startup... So i would be happy to switch as long as they include the basics i have mentioned and keep the cost in check. Also a charger would be nice."
UgybBp2vS1Nk0DTagb94AaABAg,"It would be cool for the cameras to be tucked in, and they could bring back the bumper cases"

UgyK8pH3zvMMByZXD8V4AaABAg,"The problem is breaking people out of Apple's ecosystem.

It's like leaving an abusive relationship to get a fresh start."
Ugy0uJr4yOT5kvW4dKJ4AaABAg,"TechAltar did a video a couple of years back titled something like ""Why enthusiast brands can't last"". It is worth remembering and revisiting. Enthusiast-focused products are a cheap way to build market share before transitioning to higher margin products with a broader market - most consumer electronics 'start ups' are nothing of the sort, and have no loyalty to the 'community' they initally create."

Coming to this phone, it looks pretty awesome and certainly that led will push people like me to go for it. I am pretty sure they will give specs which will nicely sit alongside competitors.

There used to be more experimentation in the Android world but for years now it just seems to be similar designs with the occasional color difference.

So yes, you're all worked up over nothing and assuming I meant iPhones were any different just because I didn't specifically criticize them in a video about an Android phone.  At least that's best I can figure out what you're on about."

UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cZjrc_K859,LED notification on the back of the phone is kinda weird design choice since most people put the phone on surface with screen facing up to prevent the screen scratced.

UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cZAojYYcCA,"I was hoping they might be able to do multi colored LEDs, sort of like a gaming phone, but with different colors, imagain being able to have Blue for Twitter, Pink for Instagram, Red your Youtube, or combinations of that, such as a back light dot (at the dot of the !) that changes colors to reflect battery life left"
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cZ91bRK32A,"I wouldn't call the back super clean, full of screws and chaotic, practical plastic pieces to hide its parts and the LED pattern is, again, random and ugly, but I do applaud them for trying something new.
I wish that wasn't the case though. Getting points for simply being different but ugly speaks to the lack of variety and creativity of the market."
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cZ5Jyi9X9t,"@Cyber_Photography You sure got super worked up and made some bold assumptions just because I said I liked the design of the phone and that standard phone designs have been boring for some time now.  Jesus.  Maybe you weren't replying to me and I'm just off, who knows."
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cZ5IvSJyLC,NOTHING really special
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cZ4Qt7FHob,"The concept is cool, but that LED placement is ugly AF.  Outside of that, I think the phone looks quite nice.  I've always preferred this mostly flat styling for a long time even when the Xperia Z phones got trashed for being too plain."
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cZ-PNhI5KE,The design is nothing special. Just looks like an iPhone with a different back
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cYzQg_DUFo,"I mean that's all Apple is, the same design ever single year with a different colour.

Least android has folding phones, curved glass, unique camera arrangements and position, frosted glass, clear glass, transparent backs, flip cameras etc etc.

If you can't find a unique android phone that looks cool than your either talking bull or haven't looked.

I haven't mentioned the hundreds of special edition releases nearly all brands do every year that are practically the same price as the basic phone if you really want an out there design.



This comment really feels like an Apple addict who wants to compliment Android but also can't swallow his bullshit enough to commit fully."
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cYyu0E-Cfy,"Just curious, any non-adroid phones that impressed you lately?"
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cYyNwfi6v1,"As long as they don't go down the route of possibly causing seizures from the LED's blinking, I am sure they will be good...  It's happened before with LED products, just not on phones. :)"
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cYx8a4p1VU,"It‚Äôs obviously based on the iPhone lmao, hardly an innovative design is it üòÇ but yes does look cool"
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cYsCu7Z0L_,"A teardown skin with cutouts for the lights will look sick. I see alor of hate, but i give them props for trying somthing different. Only lg was left making something unique and there no longer around in the smartphonegame. So unles its a slab or a folding phone, there all going to look the same. This is still a slab, but will stand out much more and have ACTUALLY usefully design features"
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cYiNJyrmCF,"It truly feels like a passion project, something that most phone manufacturers have lacked for a WHILE now"
UgzRIJcJlV8XijoN-U14AaABAg.9cYeLHOlRIG9cYfqBIeQGN,"Same - being able to have a subtle flash-tone, or an insane one (and based on contacts!) is pretty sweet."
UgxOxL_uIAqVMG_hfeN4AaABAg,"Notification lights died because they gave way to oled screens with always on displays, that was a good innovation, this seems to go backwards, it's almost retro-future."
UgxqopAi3RTdAUaVY7t4AaABAg,I was gonna get an iPhone XS/11 but now I want this as long as it‚Äôs ¬£400>
UgxWuvX4zgw9xeoKdoB4AaABAg,So I wont be able to throw a dbrand skin on it!
UgxJLHtKuvb_hUuFeSx4AaABAg,Who has their phone face down when charging
UgxJiRd9-VWc_NLU2Fh4AaABAg,"This looks awesome! Slapping glowing lights onto anything makes it about 10x more interesting, but this really does look like a very useful feature, I would love to try it out"
UgxZhAu-qm4eYfEmwdR4AaABAg,This video is 3 hours old and has 1.5 million views already?!!
UgwC8POZ2eSQ09WPsjt4AaABAg,Those ringtone lights are for sure going to scare the crap out of me in the middle of the night in a dark room
Ugw7cYOhMURSVUYrEkt4AaABAg,If smart phones came out in the 80s
UgwqOB4Suj4Ijg5uVwx4AaABAg,"The tones, the lights and the back are sci fi sick"
UgwqTj_kODpdXWYCutx4AaABAg,These guys will be sued so hard because of this design.
UgzaUWgh4YwNk6GWTx14AaABAg,Those led lights can be used as  darth wader with light saber as back case
UgzR4LzfVa4KoSueAx54AaABAg,Just a wish iphone
UgzBo1slGkETpBt8QB54AaABAg,The iphone without a notch is ugly
UgyolrPDMPsxuPO1kkB4AaABAg,"From what I am seeing, I would buy the phone if the price and expectations are met."
Ugyz5NX9QO5YDBYQvSh4AaABAg,I hope they don't abandoned back led hope it develop more and more
UgzEwFTgSC3AfpD229l4AaABAg,"They need to add more LED colors, not just white"
UgzStWU3c9_lPawahgB4AaABAg,Great design i love itüëåüëå
UgwZcsgI_imb3Eg7vpR4AaABAg,"They definitely have my attention. If it performs well and the price is right, I'll buy."
Ugxu9zWfkh1Nl2emJjJ4AaABAg,""" i can only ahow you the back of the phone"" ....: Proceeds to show us the ui"
UgysYUmxrj3A5EU1X2N4AaABAg,"It's cool, finally something fresh and new with android as OS!"
UgyF1jKbeZGLOj-pD9x4AaABAg,"i was going to buy an iPhone in a months time, but if this is out by then i might just buy it :D"
UgyZamh5GUT4-XswM1x4AaABAg,Who charges a phone with the screen facedown? The back is 'interesting' but I never see the back of my phone.
UgyOMCOguP7G9FTgAjJ4AaABAg,Basically a phone with some leds
Ugx2Zq0RXRofKK1DiRl4AaABAg,"That glow on the back for cameras is something I wanted for a long time compared to flash or a night mode, but it‚Äôs not enough to make me switch away from my iPhone 13 mini. I‚Äôd like to see Apple or a third party come out with a MagSafe accessory that can utilize LEDs like this."
UgxAju_HZkqUeVrlgZp4AaABAg,"Looks good design, but I think the back led is more like a gimmick, since most people will put a back cover....

Looking forward to the real features and and pricing to consider switching..."
UgxY9TUp-dQBewY7p1R4AaABAg,I ordered a phone and got Nothing
UgyHgtTtLbmopSUBxfJ4AaABAg,The whole light feature is completely useless with a case lmao
UgwztZi3-mWqFkyJE0R4AaABAg,Battery life: tee fiddy
UgxXhozDFutLAPKCV9h4AaABAg,"I think this is the best back idea of a phone I have seen in years, love the idea and implementation. It has that Aliens movie look to it. Cool."
UgzmQ-6KQZml3KIIJvB4AaABAg,ok l see it ok
UgzOCmhEaYgsx15nVfl4AaABAg,"I wish phone manufacturers would bring back grippy premium materials like leather or wood for the backs of their phones. Hell, if you wanted to be modern (and possibly infringe on a Lamborghini patent) you could use forged carbon. Phone design peaked with the 3rd gen Moto X"
Ugx5dwi-W-E4dzCrFlV4AaABAg,like the looks of it. need to know the internals
Ugwndukim4PWGf4e_TF4AaABAg,This looks really nice and cool.
UgzPimFoD42WU1DVjyd4AaABAg,"If they can add Traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, would be added üëç advantage."
Ugxp4KA9Qiy3ui99J0F4AaABAg,So Gimmicky
UgyTrn5BWyua-bao7Zd4AaABAg,"That subtle dig at one plus ü•≤
But so true tho got the one plus 1,3,6,7(only one that got spoilt cz of the pop up camera) ,8 and all of them work perfectly well till date but when I went to see the new one plus it was so disappointing"
Ugx5WVRo9E2g9GLLBE94AaABAg,Aren‚Äôt there any smartcases app combo‚Äôs that could emulate the LED ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù?
UgyP6wtE8w5F3hQmBhd4AaABAg,"You should do a video on anime like what animes you've watched, which ones you want to watch in future and anime themed tech that you own."
Ugx5iQjpktPPK8jqCF14AaABAg,Looks like Star Wars phone ü§î
Ugyo8xAvOpHWJfoQ9MJ4AaABAg,Reminds me of the Nokia 3220
UgwbHPFbesuYLJstsUd4AaABAg,"For all that's worth, you can actually install nothing launcher and get a taste of the UI. It's pretty amazing from official wallpapers to icon packs to widgets and ringtones. Go on give it a try."
UgxMvwyHzGieiSZAJkV4AaABAg,"WELL, promise 5 years of  updates and I will be very intersted"
Ugz7J8lqJlyi9asc5lp4AaABAg,this is gimmicky as hell
Ugwd7hxFIg1deO2JFe14AaABAg,"Why does it look like a mock-up from Apple? And no Marques, that's not cool üòÇ"
Ugw4jXwekW28i9MfJH14AaABAg,"Waiting for Carl Pie to respond to the last bit about ""Sounds familiar?"""
Ugzw-23t-gUUI2XA6ep4AaABAg,"They created a very different design, I liked it!"
UgwYSZxWaZxr3iebua54AaABAg,"So pointless. A perfect Android phone would be one that‚Äôs a 7‚Äù S22+ with Xiaomi‚Äôs camera hardware, Oppo‚Äôs computational algorithm, Samsung‚Äôs UI, and 6000+ mAh battery"
UgwA0u8l82tMMRmrT954AaABAg,Hope this one doesn‚Äôt end up like one plus
UgyksCSXuMbuKWUbZyJ4AaABAg,"Nothing will become the next Oneplus, I'm wondering now what the next company will be called."
Ugw8qifCluVf6g7WrkV4AaABAg,I would 100% get that phone.
UgzhklXSYt63R6sDAOx4AaABAg,I really REALLY hope this phones turns out actually being good. The design is so dope seriously.
UgzhklXSYt63R6sDAOx4AaABAg.9cYdAmgvsaH9cqO7UemVcf,imagine a black version with Tron: legacy Clu's orange accent!
UgzHiqggSr1xsHB_Y8x4AaABAg,Can we see the front of the phone
UgzwNHEAgBBuG1Cl0pV4AaABAg,"Will be interesting after the hype if it's actually any good, if  the ear buds are anything to go by it will have nothing good other than nice LEDs which is the only thing you can show, maybe the only thing that actually works as the screen and lag did not seem all that great."
UgxW--Epx20Jyzhojb14AaABAg,I would like to get this phone
Ugxl7ZL9HOBcHIFUONp4AaABAg,Wait... I see LTT! :)
UgyJdrts_6CSl-HhCiV4AaABAg,"Nokia 3310 Review: The Perfect Smartphone?!

Ugzs0sBiaM5Adk5LsOd4AaABAg,"Sounds too familiar to OnePlus History for me, Marquees @MKBHD Also, i will like to see a Mate Black version, and I'm pretty sure they can take my money..."
Ugw8lwO-K84HB8xXuTZ4AaABAg,I want to buy this
Ugz1-XEvxNdhSYLoS-N4AaABAg,The oneplus dig at the end lol
UgwOiq8pBxpbouj-Zz54AaABAg,I am excited to hear the specs and the price. I think the design overall is still boring but the lights do bring the phone to life a bit.
UgwN4Vi29Oe1HUAceLR4AaABAg,Man those ring tones sound like shit
UgwPioXmCXnnmlkNTPR4AaABAg,"got pretty existential at the end there, hahaha"

UgyDQGbCd8ya0TLDfF94AaABAg,Thats the coolest phone design ive ever seen o.O
Ugzq0UraCNSXqdIZDYR4AaABAg,It made me remember the Nokia 3220. Back when Nokia phones were different and each line had its own gimmick.
UgxvF5Jv2gWigiXOryx4AaABAg,We dont have enough RGB on phones yet lmao
Ugy3L3U2sX0gMolmG7V4AaABAg,"Looks amazing, but stock android ruins it for me :("
Ugybv7dK4e0-kCwMZ7t4AaABAg,I actually like almost every ringtone üòÖ and I'm curious about this phone.
Ugx5MYHh8nF7rcsm7N94AaABAg,6:31 yea it does sound very familiar!
UgyW97Xmq_rUw1igkLt4AaABAg,The last üìå was for OnePlus now which is basically oppo & Carl pei should utilize on Nothing phone
UgxJBUw3r_Luu4AVACl4AaABAg,Those ring tones are the death of ears all over the world

UgypPw_X5IfBh4PWtgB4AaABAg,Hope Apple adds this led features by 2034. cant wait.

Ugx9pXMyjPqNQSgUfBJ4AaABAg,"I came from the future, so mark my words that 2nd generation gonna have rgb (colorfull or rainbow) lights , I can tell because that's how it started for PC lights. 
Other than that I think the grandfathers of rgb phones was nokia 3220"
UgwCmmaaFE1JVPMUKTx4AaABAg,"Any company that demands half assed reviews such as this, is trash in my book.  This is a way to get free extra publicity and big YouTubers such as yourself should not be enabling such behaviour."

UgxjVYX7h7-spCV9pJN4AaABAg,Not sure how i would feel constantly resting the phone on its screen and having to turn it around to actually look whats happening. I can understand when someone wants this phone but im pretty happy with my LG Wing with a clear back mod
Ugxm7eeroK3DPX2bHFN4AaABAg,OnePlus
UgyG5L5rH3SuqPWPuUt4AaABAg,"i own the ear 1s and they are great, this phone looks great and i cant wait to see even more regarding its software etc. huge fan of what nothing is doing already"
Ugw2Ej_jMmCdy4SYA8x4AaABAg,It's sure not the Nothing Phone anymore
UgwV_YotACixYaKyNtp4AaABAg,The led notification would be useful for those who are hard of hearing or deaf. I can see this phone being used for a specific demographic or those who wants something unique.
UgwbXTIhevTHz024CXZ4AaABAg,"I like the idea of soft dispersed led lights on the back. Also, the fact that the phone is made by Nothing is a funny thing to say."
Ugzl8X07153SZ85T08t4AaABAg,*After seeing the Ringtone with LED function I am convinced that these people can make an R2-D2.*
Ugx61vWf8Jgisa9SRzx4AaABAg,"Please remember Sony Xperia U, P & S series about the LED strip lights with multicolours at the bottom. It's not new I think..."

UgwlhhMNMLkPwqPLJxp4AaABAg,Id buy
UgynkzO0vvYY-LpFvTF4AaABAg,"Love it... and I'd buy into that lighting and ring tone feature for sure, but I'm really concerned it won't keep up with the camera and general performance of my flagship Sanmsung (and other similar top tier) phone(s)."
UgynkzO0vvYY-LpFvTF4AaABAg.9cYc7o066ad9cYxRyTINUG,"@Daley Carter totally fair. I use my cameras for work pretty consistently which is why it matters to me so much. I guess I should say, I hope they do make a flagship phone of their own with amazing cameras and software that ALSO has this really awesome lighting and ring tone feature!"
UgynkzO0vvYY-LpFvTF4AaABAg.9cYc7o066ad9cYr7vX4uZx,"I'd be fine with that so long as it doesn't have a flagship price tag.

I can live with half decent cameras, and the performance of the software on phones these days is so negligible with each iteration.

I have a Z flip 3 because I thought it was a fun phone, and I feel the same about this. As long as the UI is nice and it can be a daily driver without any noticeable annoyances, I'd be down to buy this"
UgwTlnYDtV3yk_MZP7F4AaABAg,Hopefully Nothing is smart enough not to have their phones built in China. There will be a Chinese rip off company selling their exact spec for a quarter of the price.
UgyasuRCa2Tju0jZMdt4AaABAg,A company listening to the needs of their customers?!?  What a novel idea...  I hate that my S20 doesn't have a notification LED.  Who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it?
UgwuiUcUJSy0_ANNDzp4AaABAg,Those ringtones are so cool
UgwPEA22h_JbfOWo0jZ4AaABAg,"That reference at the end, aren't the original founders of One Plus in charge of this phone?"

UgwE6P3MXPszfWq5lM94AaABAg,"I feel that the flash notification is so wrong, gonna make people even more addict to their smartphone with those flashes even when the phone is put on the screen..."

Now am really surprised after seeing the comments that folks are interested to switch to this because of lights. Am sure they do realized they have to keep the phone always screen down to see those lights and of course they can't do that when wireless charging. Makes sense.. eh!!"
UgztQZTpIyE5KuL6zwt4AaABAg,Dope
UgzchMnfn3Btg25RF0x4AaABAg,Lol the back would be useless after you put on your cover which you will

Ugza8HJIHY9AqsqE2cx4AaABAg,....... I want it
UgxUM0qFPP9JZxSqpPR4AaABAg,Wow cool new idea definitely selling point. Certainly not a copy of RBG and many phones screen will light and vibrate on different notifications. Also charging animation quite neat feature don't even need to shake the phone
Ugy89_YrzBSmtk-algN4AaABAg,"Too white for my tastes. After all that marketing in dark tones, I expected a black phone... Cool ideas for the LEDs on the back, but... nothing you can't really live without. It will be appealing for someone who look for a phone different on the external part."
UgxxGob4MV8WfvaVTQx4AaABAg,"Yep, down for it, would drop my iPhone for that, hope the UI is as interesting as the device, I'm thinking along the lines of Ratio by Blloc. Does it come in black ?"
Ugy7hZzQAIJ7innFdjh4AaABAg,"Transparency is complete turn off for me personally, but I really like the ringtone/glyph synergy."
UgylHlINcMif8dtRmKt4AaABAg,I am so excited üòÉ
Ugz0frotmbGI2DOeYWh4AaABAg,"I guess the weight would be more than 200 gms if the phone size is 6.7 inc. It‚Äôs a thicker one though. The bezel is not much thin as S22. It‚Äôs like that of iPhone‚Äôs.

UgxZgQ-quWtPfVTI84t4AaABAg,"Looks like an iPhone but has the spirit of the old OnePlus phones. I'm interested, depending on the price and whatnot.

However I'm not going to go in thinking this will be the enthusiast phone and after some time, they change and feel ""betrayed"" or ""abandoned"". Remember, while they're still starting up, this is a company and over time they will do things you're not going to like. They're a company, they only care about your money."

UgwJKRsWcs7b2hu2KHh4AaABAg,"All of that is fine, but they are going to have to be just as innovative on the software side. I don't know if they can pull that off."
UgwZK94awX0iPEiTx894AaABAg,0:13 - That even screen bezel all the way around. üòåüëå
Ugy1WchV0zQjwoL2gNJ4AaABAg,"May not gel with everyone, the target would be a limited audience, case can‚Äôt be used and all that would matter would be a seamless software, I use their Ear (1) and I must say it has lots and lots of bugs and I wrote to Nothing, and yeah you guessed it, Nothing happened!!"

UgzI2g9bJfXLhQ226SN4AaABAg,We're officially going backwards. Now we don't care what the phone does on the screen. We want to see what it does in the back.
Ugw317k8G-W4W1v12gZ4AaABAg,Hear me out‚Ä¶ could someone make a case with these LED strips on the back of it that gets its power through wirelessly charging and can connect via Bluetooth to the phone with an app that lets you customise the ringtone as well.
Ugw317k8G-W4W1v12gZ4AaABAg.9cYa_iXCVpi9cZJhB8pcAW,"This right here is what I consider a threat to Nothing‚Äôs business model. A case would probably be cheaper, flexible and does not require commitment. The phone is exciting, however I don‚Äôt believe it can stand against Apple or Samsung long term. In order to win, Nothing has to bring to the table something that none of the existing phones offer. It‚Äôs an incredibly tough market but kudos to them, as an industrial design fanatic, I‚Äôm thrilled by the design."
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg,"Not gonna lie, they've managed to pack way more functionality into these leds, than I've thought. It's enough for it to be more than just a gimmick. It's nice not to be disappointed for once."
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cghmuFkX9a,"@PRIME12602 I expected *nothing* üòã They called out Apple so many times during their presentations that I could already tell they won‚Äôt have anything original.

Being a startup doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt design something original, it‚Äôs not a question of money, just creativity."
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cg6rUiimbG,@Team Puzel expectations man we expecting a lot form a startup.
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cfOaE8e43I,"@PRIME12602 The point is, it‚Äôs just very derivative of already existing products. Apple was inspired by Braun designs from the 50s. Not their competition.

I‚Äôm trying to look at Nothing from an industrial design perspective, and all they do is tweak what already exists on the market, it‚Äôs nothing new. As their name implies there‚Äôs nothing to learn from them, their phone is just boring. 

They‚Äôre trying to replace design with style but that won‚Äôt get them very far. You may like that style, but it doesn‚Äôt make it innovative. It‚Äôs not better it‚Äôs just different for the sake of being different."
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249ce2Qf8of8H,"@Team Puzel ‚Äú90% stolen design‚Äù you comparing to iPhone, it‚Äôs like saying Genshin impact looks similar to legend of Zelda breath of the wild. It is correct but it‚Äôs just a similar and there is nothing more to it. 

Here Nothing looks better than iPhone except iPhone 4 that was a masterpiece."
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249ce1lHHFJnx,@Silver Joystix cuz a lot of people put their phones upside down so that they don‚Äôt get distracted easily and focus on people or work but they get anxious on what might be happening and this will let them know and will be less distracting(cuz it will tell what is happening that is it important enough to pick up the phone) and a lot of people keep their phone silent in a lot of places that led will let you know if it important or can be dealt with later.
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249c_HZKStaE6,@Uri To show off their Apple logo? :D
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249c_H8gKVWb_,"@Someone Ever noticed that they look ugly and out of place? Are you actually going to buy a phone for its design then put a screen protector on it? that defeats the purpose of this product lol. I mean, it has literally *nothing* going for it other than the 90% stolen design. Why do you think they spent all their announcements talking about the design not features?
Not to mention before putting on a screen protector people wipe the screen with alcohol, ruining the coating."
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cZVvVB62ow,I'd love to see a phone with an led again but not on the back. Surely they realise most people put their phone down with the screen facing up which makes an led on the back useless. Why not put the led on the bottom where the charging point is (I think zenfone did this)? Or in the earpiece speaker?
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cZDYF3CPur,"I don't understand how comments like yours get so many likes.  The LEDs are only ""useful"" when the screen is facing down.  How is this not a gimmick?  I don't know anyone who buys a phone only to never use the screen."
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cZ1ad2G0Kf,AOD will always be the better choice for me personally...there's no way those LEDs don't eat up a crap ton of battery
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cZ-p8fbi88,@Team Puzel Ever heard of a screen protector
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cYpk049igA,@Team Puzel A huge amount of people rest their phones like that already.
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cYjUWztx7B,"@Team Puzel That, and I'm sure those LEDs eat up your battery depending on your use case"
UgzqlJW9p1zgCm1Agy54AaABAg.9cYa_8ZB0249cYi3DZc0x_,"how‚Äôs it more than a gimmick? if you put the phone the correct side up you can just have an always on display with even more information. (not to mention you will scratch the display by putting it screen down)
Their transparent design is interesting but not functional. Details like that really increase cost, so they definitely had to cut corners somewhere (my guess is the cameras) which are more important than LEDs"
UgzaJ_t3Vxv23BTvaFB4AaABAg,M bored of apple and android both. Need a new player. Also was expecting a bit more info/ showcasing of the front and screen and ui as well.
Ugxn92-tIAxPCR_DaIl4AaABAg,Abandoning the fan base... Exactly what happened with Carl Pei - OnePlus. Hopefully with Nothing being a VC funded company it won't turn out like OP being the sister company of OPPO and then getting completely absorbed into Oppo
Ugw-gRPWiLIFxbQ50VF4AaABAg,Betaabi se intzaar
UgxaLmXDwiIDYWw17mR4AaABAg,This is an interesting design and concept. We need some notifications like this. But now..am worried about the battery with that powerful litsüòÖü§£

UgzgDZnAsoMDO12rD-F4AaABAg,The real question: was that a PowerBook G3 in the background?
UgzkR_UuRcIRzg7OrFZ4AaABAg,I don't really see a problem with this type of phone like many other YouTubers say that no today's smartphones aren't boring they are improving from inside but I think that something that doesn't look interesting from look that will be no differ than othe phone but nothing had made something really interesting atleast by looks of phone 1 so I like it
Ugw7pONanUZ7IGXnOdB4AaABAg,I love Marques no hate but the fact he has nothing bad to say about the phone means that‚Äôs it a paid promotion
Ugw7pONanUZ7IGXnOdB4AaABAg.9cY_tJPuFde9cYa80PZ-Yo,probably under embargo so he is barred from saying anything yet.
UgzRvlrd1epb-aRrQ2N4AaABAg,I wanna know why do people hype a gimmick
UgzVYbUZfmXEsCU_alZ4AaABAg,Seen this one coming. Top YouTuber  being one of the first to give a first impressions of the Nothing Phone. Get ready Nothing to get compared to a Samsung phone like every other smartphone to show how inferior your new Smartphone is compared to a Samsung.

Ugw90SQm5oVXysCmJq54AaABAg,"I mean this does look pretty cool, but why are the ringtones made up of the most harsh, disgusting, eardrum wrecking sounds possible? _Clearly_ nobody who worked on this phone has the benefit of being autistic! The light patterns, also, would benefit from even _just a little_ fade in/out, even if it‚Äôs just 0.1 seconds. I really do like the idea of this phone and many of the ideas they‚Äôve used, but the current implementation makes this an _absolute_ sensory nightmare. I really hope they polish up these sharp edges though, as it‚Äôs lovely to see this kind of innovation in the smartphone market. Keep it up guys, but seriously, hire an autistic nerd or two - we‚Äôre _really_ not that hard to find üòÇ"

UgxuI0qJoHCa_tEIhaZ4AaABAg,Notifications lighting is cool but this also means we cannot use a case cover with it. Thus making it more fragile.
UgxhjIpk8DGc0dOc7Ih4AaABAg,If they let us unlock the bootloader and they are developer friendly I would buy it and recommend this phone to other. I use oneplus but their days are over. But they do let us root our software and still kept the guarantee

1.glowing something at back(apple logo) 
2.brick design.... 
please don't copy the price yaar(nothing but a request) üòÖüòÖ"
Ugwq1PamN16ADRkisk54AaABAg,It looks very similar to the iPhone in terms of design the only thing is different is lights I don‚Äôt think that will be enough to challenge Samsung and apple so their OS better be good
UgzIgR3MqWSQoBbp7J94AaABAg,why focus that much on the back of the phone. 99% of the time it is not visible to the user. looks like another gimmick to me.
UgzclDiaRXTv1jy_F6V4AaABAg,looks like an iphone
UgzcDJJhOOp_CYGSBYZ4AaABAg,"Those ringtones make my ears bleed but otherwise, looks cool üëç"
Ugy3VfPt_guq0lJ6Quh4AaABAg,"I really dont like the way Nothing has situated themselves, with all drops going through stockX and devices being limited. It feels like OnePlus, but rebranded to fit the hypebeast trend."
Ugy2WJshPSIndESD6Wl4AaABAg,"Man I really miss the days of weird, innovative experimental smart phones. I genuinely hope this phone is good and more than just its attractive gimmick."
Ugz-IBKvSdnZz4qamLh4AaABAg,Damn everyone gonna hate those ppls who will use this retarded fkn already annoying ringtones. Hope noone will use it
UgyKXXlTz2DUiIs7zTp4AaABAg,The front screen is crazy. No bottom bezel like other android and just one pinhole at the top.
UgyKXXlTz2DUiIs7zTp4AaABAg.9cYYWKMlaKs9cYYli2XQ0i,That tooo on the left corner....üëç
Ugy_cMPIaHYhxgloi_94AaABAg,"Well, the bet is about software updates and overall support.
If it is a real startup as it shows, it will be another failure.
But I have the sense that big funds are behind, and then again, why they didn't tell from the beginning?
Really frustrating"
Ugws7-h7vEJBtkd_0zl4AaABAg,"In the end, it's more important how it performs than how it looks like."
UgzfjWaR7CvXCf2Q1q94AaABAg,Those ringtones are dope AF
UgzVD_hrvMIsVcF3sRZ4AaABAg,"Sure I like it, but I‚Äôve always had an apple device as phone. So I‚Äôm not intrigued to switch to something else that also has another OS. But if I had something like a Samsung, I would definitely switch."
UgxDsYP_9B31dc9j91Z4AaABAg,"Oh I'm definitely up for the nothing ph1. I have the Nextbit Robin, I have the Essential Ph-1, this just seems like a natural progression. üî•üß®üî•"
UgynrlQTYMrRFRnl6_N4AaABAg,What a great phone...but I wish the LEDs were blue..

UgzAOLnVvrI1idSRn4J4AaABAg,Am I the only one who really don't like it???
UgzhdE9YdEM9t0sUk8p4AaABAg,"I sort of hate this one feature preview/review of to be launched phones. If one doesn't like that feature, say its design, I don't think withholding more information which might appeal to that person is a good idea. Brands will do anything for clicks."
UgwZqjC2g9dgpb8XtON4AaABAg,"Samsung front, Apple back"

Ugwqc3lqQM4mpNo7nF54AaABAg,It's a sponsorship isn't it!?
UgzPYJO5wJ8H81WiwnB4AaABAg,"Neat? I definitely would like to see more fun phone designs. Though this seems like a meh strategy. There's the mainstream phones like apple and samsung, there's phones that innovate like Sony's Xperia, and this is sort of... A hipster Iphone? Well now that ive phrased it that way, yes I understand why they went with this strategy."
UgwIoqu3s_1bKRzZ4ip4AaABAg,"Times when One Plus was OG and Carl Pie was with it ,, RIP One plus"

UgyXijzslNtwSj81L7R4AaABAg,"It‚Äôs a really interesting phone , I like the back lighting function for notifications or charing. But sadly I don‚Äôt use android üòø"
Ugyj0tutDDmKFk18Z1p4AaABAg,"The design looks pretty clean so far. The light gimmick is cool but I expect to see almost no users actually use the feature. The main thing I am waiting to see are things like actual specs, cost, and if the Android OS is skinned or stock and if it is skinned will they actually stay up to date or is this gonna be stuck on like Android 11/12 then be unusable in 3-4 years when no apps support it any longer. Only a month until we find out I guess."
Ugy_V_ArA62dPZmCOTx4AaABAg,I'm literally waiting for nothing

Ugw9ytYvJSxQno4Q54t4AaABAg,The ringtones remind me of the Nokia 3310 Era. Obnoxious noises
UgxkxbOSeMKJy4Ru0LF4AaABAg,Is it comes with the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 ?
UgzZEDjWu1Bu4mRXwFt4AaABAg,"I feel a black background with the white light would be sick. or different RGB. and paired with an airplay type thing with the pods or even a watch, etc!"

UgyQ8nG3dqP_bY5cy1B4AaABAg,"I'm hyped to see, how this is gonna turn out. I love my oneplus, but they have made some bad decitions the last couple of years and if nothing can do it better, i might switch as soon as my phone has to be replaced.
Only time will tell."
UgyQ8nG3dqP_bY5cy1B4AaABAg.9cYXuTBbvux9cYn-nEjQ8X,They have that's why the the co creater of one plus left to make this company. Nothing. And he bringing the innovation back like he did when one plus was going up.
UgxzIPHlxa5SSGNxpFF4AaABAg,"""yoo thats a nice phone! what kind of phone is it?""

""oh its nothing."""
UgzEVvaw_INZAQuuCq54AaABAg,"It's pronounced OnePlus, Marques."
Ugywb5QBb6NvZQpCzWl4AaABAg,"come to think of it, the back led kinda reminds me of the apple logo? not that it is intentional but the led surrounding the wireless charger and its stem kinda just reminds me of it???"
Ugzm1w3p1B9I75yiCyZ4AaABAg,"It's not familiar, just predominantly different from what you think. Yeah, i know what you think, apple fan boy."
Ugzvv15arAlEPRCtiDJ4AaABAg,I'd love to know the price point of this phone cause all I can find is about 2500‚Ç¨ and that's a 1000‚Ç¨ more than the fold phones or iPhone pro maxes
Ugz8TESlCWfWMgAfM_N4AaABAg,Really exited about this one! Something different and no 0815 shit!
UgwsWZYy832uk-jBJbd4AaABAg,I Don't like that üòï
UgwHQt2ORsMm7LNcoDt4AaABAg,"I mean if i was in the market for a phone & the software on this ends up being good, I would hands down seriously consider this phone along things like the s22 ultra or 13 pro max."

UgxeDbQzLrd_QT0y8dx4AaABAg,Hmm this weird glyph in the back of the phone seems rather familiar ü§î. If you combine the big round thing in the middle with the diagonal line in the top right corner you get a minimalist bitten üçé. Holy shit they copied the Apple logo !!!
Ugx7z4uAAfi_eY-Wr1p4AaABAg,static LED designs are pretty good.. would have been better if these were dynamic and customizable

UgwbN3v0x4o3VTiXiWp4AaABAg,Maybe I will buy it as a second  phone. But to switch form iOS to Android again‚Ä¶. thats not enough.
Ugw5B_7V9mq1P9YDfch4AaABAg,"Where have I seen that before?
Oh yeah, Nokia 3220."
UgwdX1uzGkRwtm97sY94AaABAg,The display and the SOUND too :D!

Ugyx6grtVAvjJzlmSYJ4AaABAg,Creative. Might try it out if it isn‚Äôt too expensive! Not gonna change phones though! I don‚Äôt rly know anything that would make me switch from iPhone or Samsung! Unless a new actual useful feature comes out on one phone but the problem is all phones get any new feature within a month

UgyanmYywfNv1cCzA9B4AaABAg,Gimmicks. Nothing else. That's how they should call their company. Give me a damn third camera lens for tele instead of this crap.
UgyD0zhAaHKQ9P_ukg14AaABAg,"Difference for difference sake...standing out by putting a light show on the part of the phone that people will look at the least.  As if anyone with a smart watch needs a notification pattern on the back of their phone.  

What is the virtue of standing out by championing pointless ideas?  Is there a gold-star to be had or something?  Why couldn't Pei and co solve some real problem in the world, some real inconvenience of mobile devices?  Start there and dare to start a new dialogue, a true re-evaluation of the status quo.

They called the company Nothing and the puns write themselves but they should have named it Nowhere.  As in 'our ideas for innovation are literally coming from and going nowhere."""

UgxwOAjr1u5K96UE6rJ4AaABAg,Samsung LED Cover does all of these. So this is also not new.
UgzGpaAyC5o0hxVyeZh4AaABAg,Looks very cool but I'm more concerned with the UI and what support we would be able to count on.
Ugz8NAoZASJKKgEbuaJ4AaABAg,Sound familiar oneplus? üòÇüòÇ
UgzkmhpB4EZ0j0rdE9d4AaABAg,this could be a saviour for oneplus users....as well as a good flagship experience
UgxZHYukqis2WAeCTXF4AaABAg,"Would be cool if they built in the option to have the lights in different colors. That's a feature I miss, the LED that tells you, based on color, what's going on. Like I had green for email, blue for incoming calls, red for calendar etc."

UgzSnHeZ-LUOwRR6ycZ4AaABAg,"The back does look sick but i am more interested to see the specs and the software experience. All the bells and whistles won‚Äôt attract customers unless its par or sub par and is able to retain the essence that one plus had when it launched.

UgwuMkNpQKkbkIvyDcN4AaABAg,I'm really hoping that Nothing will make good phones because I was a new phone with OG OnePlus DNA because I got the 7 Pro which was old OnePlus's last phone.

UgwzGq1eupPZ6-wncFp4AaABAg,"I'm not impressed by any of this.  I would have been happy with a phone with a physical keyboard.  That would have been simple, effective, and different.  Instead, they are providing a phone that I literally have to use with the screen facing down."

Ugy-m8Er_VA0NImzcit4AaABAg,"Cool. If it is priced for the mid-range market/upper mid-range I can see their strategy working.
For the hi-end...no. Just design alone won't be enough to compete with Apple and Samsung. They won't have the display tech or the color science for the cameras.

That's what they did with Ear 1: lots of posturing about competing with Apple but nowhere near the price of both Airpods or Airpods pro."
UgwYa5dG74kwXkJWMYt4AaABAg,"Wait i'm confused. You said you're not allowed to show the front but then continue to show it, or is that just an edit over the screen so we still don't know what the cutout looks like??"

Ugyt05TUdzPjh71M9gt4AaABAg,"I'm calling it right now.

The device will be cool for like 2 weeks and then fail."
UgwiVf-vRCwFnGemmXJ4AaABAg,Nahhh not that impressive to make you shift from a established brand to an unknown one. OnePlus is the last company that were able to scale up super fast and survive. I don't think we've had any post that. Realme etc were backed by BBK officially from Day 1 so not included. Yes I know OnePlus is owned by BBK but they were extremely independent and more like a project for BBK

Its a really cool phone that is very tempting to switch to"
Ugw8hMmbHCe0-ZMqf_B4AaABAg,Flashing lights on the back not really very useful as most people don't lay their phone down on the screen or will have a case on ..so nothing new there. Looks very much like an iPhone 13 body with some version of Android inside.

UgzZ0IZFfsL_HiveL4R4AaABAg,It would be cool if they were RGB lights as well
UgzsgHyuORb5Ryk9aXR4AaABAg,"At some point some phone maker will make back lights to display a letter or a symbol. Or emoji. Then ir will be really cool. Even the text message could be quite readable, if displayed 3 or 5 symbols per second. Would buy that."

Ugyin0Veb4mWiluYaQ54AaABAg,Marques is the real og for saying that about 1+ in the end
UgwIhW0cUmjt2M3isx54AaABAg,Yea I totally disagree. I think 99% of people would mistake this for an iPhone with an interesting skin on it.

UgwVpYJb4WiPuM-Gp0d4AaABAg,I like the OnePlus reference
UgxafKhMGnru6FnYCt54AaABAg,"And then, I put a hard case in it"
UgxtFi5UnN8sp1fjtWN4AaABAg,"Marques is very very keen into how business strategy works
The only real way to survive is to stand out in a way that is economically unfeasible for the big dogs, such as carving out a niche of anime fans to be your consumers, because Samsung sure isn't going to waste time changing their Galaxy line to have a custom design - the designers and machinery cost isn't worth it for a few thousand phones sold, and they have to pay BTS to sing over their commercials.
The small niche companies essentially keep expanding using that niche as an entry point. The truly successful ones don't abandon their niche but OnePlus shows that this doesn't usually happen in the smartphone space."
UgwrhnEcx6Ks7kQayE94AaABAg,Taking a subtle dig at OnePlus ü´£
UgyAeg4RR1O2MGAUY5x4AaABAg,it's exactly what I'm afraid for. I feel like it's just hype and like OnePlus it was justified hype until a point where the phone became just meh/average (OP Nord) after overselling it. Not sure LED lights can mean a lot of sales. The phone needs to be available worldwide and for me it has to have killer software like the camera; I got the Pixel in the first place because I want a top quality camera. OP got left behind on that aspect.
UgypHEbVbCCYLLFF6TF4AaABAg,I like it oneplus ceo is really innovative and talented. Now oneplus is trash but I think nothing will take that pride with a new start.. üòâ
UgwxXolmlsmQ4At5TZB4AaABAg,A stupid product for empty people...enthusiasts wants phones that last 4 years with great battery life and build quality that negates the need for cases...

UgwqqICtQEfx4Qp30Xl4AaABAg,Nothing is ‚Ä¶ nothing but copy of iphone 12 which loaded with stock android.
UgwG6CPO011TT80j7PN4AaABAg,price and processor please
UgwTDWeQhTwP6RmxSOJ4AaABAg,Nothing wants to look different with LED lights and ends up copying Iphone built style. üòÇ
UgxsEDhJjqqG41w7AjJ4AaABAg,"This concept seems familiar, almost giving the Nokia 8210 modification era vibe back in the 90s"
UgzfGsAUpTD5y-AlaBR4AaABAg,Nice phone but I will stay with my S21 Ultra for another 2 years.
Ugw2H7Bf55xvCCV_YPR4AaABAg,"The main question I have is, are the LEDs colour customizable??"
UgwKIlct6E2xAbyQ8N54AaABAg,It is just the same old ‚ÄòOnePlus‚Äô story to recreate the success: ‚ÄòCopy everything off a hyper successful and make it cheaper with JUST and Exactly just one CHANGE‚Äô
UgxWPAB9N_dZJObo7FZ4AaABAg,As long as it stays snappy and is easily repairable I would 100% consider something like a Nothing phone as my next. I guess only time will tell. Still rocking my OnePlus 6 and it's going great to this day. Only had to change the battery which was super easy.
UgwUPhFrdlLNzjrC3vx4AaABAg,"So this is the new ""One Plus"""
Ugw5BQXWscu1Z0kmNl54AaABAg,"This is a decent first impression for new buyers, hope the software and the hardware holds up especially with Samsung and Google offering more updates with Samsung being more bug free

UgztPtFp4X193Z5F3Gd4AaABAg,"This phone made 13 pro max look old, they really know what they are doing, it's an art"

Ugx28juzpwYOtbqZDUx4AaABAg,"For just this back, i don't think to switch to this phone."

Ugyq6p8EajH3-Tq_j9N4AaABAg,The issue with making cooler looking phones is that they're still fragile... so I get cases that cover it up... they've gotta sell cases that emphasize and work with the design so you can protect it without missing out
Ugyq6p8EajH3-Tq_j9N4AaABAg.9cYVDYALszg9cZCeNq7Iyg,@Patrick Carpenter what a galaxy brain take. Do you also go to victims of car crashes to tell them ‚Äújust don‚Äôt crash your car lol‚Äù?

Ugyq6p8EajH3-Tq_j9N4AaABAg.9cYVDYALszg9cYc5OLbGPR,"@Tiago Lajas Sure, I get that. For me, it's not so much the scratches as it is the cracks that can actually affect user experience. I don't really consume media on my phone so scratches don't really bother me, but a cracked panel that makes the touch-responsiveness go haywire becomes a huge pain in the ass."
Ugyq6p8EajH3-Tq_j9N4AaABAg.9cYVDYALszg9cYbnJrvfmt,the cases will probably just have cut outs around the lights
Ugyq6p8EajH3-Tq_j9N4AaABAg.9cYVDYALszg9cY_kOI9XlD,"@Son Of Montreal At least for me, I don't think it's a matter of fear of braking the phone if I don't put a case on it, but the fear of scratching those amazing finishes that phones bring nowadays and the urge to preserve them due to being such beautiful pieces of tech."
Ugyq6p8EajH3-Tq_j9N4AaABAg.9cYVDYALszg9cYYou1KVFX,"Or better yet: make phones that are solid enough to not really require a case. My old iPhone 4 was so durable it could practically double up as a self-defense weapon. I have dropped it over concrete many times and I'm pretty sure it hurt the concrete.

 It doesn't have to be all models, companies could still make those skinny slabs of glass for those who are into that but it'd be nice to have a separate line of more rugged/bulky smartphones for people that might need their phone to act as a blunt weapon once in a while."

Ugw4V0mKQSpCSdhEaxh4AaABAg,That is an iPhone.
UgxYX6ASxsz9sYWilZ54AaABAg,would be cool if you could sync those LEDs with your media or mic (useful in concerts maybe)

Ugwcghtg2LyHnaPM5SV4AaABAg,I really hope they have other Features which make it unique. Just slapping some led strips on the back and calling it a unique approach let me suggest that these are totally posers. My assumption solidifies when i see how they describing themselves in their about us page. Just some generic hipsters who think they are special but yet are closer to a apple or Samsung than anyone else.

UgwMenR6HGUWtgyqyPZ4AaABAg,I really like it. Reminds me of the days when people would deck out their Nokias with see through cases and strobing led lights. My only concern with this phone is the OS.

Ugxavw_hpCLxyaLwUyV4AaABAg,"Why would Nothing choose this design for the led's, other than looking like Magsafe? The LED features are pretty cool I suppose, but ehhh, maybe for the camera flash?

As you know the only company that has been able to do this it's apple, to be honest apple it's just on another level."
UgzbHrjup8R83wZIfZB4AaABAg,That design would make me so much more comfortable not using a case. The trouble with clean and sleek backs is the ease they show scratches etc. that looks like it would take a years worth of heavy use and from first glance look great still

Ugzpi1w-z42qzU8w15h4AaABAg,"The Oneplus 7 pro was one of those awesome phones with a truly unique design.. the popup camera to me was one of the coolest things.  There's a privacy feature there where obviously if the camera is down inside the phone it can't record you, and the front of the display was all display.  I was irritated when they abandoned that design so quick."

UgzKZM5Jo5_r6dOhcT54AaABAg,"They could‚Äôve made it look like a Galaxy S5, they could‚Äôve made it look like a Huawei P10, they could‚Äôve made it look like an HTC M8, or an LG G4 with the faux leather back, or a Palm Pilot, or a BlackBerry 9800, but it doesn‚Äôt look like any of those it looks like an iPhone 12, complete with LEDs that mimic the round Apple with a chunk missing from the upper-right and a right-leaning stem on top. That‚Äôs no coincidence."
UgwihtFuJNdqtT8da_V4AaABAg,"I don't understand the point of these lights, why would I use them because I can use an always on display instead"

UgytjHXcAieKJf2jn1Z4AaABAg,"The simple fact that all smartphones still have cameras that are standing out of the phone case is just one reason why i rather stick to an older phone. Its such a bad ""feature"", i rather take the tiny amount more and have them in the case, as it happened to many times already that a phone just slides down a surface (and no a phone case is just a bad fix for this, as its a design flaw). The second one is usb-c but thats the apple only issue.."

UgwIBw9qPzgFItDtrwt4AaABAg,"Cool leds on the rear. But I usually have my screen up, so the screen doesn't face down and get damaged to the surface. So the led will almost not be visible for me so it wouldn't help me. Or am I the ""only"" one who has the screen facing up when lying on a table?"
UgwIBw9qPzgFItDtrwt4AaABAg.9cYRxb8tYy_9cYWUJCU9GO,"In public places and at work, I always put my phone face down (when it's in a case), so I can easily not confuse it with another and I also really like how it looks in a cool case.  In the case of Nothing, the only logical thing is a transparent cover or an overlay frame with a thick border."
Ugz83r8WEu_-HYP-hmx4AaABAg,It could be a flop or a revolution in Android world
UgwuzQXGIQ1n5HljcVZ4AaABAg,Nothing could not be any more underwhelming. It‚Äôs entire motto is nothing more than gimmicks.

Ugzl25AtANUN-lsqihV4AaABAg,"Android phones have become a commodity - new tech doesn't add much - so it's now more about a fashion statement and gimmick (some useful, some not). I expect to see companies that nobody expected to see in this market - entering it in the next couple of years. Won't be surprised to see a Nike phone, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Rolex... etc. Basically, top fashion/sports brands are likely to introduce their own phones... then watches etc. I definately used to love my Nike watch ~15 years ago!"

UgxoJxUwTZBYYmAtI814AaABAg.9cYR70PUAfj9cYrMiQftDP,@Mr. Everything I could certainly risk it if i had the money! Already the Fold 3 is IP water resistance certified let's see if they bring dust resistance too. But all phones are fragile one way or another.
UgxoJxUwTZBYYmAtI814AaABAg.9cYR70PUAfj9cYq09rw-Qd,@panatha tube until you can fold glass in half I'll never be a fan of foldable screens. There's a reason we don't have plastic screens on your phones anymore. Let alone the gap in the screen that leads directly into the inside of the phone letting dirt and whatever else wants to party inside your phone. You you imagine a tiny metal shaving or something conductive getting in there and ruining your phone in a matter of seconds? Then you get to deal with the fact that you have to shell out another $1500 because of a metal shaving. Repairability is the future of technology. Not locked down devices that's impossible to extent the life of.
UgxoJxUwTZBYYmAtI814AaABAg.9cYR70PUAfj9cYo9An7O-_,"I'd like a LED light for notifications on the back of the phone. But to me this looks like an overkill and a bit gimmicky. That's my first impression though, and i might change my mind. Of course I'd like to see the phone up close and personal, see the Android skin, learn the price and the cameras should be respectable. Anyway, a new device means more competition in the phone market which is good. But to me real innovation is foldables not LED lights."
UgxoJxUwTZBYYmAtI814AaABAg.9cYR70PUAfj9cYlfSi7FjA,"@Liam If that is really all you see in this phone, then I would hate to see what your basement bedroom looks like. Probably a bunch of blank walls with zero design taste. ya know, like an Apple product"
UgxoJxUwTZBYYmAtI814AaABAg.9cYR70PUAfj9cYlXtG-qsM,It's only so hard to innovate in the smartphone market because you have people like the other two commenters on this post ruining all the possibilities of innvoation for everyone. Every time a company does something different there is always this wave of butt hurt basement dwellers that rise up and bash on it because they can't stand the possibility of change. They can't stand the idea of someone other than apple changing the industry. I want you to be real with yourself and imagine the reaction we would have if apple did this same thing with one of their iphones.
UgxoJxUwTZBYYmAtI814AaABAg.9cYR70PUAfj9cYiUbYIBQz,"@Liam Samsung and Apple have done shameless copies of each other a long time ago. In the end of the day, the customers care about practical functionality over originality."

What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
UgyCHYifzBvTxh0-rQ94AaABAg,No one plus was harmed towards the end of the videoüôÇ
UgzLYscpug5mea9TsJ94AaABAg,I want it.
Ugzg0RAzrSr8ni9el994AaABAg,I‚Äôd add a flashing lights warning to this video
UgzBoypSJi4ssjbz0ch4AaABAg,"At least they're on the right way in bezel management. They prefer to make it symmetrical in 4 sides rather than 3+1 chin. If it's cameras great, it'll be a real new OnePlus."
UgyTx8BD8YybyGlHLnp4AaABAg,RGB slowly making its way into phones
Ugz6tdD9iWVihzCFCGR4AaABAg,Looking at the phones back and coupled with the quirky LED interface it gives off the design feel of something produced by Teenage Enginnering.
UgyAmGdbQypTHxNFyZ14AaABAg,The camera module is so good.
UgxwK9CDM2TSQxNBqVZ4AaABAg,"The whole thing feels gimmicky at best. 
Won't buy the phone for just some flashing lights..
Will wait for the whole package reveal."
UgxRQpk1c_QuwsUgd6F4AaABAg,Wish the LEDs could change colors
Ugyw0i23X1VCieihbH94AaABAg,I WANT THIS.... I WISH IF I HAD MONEY... THIS IS SUPER UNIQUE AND VERY ATTRACTIVE AND A FUTURISTIC PHONE... CONGRATS TO THE OWNERS...
Ugz8BJ5anhHP6GLXemx4AaABAg,It's ugly
UgxEM6GRbTdoD8SnwG14AaABAg,"I hope some day someone will make a round smartphone. Maybe with no notch or a teardrop notch, small rounded bezzles like a smartwatch, 3 cameras in a triangle on the back and another UI. UI could also rotate with a gyroscope Just because it will be the only one, it will sell fine."
UgyTxp9AvxZvm9QWI9x4AaABAg,"Nice, I wanted a phone that looks like Iphone, but with android, sadly looks like there are only 2 cameras, I wanted a telephoto, but I don't want Iphone."
UgxTegsDeNqJhkU8EON4AaABAg,Masallah üíö
UgzseIolxmlBVkYt2gN4AaABAg,Deadass thought this was the new iphone
UgzMbx3BUs3Za4XHT1Z4AaABAg,Nothing getting apple cult !! This time for serious .
UgxmlEtfa4mqhVcELUp4AaABAg,Pure garbage lol let‚Äôs put 10000 LEDs for no reason lol we get sold trash everyday it‚Äôs getting ridiculous
Ugw8VbBWLEU1ZWh4UWV4AaABAg,nothing revolutionary here... i dont like it.
UgygIAamIJ_PIvikV_p4AaABAg,So you have shown us NOTHING in this video
Ugy9lCwkKCk6h7_AKtR4AaABAg,No exclamation mark after the video name? Now that's a first!
UgyWScdrUKBon4USD4t4AaABAg,iPhone 12 Body + OnePlus UI & Optimization = Nothing Phone
UgyyzU33BkJFUbZeCZl4AaABAg,That is a great piece of hardware. Thanks for the review. I love how they stand out from the rest of the crowded smartphone field!
UgyyzU33BkJFUbZeCZl4AaABAg.9cYQag4CGrp9cYSasjHx7d,Not a review. Don‚Äôt buy this yet.
UgzO-OVaToPQFvVxxpZ4AaABAg,so..modded iphone?
Ugz28w2IWP1axJMzGN94AaABAg,"If the camera is good and no bloatware, then im sold!"
UgyGpwHQXFcJfw2dkdV4AaABAg,Ok seems a worthy upgrade from Poco F1 The Last Legend
Ugym7iVqGG0rg54pSD54AaABAg,"I want phone I can use a simple as Windows 98, I have to make whole research when I get new phone how to transfer files and stuff.... And it doesn't matter what kind of phone it is because when I switch to Apple my memory gets clocked up so fast
.... Plus all this scam with phones locked to certain provider.. I need cell phone for my work and I need good signal...this year . I had like five phones I don't use because I cannot use them, and the provider signal is bad in my area..this days we basically have monopoly ...2-3 big companies...well done .
Is this a freedom to you ?Try get of the contract from At&t ,crooks ....they will send you to many collections .American dream got stolen by corporations."
UgwxDn2u7f2Mrq2vqNJ4AaABAg,"Show the ui , camera everything ehshhh"
Ugy-iO9s_YrQv9yDyFF4AaABAg,Didn‚Äôt anyone notice it looks like an iPhone 11 except for the hole lunch camera.
UgyQtnhrxIwBTKA81ux4AaABAg,"6:31 OnePlus be like- I know which company he is talking about, oh wait that is meeeee!"
UgzwIVMQZrr2NJyn7zh4AaABAg,That monologue in the last though..
UgzEnBcaehL1Mj_4-lx4AaABAg,This is Nothing
Ugw4hl0xp8pc76h-hZp4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm stuck in Apple ecosystem just like most of you guys stuck in Android ecosystem. I mean these phone looks cool and prettiest to me compared to Samsung phones. I just don‚Äôt like their full screen, rectangular shape and big on my palm. This phone is perfect in terms of design."
UgxtZCWTYPiGZbhSwEx4AaABAg,Price?
UgxtZCWTYPiGZbhSwEx4AaABAg.9cYQUtRsgUf9cYROccmlve,Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
UgyiOWGBOJw4_6V0E5t4AaABAg,"Supporter of flagship killer OnePlus. Still holding on to my 5t. Hoping it'll hold out long enough to get a Nothing Phone 3, or 5 if they skip 4 again. Maybe I'll be able to catch Flagship Killer territory again before it becomes flagship"
UgyUVsvwljvVKvyOFoZ4AaABAg,Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate
UgzikmOdWxtHCU-gYh94AaABAg,"I thought it would be something more revolutionary, but I still think my S22 Ultra and iPhone are more revolutionary."
UgzGDo9Gqv8f1ONOmQh4AaABAg,Apple has nothing to worry about
UgzG1PGzZVHIj4vnW5h4AaABAg,iPhone and Google pixel 5 vibes
UgyWVC9mEzWlDd1mTqp4AaABAg,It looks like a really big phone. If they had this in a smaller size I would definitely consider getting one.
UgyfkcPRBhskj7CuryN4AaABAg,The back led light is amazing along with the ringtone 2 This looks like the next step to project Ara / google project remember.
UgyfkcPRBhskj7CuryN4AaABAg.9cYQR67p9CG9cZ0RE4hztK,agreed
Ugzsy799h3m0mUpa9l14AaABAg,"Anyways, making this teaser video... Cmon, give us full review. Like why 50 videos of the same, hate that, just for the views."
UgylB5cuYU4AV96rebh4AaABAg,It's gonna be a revolution for the future phones
UgyfCY0X3Y8N86wdOoN4AaABAg,the ending is only for the oneplus community
UgyfCY0X3Y8N86wdOoN4AaABAg.9cYQOu939sJ9cYStaQTWxi,@TelegramüëâOfficialnicoleonard oh yeah is this for real? üòÅ
UgxYLjmqQYFxyGII0IN4AaABAg,This looks.... Interesting. Can't wait to see more.
UgzrTXNs8uhjR7v_w5Z4AaABAg,If Tron made a phone‚Ä¶
Ugz1jCpF3gImV8Vd6qJ4AaABAg,No one can beat iphone the king of smartphones
UgyHBIBGZFGKt-F-v4F4AaABAg,absen gaez ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üéâ
Ugz89HZgUjqMRfD9V2B4AaABAg,"I like the look of the phone, kind of a throwback to see through phones in the 90s. The notification lights are pretty cool, the only hope is that they have a good price point and great performance.

And you're right, the market is a difficult slope for a new startup unless it's just looking to make enough waves in order  to be purchased by a bigger player."
Ugy2a8SfTfzdJjr_Y3R4AaABAg,I love the back design ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
UgxMmD8aN8GPgASymAp4AaABAg,"Unique and interesting, but absolutely would never want that.... So annoying."
UgwQnukchKfUyrCxo0V4AaABAg,"Nothing you had me at ringtone, I'm in"
UgxiMsTbQcB0jojZ7O54AaABAg,"i would like to see other colors or at the very least be able to change the color of the LED's, however putting that aside I am decently impressed with what has been shown so far. I'll continue to reserve judgement about the entire phone until its out."
Ugxukb_m2k8rsYHAxwB4AaABAg,Seems like an always on display does a lot of the things the back lights do. ü§î
UgxLNsUfv5gIOCLFvTV4AaABAg,"Wishful thinking here, I hope it isn't OnePlus all over again üòÖ"
UgzLadjmDytljheE0TR4AaABAg,"I don't think a iPhone design with flat screen and more boxy shape is a had thing. The android world has been crying out for something as well designed. Think they missed a trick with not having multicoloured led notification lights on the back, although the white does look cool and futuristic."
Ugw975Bva4t2sUh5Ep14AaABAg,It's really interesting to see how just by showing this design alone many people are willing to purchase the device pre release.
Ugw0FJpGWGxByKP_VUR4AaABAg,Another paid review . Thank you MKBHD .
UgzMzLR-D4969Drgdcl4AaABAg,Mmm intresting
UgzCj3C0-HsVKDVyZUR4AaABAg,OnePlus was not hurt in this video.. ü§™üòú
UgzWdvR4zGX-6TqktRN4AaABAg,like a phone from Assassin's Creed
Ugzq3o5CKQgJ4R9ferV4AaABAg,"It‚Äôs bold but none of these new different features really matter to me and it‚Äôs not differentiated enough/could be replicated so easily. Who cares about the exact charging progress indicator? And frankly, I much prefer vibration over light up hieroglyph symbols that I can‚Äôt see when my phone is in my pocket. It‚Äôs a no from me chief."
Ugz0slBsIkAMZgnCemt4AaABAg,Whats  the weight sar value price y r u not showing  screen  quality
UgyfHHw-vqhDgx22e5h4AaABAg,How did I miss Naruto phone?
Ugz35I3HUcnoMan0OL94AaABAg,Does it have an alert slider?!
Ugwicum88K9BRlXLe054AaABAg,Side punch hole display looks ugly
Ugwl7arnu3mSIpSBhnF4AaABAg,this that Henry danger phone
UgwB2OXGcw3tJIkSxBF4AaABAg,If I want to stop light  can we?
UgxWedwLz-JmdgniwjJ4AaABAg,Hints at one plus. Lol
UgwQFiC1kfo1Sc7GMGB4AaABAg,That light feature is gonna be overhyped just like Samsung edge lighting. It‚Äôs cool at first but you‚Äôll eventually stop caring bout it.
UgyhzC_E2Lia1GJy2XN4AaABAg,Got tired of my OnePlus 6 and new OnePlus phone aren't exciting enough but after OnePlus 6 this is the first phone I'm excited for. Hope it delivers
UgzoJ0uIlRDeZBxoWT54AaABAg,iPhone 12 white with MagSafe Clear Case ü§£
UgytF4XRmEwDdRXE3SN4AaABAg,Uhh... The last line üòâ
UgzeWzU5jIy1XiYhz8l4AaABAg,Looks like 'Nothing' going to take on  'everything' apple and samsung doing .
UgwbXa4dwHpvaC2l0G14AaABAg,DAAAAAMN it looks waaaaay better than the iphone literally amazing ...
UgzLR9La6-imXDBRvAd4AaABAg,"Damn, that's really cool, only complaint would the front camera position, honestly, I personally never use the front facing camera, I'd rather have nothing. Also, if only they could get Apple's OS... but that's a pipe dream lol."
UgzCRWo1_a5WhHtMKnx4AaABAg,I am not nearly as observant as needed to know the difference between some of those light patterns so over my head. Nice to see a new idea.
UgxZNqYxBBHWoqYxUMl4AaABAg,Is thr black one?
UgyspP2UVGeNA35zr1F4AaABAg,Was waiting for that sounds familiar ü§£ü§£ change the car to phone here.

UgzETm61Pm1kUppdXVZ4AaABAg,I hope they don‚Äôt go the same way Oneplus are going
Ugy1VWCJ71V3AEda6kh4AaABAg,"Heh, I used to find people, who use regular flashlights for notifications pretty annoying. Let's see, how this will turn around.)
I mean that semi-seriously, though: it's more light, for sure, but the light itself is softer, so it might not be that bad. We'll see, but for now at least it looks different, yes."
UgxrbFb5r9MpV7B41Qp4AaABAg,I wish that LED on the back was RGB!
Ugxjgo6WFpcUbwHfaEV4AaABAg,LOVE it!!!
UgwcBhs-QlmrqD0VuzN4AaABAg,"It's more look like the ancient one, the play station 1 in a small size. The wireless charging circle area is the place we put the disc. And the camera bump is the power button. Lol."
UgxiXi8R3nA5HEvNZCt4AaABAg,Mid phone from another Chinese fraudulent company.
UgyfFcRuu4YunsFazah4AaABAg,"But, do they let you unlock the bootloader?"
UgydnvP5GuIVLtbUl0d4AaABAg,Thats a alien phone üëÄ
UgzQU6qppOOkwCy84bp4AaABAg,"If it's anything like their earbuds, stay away."
Ugw9MYP6iffP3y5Fi-Z4AaABAg,I want that phone!
UgwsS5ad3QHwLRNiCB14AaABAg,Nothing hype machine at full steam. Crazy that people instantly forget how they used this same marketing ploy for a lackluster product in the past
UgydPmT9nkscIiZOtpJ4AaABAg,The see through electronics of the 90s are back! Everything must be transparent! I want Crystal Mountain Dew!
UgwlR7d8WMEMOM5sXzR4AaABAg,Ringtones feels bit irritating to hear
UgxsgzR17B4Psln-zTR4AaABAg,This screams cyberpunk. I will definitely buy it!
UgyVKBy_wLC66-K_s894AaABAg,I will definitely
Ugw5TovfKIYEXzetRTp4AaABAg,If it's a small size 5g I'll look into it
UgyG5jYhV2uYaHXmBCJ4AaABAg,"If I was an Android user, I would consider giving the Nothing Phone a run. I think it looks cool. Of course, the purchase decision would also be impacted by my thoughts on the UI whenever we get to see all of that in action."
Ugwhx5qgOWWjcH5kWnh4AaABAg,this is a cool bootleg iphone 12 the whole rear and sides and camera design are straight up copied from the iphone 12 plus the way the lights are arranged look like the magsafe magnets arrangement on the 12
UgzR7Np5cyvPayrTKud4AaABAg,That's a dope phone. I love it!
Ugz3Zya6YRm1dUvy7mh4AaABAg,That looks like it would drain your battery really fast
UgwvFoaK8CzeLiTL5K14AaABAg,This easily has to be the coolest looking phone in a while. The gaming phones take a back seat on this one.
UgyhfLyOA89lBAayEIx4AaABAg,"Notification LED is so cool, if only Samsung brought it back or iPhone started doing it with the apple logo lighting up. I still have my s9+ and haven't upgraded because it still has a notification LED. Also because it has a headphone jack. It also has the micro sd slot. The heart rate bpm sensor through finger. It's the one big reason I haven't upgraded yet. Because it's the last phone to have everything. S10+ was close and only got rid of the notification LED and then s20 ultra got rid of headphone hack and heart rate bpm scanner and then s21 ultra got rid of the micro sd slot so every year they got rid of everything which was annoying. The s22 ultra made its phone look like a note and I was more a fan of the s series body shape. The s21 ultra had basically the best design. The best feel. Just didn't have a slot for the pen. But it is far ahead in terms of getting rid of all the things my s9+ still has so maybe I'll move on and finally upgrade when the s23 ultra comes out. That's if the rumoured 200mp camera is true and I'm also hoping for a far better zoom lens and video recording capabilities because it's still far behind iPhone. I am certain my s9+ from over 4 years ago will still last another year. Maybe even 2"
Ugy9L8IYs53kZVp89lh4AaABAg,Recent leaks indicate that 7 Gen 1 has antutu score near about 2 lakh only. I don't believe that.
UgwDQHJ5wvb1F3f1ezh4AaABAg,Ok this is the not iPhone for iPhone users. I‚Äôd buy this. I like it a lot
UgxVsYUmtzZWq9qHsDd4AaABAg,This makes me smile for some reason.
UgzPh5V-6VRbs9uiHKB4AaABAg,If I remember properly even you have put up some investment in nothing company. So you would say nice things about it as u can see in video
UgyG07s5NqTVFrxXtr94AaABAg,"Hey is that an iphone 12?

Me: nah! Its Nothing.

Come on man tell me which one is it?"
UgylfSkCdTi9rq4MtMR4AaABAg,Y wud I want notification indicator on the back? I m never gonna keep it on screen side down on the table ü§î
Ugyj64Sy-JbcjiyERRR4AaABAg,What you're allowed to say about it before the emargo lifts: Nothing
Ugyqj09UFGN7-_3IU094AaABAg,LOOKS GOOD
UgxILwkyDgb1Ng5HC1h4AaABAg,Where is that bi fold galaxy fold or tri fold
Ugx5cSWV_g3xE0aVWmd4AaABAg,"I mean if this thing has the power and the Software to keep up with my current Oppo Find X2 Pro, i am definitely considering it. Those lights would surely help with shooting pictures in darker settings, also it looks like it comes straight out of Tron which is super cool"
UgxMInpndDVJHX_onkt4AaABAg,Kinda reminds me of the Fairphone 3
UgziXpuOjhjGldr3keF4AaABAg,NothingOS 1???
UgwkOfykUhaMCadrWFN4AaABAg,Loved that subtle jibe at One Plus üòÜüòÜ
UgwlSRHJqSloLQNOtOt4AaABAg,"This is a abstract looking iPhone. If you can‚Äôt see the placement of the lights it makes it look like a reverse Apple logo. 

Maybe change the led placement and at glance most people will assume it‚Äôs an iPhone."
UgwF4t0g8EjMZk8h24d4AaABAg,"But I do wish they would put a small mini screen near the camera and that way I can get notifications, time etc if I want to turn it on"
Ugx5NLbXUXZkA5EXEBB4AaABAg,"The most BASIC title award 2022 goes to 

*drumroll*

The Nothing Phone LOOKS Different~ MKBHD"
UgzrOEsZcETxl0gg_zJ4AaABAg,"Is there any phone that could resemble the phones in black mirror series(season 5) ? The smoothness,thin look, actually small‚Ä¶ its all what i need in a phone."
Ugxx0e4hcA1YvmHy9494AaABAg,Colorful backlights... Anyone !
UgyXHFZaaMhOh2RbSlZ4AaABAg,Sounds familiar?
UgyHphiPJS1Q8hI69XN4AaABAg,Any Indians hereüòä
Ugz5RpRvrsI9IChj2L14AaABAg,"Except for the deaf, this seems useless and really annoying"
Ugw-YgmCtsOnV00Lf7x4AaABAg,"Whether this will be an upgrade (?) for my OnePlus 7 pro will probably depend on the price and the software experience, looking forward to the launch event.üòÅ"
UgwSoNuZZuh60N5AcAJ4AaABAg,Wtf did i just see? It's shit. 100% shit.
UgzG-0QOxgdNV4GZ7Sx4AaABAg,This ain't for me
UgxFxpgCVShWIawNmaV4AaABAg,Nothing to me has been such a snake oil company. Talking about innovation and they made AirPods and an iPhone X that are transparent like gameboys. Honestly the company just reminds me of Beats by Dre all hype and pure marketing
UgxPNFl3GnTaWZit5Dp4AaABAg,"ok, but does it have an aux port?"
UgzKwtxpB4-JPz6fh414AaABAg,"I like the look, but ""The safe bet"" hole is massive and getting people out of it is not likely to happen."
UgzpsjQC2q_XKEBluXx4AaABAg,Just wiggle the phone to see the status of charging and when u turn the phone all u see is a bunch of scratches on the screen ü§≠ y wud I charge the phone with the screen side down üòÇ
UgxAfITfXTHQDf89Jop4AaABAg,Finally an iPhone with USB-C!!
UgzRtg6Up2unOoTnLSJ4AaABAg,"so im supposed to use the back of my phone to see who is calling what is the notifction and the chargeing status,so might i suggest you to turn you phone around and use the front side to not only all these and more"
Ugwu1aKYDldbHvEn4aJ4AaABAg,why you have not shown it in dark room?
UgwCtzRHWmYT0AURIbd4AaABAg,So how would the phone case look like given the amount of LEDs on the back?
Ugz3XrJasg7OtqXRDJR4AaABAg,now imagine being someone suffering from photosenitive elipesy siting next to someone with that phone
Ugz0wJGpZq6YdVSwq_94AaABAg,I want nothing
UgzE2xmVtL8kfYWrbl94AaABAg,what does the dbrand skin for this look like?
Ugz0piE7wII6h84Olul4AaABAg,"Love the look. I hate the glass pebble that every android phone has become, and much prefer flat edges, to the point I bought an iPhone last year just because I liked their new design so much. I ended up disliking iOS and moving back to an s21 but have been putting off the upgrade because I don't like any android flagships this year. This is starting to look like it might be my next upgrade!"
UgzAMCwMRj9yh7hDqBh4AaABAg,What's that laptop in the background bro?
Ugwm67Kj3dfRgiLE5lx4AaABAg,"It definitely looks a lot like iPhone. But this LED feature, i think is just a gimmick. Not really a useful feature, just something to say is different is there. Also, if someone does not get a clear case, then this feature is totally wasted as well and clear cases normally is not the easiest to maintain"
UgwOoTfzm362PG2rgAR4AaABAg,I personally think looks on a phone nowadays doesn‚Äôt matter anymore due to vibrant varieties of cases skins available in the market and all people soon will care about is what a phone has to offer rather then how it looks.
UgyF9bmcPzWyoQYwvzl4AaABAg,6:32 of course OnePlus the company never settle
UgxF16FdYOCdx2TpQiJ4AaABAg,"Better luck than essential phone, I bought that and I remember the fiasco, got two phones from best buy, both had light bleeding from the edges."
UgxhlFESutDCkp7xd6R4AaABAg,iphone with transparent back...thats how it looks
Ugxh146dKmFOHy_SPdR4AaABAg,Literally an iphone clone
UgwisnjhXMykNPdNZRl4AaABAg,"Weird ring tone, sounded like a draco."

UgytxsTWFYnIVNS3Xut4AaABAg,As an iphone 12 user i like itüëç
UgyO_i75UBZDQPFQE0Z4AaABAg,Will this run on android or do they have their own os?
UgwhrmRRcI4w8z4G4vt4AaABAg,"other brands: lets start from the front.
nothing: lets make back more attractive and usable than front"
Ugw6T8x-wQWxT0ZvEOd4AaABAg,Apple nothing to worry about.
UgxJRq_Lz5_kCfk0P3V4AaABAg,Looks shit
Ugx9ctMxuSajrESVo894AaABAg,It reminds me of the R2D2 swimsuit that was doing the rounds a few years so.
UgyUzDqk_minMF51qTl4AaABAg,Price?
UgyXyO9NrYq9zkjlKBx4AaABAg,If the phone has the same quality of the earbuds its gonna flop hard

UgyTyDLs0kgO2yToSyd4AaABAg,Wow impressed!
UgydQtfGsNuYr9kwXkF4AaABAg,As an iPhone user since the iPhone one I need to state that this piece of tech looks awesome and could lead me to switch - not from the software perspective but from an aesthetic hardware one.

UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg,"Digging the Tron aesthetic, it's also nice to see someone actually trying to make these amazing tools we carry in our pockets less banal. 

I am however, curious/concerned about how much extra drain the LEDs are adding on the battery."
UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg.9cYOTnxTK_z9cYwmGyr1_c,It's probably close to the raw equivalent of AOD in modern Androids. Plus modern smartphones have gotten bigger batteries and better power efficiency so it's most likely as negligible as AOD.
UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg.9cYOTnxTK_z9cYtycrkbdn,it would drain less than the screen for sure
UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg.9cYOTnxTK_z9cYhWgwzhW4,"@Apaullo 5,10,15,20%
20% for heavy use üòÇ
I think those are absolute wild guesses.
How quickly will you be draining the battery with the screen on? Let‚Äôs say you only got 4-5 hours out of a charge under real heavy use, you think the notifications would bring it down to 3.5 to 4 hours.

Think a bit more logically.
This feature would be negligible at best. Same with vibrate notifications, Face ID, Touch ID."
UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg.9cYOTnxTK_z9cYgM-diU4-,Wow could you imagine living in 2022 and worrying about left battery drain lol
UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg.9cYOTnxTK_z9cYgIj8olBU,None
UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg.9cYOTnxTK_z9cYeVau_jBS,"I actually think this is a really fair question and one we probably won't get a real answer to until we get our hands on it. First off, we don't know how long the battery is supposed to last from what I can find online, and additionally we won't know how much of that battery was lost to the interface unless Nothing has already tested this exact question, or even worse, if they even used the interface during their testing of battery performance at all. Probable guess: I think this'll take somewhere to 5-10% of your total battery life per charge, depending on how you use your device. Some people might just binge a ton of stuff, keeping their screens on, and relive the Glyph Interface from needing to actually be a notification to the user, others like myself might not use their phone much throughout the day so we'd have a build up of a bunch of notifications from a series of apps, which I think would probably drain your battery closer to 15 maybe even 20% if you're on the extreme end of this. But really we'll just have to wait an see.

Also, the numbers given are purely a guess, seeing how other notification LEDs can have an impact on their phone's battery performance and trying to adjust for the number of LEDs and their thematics, so don't come with torches and pitchforks at me"
UgxUpthBrlt8CpkmOMl4AaABAg.9cYOTnxTK_z9cYdHrzkY00,"I cant imagine leds, which are already super efficient, will be draining the battery unless you just leave them on all the time. If you just use them for notifications im sure its negligible"

UgyH4nGgdd7jxrrBnTh4AaABAg,I love to see some innovation. And that's some innovation. And it looks cool. But these aren't  useful features. I can already see who is calling even in silent mode. By simply looking at the front of the phone. Phones already display charge level on the front of the phone when wiggled. It looks like it's a prop from Tron which I like. But there aren't useful featuresfor me to buy this.
UgzmWZGLdusIET5uTBl4AaABAg,Dbrand is not going to be happy with Teardown skins.
UgxVfdnS0xpSash5GGd4AaABAg,"Niche phone.  Glyph notification is original, I will give them that. Glyph notification is useless when phone is in pocket. Users of the Nothing Phone must use clear case or a tinted case.  All accessories will need to come from manufacturer as there is not enough customer base for 3rd party ones. All smartphones have the ability to modify vibration patterns for each ring tone so people can set it up so they know who is calling without even looking at phone in silent mode. I think MKHD low key showed the target market share for the Nothing Smartphone. It‚Äôs going after the young teenager who will want Naruto or DBZ phone. To old dudes like me it‚Äôs meh."

There needs to be an accompanying watch as well as a software UX that rivals what iOS does with their devices and macOS or what Samsung is starting to do with Windows. 
For iOS how pairing your Bluetooth device pairs it with every other iOS device you own and every other feature of continuity mode in general. Or how with Samsung Dex you have a full fledged computer. I‚Äôm not saying this device is bad but ecosystems are more important imo."
UgwJ3XzEc-N6MS9IVmp4AaABAg,It's the most useless feature ever. Why would I even need LED lights on the back of my phone ???

UgwqBr0vEMBT8FhU-Rl4AaABAg,"I'm not in need of a phone but if I was it would come down to two big things, software support length and quality of the os. Too many times has a great phone been buggered by bad software."
UgxOW8X3cv4162vCUWR4AaABAg,"Who places their phone on the front glass? If they actually used sapphire like HTC did once, maybe it would make sense. As is, it will just get scratched for no apparent reason as everything that leds can do, screen can do better. If you put it in transparent case, that's like the only way to even attempt to use that ""feature"". It's one of the most useless gimmicks in phones I've seen so far. That look is pretty cool tho. Definately prefer my clean looking devices, but it has its appeal I guess."

UgzJH2XL4VsRkqfGiVN4AaABAg,"I like how it looks, but I'm not sure I trust them to make a whole phone. The ear 1 has been out for almost a year, and even after all the firmware updates whenever I pull them out of the case, one or both of them doesn't pair. I hope that it's just some hardware limitation that's kept them from patching it and this phone is going to be rock solid, but it's not really confidence inspiring."

UgwmA9LluTINsFXMfep4AaABAg,"If the charging led lights up when you wiggle the phone, then it'll stay on while using the phone when charging. Either they make a pretty dam job of it not being annoying while using the phone at night while charging or people will get mad on it."

UgxDOx0mi9YD4d2HUWR4AaABAg,"Its not the design that attracts me. Being a OnePlus fan, it was disappointing when OnePlus started taking customers for granted and started destroying the phone's uniqueness by replacing the pure stock experience with some chinese OS experience..

UgzvIPl8KL6ClLlZ-A94AaABAg,why would I wiggle my phone screen on a surface and scratch it? might as well pick it up but then I won't need the light...
UgySbnrbnBCtKrjCVPl4AaABAg,I think most importantly is the spec first then only we talk about the extra features. Don‚Äôt think consumers would buy a phone just over some back light led design if it packed with lousy processors. HTC phones proved that when they launch their flagship with bad spec.

UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg,Feels like what OnePlus used to be. My hopes are high for the future of this company.
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYgom097sf,@PM find the TechAltar 'Story Behind' video on OnePlus and enthusiast brands. The flagship killer business model is an effective but unsustainable way to build market share - once the brand is recognised you can sell the same stuff everyone else does.
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYanB_38-s,"@PM Carl Pei founder of Nothing was also co-founder of OnePlus, in the early days OnePlus used to have devices with flagship hardware, good price, and the best android skin: oxygen os

tech enthusiasts tended to think OnePlus as the best android in the market, and their design was different than apple and samsung until the OnePlus 5, people even used to compare the speed and responsiveness of oxygen os with Apple's ios, it was really good

Carl Pei left OnePlus in 2020 some time after the release of OnePlus 8t, at that time OnePlus wasn't what it used to be anymore, they started to target more mainstream consumers, their devices design have become uninspired, users started to complain about more and more bugs in the software and the price was matching other flagships but the final product wasn't delivering equal experience

after Carl Pei left OnePlus announced the merge with Oppo (this may be a huge coincidence, or maybe not) and oxygen os become based in Oppo's color os, which garnered a lot of criticism from users and longtime fans, that's the story the main reason i believe many have lost faith in OnePlus is because the price is high and the final product doesn't deliver anything different or better than the competition

and now Carl Pei and Nothing revived once again that feeling of OnePlus early days, he was the ""face"" of OnePlus in the Ocident so people tended to believe that many of the old OnePlus ideals was also his own ideals"
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYZMeQUYx-,"@PM OnePlus was a good brand at first. They were selling top tier phones at a reasonable (for the competition) price. Their UI was also very fast, optimized and good. Then they started to share more things with their headbrand Oppo. Now even their UI is a ColorOS (Oppo's UI) skin. They were releasing 2 models a year, last year they released almost 10 models."
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYZM9ePWpZ,@PM OnePlus started out as an enthusiastic brand that came out with phones that were different and cheaper while still delivering almost flagship-level power. Alas! They degraded over time and lost their uniqueness by creating generic phones that were no different from the competition.
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYXSh4jlYm,Can someone please explain what he meant about OnePlus? I have never owned a OnePlus phone nor do I know much about their models. Thanks!
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYWyVB_XRv,@Goliath just because it was owned by BBK Electronics Corporation and it seems one of OP creators was about money and not about enthusiasm in tech.
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYUyeF4heh,@Mugabe He was the co-founder of OnePlus. He wasn't the main guy. Now he is trying to make a new brand which will follow the right path of OnePlus. I think this is a good step and i hope this guy is going to be successful.
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYUVEVVeIA,Sounds like something TechAltar would say
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYRSx3LFCf,"An enthusiast brand can't stay an enthusiast brand, shareholders demand continuous growth, OnePlus's fate was inevitable."
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYRGhonwbF,It's exactly the company he's referring to at the end
UgzlCByLRO-5eLy2McN4AaABAg.9cYIcOFWcOh9cYPa045i6q,"It's no coincidence both companies have the same founder. Instead of improving OP, it was dumped and now he's pumping the next brand"

The REAL flagship killer, with the latest SD chip, and oxygen os that feels snappy and quick, pair that with a reasonable price and there u go, a niche waiting to be filled. So simple yet so hard to do."
UgztDXZsY9uK34Hd1YF4AaABAg,"For me, it all depends on how must they customize Android OS. If it has vanilla Android with some additional hardware features, that's great. If they fully customize Android (like Samsung) , I'm out."
UgzFbG_3cW9afjsXW-94AaABAg,When everyone started to buy the phone for LED lights ?

UgyeeeVC668bSUBBfRl4AaABAg,"It could be like anything with an RGB lighting. could be great initially, but for day to day use it may not be impressive. People might want to turn this off in most situation. It's cool. And does it come with a charger in the box?"
Ugw_wjg8e6QB96e0wxh4AaABAg,"It will be like this for 90% of users: Buys phone, looks at back 1 time, then puts a case on and never sees the back of the phone or mind it.

UgwzNJjw4MmP78XK1TR4AaABAg,Remind me of Nokia light up Kyepad while Ringing..üòÅ

UgyBepwGkYKTv7QNUKl4AaABAg,Very cool thing
UgwTVZbPsLJOfm8oqEJ4AaABAg,Oh my days. No. No. I have had enough. At first the impression videos let the reviews to show everything about the phone except software. Now you're not even allowed to show the front üò≠
UgxcvjcbLMrZeSmWLhN4AaABAg,This would actually make me think about switching from iPhone for the first time

UgyBPYZ8xKUu0SxS6oh4AaABAg,This is the phone for people with hearing a disability
UgwWZ4Zk1SZJQYsd8Op4AaABAg,I think this is one of the LEAST USEFUL video you have made recently . HATE this stratergy of NOTHING .
UgxAaK1yGkqpIBwuF3h4AaABAg,With this type of phone back definitely yes and front also looks super good without any chin
UgwE03az-pnHZLbvNo54AaABAg,Hopefully Supcase will put out a case for it.
UgymqPSHMSLExz1ErWV4AaABAg,20syl's music as the intro again yes:)
UgxHbllzbGNygJzdVLZ4AaABAg,So you‚Äôre telling me that this phone was 100% made by nothing.  Nothing has made this phone.  Nothing has completed studies to show how to make a phone stand out.  Nothing has a phone that‚Äôs different from others.  Like actually nothing.  Correct?
UgylE8dJDlo5QDtrpAx4AaABAg,"1.600‚Ç¨

UgyGfvnvFgoFMiM2Mz94AaABAg,"you didn't seem very enthusiastic tbh, I'd say rather doubtful."
UgyybD0kebcdgOm84_N4AaABAg,So this this the Star Wars phone in a nutshell...I love it!!
UgwFFhk-2Jp6HsgfHQ94AaABAg,Nothing has done price cutting over two things 1) by providing 44w fast charging feature 2) 90 hz refresh rate. So this shouldn't cost more than 30k INR (base model). At this price 120 hz refresh rate is an obvious feature available and 67w of fast charging as well. Well I understand only these two features don't decide the fate of any phone. We have to see how will they compensate this with the offering of some other feature. so lets see what else nothing has to offer. Well the design has just sustained the hype so far though. And not to mention that has already impressed me and the rest of us a lot. I would like to see it giving head to head to Iphone.
Ugz9GkPx4fNCC90a-X94AaABAg,Can't lie bro those lights got me
Ugw_sIZNGIaUTJsznlN4AaABAg,"HEEYYYY

UgwlUzjlSkLqU6D3bkB4AaABAg,Imagine the cases that can be built for this.
UgzSHC4GjNA3VPWlcEZ4AaABAg,Everything boils down to pricing of the phone.
UgwXC6gK6x3CugTnJFZ4AaABAg,Does it have different color LEDs or is it just white?

UgzhJCTbWvgjw-ERe9p4AaABAg,I like it alot I would so get it cus it's different and one software thing mkbhd shows that I really like Is The clock on the lock screen
UgzRjtdjMZaSq5FU0jt4AaABAg,@mkbhd the video showed the front of the phone. You‚Äôd mentioned earlier you are allowed to show only the back. ü§î
UgxJASbfOv6BaV4iDjJ4AaABAg,"Definitely getting it, anything is better than OnePlus currently"
UgxOuOBXYW5Ty6paVBR4AaABAg,"That's unique but everything depends on what interface they used inside. People get bored using the same interface. Also what eco system they offer... Can they make an stand alone Eco system like apple! If they can... Kudos for them. I'm in.
Best of luck NOTHING üòç
By the way if you look carefully they used apple logo just in a geometric shape. The leaf, the body of apple and also the bite shape ü§£"

UgzTNd537PfpsApWx-l4AaABAg,"2:53
I mean, while it is neat, I don‚Äôt see how this is any better than just having the phone be face side up. I tap the screen and see the percentage. I also see all the notifications and more. I guess it‚Äôs a cool trick for situations where the phone would need to be face down."

UgxNbmCb3u5GRMT2s014AaABAg,I like it
UgymuXxI1HuqICTr5Tt4AaABAg,Fan based companies will disappoint at some point. Like One Plus did. Beside that why buy a phone who looks like an iPhone when i can buy the real one.
UgztMAGsp0-HnKi0fwh4AaABAg,But my question who's gonna keep the phone upside-down???
UgwYWS_QmPafH8L0dFx4AaABAg,"In my opinion, the front camera should be in the center and the back of the phone need to be more mature. It was target for under 30?"
UgyDwobSe_5uqSHjSMF4AaABAg,Waiting for the camera....if that will put competition to Apple.....then no doubt nothing will be successfull
UgxqLjZD0GRVqs1glcx4AaABAg,"one plus is dumb as f, their ceo left and made nothing"
UgwDYkjPUBTnY5_o6sx4AaABAg,"I know it looks a lot like an iPhone but I really love the design, the LED's are amazing."
UgxFLAFbeBFDE0LwuuV4AaABAg,Too gimmicky.  I personally never put my phone down face down.  So the lights have no purpose for me.  Plus at night it will be a nightmare.
UgzjCwe55Prhc1L_LOB4AaABAg,"Here is a cool idea... Make a black Nothing phone, with the same notification lights inside, but the glass panel on top of be made same like that of McLaren edition OnePlus, hides even the cameras when not in use, but once turned on, everything ... should be dope ü§©üòÅ... Nothing impossible right üòú"
UgxLrPvENQOmNpRSnfB4AaABAg,"Let's be real, LEDs in the back of phones have been around since the Nokia days when every other kiosk in the mall sold batteries covered in LEDs. They're just bringing it into the 21st century lol"
UgzAw4QaYCV81XURDNt4AaABAg,"As someone who has to put a case on a phone or it will die, they need more going on. I don‚Äôt know if I really want a clear case either. 

Looking forward to hearing more but I‚Äôm very ingrained in my ecosystem now."
UgwUdsEEFH4y2y4MvzJ4AaABAg,I'd buy the phone based on the ringtones and lights themselves.
Ugx2827Ziyhp5xE1kkl4AaABAg,Apple has nothing to worry about.
UgzxIQq_y0uHpxb6iDh4AaABAg,I will need to do a 3 month course to use this phone

Ugx3DmWZ_bAOsRbZP6N4AaABAg,"Back lights are a waist of energy in my opinion, change my mind."
Ugwp5LsqQbze_PWxzWF4AaABAg,What it needs is spiderman using this phone as an advertisement
Ugx0846IfprGKZjkse14AaABAg,Back in the days many nokia and sony walkman phones had the same light whch would pulse according to ringtone or music...
UgxK1acpY623vRdyWpd4AaABAg,Oooo the OnePlus shade
UgykE4Ew5sRamPoyyPV4AaABAg,Put a case on it then that's literally an iPhone 12 in the android version. Those who want an iPhone-looking device with android software May go for it..
Ugxgoh684Pfgilna-Jx4AaABAg,What is the purpose of these LED's... ?  Will it work as room Lamp..?
Ugy1UKAMIi1gv_2Xkol4AaABAg,"Meh, seems like a cheap gimmik to get consumers attention."
UgxqSDnV6TojNbOTrdd4AaABAg,You need a noise gate or a quieter studio. The ringing lights patterns section showed this.
UgwCKwt-EM9UzqNNpDR4AaABAg,Wow...

UgzduxI60fQv1PpB6V94AaABAg,"This phone sparks the same light I had when I was closely watching OnePlus One being released. I bought it asap and I wasn't dissapointed. For that price it was a bargain. After that I bought OnePlus 5 which I have to this day. In my opionion OP5 was the last good phone from OnePlus.. I really love the fast af fingerprint and the OS is still as fast as when I bought it. I would only like to have a better camera and better battery. That's all I want. 
If Nothing can achieve this, they can count with me as a happy customer :)"
UgzduxI60fQv1PpB6V94AaABAg.9cYHCzjKDHU9cYQZehW8ep,@Flaw1k Deadshot It had fingerprint on the back if I recall correctly? I preffer to have it on the front.

UgzduxI60fQv1PpB6V94AaABAg.9cYHCzjKDHU9cYL9AB_p0B,7pro is the last good oneplus one
UgzduxI60fQv1PpB6V94AaABAg.9cYHCzjKDHU9cYIF05WKx8,5t was the better one tbh
UgxQU6LraMHn0dpUjU54AaABAg,"Well... Idk, light on the back seem like gimmick and waste of battery. And reverse wireless charging even more so. I mean phone is the thing you want to keep charged, it doesn't matter if your earphones or something dies. And phone battery isn't that much anyways."
Ugx5TyndyUq50nUcTf14AaABAg,The answer you are looking for is No. It wont work. In my opinion

UgyVpJd3CbuvY-KG96R4AaABAg,"i absolutely love that design, and those LEDs but i just simply dont like Android. so as much as i want to support this design and new stuff in the industry, android day-to-day is just not as good for me compared to iOS"

UgxohpHca0jZFq5NOEh4AaABAg,That final line I need an explanation for that .
UgwZHudo9TqfjTvwcfp4AaABAg,"Not impressed at all. A transparent back with an internal enclosure covering all components and 900 LEDs means probably an extra $50-$100 in manufacturing cost before they even announce the specs. The rest of the phone looks like a generic iPhone clone from Wish. What is the point of wasting all that money on the back of the phone (which nobody with a case or skin is ever going to pay attention to anyway) if the front of it is going to look and perform like a $300 Xiaomi? Nobody has cared about LEDs on phones since the flip phone era of the mid-2000s (I had an old Siemens flip phone with a much better implementation of notification LEDs than this useless thing).

If this is all they have that's ""unique"", this phone/company is going to fail a thousand times harder than Essential ever did."
UgwZjnM9ZLB_eVKHwx94AaABAg,"The phone is beyond cool, but for 1,700$ it‚Äôs just not affordable to the common person‚Ä¶ if it was 1,000 that would be a different story"

UgyjMTRnkcaBd-Ifokd4AaABAg,Recording red indicator and ringtones are not good

UgzJfcBQGMWPGl_snXx4AaABAg,OnePlus when it launched hit a different spot. It wasn't a gimmicky phone but very aggressively priced phone for a base who were looking for top notch Android features on a high end smart phone. Nothing phone 1 is nothing like OnePlus One.
UgzJfcBQGMWPGl_snXx4AaABAg.9cYGZEpVcVn9cYNPMafP6Y,can't agree more

UgzGepm8eysbyYSgiRR4AaABAg,I was really skeptical of how Nothing could differentiate themselves from other Android brands but honestly that's actually fucking dope. I might consider it. It's Apple-like design with nerdy Android-like quirks that I love.
UgyRi5F38TPa2prIqzt4AaABAg,Does it come in black?
UgxSRGgejkUXFFs4Nl54AaABAg,nice try Apple
UgyHNyqXQDqkPEVQpfp4AaABAg,Whether its trying to build ecosystem or looks like star wars phone. But we all have to agree its something fresh.
Ugx-9IZj1WrK78Coue14AaABAg,"If I was an Android user I would be interested, maybe, but no Android phone so far has come close to getting me to consider ditching my iPhone. It's surprising how un-tempted I've been over the years really. So it's not really a breakthrough from my point of view even though I like it and of course it was always going to take more than a few flashing LEDs to be a breakthrough."
UgzzKmFrR7rfaDVWx7B4AaABAg,Those ringtones... Ouch

It's slick, it's stylish, it still runs well (despite the software now being more buggy because OnePlus apparently stopped caring about OS quality) and it doesn't have a camera punch-out on the screen.

There were a couple of instances where I couldnt get out of the app I was in, after like 100 attempts I managed to switch to another but not to get out to the homescreen - had to restart. There were other as well, cant remember em all) Android 12 fixed most of them but introduced some new ones as well (still, its much better than before, 12 was its last chance before I returned it and it somewhat redeemed it)."

I think that if ROM will be simplified like Google`s one with some extra usable features like in OnePlus idea - that may work for fans of OnePlus, especially now, when OnePlus become same ROM as Vivo and Oppo and many fans are not happy at all from this changes. Even I declined my look to OnePlus for now and looking over Samsung models, as latest OnePlus ROM don`t make my friends with their phones happy with that changes and some bugs."

Ugy53JcSaix72ShvQeN4AaABAg,The design is good. I think the unique thing about the phone is the massive led notification that i believe nobody excited for .
UgwYCSq5v3b5_lRmZRV4AaABAg,that reminds me my nokia 3220 from 2004
UgxgZOSaADREcM6f48V4AaABAg,"Boooooorrrrrrring, lol. Android needs the battery life. Drop the lights."
UgwiClLLqV0ge2tF7r14AaABAg,"For whatever reason, the phone reminds me of a movie prop from Star Wars."
Ugy8lfHjyWPUWQgPI2x4AaABAg,Looks like the iPhone Apple should have made 7yrs ago.
Ugylgg1TlLyIPNydC3d4AaABAg,"Having bought the nothing ear 1 ,this  definitely gonna be overpriced ,,, it'll be cool if they tag it $1111"
UgyfYxpilFS9TehlAGB4AaABAg,Coolest phone this year so far
UgwrmAOMXKbPrNpo0AV4AaABAg,"The fact that they have restricted us to let us see the front display, proves that there is something fishey going on, maybe the chin is too big or the display is not that impressive. 
We are going to see another mediocre product which was overhyped"
Ugxu9ZFGYdWEDwpZZz14AaABAg,That one plus reference in the end ..
UgxajDAlO8FogJVEm9p4AaABAg,This shirt is awful
UgyAaNk5Td9bbcDbI_F4AaABAg,"What is the use of this, if u have to see the back of the phone why can't u just turn your phone and see the screen ."
UgzIlW9da_PIx21QBEt4AaABAg,"Really who gives a shit about notification LED when you have AOD on all the phones now? and to be covered with a case also! And even then who says that camera and/or specs are even half good? that happened with nothing ear 1, a piece of shit quality air pod rip off! Strategy is MKBHD sells nothing HARD and then people pre order this then comes garbage software and shitty hardware. this video literally is about LEDs on back of a phone 6 MF minutes! MKB may have a share of this or a profit in this or something..."
Ugx5a3MzY63Nq6plHA94AaABAg,"The led thing is for people who do not use case, put their phone upside down and never use always on display feature. And i dont fit that criteria"
UgzudROD1NF5PfQMZ-14AaABAg,"The 1+ jab there tho üòÇ It looks sick to be honest, I carry an iPhone nowadays but this phone made me think about it for a second. I would give it a try for sure if I was on the Android ecosystem."
UgwHi9kDxuXSn-1WpWl4AaABAg,I don't know when I was this excited for a smartphone. This looks really cool.
Ugx-uFyhIN66VtGuj814AaABAg,I thought it was a modded iPhone for a second
Ugwa5EtxHlY8VF3-KyJ4AaABAg,RGB...Ôºü
Ugx6uBYT8799jj8LsU54AaABAg,Futuristic phone
UgyLDphsGEpKC-IlR_l4AaABAg,"Actually, the uniqueness of the notification and light from other phones might help it stand out. But the phone sure looks sick. ‚úåÔ∏è"
UgyLDphsGEpKC-IlR_l4AaABAg.9cYEWNlb44U9cYSYg08xrq,I will never preorder anything but i would consider this my new phone if it delivers. I have currently an iPhone XS and want to switch to android again. It would be so nice if they just use stock android with some improvements like they did with One+. It's not even because of the lights (ok the charging light is pretty cool) but the design is just so clean. Thats why i haven't switched to android so far. Only really clean looking android phone is the Samsung Galaxy S22 but i hate Samsung for their bloatware and own stores and so on. I just want clean android. :(
UgyLDphsGEpKC-IlR_l4AaABAg.9cYEWNlb44U9cYSMrwmNaP,@Rxiya x‚ô°o lol not even close
UgyLDphsGEpKC-IlR_l4AaABAg.9cYEWNlb44U9cYLAl9fiDU,They should get a phone case that would match the led‚Äôs
UgwcqaGkfx2I-tzi76N4AaABAg,looks better than an iPhone.
UgwRaHJvl5ZrNMWkcKN4AaABAg,Watch dbrand sell clear skins for it
Ugyrv4Aas8GEI8Og4Fp4AaABAg,What a beautiful phone
UgzT2zeLnasSOZps2XZ4AaABAg,Loved the not so subtle dig at OPPO PlusüòÅüòÅ Vintage Marques.
UgwhehoWsAiMHd2yRz14AaABAg,‚ÄúUnique Phone‚Äù Yeah looks like an iPhone 12 modified
UgwmPZVCkuxibGOfoix4AaABAg,But that feels like it abandoned your original fan base sound familiar!!
UgyP-zh9NZjH-4Dg1mh4AaABAg,You had me at lights tbh. Are you going to review the Naruto phone??
Ugw81VsOnKz58lWI05V4AaABAg,Sold!
Ugz6KlR4bg3VNL5zm4N4AaABAg,Pretty disappointing. Just another Midrange smartphone. Putting an oppo logo on the back won‚Äôt look weird
UgxHxdb8UZRBygoWaot4AaABAg,Love how that one ringtone(?) is the sound my computer speakers used to make right before my mobile phone would ring.
Ugx1VtOWfpQg2u40IA54AaABAg,"So, basically just another phone. Phones have plateaued big time, man. I personally now only look for a big screen, big battery and an SD card slot, that's all."
UgwULnLSNwr-q8RiZlt4AaABAg,Does the phone offer an easily replaceable battery?
UgxG0zA9AnpEjx2e_Nl4AaABAg,so cool
Ugxs4-jI1gH9m58tpYZ4AaABAg,Id get one if I used android
UgyTjRtt-5joswtldFh4AaABAg,Nobody cares about any of this
UgxBhkFv-Vq683j-GLt4AaABAg,all good but front camera is not at middle
UgySKveYxaY2Bj7ZHfR4AaABAg,Nothing phone series will surely get bigger than one plus
UgzHTgPYi7mmecvjAbR4AaABAg,You were only allowed to show the back... but you also showed the front...??
UgzHJ4LIL4mzk6w8MTR4AaABAg,"In Android world it's feel like ""EVERYTHING (OS) IS SAME EXCEPT THE NAME (PHONE COMPANY)...
This phone has a unique design, üëçüèª for that, and those LED light features are cool as well,, and umm ...I don't know what to say ."
UgzGidQKiGx_nkZon5x4AaABAg,üòÇIs he talking about OnePlus at the end?
UgwyRbLHZNHfKNTgszh4AaABAg,The new OnePlus?üòå
UgyFzf5Yzqa9jgIqJBR4AaABAg,I see that it might appeal more to hearing-impaired phone users. I'd certainly get one for those LED lights
UgzXgIOdaR_QAR57nUF4AaABAg,Sick ringtones!!
Ugz4SpHRLZO63xYo_Qx4AaABAg,Sick design üëåüëåüëå
Ugxyw7i_lQ8caTUJNOR4AaABAg,"at the end of the day, if the functionality of the device isn‚Äôt compelling enough, it‚Äôs going to be another average phone in the ocean of average phones. if nothing can release an api and get developers of the core apps out there to fully take advantage of the led lights, i think that can be an actual way to grow interest in the device.  

what i‚Äôve noticed is a unique looking device will come out, and after a while, its uniqueness tends to fade into the background, and the core characteristics of the device ends up being the same as every other device; which is why ppl tend to default to samsung or apple."
UgzwsHMSan1ZIPkBhi54AaABAg,Can the lights work in silent or DND mode
Ugzm4kv4WlGzQKL9VUR4AaABAg,Death of oneplus
UgyPlcYzVbRCtkLQQEJ4AaABAg,*With those led Battery life really remains a question*
UgyRx_yecqH65vZyl4V4AaABAg,"And what about the specs? I was genuinely interested but the video just goes ""phone has light. Light cool. Buy phone"" ü§å?"
Ugz9TeK6rOD9YFIvu_R4AaABAg,This is absolutely bonkers
UgyZk-JQGkHff7Ck57J4AaABAg,im sold where do i get one RIGHT NOW

UgyT5UnO4L69gZmzBVR4AaABAg,Subtle dig at oneplus...
UgwHpVG-KBeXOla9_h94AaABAg,The better looking iPhone. That‚Äôs it.
UgxgUhhXsIIUivD_Mup4AaABAg,Looks literally just like an iPhone. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Apple sues them.
Ugzwufo7qGqhUnBgRvx4AaABAg,"It seems from the video that they use stock Android but with added features
Which is wonderful üíú
I love stock Android UI

But I wonder will they provide updates?"
UgzYU_J_7mPDHH9ZRGd4AaABAg,"No notch

UgxD07hmhyR_1qzSGYB4AaABAg,Nothing will end up being Nothing or Nothing
Ugy6U9SWAT1naPI3lIh4AaABAg,It‚Äôs all good until the LED‚Äôs start failing
UgzQZ6cDnWFcEj9JMV54AaABAg,This guy is sucked into the multiple embargo model
UgxIMeHdPuv-zz8-N6d4AaABAg,Oneplus.
UgwVxpE0tLsqUdfrp_B4AaABAg,6:16 One Plus- I‚Äôll take my leave guys
UgwdbaFn7s746zAiQ2V4AaABAg,Samsung invented this thing of light indication in j7max and some mobiles
Ugx0LrAbzW-lNjtlmFF4AaABAg,"Looking good, but gonna wait on the Real Review, Snyder Cut ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"
UgwNxPjpMxD6LkRma694AaABAg,Maybe they make a covercase that complement the LED feature? Might look dope
UgyboHgUuLWgYiKjBXV4AaABAg,All  these young people dont remember how people would customize their Nokia 3390 with battrties that would light up with the custom ringtones.
Ugz28DD2bmrOw2mkRFp4AaABAg,I don't put my phone screen facing downward. & Shaking phone seems scratching screen. Notification light should be on front side
Ugz98Tt9i3S3y7aR-CJ4AaABAg,i already want it‚Ä¶ someone please buy me this and the buds for my bd ü•≤
UgyqPe1Hfl6nxmP6-tt4AaABAg,Looks like a flop. You heard it here first ü§ì
Ugz65sPG8MwlgBSYAQZ4AaABAg,Wow imagine how great the led would be for deaf or hard of hearing people. Amazing design I think
Ugz65sPG8MwlgBSYAQZ4AaABAg.9cYE2rcU9cB9cZkh4v0QGC,"@Naru Sorry, I'm quite limited in my writing abilities in english"

Ugz65sPG8MwlgBSYAQZ4AaABAg.9cYE2rcU9cB9cYQA_w-fAi,@Naru This!!!!
Ugz65sPG8MwlgBSYAQZ4AaABAg.9cYE2rcU9cB9cYMjDFAF7_,"actually they can either feel vibration or literally look at the front screen. The purpose of the led at the back is to get notifications with the phone faced down, which is independent of whether the person is deaf or not"
UgwHaaXyQ8O7-RtKoFF4AaABAg,After watching this... Ive seen Nothing
UgysYparB9Va5KX57BF4AaABAg,"I seriously can't believe they would announce just the LEDs on the back. Not nearly enough for me to get excited since those seem like something I would immediately turn off. I don't want everyone knowing when I get notifications, I don't want my pocket to light up while walking down the street. I really don't get it. Besides that, this phone doesn't look unique at all. It looks like something AI would make based on the last 4 iPhones."
Ugz-lRmPT-HQ5bzJ4CN4AaABAg,Another comment thread full of verified checks‚Ä¶ I KNOW this isn‚Äôt genuine at this point
UgzHqFlogLqDm2xKMtJ4AaABAg,Nothing interesting
UgxZDxH_NcWqBp9J_nJ4AaABAg,"Too much for the brain, its really will be bad form  for my anxiety tho.  Its cool gadget but isn't it our goal is to minimize distraction and make it utilitarian more towards our progression."
UgzmTvlZk4UJ8GCgCqF4AaABAg,If its under 30K rupees i am gonna buy it as soon as i convince my family
Ugyj7gLqfF0PEvJeJ_V4AaABAg,Slightly more broadly appealing.....even more and even more and even....aaah f*ck it
UgxPDQ0RK_DOspIEWUV4AaABAg,So he said it comes out June 12th. Did he mean July 12th?
UgzeyDuGcZbIvipKhLB4AaABAg,what phone do you use?
UgxyxPq2flUVrxxhtot4AaABAg,If it's under 600 dollar........it's lit
Ugw-D8NMgZo_Y7XZjl94AaABAg,"as usual. miracles on the stick and when it comes out, it will turn out to be something else"
Ugw0wcn5ZbtMmAg5QGB4AaABAg,"The area on the top tight, next to the camera is auch a missed opportunity for a good small e-ink display for notifications."
UgwTcNlKK578bq8GHHB4AaABAg,Literally thought it was an iPhone 11 with a nothing phone case or smthg at first üóø.
UgzmqyjKwue2fxpra7t4AaABAg,"Yeah, but doesn't you always on display do all that way better anyways?"
UgwLvpnmsDSo-XDv3oV4AaABAg,Keep in mind that NOTHING is a startup company who are playing against all those trillion dollars company
UgwOUrvCe6o1wg-evYd4AaABAg,So there‚Äôs a screen on the front that can display everything but they want you to decipher everything with led arrangements on the back‚Ä¶ cool I guess but how many people want something like that?
Ugwp9Z6g5Ypxo3ufAn14AaABAg,Anyone else hear the humming vent?
Ugy_REoLan1Qz7D8uZ14AaABAg,I think the only way this can really have mass appeal is if they can get a case that also mimics the LEDs
UgzT6Yi_evC06sQY_dF4AaABAg,rgb
UgzpSpmEQzt2E7iulDx4AaABAg,KCPD man
Ugxhw85rzwtN-_Jpw294AaABAg,its nothing new..the 1+ brand started almost like this and it ended up mainstreams years later..the Nothing brand will be the same
Ugwmsy1NJ5jYNJrLVx94AaABAg,"I use a transparent case for my iPhone and never ever look at the back of the phone, so don‚Äôt see why notification lights will make me want to remap my brain to start placing any phone on its screen."

UgxLM4_TfIMk-HSGD014AaABAg,Sounds familiar..???  yes oneplus!!
Ugx4qzo0wuvQrTrGwvt4AaABAg,and what about back cover? you didn't bring that topic in discussion.
UgxLBjrKpTfMiRAS4DV4AaABAg,cool level 9999
Ugy6JO98_CmvnZluOS94AaABAg,Looks good but I‚Äôll want to see performance and long term support.
UgwDh6th-zP7_rrtWEx4AaABAg,this look straight out of the cyberpunk vibes
UgwIbIsXFvD0rabWteR4AaABAg,"I'm concerned about battery life of this device. I think it'll die soon, as it has Always on display with Always on LEDs on it's back."
Ugzt_73s64_EtXaF6yF4AaABAg,I think it looks actually pretty dope tbh! I mean you clearly can flex with this phone hahahah

UgyRtVvaetoDyWULPf14AaABAg,watching on my 1+7p. yes it does sound familiar

UgwRmsaGvLCE6fIljCF4AaABAg,very familiar
Ugx1Y1GnljQiNlSpV_B4AaABAg,"I think, you are taking about OnePlus, in the end."
Ugx-GgLB2uRIRnl35qx4AaABAg,"Am digging it for sure but Pei should sign a pledge never to ditch fans like OnePlus eventually did. OnePlus used to actually get views from fans and infuse them in their phones until they got fat and disoriented. As for Nothing, we need a very fast and uncluttered skin, solid reliability in hardware and software frontiers, good (not necessarily great) cameras, awesome battery, long-term updates....and a good sustainability business model (buy-back, for example). We waiting Pei"

UgxBAJlnfjjyhFkCxDR4AaABAg,‚ÄúAll look Basically the same‚Äù meaning look like iPhones lmao they gotta do better I miss when nexus was around it seemed like android companies did differently . But the led lights are cool af
UgxYcetr1eMBAynLp5J4AaABAg,ü§© Another competitor in market place is hugely welcomed by our side!!! Great to see that they are trying something different than other. I would also like to see them directly go head to head with Apple in coming years.
UgxYcetr1eMBAynLp5J4AaABAg.9cYDbpzlF2q9cZXVRVYLEt,"@catboy oneplus and google has big market share in Asia, what are you talking about??? It has given huge alternative against Sam and apple."
UgxYcetr1eMBAynLp5J4AaABAg.9cYDbpzlF2q9cYNhUAWSgb,and i use android 6 year recently switch in ios my experience got better and in my perspective ios is better and yes ios have limitation but i think ios come closer to android yeah its slowly but its happening
UgxYcetr1eMBAynLp5J4AaABAg.9cYDbpzlF2q9cYNFdUSrLu,if apple stick to their meta strong factor and improve overtime that's apple eventually doing so trust me no one able to beat apple in smartphone market business coz majority off people want balanced phone in flagship category  great camera great battery performance essential and useful features smoothly and lag free performance and 5year plus support also gd build quality and great ecosystem so in this criteria apple way ahead other smartphone company
Ugxon2KkH8Ya9U-YVwV4AaABAg,dopeee
Ugztm45AbzMUzMyNj-B4AaABAg,All it needs is a case with cutouts for the leds.
UgyuX8J7_NsD12pdTjF4AaABAg,This kind of feels like a renaissance of the old transparent Nintendo handhelds. I can certainly appreciate that!
Ugz6pz92zC9YEw--ThF4AaABAg,"Damn, looks cool. Unfortunately it'll all be covered with a case, unless you're into cheap silicone cases that yellow over time."

UgwE7_U1wj3kLQy08lN4AaABAg,Nothing became ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ugyym3YcTvrMXhttRnJ4AaABAg,All these features are cool but why would you want to put your phone down on ground with the screen? Putting the most sensitive part of the phone at the highest risk of damaging it.
UgwNVaLxHVL8AdiBRxN4AaABAg,Glyph design resembles the Apple logo
Ugxid1sSJHzrVqXwupB4AaABAg,"It's really cool for ppl who have difficulty hearing. Maybe smartphone can get a bit smarter than now, through these little idea and design show up. Not just trending mass appealing designs."

It‚Äôs the bad software which is holding back Android in developed markets.

UgzGnmlZramJUVzCFf14AaABAg,Yes you do sound familiar. That's how I lost trust and love for Oneplus. I hope it won't go that way too.
UgzDP3-24Cl_kWtFwl94AaABAg,Am I the only one that rests his phone face up? Makes thoses LEDs useless to me... Also an AOD app (given an OLED screen) gives pretty much the same features.
UgzBv7xtdCko5H5hwKB4AaABAg,This looks like NOTHING I‚Äôve ever seen before.

UgzMRI_bIB4dA_5zALV4AaABAg,"I think smartphone companies are losing the point. I mean look at Apple! I was always mocking them‚Ä¶the iPhone is so expensive while so simple. But thing is there is nothing similar concept-wise.

Imagine there was an android phone with flat edges, fhd+ or qhd+ 120hz display with a punch hole camera and just 2 cameras on the back, a 5,8 inch ‚Äúmini‚Äù model and a normal 6,5 inch model, a light ui based on stock Android OS and a snapdragon chip. Asus was going towards that way with zenphone 8 but it was not widely available. I believe Android smartphone companies are competing only in specs, but none of them in real life use"
UgzBI5MqS2MeDfuaKGZ4AaABAg,"The dilemma here is that the LED lights at the back of the phone may consume a lot since it would do much lighting up whenever someone would call you. Just sayin'.

P.S. How much is this phone again?"
UgzXQ1nC-AFaTlCOTVV4AaABAg,Nerd evil is so 2010...we gotta get out of all this nerd evil stuff and back to wholesome good things. Words of inspiration and empowerment. Every human has their own gifts. Why do nerds gifts get to demand all the limelight? Nerds are a thing of the past these days.

Ugx3LX4vPvQjPfoYKEt4AaABAg,I adore the design of this. Finally someone thinking outside the plain slab.
UgwD32-GGAh_RugMGjx4AaABAg,"Hmm... How many people charge or lay their phone down-facing? When it rings, I'd see the caller's name or photo show up."
UgxQMlR3XGNR0RVoBG54AaABAg,Now I am hyped
UgxobEzjiqWS1M9-WcR4AaABAg,Definitely interested on this phone. Looks very cool. Neat and different idea concept and love to see what it is able to do. Plus what the price will be for it when it comes out.
Ugx-TIxM6U9TqCczJO54AaABAg,No matter how good your phone looks in the end you will end up using a funky case for it.
UgwSuwU55-9Vt8u-ax54AaABAg,That's actually pretty cool
Ugx31Gsqj7l_5PC80dh4AaABAg,I think it's just boring nothing special
Ugzo_a_u6zoltVIwR594AaABAg,Oh thank God finally a phone that has the curvy body of an iPhone! The usual Androids don‚Äôt curve as smoothly as an iPhone‚Äôs body does..
UgwBEbDAb_XgIhvLSuV4AaABAg,Will it support North American LTE bands?
Ugz-u5udxfjCFJ8mXRR4AaABAg,Now phone backs are getting reviewed.
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg,"Omg, the diffusion looks fantastic on those lights! I'm actually considering this for my next device. I have the Z Flip 3 but the rumours and leaks on the flip 4 look like it will be almost identical to the 3, so this seems like a good runner up. Now I understand what that image they showed on stage, it was the pattern of the lights."
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cY_WMNE4ZF,@Mit Mit  no kidding eh.

UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYX_aZuy9z,"@Mit Mit  Ya thats the only reason I switched to it from my 12 pro, I was just bored of the same old design over and over so when I bought the ZFlip it felt like a completely new thing. But like anything the novelty wears off after a few months lol."
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYWTZlrN9t,@Â±±‰πá‰∏Ç·ëéI·ëï·ïºO·í™ i haven't own flip before might as well get it for my  next daily use phone (also 8gen1+ is really good i heard ) . i mean  folding phone still a new thing around nothing phone only look cool in the back otherwise they are just some  regular slab smartphone

UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYL8V621lH,@Mit Mit  yea the better crease is the only reason I would consider the 4
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYKU1yuJmQ,"flip 4 much smaller hinge frame , improved battery less crease ."
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYJSLsCbb7,@bob after 7 months the screen just cracked in the middle on mine
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYGIhwdOZE,"Same hea, i would rather not trade n use z flip 3 as my secondary option. Secondary because the battery life sucks and not easy to carry n use. Its been nearly a year n am still not so confident wid z flip 3 but i still love it. Nothing will be my primary n every day use device, finger crossed. I would love if they released black color option cuzz those led lights is gonna look dope in black panel."
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYFR_SsVrL,"@bob  oh nothing (lol) at all, I usually trade in my phone every 12 months so I don't have to, if the nothing phone 1 is too hard to get my hands on, I'll just stick with my ZFlip.  It's actually been a great phone, other than the battery life."
UgxpoRCFE4tCAI5N7El4AaABAg.9cYD9kFGw5a9cYEH1GSSaC,Whats wrong with the Z Flip 3?
UgwkI5CZTdxklY_UiZZ4AaABAg,I've only known about this phone for a few weeks but I'm very interested in the Android re-skin and if the cameras are good. if not I'm just going to get a Pixel 6a

Ugw3wUBPxDWU6VKtLHZ4AaABAg,plot twist: this is an iPhone. iPhone is Nothing.
Ugx7Y4pWVoq-Q5HRXEB4AaABAg,"All BAD IDEAS.
1) Putting the phone face down on a desk prone to dust. 
2) Wiggling the phone on the dusty desk to check battery status.
3) Wasting previous battery.

I have a legion phone with LEDs on the back and never use it because it drains the battery."

If it has anything close to upper mid tier perfomance, it will be all things to most of the people, albeit barring some hardcore special scenario users. I'm excited for Nothing's future in a familiar way. Carl Pei came full circle."

I'm not sure, but sd has kept making the 7 series more and more capable while pricing it higher. It's now an upper middle range soc, I expect sd to introduce a 6 series or something lower with maybe 6 cores and cut down bits from 7 and 8 series"

UgwW1IFaZNq0o5s5Xpd4AaABAg.9cYCrtmxBfX9cYUi0vNsuc,"Yessir. The design alone is already awesome. If it has a camera and speakers that can compete with iPhone, and the software isn't complete trash, I'd definitely be interested in switching over."

UgyNPcutLk4dVPunsAF4AaABAg,Ppl are gullible and kinda short minded narrow minded easy influenced. If u tell them this is the best thing to ever came in a phone ppl will listen and buy it even so it might be totally trash. That's why there is leaders and many followers. Because the leaders make decisions and not listen to others. Then there is the sheep that follow and listen and don't make their own decisions. (lot of ppl seem to fit in the later)
Ugz-LaaEPUsStpa6k-54AaABAg,"I'm sorry but that's literally just a fucking iPhone, they straight up ripped it off there's nothing that LOOKS different about it.

The idea of LED indicators coming back rocks though, they should have never left."

UgyocnsqsK6BfaJJdZN4AaABAg,Not because the camera is like this don't mean it's a iPhone
UgzDfhLrmYK6xiMUh0p4AaABAg,"Sure that is something new, but seems like a gimmick than a feature to me. Like if I don't have my phone in my pocket, I will have it like on a table, but screen side up, right? And when I have my phone in my pocket and it starts vibrating/ringing, I can just look at the screen to see who's calling or what notification did I get.

This would make more sense, if the led's would be on side or on top of the phone, you know like a ring around the entirety of the display, this way the led's could actually be used for software like in pc rgb hardware, red glow when you playing a game and you're low health and such.

On a sidenote, when will phone manufacturers start making their phones more grippable, I feel like every phone is so smooth and slippery that you have get a case to not have it fall off your hands constantly and so the entire aesthetic of the phone is moot. Sure you can use a clear case, but not only does that look bad and cheap, it will also gather a lot of dirt and lint."

UgzuPnb5DSEhNMX-yyB4AaABAg,Yeah similiar to OnePlus because the owner is the same right!!
UgxrPQpbXO1To6kecf54AaABAg,"If they move the cameras to the middle, that would be enough to make it unique in this ""iPhone like"" trend's that we have right now"
UgzmYn4o4i-5ylCQwup4AaABAg,"This phone looks like something out of the future. BUT, from a user experience point of view, I'm interested to see how the seamless integration between software and hardware will play out. As someone heavily invested in the Apple eco-system, the ability to work across different platforms (MacBook, iPhone, Watch, etc.) makes the experience amazing, and NOTHING really has to convince users that they can offer something similar. Watching this space!"
UgzhI782WI9KWzB_VYZ4AaABAg,The one plus reference in the endüòÇüòÇüòÇ
UgwDCpYEP21jn20Pi3N4AaABAg,The design is amazing.
UgyFuDhfq1MlWdpAJYh4AaABAg,"When he‚Äôs checking the ringtones, it reminds me of when I was a kid, I‚Äôd always spend minutes on my Mum‚Äôs Nokia 3310 going through every existing ringtone, and vibe to them like actual music. Ha ha üòÇ"
Ugyf0tR26NEfDbNK2NZ4AaABAg,Definitely my next phone.
UgyOXslhHrt6XQroTRp4AaABAg,"The Nothing Phone (1) looks like a blend of all Oppo Reno 7 phones. Chinese Reno 7 5G frame. Even some antenna bands are at the same spot along with the individual volume buttons. Also same screen size with 6.43"" along with a slightly slimmer chin like the Oppo Reno 7 Pro and punchhole on the left top. And how the cameras portrude looks like the ones of the Reno 7Z. Also the Reno 7 series brought the Orbit (Breathing) Light that the (1) took to the max! So is Nothing a true indipendent start up? Looks to me like OnePlus all over again! Maybe the ties between Carl Pei and Pete Lau are still there. üòú"
Ugw3KfXq2LM2g9klfPN4AaABAg,so nothing did something? thats quite shocking
UgyCxg0RSTvkNw4ZK094AaABAg,Aight kinda impressed lol

UgwUqYTI_Z6o5kLfu_x4AaABAg,My father gets this much notifications from the business that the phone will light our whole led house by glowing 24*7
UgwD3k6-8H-yz94JGol4AaABAg,Gimmicky enough that android fans will mistake it as innovative.
UgyT5yyAwHYCTZPiZJh4AaABAg,iphone 11 knockoff
UgxF-cK5CQNDY-asgfh4AaABAg,That subtle nod to oneplusüëå
Ugx_JhqIrMC--1LR6Bh4AaABAg,Very cool but not for me.
UgwOP98crTHIzJBTarp4AaABAg,The notification lights are probably the coolest but most unnecessary thing on the phone‚Ä¶. Who puts the phone display down on a table?
UgxB8j7OUUoxOIzAeKl4AaABAg,"The shape of this phone looks EXACTLY like an iPhone. With a hole punch camera on the front instead of a notch, and a unique but possibly gimmicky back with LEDs. Whether those LEDs on the back actually add useful and cool features that are worth using, or simply turn out to be a gimmicky party trick that you show off once in a while to others but otherwise completely ignore or turn off is something that needs to be seen. I think it falls more under the gimmicky category."
UgxyYq_dQ5Q8bffT8zN4AaABAg,"The way you, in such a subtle manner made fun of Oneplus was nice üòÑüòÑüëèüèªüëèüèª"
Ugy13Ze1dOPb_7pjOS14AaABAg,"Make no mistake, the design is strategically implemented to appeal to the loyal apple iPhone fan base. The LED lighting is cool but sort of gimmicky in my opinion, and once you initially get over the excitement within a month or two, you‚Äôll regress back to the more familiar iPhone or galaxy you‚Äôve used before."
UgwcAac5Tj2U4iuj_Dh4AaABAg,Basically its overhype well its their first smartphone release and its not too bad also not really that great either. Still I really interested where they gonna go after this and what kind of product they will release. That back design still look sick tho definitely look aesthetic
UgwUQm_7DH0z4PvXr4F4AaABAg,"This looks solid AF. All it needs is a solid camera, decent screen, and a stock android like feel and it can take over where Oneplus and Pixel left off. If I wasn‚Äôt used to my iPhone syncing with my iPad and AirPods I‚Äôd buy this phone. I miss android but am really enjoying the tightly knit structure of iOS"
UgwWa8YRT0hYPGkDiWJ4AaABAg,"Really not impressed. I'm still looking for some brand to build a software first phone. 
Android os is open source and still no brand is able to come up with a decent phone that optimises for software as smooth as iphone does, not even pixel. That's the reason why people use iPhone to start with. Nobody needs huge specs"

UgyILa_9DK7DT4qtRTt4AaABAg,is this from the movie DUNE?
Ugz3tO0YyrYNgDv-DH54AaABAg,This is the only newly released phone that could get me off of my XR in a heartbeat with just the looks alone

UgwWf60da4nYtAZl07V4AaABAg,"If the camera is good, looks decent"
Ugy_InxqzGVwKtwgCH54AaABAg,"I actually am impressed‚Ä¶ I like the UI and the physical design‚Ä¶

Ugy_InxqzGVwKtwgCH54AaABAg.9cYAXXjPcs99cYQR1Fw9_a,"i like the UI font a lot. its got a cool ""welcome to the future"" vibe that reminds you of like, early internet or the matrix. idk how to properly describe it.

i like fonts."
UgziMaWJ76RfVpAruTZ4AaABAg,Definitely what they trying to achieve with this device is great but coming out with rumours of processor display and price range kinda might be a setback hope they are just rumours
Ugw8_LK-QDwV6WYWIjZ4AaABAg,When I first saw this phone I wasn't that impressed considering it didn't look as cool as the ear (1) but after seeing the backlight features it has got me interested (only if they release a transparent case)
Ugw8_LK-QDwV6WYWIjZ4AaABAg.9cYAWgttW1T9cYNu8xcCCL,"A bumper style case would work as well, keeps the screen/back raised to rpevent anything hitting it, whilst providing protection around the outside. That way there's nothing impeding the glow from the back."
Ugw8_LK-QDwV6WYWIjZ4AaABAg.9cYAWgttW1T9cYF0m3tT55,Its beatiful with with led and white color
Ugw8_LK-QDwV6WYWIjZ4AaABAg.9cYAWgttW1T9cYEKtpsINm,Literally got you interested with leds lmao

UgwVdPWQhhexCSo_PNt4AaABAg,"Rather than a transparent one, we need a scratch resistant and shockproof housing material"

I wish the whole back was filled with LEDs and it gave users choice to configure on how they want it to be. Hope no one reads my multi-million dollar idea and takes it from YT comment to R&D. Haha.

UgyOEDXX-1qxWx_rk1p4AaABAg,"Every 5-10 years, like clockwork, a Chinese company shows up and copies Apple to the hilt - adding enough gimmicks to make an illusion of not copying. They get some publicity and a following alright, but they don‚Äôt ‚Äústeal‚Äù any customers from Apple. They get Android enthusiasts, whom they abandon after 5 years when the buzz is out."
UgwSbMDfZ1F1F4Ym-uB4AaABAg,"this looks so freaking cool, if it would be available in my country (probably won't) the visuals alone would convince me to grab one"
UgxeZnz47A4F5G3BFdN4AaABAg,that finnal burn to oneplus users got me hard.
UgzNhtXeGEiMvEi6bL14AaABAg,Never heard of this company before. Not really sure what‚Äôs differentiating them here apart from some flashing lights that could be integrated into a case?
Ugz5s2UYNXuzYQ0VtPh4AaABAg,"Innovate concept but it the back panel actually solving any problems?  I generally am not in a habit placing my facing down if I don‚Äôt have to (why do that to your display?) and the notification content that can be displayed on the front can be far more granular and immediately useful.  I‚Äôll never remember which pattern is tied to which notification or caller. 

Also, what if you aren‚Äôt a fan of clear plastic cases, nearly all of which show you the grime trapped between the case and phone and all ultimately discolor and turn yellow. 

Again, some props for trying something different but this screams mostly gimmick to me."
UgyK8Ro0w_GnACjqbAF4AaABAg,idk wtf is the point of this tbh just look at yr front screen for notifications but its kinda cool thou but just quite useless in my opinion.
Ugz6amdNjsSzrhTPvu94AaABAg,Still not for me because I like to buy the big brands like Samsung and Apple phones

Unfortunately, this is just a gimmick and Nothing has nothing new to offer. Even those bezels seem huge compared to the Galaxy."

Ugx56J5KFOO51yRJFEx4AaABAg.9cY8yGAbfvZ9cYAFI__P0N,Ok let me check
UgwZEq7WFwmfBt2Uc4Z4AaABAg,"Pin hole is like a notch, a massive distraction when viewing content. The shape, buttons and so on are exactly the same as an iPhone 12 and 13, damn, even has the annoying iOS/iPadOS swipe bar at the bottom of the screen to get in the way of your lower content/controls/search fields. Just why can't people innovate in industrial design? The rear lights are cool, but the novelty will wear off. Way better to make a USEFUL phone like the Note series from Samsung with the S-Pen and perhaps add some mechanical controls for the camera like Sony do. Again, rear is cool, but, well, uhm, why not do it on the front using the screen? :)"
Ugzhab4w6LVoe68E2NV4AaABAg,I hope in future they have like some dark colour pattern on back
UgyIFSPZLDCHg1P_yLR4AaABAg,"Honestly, at this point it‚Äôs the ecosystem that‚Äôs going to attract me to a phone more than the actual phone. It would be cool to try a new form factor but I‚Äôm in deep with apple. I imagine Samsung owners are in the same boat. 

I used to buy phones, root them, then flash a modified OS but that gets to be a lot of work. I really hope these sell because competition is good. But I‚Äôm doubting it."

UgyCKaUUklPae48Gt-14AaABAg,"Way too similar to an iPhone in a generalised shape. That LED light array is a really annoying gimmick. Who puts their phonescreen down? Who wants to wiggle their phone while it is screen down?

UgzFx_AUh1vhl7-P_pp4AaABAg,"Honestly, the things that would convince me the most to get a phone like this would be the Long Term Support of the product, and the cases that will be available.  

Firstly, I won't be purchasing a phone if software updates last only a couple of years, as I upgrade my phone once every 3-6 years depending on if the phone gets damaged or not.

Secondly, the phone is useless as it is if it doesn't have a case that shows the included features...  I'm not going to drop 1K+ on a phone and not have protection for it.  I like the slim look of many modern phones, but I don't see it unless I'm cleaning the case of any dust and such."

UgzBnHXo10IkKS13sTB4AaABAg,"I don't care about the design. I'm OK with it if Nothing can provide that Customer Satisfaction.

UgzldY9f6l_czqJTLW14AaABAg,Challenging on design and competing with Giant is insane. Can‚Äôt win a battle if only had a good armour. Software is the key. I think they knew this.

UgwnIiJbcroHnd5w90R4AaABAg,WOW interesting video as always Marques!
UgwPm7-4l5YOQE9akVB4AaABAg,The led back is really pushing the envelope on overdoing trying to be different. If I want notifications I turn it screen facing up BUT if I want my phone not to be a distraction - I'll turn the screen down. This totally ruins it
Ugw2jFu5yATzeoKpmJ14AaABAg,"It surely looks unique and good ,but since it's first phone from nothing ,they really have to make it great at performance, software and photography, to actually sell it... Poco f1 looked bad but it was a huge success because it was a powerhouse of a phone. Hope nothing can pull that out too."
UgyQnYklUyHhYLpGeDZ4AaABAg,"it's a glass slab, now with led lights !

UgxiOK08kv1FSeWFtE14AaABAg,"I guess a better use case for the Glyph Interface would be to assign a light pattern to contact groups, like Work, Family, Friends etc along with specific contacts, also I hope they make this open source or atleast give an option for users to create their own patterns."
Ugw-L_Q7Deb7DULN8jp4AaABAg,"Just two cameras in 2022? Good luck with that! This is so full of fail, the name is stupendous too, reminds me of no phone, which is just a plastic slab."

UgwFL6MsdIBzUbkVDbd4AaABAg,Yes sounds familiar to 1plus am I right or wrong they had lost fan base because of appealing to broader
UgwtAT6KSf8-hMO8-fN4AaABAg,I don't kw about people but fooking buying it!!
UgyPrXFbxUo4tRYxIXl4AaABAg,You can just flip the phone and see the screen to see the actual notifications without the need for lights
Ugxq4g78bg1U8l-6_Zd4AaABAg,Those lights are for kids. Gimmicks.
UgzZVdbMhw0UBDvvs2h4AaABAg,"Seems like most people are impressed in the comments, but to be honest those LED flashing lights strike me as more annoying than anything. Like for me, that‚Äôs a downside than a selling point, but we‚Äôll see if it catches on."
Ugz0TgG_vr-2ueL47kx4AaABAg,"If you want to see your notifications there is the always on display feature, much better than a few LED. If my phone is facing down it means I do not want to be bothered.
The phone looks nice but I find the LED on the back completely useless... At least they look cool."
UgxWfjW6RiCirb9Iueh4AaABAg,That dig at OnePlus at the end üòÇ
UgyPC6bpg34AbDd0O8l4AaABAg,I would buy it. Depends on the price.

UgxuN2zFthwuNP_WnL54AaABAg,"Sooo Marques I saw u at the airport last to last Tuesday when u we‚Äôre going to Newark, and surprisingly, u were in the same flight as me, and I saw u when we were boarding.

UgysAUYITc7YuyfrEe94AaABAg,Yeah sounds a lot like 1+üòè
Ugz36eKPpHlCUdzcMZN4AaABAg,"I love the flat screen and led for notifications, but if this phone will come with permanently locked bootloader and some low end CPU, i wont buy it.  I need a phone than can be really mine, so i can root it and remove all the things i don't need, just like the current oneplus 9pro, 5min job to unlock/root/adblock"

UgxmBdNayLJjQzxC6zF4AaABAg,"okay i might be getting this wrong but didnt marques say he's allowed to show the back of the phone only? but there are clear frames showcasing the screen of the phone with the punchhole on the top left of the screen?
and i by the looks of it, this might be running a good old stock android?? (the notification bar and navigation bar)

huh, i dont wanna be that guy, but hey that's just subtle extra info for us??"
UgwqxUotaHdR2n7svaJ4AaABAg,"Great for people that like light shows and is unique to customize to callers.  One wonders how all the ""show"" will effect battery life which goes to battery size and if has fast charger with the phone or fast wireless charging.  Other issue with many phones that tempt from companies is if they are compatible with all the bands of one's cellular carrier.  Variety is great to see nevertheless."
UgwBuJ_iK70f4Ryrryd4AaABAg,Meh....most people will just cover this with a case.
UgwxQr1uHp6N7itzWGh4AaABAg,Wiggling the phone for the charging indicator will definitely scratch your screen if there's dust or whatever under it.

Ugz4xb4Yx7cef1p4Mnx4AaABAg,"First impressions: it's a phone that's based it's marketing around what I would call a gimmick. Don't get me wrong it looks cool but it looks like just a phone with LED lights on its back. Furthermore, usually when someone puts their phone facing down its usually so they don't get distracted or disturbed. Lastly it does not make sense that most features are based on the back, a place where people interact with the least."
UgzPbWeXaDqH83ceew94AaABAg,This phone is giving me gimmick phone vibes like the 3D and first gen bendable display phones.

Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cjskdB63Y6,and also how much battery it is gonna suck?
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cgIPgsn9pi,"Do you think anyone will cover that phone back..non transparent cover, Transparent case exist bro ü•±"
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9ce1K9EzP-s,@Aman S ü§ì
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cc6h-0EIKh,There will surely be a case which will have tiny cut out for the led light
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cbnuBe0voQ,"@Aman S chill also you can probably turn those off like how you'd silence your phone anyway lol,"
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cZ9T2Qt6L3,Yeah I don't think cases will be an issue for this phone long as they have cutouts for the LED strips.
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYv4HM2_tv,Transparent case :)
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYQiHNB1mj,"Very true. Our phones go through many bumps and scraped daily, it is hard to use them without a screen protector and case. These can be changed as needed."
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYJFQxVSG-,man use border case
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYI2fAuH3R,@Dash Lups yeah people on here are commenting as if transparent rubber cases are not yet invented. Duhhhh...
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYHCUW3oiA,get a clear case then
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYH0KcCIYT,Just get a clear case
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYGxgO664H,Clear phone case
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYGNMEWdwj,@Aman S ur right but u can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs still cool especially with the possibilities u can do with the gimmicks but still ultimately a gimmick
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYG9v2unQC,@craeeg now that's brilliant
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYFU_6UJZL,RhinoShield easy Meal
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYFRPA5W0e,I'm pretty sure cases made for this phone will have the appropriate cut outs to show the LEDs.
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYEiJ4W0gg,"@Aman S yeah, right. Personally, I won't buy the phone for light either but I'm just saying that when or if Apple will do this then people won't consider it awkward and instead they'll accept it because it's Apple product. So people's mentality of anything that's not made by Apple at workplace is unprofessional will change with time. They have that kind of influence of people. And nothing is aiming to challenge Apple."
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYDvBQfUWk,Just use a transparent case lmfao
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYDumeBlNN,"@Karan Bhogle this lighting thing is now new, chinese brands had it from the starting and it looked really ugly. There's no innovation in this"
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYDiYQ4Vfy,"@Aman S What _would_ you rather then? I think there's a certain novelty with a practical use case, having all of those LEDs as an impromptu ring light (as mentioned in the video) and for personalized ringtone selections where _only you_ knows who's calling, without needing to sink any more money into a smartwatch. But you do you fam."
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYDT_A_omM,Its a main feature case makers would just be wasting their time covering it
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYD-heQouy,Use a bumper case like the iPhone 5/5S
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYC37-s-n-,"‚Äã@Aman S if Apple would've done it then people wouldn't have minded it as ""unprofessional and unimpressive"". Just the way people hated twin horizontal cameras on iPhone 7 plus, notch in iPhone X and triple cameras on 11 Pro. But again, Nothing is not Apple with loyal customer base. Enthusiasts will try this phone anyway. I liked the overall idea of light in the back of the phone though."
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYBqZw5xJM,@Aman S bro u need to chill lmao its not targeted for everyone and I would say its pretty cool
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYBdaN4ul1,"Why not tempered glass for the back instead? The sides can handle some bumps. It's a tool, not an artpiece."
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYB2q7hJwV,Me and my wife have had Rhinoshield bumper cases on our iphones for 2 years without a crack and we have young kids that constantly take our phones and drop them.  The bumper case would work and look great on this phone.
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYAxcrKqTQ,"What kind of cover are you trying to use to cover that? It's like saying ""nice camera design, but I use cover on the phone. Too bad"". It doesn't hide it dumbo, even if it does, buy the one which doesn't"
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYAlfLAuI6,@craeeg it'll ruin the fun. But i don't think ugly leds is a good reason to buy this phone. It's unprofessional and unimpressive. Imagine glowing goddamn lights from phone at workplace
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cYA26DJSVr,Transparent cases are a thing and specially with this phone
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cY99wHiPO0,ringke case will do just fine :)
Ugx_IXVgdzUiORx4HP14AaABAg.9cY7Z_u6HIX9cY8dDx9_lO,Bumper cause or case with cutouts will look neat
Ugw74LYiFblRLaGJLY54AaABAg,Anyone got the Oneplus reference?
UgyHc_vGHxVupt_e7Mp4AaABAg,"I dont get why they basically revealed the phone already ... of course they want to create hype, but there will be nothing left to show on the final reveal ... Its like hey this is our new phone 1 and the crowd goes boooh we already know, BECAUSE YOU ALREADY TEASED IS FOR 5 MONTHS STRAIGHT. Why not come out with big boom without teasing too much?"
UgyT69zqbd7bcsSWVMN4AaABAg,"Wait, but you just have shown front of it as well 2:26"
Ugw4dMZAEdutkvVB-9t4AaABAg,"Finally! A genuine competitor in the Smartphone market. From the perspective of buyer, Smartphones have been changing 0.1% of it every year in the last 4-5 years. I think a genuine competitor will increase this number in the future."
UgynUO0eZctFBSg_ftZ4AaABAg,Main issue with such startups that they became oneplus. First releases are cool but then just regular low-mid chinaphone.
UgzSo_bcGQJi7pPuoZ54AaABAg,I know you will review this Nothing phone. üòè
UgwwgZg-ypsjzh-mDR54AaABAg,Loved that ending
UgzY3OkafWjOqqvItCp4AaABAg,"If back glass is only sticking in borders 
Then back glass gona shatter"
UgzdGP9B4a4vc3fIVjR4AaABAg,I'll keep this in the pocket with my Fire Phone.
UgziwsHHC2C4M5Q4GzJ4AaABAg,"the phone looks amazing. all thats left is software, battery life + charging speed, cameras, specs and price. especially the price..... because we have a history woth flagship killers becoming the flagship.."
Ugw0hQWvc1EH9SGEFYJ4AaABAg,Finally something differentüòçüéâ‚Ä¶.reminds me of my first camera phone the Nokia 3220üòÉ
Ugz0EP5l0SsXeRYazb94AaABAg,I really hope they take the right steps to grow their company. I would hate to see them fail and disappear into nothing.
Ugwz-jhxz13jgVZd_DF4AaABAg,It‚Äôs cool and all‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs nothing that I can‚Äôt live without üòÜ
UgwKkeF7LUQVDBl4o-N4AaABAg,"too bad it costs $1,698"
Ugxg2weuS_WTfU_3NfF4AaABAg,If it ends like that Essential phone you reviewed long time ago then this story doesn't have a happy ending.
Ugw8DeFe00W5TLUx4H54AaABAg,the idea is super cool. but completely useless.
UgwdZe4v7Uk2sAaJfXJ4AaABAg,Awesome üíö
UgyHl4GPPaOXwxPFK1R4AaABAg,Looks like a really cool phone. Just hope that the processor and OS don't lag over time like the regular mid-range android phones.
UgwwIk_d4NErbp0bXHh4AaABAg,"Helo
A72  or Iphone 12  
What do you think ??"
Ugza2x0FfW3zhyFBf6t4AaABAg,That‚Äôs literally a iphone with a see through classüíÄ
UgzxadnEYTZ04DH7h1R4AaABAg,"that light thing has already been done 10 years ago by Nokia 3220. it had lights which danced with ringtones. and by by phone cases... with those lights at the back, you won't be able to use cheap bac cases."
UgwbbZfAP2ARhafPcRh4AaABAg,"How much ,"
UgwgzGAP_-bGA-302vJ4AaABAg,"Man i really wish there will be a matte black with yellow led variant. It will literally be my dream phone. Still skeptical about specs and price. If they are fair about that, I will sure buy it"
UgxBnS9yOJ221Qiu9I94AaABAg,"I'm for sure buying one. Looks unique, symmetrical bezels, and cool features. Easy buy."
UgwEZ4FSlK98lR4Fm_x4AaABAg,You can flip and check your phone's battery btw
UgwrzGgTI_zeGkfjbN14AaABAg,"I love it, and would definitely buy it"
UgwVdeLj1z92IjtknQN4AaABAg,"Welp this is deffo not for people who use phone cases, unless you use those crappy transparent acrylic ones."
Ugx9m-TmML_pNu2gtjR4AaABAg,I noticed the yellow cable whether it's the charging cable of nothing as red in oneplus
UgyNXySJ4S9mDvvg3j14AaABAg,"It looks good on the outside, we'll see on the inside how it is."
UgyFXF84QihVmu2rX8F4AaABAg,One Plus about to have a heart attack in the indian market. ü§£ü§£ü§£
Ugwd73gvgbve-_687w14AaABAg,We don't want looks tbh we want performance at reasonable price!
UgyAyiC1t-30wmfRhSp4AaABAg,Are icons packs / themes safe to install (on iPhone)? Which is best in your opinion?
UgxVSZpZ4O1woPAlEcl4AaABAg,6:30
Ugw4WIYj8iU265ITGjx4AaABAg,does anyone know if nothin is coming to the US?
Ugwt8S0t2TuG2YqC0tF4AaABAg,Oneplus got burned at the end!
UgxS8KhRMKjdSQzZ6Ul4AaABAg,"Honestly the phone itself from the shape is an iPhone with the rounded corners and flat sides. Front isn't anything different and the camera setup looks like what the iPhone 11 pro or whatever looked like.
So the back can light up, just another thing that can break faster or have an issue...I'm not even remotely interested in this company because it reeks of typically Silicon Valley startup culture of trying to hype, build quick market share and then deliver a mediocre product and vanish soon after."
UgwrLWMk_qR-e1ywVSp4AaABAg,Alien üëΩ Phone üî•
UgxnwZZOnh3Z-gS8TVR4AaABAg,Some one giving reference to one plus i think nothing will become new one plus beacuse one plus now become oppo phones that is bad üòû
UgytAzIoWulafXS0U3J4AaABAg,Broadly Appealing!
UgzQYMoItW0VxTqflsR4AaABAg,"Kinda bummed by the screen as i expected the punch hole to be in the middle, this might even make me pass on it altogether. But somehow if i get over it, I'd go for it only if they focus on security and gaurantee atleast 4 android version updates. I know it's kind of a big thing to expect, but it's their only phone and lets not act like it is a small company which lacks funding."
UgxG3MZ2DemrHvpt1V94AaABAg,Am I the only one who remembered that he wasn't allowed to show the front of the phone? Am I missing something?
UgxobbL6Wwy0Ifl7CYd4AaABAg,I am really digging the design.
UgxobbL6Wwy0Ifl7CYd4AaABAg.9cY7Peqjoqu9cYeqhlpp0w,"Same here, Mirror‚Äôs Edge vibes. Love the white cyberpunk look."
UgxobbL6Wwy0Ifl7CYd4AaABAg.9cY7Peqjoqu9cYDC8VAJNg,I feel like It's Nothing special
UgxobbL6Wwy0Ifl7CYd4AaABAg.9cY7Peqjoqu9cYAFnyGAl3,You already know apple is tryng to copy this phone and make it damn sure that it will be hard to repair and will cost an ungodly amount.
UgxobbL6Wwy0Ifl7CYd4AaABAg.9cY7Peqjoqu9cY9OEz5lHx,So does Apple.
Ugx7KZm1XhWB9wS_-Bp4AaABAg,"Damn, this looks cool. I always liked the iphone square design which this has, but Im an android fan."
UgyFuR5foGJDkwzc0-54AaABAg,"if it has the following
1. wide angle camera
2. ip68
3. dual sim and nfc
4. decent battary with 25w charging
5. atleast 90hz amoled
then yah happy to pay $1000 for it."
UgxJjbCm5vtREd_fylp4AaABAg,if they add as much customisation as i hope they will i will become a nothing loyalist
UgznauUC6FWg-ox6b7B4AaABAg,CRAZY!
UgzsPxtNBGJrLl4k1eV4AaABAg,honestly looks very nice love the flat screen and squared edges.Potential for my favorite looking android
UgzN3jiiA_sy4W4FZm54AaABAg,Sorry Nothing is not for me. Glyph Interface is just a gimmick. A screen can do just exactly what it intends to do. What point in all seriousness?
Ugz-CunSWlZr3zgbx954AaABAg,Nope.
UgxevRK7M7JicqlMjVV4AaABAg,"Okay, so where is it?"
UgxjuU1CNQQErzSzDyR4AaABAg,"""Sounds Familiar?""üòÇüëç"

Ugw0992taFhrIunXFyN4AaABAg,Nothing phone 1 looks totally DOPE.
UgySw35bCHsDDN5oX9x4AaABAg,I need a new phone but don't know what to buy. I want micro SD slot with latest snapdragon and a high refresh rate... but nothing has those 3 things.
UgyXX6VNP4bpsNgq_x14AaABAg,Imagine recording videos in public üíÄ
UgxAhyyqJ98XIfaB8ip4AaABAg,"Nothing: hey Apple, can I copy your phone design

Nothing: gotcha‚Ä¶"
UgwTQvZI83Fj57ELhcF4AaABAg,Keren ancrit
UgzpbXEV5BKWu5uU5J54AaABAg,I've been waiting for this one
Ugzi-g5hBGAiGcNIYEl4AaABAg,If they provide us smth like OP3 and 3T in today's standards - I'm OK with that. If they just gonna bait us with lights - not 80s anymore!
UgxQzVetNUKetVfeEp14AaABAg,:):
UgwttJZ8O2IZOZ_rf0x4AaABAg,"kinda meh, essential phone was more exciting for sure."
Ugz5K0LTrRKkIfAv7Zd4AaABAg,I thought you said ü§î you could NOT show the front of the phone I'm so confused right now üòê
Ugz_9WuQBldNhLvtXId4AaABAg,Looks really cool
UgzxtN3D5iuesP582ZV4AaABAg,It's really sad that only new companies are trying new stuff... Cause yeah I would love that back panel... But on my Samsung Note 9.
UgzWFvDrMEqFNMe27IZ4AaABAg,I am excited about the camera performance!
UgxBR68B9l72iokORUh4AaABAg,"Nothing has refined what Dope Tech means from smartphone view! This being the first phone from Nothing, i am EXCITED to see where Carl is heading with the company. Especially, when he has now free hands and UI knowledge!"
Ugwbu51eejFGFyVTsaJ4AaABAg,"if the software of this phone is really good, then I am absolutely getting one. I really hope I am not disappointed"
Ugwbu51eejFGFyVTsaJ4AaABAg.9cY7FMx3Akw9cY8dlL0kII,@Fantasytky üòÇplease no

UgyAzHyzg5_Ctf6ZEGJ4AaABAg,"""I'm only allowed to show you the back of the phone""... *Proceeds to go into the notification led settings showing the front*"
UgxUmJGdVGhItRf6E454AaABAg,I use case for my phone.. I guess without transparent case those LED will be nothing useful! Hopefully it won't put s dent on battery!
UgxoqLJL9NTAjUZgEah4AaABAg,üî•
Ugxo-zJnpzrr4zs-rhh4AaABAg,"6:32 Carl Pei co-founded OnePlus.... But now as OnePlus isn't 'OnePlus' anymore,
So here with this Nothing Phone we can hope Carl Pei can bring little bit of the OG OnePlus level shit back in the game."
UgzYzH8CJBw4osLHy4p4AaABAg,"I feel it's just a phone with some LED on the back. Like LED on back of  ROG lap. 
But anyway it's cool üòé"
UgyMIzffmhpCU-hvl5p4AaABAg,I get that you don't want to be the last tech cannel covering something but didnt MKBHD make a huge stink about embargo and marketing phones as an extended advertiser. Hes literally just a part of the hype machine now to help them sell their crappy phone on stockX
UgyMIzffmhpCU-hvl5p4AaABAg.9cY7DPPTZ8f9cY7OxeVDde,also this iphone clone sucks.
Ugxk9vM6Dp6TCLYJxE94AaABAg,"if it works as smooth and good as a pixel, I'm interested"
UgxOvBW-LcEiLNXtKZN4AaABAg,You also showed the front of the phone. As long as is has tiny punch hole and a good camera in back I am down for getting it.
UgweiW0m08i2K1g_ldh4AaABAg,BUT people wants a good camera and a good performing phone.
UgxEiMvHQ3X0T3gLi_B4AaABAg,Brilliant phone. Horrid ringtones!
Ugzc7ItRiF03SJ1qiiR4AaABAg,.... or you could just place the phone with the screen NOT touching the table and just see who's calling you while on mute...
UgxxlpWXpMLWkMxiqRF4AaABAg,Seams ideal for people I do not care to know...
UgxDgRXmLmceNOuVSDZ4AaABAg,I feel like that a phone from Star Wars
Ugx8B54cx27IuQtzkWh4AaABAg,what is the size of this phone ? i hope ~6 and not bigger
UgwpAlJd71yWlVW3w5t4AaABAg,"At first I thought that they have interesting features but kinda meh, until i saw they collaboration skins‚Ä¶..oh my‚Ä¶."
UgzX9ub9ztfpyI-X1WR4AaABAg,Not something that reinvents the industry as they promised. It's just an Android phone with some gimmiky. Looks cool although it's not that much impressive. I got more excited for the Ear (1) than that.
UgzPd48SuWBu_7xry454AaABAg,"Pretty cool,"
UgxuYAgtgQjq3vBR5rl4AaABAg,"TLDW: Cool phone bruh, hope you don't become the next OnePlus!"
Ugxo18Intv3iYktY5FZ4AaABAg,I guess the ‚Äúnothing‚Äù stands for how much battery you will have left after those led‚Äôs go off all day with your notifications.
Ugxc6cq4t1kORCFUuyt4AaABAg,"""Sounds familiar"" ü§£ OnePlus silently watching this üòù"

UgxHdfuC-g2xtAtrOtp4AaABAg,this phone is just the fantasy for Indian technical YouTubers... hope they get it by August
Ugxd6txM4AqNS6Y0ABt4AaABAg,Actually a cool concept. Notification LEDs are super nice to have.
Ugwp-n9EgyPgpj9xNxZ4AaABAg,"My phone has these light patterns as well, allowing me to see who's calling. It even is customisable with a light pattern that matches their faces, called a photograph. And then the other light patterns write their name. ON THE FRONT."
Ugy-13Cvy-qOAHCJptd4AaABAg,"The idea of such back LED indication is dope, but the implementation is really weird. It looks really messy with all that entrails stuff under the transparent cover. The image the LEDs form doesn't look iconic or even stylish, hence it can't become a popular trend. Some balanced and appealing pattern would be more appreciated. And the entire iPhone-ish design also doesn't get additional points for the product."
UgwQNuqIyUfs8GEMYFp4AaABAg,Meh. It‚Äôs nothing.
UgzubYjJRCYNUpfrfkJ4AaABAg,Processor?
Ugw0sLDmVFd7M56KR9V4AaABAg,they are not allowed to test camera and hardware
UgyuxFZcV5SLYK8Eatt4AaABAg,nothing 2 c here üòÄ
UgzMWqZHX_N6IDlKsxR4AaABAg,So many features on the phone face down where ppl are so used to putting their phone face up on the table now.. not sure how appealing it will be in the long run..
UgwqbJI18EbtPfqBN4F4AaABAg,"Well, as an iOS user and Apple fan I have to say that this is probably the only Android phone I really would like to use at least for some time.
It is very clear for me that this design is heavily inspired by Apple, yet, it distinct enough to actually earn my attention.
All other phone look like a toy to me, but this one is a real product."
UgxlKZHSKN94NkRTQBl4AaABAg,More ways to get notifications from my phone is definitely something I don‚Äôt want so not for me. Still looks cool tho
UgwmYP6L2nTIiXPLDMB4AaABAg,"I always missed led feature on the front when this no bezel smartphone era begin.
But seems like this is the most perfect alternative to that."
UgwmYP6L2nTIiXPLDMB4AaABAg.9cY73js3ywu9cYC_Y1VXSi,"Problem with this one I see is that *hopefully* nobody puts their phone down on it's screen without a case as that'd make the screen full of scratches in no time, but a case would also cover the cool back..."
UgwmYP6L2nTIiXPLDMB4AaABAg.9cY73js3ywu9cYBpSPUs1I,true it was satisfying to know many details even when screen is off

Ugz8P4nvdpsu21ePFIR4AaABAg,"It's a little bit ""different"" but they're not bringing anything that's changing the game, but the ring tone thing is kinda neat and who doesn't like transparent phones? I imagine theirs some people don't but more probably do than don't but is it enough to make a little money? Who knows, the phone market is a tough one, but I'd buy it if it was priced 500 or lower, so yeah, I don't see one in my futureü§£üòÇ"

UgyI3gF5hizYr-ejgpd4AaABAg,That's some real cool shit right there..!
Ugzepjzp0TnjklR-lxh4AaABAg,You can tell who is calling just by memorizing the pattern and looking at the back of the phone‚Ä¶how about i look at the front and see their name?

Ugz0L7PEee3lhiGV8MR4AaABAg,The strategy is similar to what OnePlus started with. It's good that they only inspired the back of the phone with the iPhone. It would have been sad if they would have put in the big notch on the front. Can't imagine an Android phone with a big notch in 2022 üòÇ
UgxptnVeXoPhAlS1znh4AaABAg,"Who puts their phone screen-down?
Light patterns are cool and all and can pass different kind of messages depending on how they flash in whatever patterns but this really is nothing but a gimmick.
What easily beats it is the actual phone's screen.
It can fit a lot more information in the same space.
Do you want to know who's calling you? Look at the screen.
Do you want to know the battery charging progress? Look at the screen.
The only real advantage of the lights on the back is for use with the camera."
UgyDYXaykTH2x4clzEV4AaABAg,I feel like i would get bullies for having this phone

UgyR4bQ9bQXhnC7TTQ94AaABAg,"But honestly I've never seen a person who puts their phone screen down/back side up and an always on display in the front would give the user more options and customisability over these gimmicky LEDs.Unless it has a really great camera and the LEDs get bright enough for vlogging, this doesn't make any sense. Besides, I don't want my phone flashing bright lights when I'm asleep."

UgxOZUKV0-Ab8A3ujfB4AaABAg,"when you mentioned about the broadly appealing strategy, thats what samsung did. i have been using 4-5 generations of galaxy notes and i have to say, samsung screwed it up. from cancelling the note serious entirely and rebrand it under the galaxy S series is just weak. and they took away the charging brick and the memory card slot for all the new phones. not only samsung did it, but other android phone makers as well. it really pains to see when most android users used android phones because we wanted more customizable features and things that iphones doesnt give you directly, and now the vast majority of new android phones are basically ripped off apple's marketing strategy. if this nothing phone builds up completely from what android phones were in the first place - being different, they can have my money any time of the day."

Ugyj5Mo7b35w1x04HGR4AaABAg,"Wow this looks really fresh..don't know why people are complaining that its design is similar to apple, there is nothing wrong in taking good features from your competitors and implement it with some different and unique features...even Apple may have taken so many ideas and features from Android and other brands  but does that mean it's copying others. Really hope  Nothing have nailed all other important  features or else the hype will not be worth it!"

It is targeted towards mid range segment and the expectation should also be what you'd expect from a mid range phone. It will have a snapdragon 7 Gen 1, and if they price it right with keeping the software as stock as OxygenOS and no bloatware, it would definitely attract people."
UgypoU2viR60JMlL1r54AaABAg,Not gonna lie this is a big move by carl pei in exposing his ideas.  Very cool idea on ringtone and charging led notification. What left to oneplus then?

1. Who places their phone face down while charging? And do you really want to wiggle it with the screen against your desk?

2. The people who put their phone face down on the desk are usually people who want to clearly signal that they will NOT be distracted by anything on their phone right now -- calls, messages, whatever. Why are those LEDs there again?

3. You know there's another way to know exactly who is calling you? Yeah, you put your phone face-up and you see your contact's name and picture when the phone rings."

In some ways I think Carl Pei has the right spirit about his Nothing brand but tbh I think he's all talk no action. The Phone (1) back cover is pretty good and interesting, I love the boxy iPhone-like look of the bezel but a phone is much more than that, most of it is about the software and in case of Android Phones, the amount of time they bring updates and (security updates) is very important, in fact, it's the most important thing for me. So we'll see what happens, but I don't expect too much from nothing."

Also I‚Äôm thinking with the motion to bring the charging battery LED back on, you wiggle the phone, I‚Äôm thinking that could cause some scratching on the screen over time.

You said it right, it‚Äôs a product to attract customers at first and then later on things will change. 

Hope they make good quality phones and we get an option to choose from, apart from samsung or one plus. 

Although it‚Äôs a nice step to choose iphone 12 looking design, still from sides and all it looks neat and clean, thankfully they didn‚Äôt make it like Tesla did with cyber truck.

UgzMZAGLx7PC1LkvVil4AaABAg,"I know that almost all phones look the same from the front but I like the fact that Nothing Phone has the hole punch camera in the corner and not in the centre as it will fade in the peripheral vision, and I think the back design looks good‚ò∫"

UgyhaixqvGAfCa8L6gB4AaABAg,"Damn it's dope! People gave too much flac on the UI but now it all looks cohesive and still, pretty clean."
UgxcItW0V4BkIYUvIm54AaABAg,"Not bothered about the led strips lighting up for notifications as I don't ever place my phone front side down. As you could accidentally scratch the glass off something on the table etc.

Much more intrigued with the Led strips acting as a camera flash. I had even replied to Carl Pei on Instagram a few days ago. Asking if the curved led strip would be used as a led ring flash üì∏ 

Turns out I was correct!"
UgxcItW0V4BkIYUvIm54AaABAg.9cY57HEdfDY9cYCPEvanWW,"The strip on the back is too small to be an effective ring flash, so who cares?"

UgwZKd2y5plYWv8tGZp4AaABAg,I would love it if the corner or bottom LEDs light up when i get a notification and NOT the whole LED back panel thingy. Hope it could be done through software update.

UgzU-CtLJ7z-I_U6fgp4AaABAg,"This phone looks really cool to me. Always is nice to see some company trying new things, giving a bit more of a niche package for people that just get bored of the regular Apples and Samsungs. I'm pretty sure that as you say in the video, if Nothing is a success they will lean into broader appeal, but that's a problem for the future. Hopefully then, some other company is bold enough to shake things up, as Nothing has done now. As long as the phone is functional and doesn't have glaring issues, I'm willing to give it a shot just for the awesome look!"

UgxsNjt1spzSTEjynxt4AaABAg,Those ringtones are actually horrible
UgwhB7oBtZOWfoKvUaJ4AaABAg,"It looks cool and has definitely generated interest, but the software experience is going to make it break this nothing phone imo. If it‚Äôs glitchy and buggy or the screen is really dim or it quickly overheats and throttles or charges slowly (I can‚Äôt imagine it having long battery life with all those lights) etc then the first purchasing wave will be the only purchasing wave."
UgzfybahZRYXrkBYOrl4AaABAg,Ugly... No headphone jack no buy. Another phone hardware startup that'll disappear after the first generation.

I hope the OS is good and usable, and if so, that is a success"

UgyJg5qaMM_F8VN1Pzd4AaABAg,If nothing really wanted to speak to a niche market they would start with a foldable.

Ugwep9SKt7Jcp95nXvl4AaABAg,"I was so ready to clown this phone for looking like an iPhone 12 but honestly, that LED array on the back has sold me. It so freaking cool and seems genuinely useful, with manufacturers ditching LED notification lights years ago"

UgwnstD7Aih2mrWd0Md4AaABAg,I am shocked at the enthusiasm over this.  it's an iPhone clone with lights on the back.  Who keeps their phone face down that much to make this useful?   Always on display made notification LEDs obsolete a long time ago.

UgwRvVO2jcBGnWH3j1J4AaABAg,"I came here thinking It was going to be a basic phone with some design on the back for people who like design. Boy was I wrong. Lights on the back of the phone like this seems so right! I dont know if theyre going to be like the new LG who makes crazy new stuff that other companiss pick up on because it just makes sense, or if theyll actually be able to compete!"
UgxgIjMONwYeoc2Pr2N4AaABAg,"Bias
It doesn't look different, it's an iphone with a cover on the back
About the LED? I call it a gimmick
Others can do the same with always on display on AMOLED screen if they want to.
Check your Samsung, it does it already.

Who put his phone on that side when charging it? Who put his phone on that side to rest on the desk?
You will end up always having to flip your phone for each and all of your notifications, such a hassle...

Get an iPhone or a Samsung and forget this one, try again OnePlus- I mean Nothing"
Ugz6GV6PwlqRGW5sGkl4AaABAg,I guess you could almost say that Nothing phone looks and acts like Nothing we‚Äôve seen before‚Ä¶‚Ä¶get it? Okay I‚Äôll find my way out

UgxYjFfcJL9ZeYPwi4p4AaABAg,"Meh, just another gargantuan 6.5 inch phone :("
UgyrKV0LvXru6lUZKUJ4AaABAg,You could just have said OnePlus and not sound familiar

Ugx2l2HH1kZTTLOsD-V4AaABAg,The LED feature is a great stuff out of the box but I personally didn't like the so called transparent back and am more into a matte or glass back with a premium colour in a premium phone
UgzdXFYIOATOh2vKqCl4AaABAg,will wait for black color cuz those backlight is gonna look dope in black panel
Ugxb9MlicYRziy70jTp4AaABAg,Reminds me of a step up from the HTC front dot case that came out a while back.

UgymZgAd0XoJWvYN7PR4AaABAg,üëéüèΩ
UgxP_w3ufeAfWVaHJ4Z4AaABAg,"In my opinion it should have 3 cameras. That makes or breaks the deal for me. Besides clean, un-bloated, fast and optimized software. Then again, in a market where everything is saturated with the same cameras, this would be their opportunity to shine. Apple does it, why is there no Android phone with that setup? 3 cameras, all having the same resolution but different lenses (wide, ultra wide and tele, the golden trio). Any Android i buy has BIG numbers like 108MP and such, pixel binned from 12MP. And the other cameras are added just to suck to say they have 3. Like how many times was it the case where the main camera is the best, and the zoom or wide sucked. Apple's camera doesn't suck like that. Shouldn't it be time Android stepped up it's game?"
UgzeMjYl-AW0A5_b8Y94AaABAg,"lmao, that closing thought reminded me of that ‚ÄúEnthusiast brands will betray you‚Äù you video, which i highly recommend anyone to watch."

Ugyqsfuf9YJIYT-ji8p4AaABAg,"So basically we have yet another small, agile, creative anti Apple company, and use their market position as an excuse for every uncomfortable question what might come up. Just to betray the original fan base few years later. Khmmm 1+"

UgwEdnJ0YCQJzgFiB614AaABAg,"Given it's primarily ran by Carl Pei, NOTHING is on their way to be what OnePlus once was. Kinda reminds me how OnePlus started with CyanogenMod, for the niche market of power-users. Only if they stick to their demeanor through and through, unlike the mess, that OnePlus has been since the past 2 years. Very intrigued to see the road these guys take. Also, I'd definitely switch out my phone for this, if it comes with a decent SOC and a great software support."

UgxqscVTxNN-On1x2dN4AaABAg,Sounds familiar.
UgwOLs22GwetkutqTDZ4AaABAg,"Leds are nice, wish they got an Android instead of iphone looks, it looks nice anyway, curious to see the full review and if the leds take too much on batery"
UgxrxJgla6TsPl76-4x4AaABAg,Gonna be interesting to see how third parties make cases for this phone
UgzFh334fyrhgAb0abt4AaABAg,"All that just to put a case over it. And yes, I know a clear case will prob be ideal, but those get scratched up pretty quickly. Cool idea though, I like the phone but I still wouldn‚Äôt switch from Apple. Not just yet."
UgxKBR9z91gRmRCSv6F4AaABAg,"It‚Äôs one thing for the phone to look interesting but the software needs to bring something new as well. 

So is there room for a non-Apple & non-Andriod OS? I feel someone needs to break away from these two OS and create something open source."
UgxpqkNk_GpaiYSasad4AaABAg,It's not going to make it for the backpannel lights üòï it's different but it is not going  to make it. It looks odd but not unique. Bt without the backlights it's dope.
Ugy1b-kbsTZPMjtJAep4AaABAg,I'd definitely buy that!
Ugzz9WXDPHZVEl-donl4AaABAg,"nothing new, nothing done, nothing special, and nothing worth buying."
UgzGU7vSlpBgD4LvSFl4AaABAg,i feel this phone will be on my hands pretty soon... looking so great having taht iphone finally kinda looking borders in hand of android. i mean when we see what is gonna be the software inside we will see if its amazing or not but for now seeing that iphone body and frames with android in is for sure coooool and we need to see it
UgxoUqSZQAd_CWyF5Ax4AaABAg,Excited to see where they go! Hopefully this doesn't bomb like the hydrogen! I was so excited for that one and it was such a fail lol
UgzIvLmVkHY_p4ubjlx4AaABAg,Sound familiar??? Hahahaha

UgzwG6Sg7E8kIevH6e14AaABAg,"If it comes with stock android or the old school oxygen OS, or even lineageOS, with google camera .. with software support - then I'm sold."
UgzDjjvXdt54SvHW_DB4AaABAg,Give it a black and white cyber punk ui and I am sold

UgzhxsgiGWJ3Du40wdZ4AaABAg,It looks like a copy of an iphone with bazaar like features. It seems gimmicky to me.
UgzQw7nDe0ILBPDM-KV4AaABAg,"fairly unique approach. if the phone's battery life, overall performance and display are fair enough then I would love to own one."
UgzwUIKXVeiIoJWeAGB4AaABAg,This is such a dope phone. Damnnn. Every cyberpunks dream
UgxnBWQma459akdYK1B4AaABAg,You can't use cover üòï
Ugw1Cay-yidobijE_e14AaABAg,"Yeah if this doesn't come with a clear case out of the box that is optimized for it, it's... well... useless."

UgxhC52k3m8KV1L-4N14AaABAg,I would say NOTHING Looks good here!!
UgzwDA0W0BjGLTgbejZ4AaABAg,"The lights on the back look awesome. Reminds me of my old Sony Ericsson flip and slider phones that had similar effects on the sides. I don't think this is gonna pull me away from the Note (or I guess now the S22), but if the price to power ratio is right, then they certainly have my attention"
UgzkfR9Dr-XgmI2HIPN4AaABAg,This phone looks straight out of tron and that has me excited
UgxfkO18yazbWrRdRK94AaABAg,Do people generally keep their phones facedown all the time ? ü§î
UgzzNdmQ537i3_uoy6Z4AaABAg,One and done like the Essential PH1...good phone tho.
UgxqaRooZaywyMFuXDl4AaABAg,"Great gimmick and phone overall looks pretty good. Means nothing though until we know the full specs of this thing, price and software experience etc."
Ugza6JGp1Jbe1nY_PRh4AaABAg,6:03 That's 1+ he's talking about XD
UgyF9zrUh4ixzcGxVUF4AaABAg,But normally you use a case for a phone‚Ä¶
Ugx8x433ZqR81AYGzLl4AaABAg,That led on the back literally looks like an apple. And btw why on earth do you need led lights when basically the entire front screen is a huge led notification. This is just pointless and a gimmick
UgxeiPSVZDkjiHvk-Px4AaABAg,I buy would buy over iphone
UgxC2UdNKGcZpWtCdY94AaABAg,The Ringtones are so sick!!
UgzjOUxuO75v7N0PzLl4AaABAg,Lmao I love that shot MKBHD took at OnePlus at the end

Ugyty7JDHdV4nTvYtUN4AaABAg,"I Love square phones so they already got me with the design, and the back gimmick is a good addition. Will see specs and price, but this one is on my next phone list."
Ugyty7JDHdV4nTvYtUN4AaABAg.9cY3nasEp_x9cYFVLqwQEJ,I'll buy it even if it is priced at a price point close to Apple 14 pro Max....
Ugy5_6FIyKGd_oYhVPl4AaABAg,If it ruins iOS I‚Äôll buy it
Ugwi557GUo97jbFMn6p4AaABAg,"All these unique features are just gimmicks, i don't see any practical real use for these so called extra unique features. 
Heck, I am not buying a phone for some LED light shows. I need real features that are useful. 

Sorry, not convinced."

Ugya6a0v2wBXElB5LSV4AaABAg,abandoned original fanbase ü§£ü§£ you killed it man
UgwW12AYep0k6M_bPHB4AaABAg,The question is what is the SAR value of the phone for body and head?
UgyOIHZ9kkTcvHxHiAJ4AaABAg,Ear one earbuds still super buggy. I cannot imagine solid software on this phone.
UgzRCKodSne7CuZXsnJ4AaABAg,"A video all about lights, on a white Background??? Imagine the same video in a much darker room."
UgyWUdiknbDJXNmUfFN4AaABAg,03:59 Nice! Either you have two review units or this is some lowkey smooth editing. I'm betting it's the latter! :D
UgyWUdiknbDJXNmUfFN4AaABAg.9cY3k8llhjy9cY9DsRaM_N,"@Shon John V. Yup, and you can see his hand move slightly between different ring tone selections. Very impressive though."
UgyWUdiknbDJXNmUfFN4AaABAg.9cY3k8llhjy9cY6S6HcigI,It's edited. You can see it clearly when be flips the phone on the right. The edge cuts off.
UgyCw_BG7PYGsYSZOBh4AaABAg,"That side by side phone vid was actually one phone shot twice orrrrrrrrrr? another great video as always ... if this had ios id probably get it , it looks sick"
Ugx4A2fOLYKf59wIJvp4AaABAg,"Let's just hope it's better than OnePlus software, it's become awful as of late"
UgxoMUM12tGT8WRs3-14AaABAg,I wish they added a different set of color LED's apart from the default white which could have boosted the brand more. ü§î
UgxOdy_Q-htDNkav5Ft4AaABAg,No way why woyld I buy this phone for what my money is a value of nothing ?

UgxwklFU11wLGjFxq0J4AaABAg,"Interesting Phone
Like is a iPhone 12 but veery different in design, almost if it was maked with the laser machine
But either way it looks soooo cool and weird than the other phones."

UgxUGUfh4N14xpS_6kp4AaABAg,They kinda revealed front of the phone...before launch...üòÇüòÇ
UgyUmCmoA9RdJEIn52l4AaABAg,"I really like the design. I have an Asus ROG phone 5 and I love the giant programmable LED logo on the back of my phone. Unfortunately, this Nothing phone has a hole punch camera in the front so I would never consider it. I honestly have no idea how everyone gets over that. I tried a Galaxy s21 and the hole punch made me hate the screen every time I looked at it. Pop up cameras, flip up cameras, or just a small forehead bezel are all far superior screens."
UgxC8xd2Z_YJ5DoN54d4AaABAg,One of the rarest review wheRE phone never switched on. Classic MKBHD.
UgzjZAu9K2YWcbjrvoh4AaABAg,I bet my left nut they got the lights idea from the Zephyrus G14
Ugz1WV1lyZo2mxu-YJZ4AaABAg,Tbh i was hoping the front will look like s22 this looks like it has a little bit bezelüòî

Ugzzjwtp637tfiWanXd4AaABAg,since this will most probably impossible to buy in local stores in my country (Czechia)  I don't really care. All these niche devices are always being sold only in US.
UgwPzufufsbmwBuhns54AaABAg,This is so genius and different. Love it.

UgyqtbKG7VV_a6bnP7p4AaABAg,"Yooo... Is that an iPhone?? Slapped LED strip and called it revolutionary. The LED lights light up according to the ringtones?? Nah, old brick dumb phone did that before. Just Google it if you people don't believe me. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for this NOTHING phone."

Ugxnaj4_e8jhxHx-8Dt4AaABAg,One Plus shade at the end lol
Ugz2BoTqcW5dBnG5s8J4AaABAg,That's a really nice iPhone........ might get it
UgyC4N1yxBk99ZY-yGB4AaABAg,"Didn't expect this already. I looove how the lights look, but for me it would mostly be a gimmick, since I never place my phone screen down"
UgyC4N1yxBk99ZY-yGB4AaABAg.9cY3ah_3uFq9cY4mdWrJ8o,But maybe you would if you bought one of these?
UgyEzSYFeQtrTfCZTC54AaABAg,Awesome üëè

reminds me of the early sony Xperia series with glowing transparent bottom
you quickly get tired of it and stop using it"
UgyQ2J0ICRCWtRcCki14AaABAg,that did sound very much like oneplus
UgzdAR7InnlSFRFCUY14AaABAg,"This is cool and all, but how successful were those specials editions? I don't think they would have sold all that many phones in total. And those special editions were just skinned versions of regular phones. Nothing is pitching this as their ""regular"" phone. Unless it comes in at a super cheap price point, I don't think this phone is going to do very well."
Ugzeqpk-FmGKeKDvCvR4AaABAg,"Looks impressive. If nothingOS is close to stock, I would buy it in a heartbeat"

UgxKdPjRjpElSkCxgtd4AaABAg,"The whole ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to build hype by not telling you much‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt really work when there‚Äôs a hundred other functionally identical options out there.

Also, if those are the actual ringtones, they all sound incredibly annoying."

Ugz4vg4kfPQc6r-qxdh4AaABAg,"Nothing: NOBODY INNOVATES ANYMORE !!!!!!111
Also Nothing: Look at my led strips glass back breakthrough design that's 90% same with an iPhone 12; and also you cannot show any other feature on the phone while we are at it.

The mental gymnastics needed to market this as something innovative by Marquess is comical."
Ugzqt9GaYEqdDPSHdb94AaABAg,I am only allowed to show you the back of the phone 1:12 also MKBHD 3:40 flipps and shows the interface...
UgxJQb1oJzZmeiidNoN4AaABAg,Their launcher is a mess from what I have heard. If they fix it (the UI) and have a decent camera I will buy it.
UgyVy0mWEa1InKKT4bh4AaABAg,just iphone look with transparent back and without notch
UgySW7LG7vNTX8WQY3N4AaABAg,This is out of the box innovation and will definitely buying this! this start up company will definitely kill all known smart phones out there with their unique features.
UgyYGz7_NZD8XXIsZzh4AaABAg,"Seems like Nothing people are fooling us by revealing its product before its launch...they have revealed quite a chunk of its features, jst wonder what mi8 b left to be revealed on the day of its launch...They might hav planned a bigger surprise n a better product for us"

Ugx73QOuSsm6iw_qkyp4AaABAg,"I think led notifications is one of important feature on a smartphone, but many manufactures missed it."
Ugx73QOuSsm6iw_qkyp4AaABAg.9cY3Te9V6Ji9cYCGvU86vf,@DEATHSTROKE I don't think it is right to call barely 50% of smartphones as ‚Äúmost smartphones‚Äù.
Ugx73QOuSsm6iw_qkyp4AaABAg.9cY3Te9V6Ji9cY80M9N4bD,i think they can easily implement this back with software since most smartphones are OLED. and they can simply light up a small part of the display to mimic the front notifications led
Ugx73QOuSsm6iw_qkyp4AaABAg.9cY3Te9V6Ji9cY7puDt8Xy,I miss it on my samsung S10
UgwNVHZ0OhEk8KAEXz14AaABAg,"How about, the notification lights using an always on display? You‚Äôll have endless possibility to customize the lights and the most important thing is it‚Äôs on the front. You don‚Äôt have to put your phone upside down on the desk and while charging.

The transparent design is insane I gotta admit but all the hype are *nothing* but gimmicks that reminds me too much of nexbit robin and essential phone"
Ugy-Y6ewbAtUywvuRM94AaABAg,Will be an average gimmicky phone.

1. grey (ghost/faded/dead/boring/pale) apple with a limp(d***) stem in the centre
2. surrounded by a glowing, modernised G(oogle)/apple logo mashup (iphone of android, as carl put it)
3. G/apple logo transcending the borders of the phone
4. exclamation mark to punctuate its loud design and energy 
5. 'C' around the 'camera', but perhaps for 'carl' (yes he spells it that way)."

People just want an inexpensive tool that allows them to not have to think too hard about mundane tasks (putting food in your mouth or sending/receiving information).

The lights on the back are like the screen on the back of the Flip3. It's more a gimmick because if it wasn't there, it wouldn't negatively effect my life. 

Now if this new phone folded, had 512/1T of storage (or took a microSD card), and less expensive, it would be mildly interesting."

UgzAgCTguzHmEb8NudF4AaABAg,"At 3:50 the way it lights up it really lights up apple  you have the stem at the top corner the apple body with the bite in the middle 
Have seen other comments I dunno if anyone else caught this nod to apple"
UgyOLuyA6vJ0ybNI9BF4AaABAg,Has it got the LGBT lights?
UgxqEtJjnWC5av9X5o14AaABAg,Such a interesting design I can not decide if I love it or hate it
Ugx8XgwzGjXbp5ud14h4AaABAg,"they sould name this phone as ""star wars"" or ""matrix"" bcuz it kinda came from movies!"
UgygXyf-_jWO0-uebCV4AaABAg,"Wow. Finally something that looks new rather than the usual glass slab.
If the phone doesn't come with compromises, definitely worth a look."
UgxUnLQc8G7ScLWPGtR4AaABAg,Does it come in black?
UgyJHYo7BH6Un-t79314AaABAg,"I will never put my phone's screen on any surface. And then what, you have to wiggle it so show the battery status? Like, wiggle your screen on your table? Yeah sure, either I'll have to change my screen protector each month because of how scratched it will be, or I'll just ruin my screen if I don't use a screen protector (which I don't, because I don't put my phone upside down...)"
UgyVzwYomWWPQldVc3J4AaABAg,Isheep
UgyuEOzLnNcrJ_YuzWd4AaABAg,Nothing's gonna change my love for you~
Ugz3QYjrdOOAvLvOHh94AaABAg,"Been using a OnePlus 7t since 2019, was thinking of shifting to a pixel the moment i get the android 12 oppo update. But I guess now I'll wait for Nothing."
Ugxf6YeSQZ5WrEZgeKR4AaABAg,Would have been better if the lights could change colors!
UgxnSgCLUfou11Jxwnh4AaABAg,"Damn I've been waiting to hear about this product, glad to have the news come from the best tech youtuber"
UgwW6oB3oMTjwpHL5Ed4AaABAg,"Should put ""this phone looks like NOTHING in the market"""
UgycdEECu41t9YagVfN4AaABAg,Ohh. Interesting. We'll see how they'll fair after 2 yrs when I'm ready to buy a new phone.
UgwrhCEHgCsP8QVuoxl4AaABAg,Where is the phone ???? I see Nothing !!!
UgwFkH1TAePTjwXjzmx4AaABAg,It should have been called THE GIMMICK PHONE
Ugw5oI2vk2xHeFGahZl4AaABAg,I love the last attempt at PLEA (Or JAB at) to Oneplus. Lol
UgycITWX8yzjqcAXF2t4AaABAg,What a weird name
UgwepZfOBCvXZYSA4vp4AaABAg,"Like the design just one thing either it need to be though or it needs a hi quality super clear case.
Be cause every modern smartphone is to fragile for my taste. One of the reasons I'm keeping my eye on fairphones(cheap easy to replace spare Parts)"
Ugzjaa1gh3cjxrRRa4h4AaABAg,Interested in what the battery life is gonna look like
Ugx5yyrbJbgorW2pTWd4AaABAg,"Another brand that will go down the OnePlus route? Start by making interesting phones at competitive prices, then slowly kill all innovation, slap on a Chinese ROM and sell close to the price demanded by market leaders?"
UgyKurZzZwZ6YuzXuFp4AaABAg,He showed us front too
UgyrBDe2gjjxsavUTgd4AaABAg,1:12 and 2:23 contradict each other? ü§î
Ugxppl4KWsYu1T1vzQd4AaABAg,so these are the phones which cannot be attached to a protective case.....almost the only hindering factor of this DOPE phone
Ugxd_pZ_T4_kGQ9kfLN4AaABAg,Is there is  black color‚ùì
UgzwDqkXf6mpC99x8-J4AaABAg,I feel absolutely nothing for this phone. You get it? Nothing?
Ugz8en2qHhbtf5AOc594AaABAg,"Definitely something new and different from the competition. I think the more you are into tech, the more likely you are to buy such a phone. NOTHING itself seems like a brand name, especially for the enthusiasts out there while also doing something better than others which would also appeal a regular customer. And since they are not a part of a bigger parent company or anything, also with a cool CEO; I think they will not be totally mainstream and still keep features on their devices that will be for the original fanbase. This phone though, I loved it and can't wait for the other specs and price...!"
UgxtO409NKYCpO-mcoV4AaABAg,"It definitely looks like an iPhone with those metal borders on the case. Otherwise, still interested to learn more about their Android interface."
UgwLW_2ZLBM5N6HrrfV4AaABAg,Bet you it's shite
UgyT7DLJWr8_8aIkR0J4AaABAg,This phone has already shown that it has a practically working and distinct design among all the phones out there. Kudos to the makers.üî•üôå
UgyW6ShEa6jYJZo8c8F4AaABAg,I like the idea of backside led's but I really don't like the shape they chose.
UgwvkHNynIcN2C9sx-R4AaABAg,That ring-tone LED back is an Amazing feature for People with sound impairment ! üíô
UgwpcDvv1KDqdfc9tpB4AaABAg,Does anyone noticed that when he unlocked the phone there is a UNLOCK SYMBOL is slightly higher than usual that might be the finger print sensor PLACEüòç
Ugy1aZmMX6rs9eXHXZ54AaABAg,they took that notifications led thing from Asus M16 üòÇ
UgwDs680E5DJSWKcjHV4AaABAg,Extremely gimmicky for a company that boasts heavily about challenging Apple and the entire phone industry.
Ugzs5HDpqVx-bldLOXB4AaABAg,Shots fired at one plus lol ahahah
UgxC8mz8aQvTcW7gsVh4AaABAg,"What happens when you put a case on the phone and the features on the back effectively become useless? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for innovation, but the true appeal to me is what's happening on the front. I love the look of my S22 Ultra, but I only see the back of my phone for like 1 minute every week while I'm cleaning it. You could use a clear case, but they are just not attractive; They always look so cheap."
UgzkeNP0cYocQwV6FL54AaABAg,Different like iphone xs with few gimmicky led‚Äôs.
UgyINj5cJHbVp0jDmMh4AaABAg,"Glad to see that innovation is not completely dead, but I fear that this will only appeal to a thin sliver of enthusiasts and not be the commercial success they need for their first phone. Here's hoping though. ü§û"
UgzCoXATBsztNMEXzCx4AaABAg,Well... Only the transparency is unique to me... Even the LEDs themselves look like an Apple logo...

UgzdpsOZkZ1CLLPGwZJ4AaABAg,Who is the target audience for these hyped marketing initiatives? The mass?! I doubt if they care or even notice. And nerds like us would follow regardless.
UgzqjFNIvjiMTc8HmKd4AaABAg,What a disappointement
UgwbhaZKUNDgX_V-lNt4AaABAg,But how hot will the back of the phone get?? ü§î With those lights
UgxqB1bjqGiKtmkGog14AaABAg,Dattebayoo üòõ
UgzErtF2wg9OhlA0TIt4AaABAg,Any Naruto fans here?
Ugyq9uP5X87_Xk38O1t4AaABAg,Interesting concept.  You would definitely need a clear case or else it makes no sense.  Price point will be a key factor too.
UgyrzHs9QmWqGXaFt1d4AaABAg,idk man looks like a phone to me
UgxqjE2iILzckxfx0aN4AaABAg,how are those ringtones not annoying? its a good tech product but not something someone will like in general
UgzfOZo2emwKdMEJs4d4AaABAg,"99% of the people I know uses a case, its really looks like a normal android phone"
UgyYlAy1ooBDJA-uIrp4AaABAg,Wow looking first chin removed Android phone
Ugy0hzXLz--7RbhjXbF4AaABAg,I'm ready to go on a OnePlus journey all over again
UgxIxjGDkJt0SyE5kCp4AaABAg,"The real question here is, how long do we keep our phone face down during a normal day?!"
Ugw5beni2BhrLdb7M_B4AaABAg,"Can a better grip, may be shape which fits my grip with curves not a rectangle can be a new things in phones"
Ugxts3wydv_wkesSfh94AaABAg,"Damn, these Robot Ringtones"
Ugz3VrtPgJqV2DB-aYd4AaABAg,It looks cool but to buy it i need to be reasonably cost and good specs. No point if the screen looks like doodoo
Ugw8zq4tUCufdbWQ-J54AaABAg,THIS PHONE!
UgzHRqUiqa-6OypYtpd4AaABAg,Over rated phone. Who cares about a transparent back?? It's just a marketing GIMMICK.
UgzYB9d_VqauBnPSHgh4AaABAg,"Dbrand has left the chat

A good looking design by the way !!!"
UgxAhot8zQcV-vBxPER4AaABAg,This is so cool

UgzTK7j2rhpTw_K0LPd4AaABAg,Love the not so subtle shade at OnePlus üòÇüòÇüòÇ
UgxljmrQ7k_CnX2qApd4AaABAg,I don't even know why notification LED's were dropped. It doesn't have to be all complex like this phone. One simple LED is all that's needed on the front or back of the phone.
UgyhIvP1xDidE7P8uAp4AaABAg,they made cool version of airpods pro now they did with iphone 12
UgxloY7lnFZM8xOGo2N4AaABAg,"This is what no one ask for and not worth the hype , instead of this give toy with phone thats all 
."
Ugxjurv_2sumboDGvUl4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm getting orgasm seeing this phone. This is like the best OnePlus-Apple hybrid design it could ever have been. Just give some aesthetic pastel colours plus Oxygen OS like UI and I‚Äôll buy one for the design itself!! I love my OnePlus, I‚Äôll love this one too.."
UgwbCYIH4BtRJGHS8Pl4AaABAg,Nothing phone 1 üëçüèª
UgxtO_LeveKbTWvfsVl4AaABAg,Looks cool and they make clear cases so it just depends on if it still looks as crisp under a case because I'm not not gonna put a case on an expensive ass phone.
UgwpZBaX_ZSHj196jZh4AaABAg,6:31 sound like Oneplus to me.
UgxpssCxKHVUrLFIkLR4AaABAg,"This is the epitome of a gimmick for the sake of a gimmick. Does it look cool? Sure. I'm still going to prefer having a Spigen case around the phone compared to a few more lights to distract me.

Nothing should be focused on making a non-ugly phone that performs well, has relatively unobtrusive and bloat-free software, has a headphone jack (this would be an actual value-add for most customers), and is priced competitively.

If they're relying on gimmicks like this, then they've already lost me as a potential customer."
UgzVWby5vHgQwx1-8RV4AaABAg,"buy the phone, put a case on it XD"
UgwD52Bh9PTr9pHKrZ94AaABAg,"This phone is actually really cool, out of ordinary without going too crazy like those custom designed Realme phones"
Ugxw7pXjtvioDJeyN_h4AaABAg,Nice bamboo to the one plus
Ugy0H-H_n5s3tDfvbFB4AaABAg,"The backlight setting illuminating the subject of camera sounds cool, but is it worth it? The different patterns of lighting for notifying different things and customizable looks unique, again is it worth it? What genuine problems would this phone solve? I can't seem to understand the whole idea! Unique and being one of a kind is cool but there should be a definitive use case. Do most people keep their phones with back on top? Clearly this light settings would need that!"
UgwQEEaF_fniJhfNyQ54AaABAg,Sound familiar = One Plus :P
UgzdLtP6OmxhFClJ5ZJ4AaABAg,Bro that's a cool custom iPhone 12
UgzH5M0SUr35xq7PqhZ4AaABAg,why can't apple just make a screen like that...
UgxxeNt06cVSiHF4szx4AaABAg,cringe phone...

UgxTc2NSKxEeOxyQCL14AaABAg,It was the NoPhone now it‚Äôs the NothingPhone wired huh ü§î when your friend asks you what phone you are using. What do you say?
UgzxkzCX7NBEYXZ5Yep4AaABAg,If this phone can stand next to my Oneplus 7 Pro. I'll go for this in a heartbeat.
UgyjriwAl0BNZ6ZXIvl4AaABAg,I could feel the shade being thrown at OnePlus.
UgyD6frsVdNUIQ8xYgR4AaABAg,oh well the last few seconds describe OnePlus ü´°

UgwgxtZOorxaGY0-CBh4AaABAg,Iphone killer
UgxNF8xOYOjeE0LvVAF4AaABAg,"for me a glass slab is a must, ditch those hideous buttons.  I still remember some phones, Samsung notably that have 3 physical buttons for the three basic navigation functions on ALL android devices"
Ugy-hpJMkkJ9oPGqJqJ4AaABAg,Intrigued and skeptical at the same. More intrigued about how it will perform overall against the plethora of competitions. I'm a sucker for new innovations!

UgwXlyOplCboMFjqDqd4AaABAg,"Don't konw why but this phone remind me of the old google's ""modularized phone"" whitch try to make smart phones more like a desk computer."
UgyPFN3I--r817wdceZ4AaABAg,I'm using a realme 5 pro from the last 2.5 years and it's working perfectly smooth and the battery is great. But to be very honest. This Nothing Phone finally feels like a worthy upgrade. So I might buy this as soon as this comes out.
UgzLRyJvJw0lsxjPCBt4AaABAg,The LED ringtones look like an epiletics worst nightmare.
Ugwn6MdBMuvs4oGLZVd4AaABAg,At 6:28 that was a OnePlus reference right?üòÇ I'm not sure
UgzLZxdLGbPtruxJr4B4AaABAg,"Yes familiar üòÇ OnePlus, iPhone  and every other disruptive phone idea üí°"
UgxDJrNQ72DL3ERo2YZ4AaABAg,Just don‚Äôt feel that happy having my phone face down to get scratched all the time
UgxgNGJEjHRG3Of3X1Z4AaABAg,Love that not so subtle dig at OnePlus at the end there!
UgxO6ZeV0IS3s_IGAZd4AaABAg,"hope this turns up to be a good phone, i would like to have one"
UgworWTcJ1FqiMtcQCl4AaABAg,"I like this. I'd check it out if has high end specs with competitive performance and price. Otherwise, I think it will be just another cool niche phone."
UgwI_p2gJ7PIDVuU0Ll4AaABAg,"""Nothing"" new."
Ugwz7Z9djCoc2fNixUR4AaABAg,Anyone knows the approximate screen size of the phone? i know marques has a big hand
UgyOxgnFeBq2_bFbIjR4AaABAg,When I first saw it I thought it was a iphone lol
UgyHolWa_sidn9XY6094AaABAg,It doesn't look that different my guy
UgzoRffZA4uTETepDw54AaABAg,Love it. Not sure if I'd go for it just yet. Still rocking an OnePlus but a second gen of nothing phone....
UgwQI2fhiawF5OhDHpJ4AaABAg,Nothing has impressed me more on a smartphone than the pop up selfie camera from the Oneplus 7 pro. Nothing. :/
Ugwt3SHaxuXRAQtVBIV4AaABAg,Now this is making a Smartphone fun üëèüèø
UgwrffDvcs-RAcPFNP94AaABAg,*It's like Oneplus all over again!*
UgwMbpJ0k7UnRW9vfSh4AaABAg,You can't tell me this is not an iPhone 12 of the Android with better hardware upgrades!
Ugzl1-0v0Oi51NK1MGt4AaABAg,Nokia 3220 did it wayy better!!
UgwluouE4tHH1ZX3ZPx4AaABAg,How big is it?
UgwMb-PVY-WZZlLECc54AaABAg,I Thought It Was An iPhone Because Of The Back & The Shape Of The Phone
Ugwbynprxpzqbco7QQh4AaABAg,The Boring Phone... kinda makes me yaaawn
UgwBDw-DXgcVCEBRC1F4AaABAg,I never put my phone down with the back facing up so the led lights are pointless to me...
UgyiWmDUvbJP2p242X94AaABAg,I feel this would have been a cool gimmick 10 years ago.
UgyiWmDUvbJP2p242X94AaABAg.9cY1ohGYSw79cY9wUuobfl,Then what is it now?
UgyaWsNaVwUbNHtTbOx4AaABAg,"They should give all users a rubber edge ""case"" with this phone.
Just so it has a protection by range while you put it on a flat surface like a table.

It looks really nice id say and that led functionally seems to very usable."
UgxETvYJ64tAT1oXrwd4AaABAg,"I like apple design
And Android UI"
Ugw9RnUV3G7aYBKRKKd4AaABAg,a case with cutouts for the LEDs will be good
UgywvCectCWtc0We8vJ4AaABAg,Front revealed üòç
UgzQ5WprJhyxMdAzikV4AaABAg,I don't respect copycats.
UgyDOqju3iczkoQKn294AaABAg,It looks exactly like an iPhone 12

UgxDuZFaWFrX96vbsV94AaABAg,"Ok, it has my apple attention. Mmmmmm."
UgzFLrvTx2h9ioJ1rpl4AaABAg,One plus *cough*
Ugz6VbM3pV5TESbvwUV4AaABAg,"For some reason this phone reminds me of the essential phone. Has the same spirit and hype. That was my favorite phone ever, might consider getting this one."
Ugz6VbM3pV5TESbvwUV4AaABAg.9cY1mUW24dC9cY84KHiSPE,Ya. And it will remind people again like how essential phone died.
UgybS0mYP2zAnso4ZM14AaABAg,wow much unique such innovation
UgwNtPOCpUiWQNRPBTV4AaABAg,Damn
Ugxz04kOi1Yh4GVXcfF4AaABAg,Sponsored by nothing?
UgwEEBcXPL3uIW-ECf54AaABAg,They've taken the back panel to the next level! LED looks veryyy coooool! Someone is finally getting creative!! I'm bored of looking at the same old phones with same old design O.o
UgzTXIWlKM8DPk05yIJ4AaABAg,"Caption should be

UgwFzPiAmwaCtEwC0Zp4AaABAg,"Will this sell at HAMLEY‚Äôs ? 
Bcoz it sure looks like it belongs to a toy-store"
UgwPUnGx2ExYU8VxmfR4AaABAg,"Neat extra feature but the price, the specs, and the software would probably be more important imo.
 
It hard to get excited over an extra light on the back."
UgyeUk9GbksYdznAa-54AaABAg,iPhone X camera setup and iPhone 12 body the design is a copy except back plate
UgxK_m84Adu3iIxUDyl4AaABAg,If it's cheap will buy
UgxxJ5HCKR_mLlJ3foh4AaABAg,I want to go into space with that phone!
UgzqxTgUvSPSlqk1E3l4AaABAg,What are they selling it for?
UgwM1MW84m07lmqBUL14AaABAg,clear iPhone 12 with no notch looks wise
UgywmtytQiQ-VGGTwqZ4AaABAg,Expecting dotted case from nothing.. for that LEDs
UgwrLBGyvO68wMN8MOp4AaABAg,"Sound familiar?... Yup OnePlus. Most of the original fanbase was brushed aside for a more mainstream device. Gather a small and loyal fanbase, make money, drop said loyal fanbase to appeal to a larger audience, Make even more money. I doubt there's a business out there that isn't orientated this way. growth is king."
Ugwu9ziL-3Dv_-pvzSd4AaABAg,"Definitely cool design aesthetics.
...could see myself admiring the back while my mind wanders. Question is, do most people place their phone face down?"
Ugwu9ziL-3Dv_-pvzSd4AaABAg.9cY1hwYq7pX9cY3WGk-eH-,Yeah I guess most would do if they‚Äôre in a work place to remove the temptation. However I think this phone would ‚Äúallow‚Äù people to face it down because they would usually have the face phoning up to see notifications since notifications are coming on the back now they would probably put their phone on the back now
UgzZ1nKE8SC8p0_wil54AaABAg,The subtle closing OnePlus reference was lit. Not surprising because this is coming from same school of thoughts.
UgwWN24i0DHYq1ABtOJ4AaABAg,Yeah sounds familiar:p
UgweMMVUG3bdBToAlJx4AaABAg,Reminds me a bit of my sony xperia sp from 7-8 yrs back
UgyvJ3bYjfBv-So66Q94AaABAg,Nothing More Than New Design
UgxU_QLJeHSWRxc-3xR4AaABAg,Haha I see what you did there at the end. Very familiar indeed (:
Ugzwyxvy95lRo-II3ZN4AaABAg,Reminds me of the Tron Legacy design.
Ugy3z7BGaIdRztO32IF4AaABAg,We can say it looks like nothing we have seen before...
UgxGGdOCqqBaQabciAB4AaABAg,"The phone looks like an iPhone only that it has a punch hole camera for selfies which is not symmetrical by the way, a USB type C obviously, an interesting design on the back,  equally sized bezels and chin which is more of an iPhone,  non curved display,  and circular rear  camera cutouts which is heavily inspired by the iPhone. 
I think they're trying to divert apple's market to themselves.  Lol"
UgxpwtcrxdYPZ29OyWx4AaABAg,It looks kinda like a FairPhone but also an iPhone
Ugxr8UAWq_ldTbfG0kB4AaABAg,Oneplus standing in the corner...

UgwKhOksPUMRGzoL6kt4AaABAg,"It would be sweet if a worker''s name at Nothing were Nobody. It would make a great joke: Who makes Nothing? Nobody.
That said, Nokia and Motorola did these things, was pretty neat."
Ugygl3ywT2Pxl4iwdqp4AaABAg,"Useless 3rd class Phone, how this look different than other phone? Using led makes it different lol. Under the hood may this one also is rebranded phone from oppo or vivo. Design seems copy from apple and vivo."
UgyQAAkFgAleemaG65F4AaABAg,Useless and annoying.
UgzaOI5o2lucB7iPisF4AaABAg,iPhone.
Ugxzt7piDeR00uOmjRV4AaABAg,"I miss OnePlus when they used to make good phones so I hope that they'll do good with performance and quality with Nothing.
 I'll probably wait for the second iteration so they can smooth out all the problems they might have for now. Plus my OnePlus Nord is still going strong.
Oh and I NEED  the notification slider"
UgwBKRHu79iTEeZQwwh4AaABAg,How does the battery hold up with those LEDs on the back?
UgwnUcfBa3dnuij6qbd4AaABAg,I love the LED customization and uniqueness. This is something that Nothing should absolutely keep going with each iteration.
UgyblTmW-fLDQCxbvkt4AaABAg,"I think the ""sounds familiar"" is OnePlus xD"

1. Unique design
2. Clean software experience
That's enough for me"
UgxKqyNY4KGoc6pwjoV4AaABAg,I don't think a light bar on back is a great highlight of this phone which will be nullify when a back cover is used
UgxK_WHDAPrGINJwg954AaABAg,The sound of ringtones is like Nothing is trying to create a watch dogs phone
UgzZ4Ug1HC8NriMzBGN4AaABAg,The phone looks like something straight out of a cyberpunk movie.
Ugz6_4mebjTza4vRtGd4AaABAg,New feature: LED lights which will be covered with a case - nailed it
UgwGvl9rdr-zgctsH0J4AaABAg,that lockscreen.

UgwbAJch4ZTYByq4CaB4AaABAg,Makes me think of the game mirror's edge. If they put some really small red elements on it....
UgwbgSbIRYdhaJUDJjZ4AaABAg,To me it looks like an iPhone 12 if it came out in 2077 and that is not a complaint in the slightest
UgxTOgCJAuCZKbx7skl4AaABAg,"Many people say the lights are a gimmick, but they work exactly as intended. They get everyone talking about the phone, and in public, they‚Äôll also bring attention to the phone."
Ugyju2EgI-0jLFi9jjh4AaABAg,Front camera position isn't ideal should have been at the centre
UgxFB3JIi8rr4eL5-_t4AaABAg,"Question: is that a new phone, or is it really a 'designer iPhone'? And, what would be wrong with that?"
UgwLXKmUGWjTpLl4I4F4AaABAg,"I hope The pain they went to make it look neat in the back that is being transparent, will also reflect in their Software and Hardware too, But what scares me is that with all these additions, wouldn't it be hard to become a VFM product??"
UgxGKIXQRya7MhV9vSh4AaABAg,Last portion reminds of OnePlus!!üëÄ
UgyrIK9oCeBbW38bByd4AaABAg,Soo much effort put in the light and people are going to put a opaque silicone cover on it .
Ugxqnh6o7ncW8hHvs6Z4AaABAg,"it's an old style iPhone with a clear back and flashy lights, fking silly as shite"
Ugwtt_EocNohDQliSY54AaABAg,I'm a simple bitch. I love the lightsü§ç{ ;)
Ugz0T3dHOcc-eq5QYD94AaABAg,Horrible. Just my view obviously.
UgxqhZgC_Xnvzddyw7d4AaABAg,6:10 you f'ed up 1+
UgyZP2ZX70w66l-tW6d4AaABAg,Question is who is putting their phone display down?
UgwAg9F3bTd2ZW306Ux4AaABAg,I'm only allowed to show the back of the phone. Goes ahead to show the whole screen
UgzRpCydi0hz4eaj5dR4AaABAg,Any emotional damage to OnePlus was purely unintentional.
UgyYF4sNDRL-u_t4P-Z4AaABAg,Never really interested with the nothing until now.. thnx For convincing me!
UgyYF4sNDRL-u_t4P-Z4AaABAg.9cY1R1BgPOS9ceqoZFRcck,"@Zarco i wasn't aware of the prices, but that sounds nice"
UgyYF4sNDRL-u_t4P-Z4AaABAg.9cY1R1BgPOS9cecycmghj8,@Daniel What do you mean? Midrange in specs or price? Because price is confirmed to be between 300 and 500 USD. That warrants midrange specs.
UgyYF4sNDRL-u_t4P-Z4AaABAg.9cY1R1BgPOS9cY92nMcdLz,"@Zarco I highly doubt that this thing will be midrange, not even Samsung bothers to offer cheap wireless charging on their A-lineup"
UgyYF4sNDRL-u_t4P-Z4AaABAg.9cY1R1BgPOS9cY2uz9yVtx,@Daniel Xperia pro I and 1mk4
UgyYF4sNDRL-u_t4P-Z4AaABAg.9cY1R1BgPOS9cY2b8aHZc8,@Daniel Apparently it's gonna be $500 so the specs will be mid range but that's definitely enough for a lot of people
UgyYF4sNDRL-u_t4P-Z4AaABAg.9cY1R1BgPOS9cY1koUzQ-i,"Same, but when I see the pricetag which is probably gonna be >800 bucks the interest will go away"
Ugyz537XHgrYpU2dq0R4AaABAg,"Just another Android phone. I can not see how they will compete with the Apple ecosystem, the iPad and watch are class-leading. The only problem with ios is the inability to block websites and apps in an app like Cold Turkey which is available for Mac OS."

UgzuqJWTtXkjeMXrPXh4AaABAg,"I'm more interested in knowing the overall configuration and performance of the phone. Keeping safety in mind, breaking your phone by accidentally dropping it, wouldn't you use a phone case?"

Ugz8Q-vgqAvtoUCB7QR4AaABAg,"They spent much time to make the phone's back look cool! I hope they spent even more time on making the phone's OS unique too. I personally stick to my iPhone 13 Pro Max, but great to see new manufacturers."
Ugxdtf9LCAUmVRfh2KZ4AaABAg,As OnePlus goes away from oxygenOs to shitOs... I want nothing phone to fill that oxygenOs gap with its software approch.
UgzXMn3M3pqbr_O975N4AaABAg,bet. Apple's wishing they made a glowing logo on their iPhone after seeing this video
Ugz3-tqA7-zcCcNJLQB4AaABAg,Looks like _nothing_ else on the market! haha
Ugwq46N6UzeScSVyZMh4AaABAg,They're definitely selling a transparent case which synergizes with the lights.
Ugx8iX5k9uH9Yi9QHxZ4AaABAg,My favourite is the Battery led bar.
UgxMDz3zs8x3hRke5D94AaABAg,"The design of the lights on the back look like an apple with a bite taken out of it, plus the leaf"

UgynCD1TXAXFo5pFNmt4AaABAg,I don't see an innovative functionality to those LEDs at the back. Users will get bored of it within days. Apart from that i don't think this phone has anything going for it now.
UgwGJ30YWN6oY9lctIx4AaABAg,"Dang, oneplus took that last jab personal."
UgzyGvoCnWSMF9W-ezF4AaABAg,I don't get the design of the LED. Shouldn't it be N for Nothing and it's sort of symmetrical?
UgwiE08ActEcdD1blLB4AaABAg,Most of the people use back cover on their phone so this is a bad strategy for a long run
Ugx25abcvcJTQIuK5NR4AaABAg,That‚Äôs some dope features nice showcase

UgyKES5mr4WpH1k26F54AaABAg,it looks like an iphone
Ugxvyhpj7rqIMERWO4F4AaABAg,This phone with that stupendous looking ui replaced with custom rom would be so much fun.

UgzUEcUjTnSNc6bwRpR4AaABAg,"If I put a case on it, it just looks like an iphone 12, nothing spectacular"

UgyQTxvRffr0z7KdN8x4AaABAg,"I'm actually awestruck! I've been thinking how phones have evolved to a point they look alike to the last generation. But DAMN, that's some smart design. No one's getting the phone just for the lights, so I hope to see new tech from Nothing soon. If the phone outperforms the others one in the price segment, in terms of basic smartphone performance. That'll be a switch for me."

I really want to change amy current phone for the new samsung A53 but design wise i have fallen in love with the nothing phone 1 the only plus point samsung will still have is a better OS experience (4 year OS update vs 3 year OS update ) and i am not how stable updates Nothing will give. Yet i feel if the price is right i  will go for nothing phone 1
Ugzdm0kX2NhNlz6ddp54AaABAg,In my opinion it doesn‚Äôt look different at all. It‚Äôs an iphone with a clear back. A rectangle with a screen.
Ugx-WB34J1Q8PwIMHV14AaABAg,I am like don't we cover the back  off the phone  -_-
Ugyy8OZF55Y7aehN8EV4AaABAg,Am I the only one who was thinks that the ringtones sound... like absolute shit lol

UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg,This feels like the OnePlus One of this decade. A new startup ready to create waves from ripples.
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9c_Ip2hzZUb,That was his dig at the end....I had a OnePlus One and a OnePlus X ... that was it...
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cYAUHnhbHr,@InSaNe HuSs31n carl pei left bbk because to get freedom on what he decides.
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cYAPB30C_a,Only to abandon their fan base for more sales revenue. Permission to say Cancel Nothing? Because that's a confusing phrase.
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cY88bCFubQ,Was OnePlus a start up? They're owned by Oppo from the start.
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cY5Rxp7CxA,"@NonLegit Nation 2 you missing something. That niche ""Fan Boy"" is the reason the company still running, and when they left? Who gonna buy that phone?"
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cY4xrddvOa,Pixel 6 Pro is a example of overhyped and this is another one that‚Äôs overhyped.
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cY4Zv2FYvj,"@InSaNe HuSs31n yeah it sucks, they decided they wanted to make more money and the OnePlus fanboys I guess didn't want them to. I think it was him that did a video on OnePlus last year talking about how it's a catch 22 for any company, they can't stay in the niche fanbase and make money."
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cY3Ps2zjTp,The CEO of nothing is the co-founder of one plus he left one plus to start the nothing brand .
UgzcffD7jeiW2FqkChh4AaABAg.9cY17SI47_w9cY2kEIhT-i,"Yeah, then lose the original fan base, just like he said."
UgyIiJ_swt0bkifIiOd4AaABAg,Software will decide what happens with this company
UgxU8nK6Pq93km6qBI54AaABAg,i love the freaking design

UgyTx4TN5cMDgK8-kM54AaABAg,"Certainly does have the shape of an iPhone 12 and the cameras look very, very similar. But, it also means I think it'll be the best designed Android phone imo. At least for looks. And if the rumored price is correct, it could be quite the deal."

UgyHi16FwtWJLikVIyh4AaABAg,What animal places their phone screen down??

UgzY8gyBw75WW947ejZ4AaABAg,"How big is the screen size though?  
It looks like it might be 6.4"" approx but if so it's a dealbreaker no matter how cool the phone is..."
Ugw2mnqF0aHW1Kcwlwd4AaABAg,cool and fresh idea
UgwLdOEpBm1qwv0BDNt4AaABAg,"This reminds me a little of my second phone, a Sony Xperia SP. Back in very early Android days (like, it getting an upgrade to Android 4 was a thing I remember) it was a budget-ish phone, and it had a small block of clear plastic along the bottom edge, with the frame wrapping around it, and multicoloured LEDs on the inside. It worked as a notification light, and as a visualiser when you listened to music on the preloaded Walkman app. 

In essence, it was just a gimmick. But because of that gimmick, I have fond memories of that phone, and I was very disappointed when Sony stopped selling their phones in Australia, making it really impractical for me to try and get my hands on one. If I was in the market for a new phone right now, I would be strongly considering this one, as long as it held up in the other departments."
UgxysMxXeMueranCny94AaABAg,"Did not say nothing about the nothing phone but LEDs

Just to be the first to show it. I espect much more from your channel."
UgxysMxXeMueranCny94AaABAg.9cY12P76CmY9cY1Cvstjpo,There were already videos on Twitter. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first.
UgwdCDo1Hy8eoVWHg854AaABAg,"So with this phone, you'll be needing to put your phone face down in order to see the notifications light. Not really a fan of that as I don't want my screen to be touching different surfaces."
Ugy589h0PhLx5z4rZyF4AaABAg,A very unique and truly incredible phone!
UgwIf_SPnsCVRjzoSO94AaABAg,Nothing has something interesting
UgzoFeiJ5kciqd5cnn14AaABAg,"I thought it would have the same design as the nothing ear 1, the black and white one. Kinda disappointed in that."
UgyVuTfYIaeaAXxBC494AaABAg,"I love how Ringtones and Notification Lights have been finally given some life. FINALLY! But hope that the software is stable and familiar to use because I won't spend my money over just a REALLY good looking, aesthetically standing out back of the phone"
UgzZ4wLXkK41BM5Eo854AaABAg,at least he shows the front in the start.
UgwUEUBpXS-0R0m1UVR4AaABAg,It would be cool feature when playing music and light bright up like disco lights with the beat of music.....not a great difference but in dark room it would work like a strobe lights...üëç
UgyhyRmcXxIQDI8VUBl4AaABAg,Thanks Marques
Ugyi8IMSUfgQOsV6ls54AaABAg,I've got the buds. The software is absolutely AWFUL. I'll wait for the second version of both if I do need new buds/phone by then
Ugy371wt8ML-GWWSllF4AaABAg,Can they please make a bumper case?
Ugybtwo6IVSotuJf_nx4AaABAg,"Very cool if I want iPhone designs but using android I can buy this, hopefully not that expensive"
Ugzg6gqtn4fSThqrJqh4AaABAg,Did he roast Oneplus in the end?
Ugw95W21re7JjDiDoIB4AaABAg,The lights are just a pointless gimmick. How about just having the phone facing screen up to see how much the battery has charged or who's calling you on the screen.
UgxGO76GlkwIjzEvbBV4AaABAg,Sponsored  content.  And useless  hype. This company is not gonna last very long.
Ugz0o2Tdpe7M-C4sOl14AaABAg,"I love the imagination and thought put in to the development of the phone, But the glaring question for me is....Will it come in ""BLACK""?"
Ugz0o2Tdpe7M-C4sOl14AaABAg.9cY0xn4orxT9cY3flMKFo5,Hopefully
UgxAe4SgzpvJ9xtWNE14AaABAg,The one plus satire bang on.
UgxrWPIj_9ROMqsqjSd4AaABAg,The LED Lights look fine ... but what about the battery with this feature?
UgzHzM3LYNXK6GvTJAt4AaABAg,Rokr e1 had led light stereo speakers that light in to rhythm of every song you throw in... Not just ring tones. In 2005
UgyNHyupBXM9jKPIZOJ4AaABAg,That subtle roast in the endü•≤
UgzTfAcUNJGq7_yTw9d4AaABAg,This phone doesn't have 900 LEDs on the rear panel. Theres a maximum of 20 LEDs. Nowhere close to 900. LEDs are only so small.
Ugx5RcD6sRMpo7ZFI2B4AaABAg,"I'd prefer a single LED that had different colors and pulse patterns.
Not a huge fan of the transparent look, but I prefer it to other phones.
The LoL phone is actually nice, LoL branding aside."
UgxTbsJmGJ-V90HfHGp4AaABAg,"1:00, 1:50.  Alas, doesn't look like there's a headphone jack. Guess that would cut into their earphone business, but unfortunately that's a major turnoff for me. Hopefully they would have less-gaudy ringtones, too."
Ugy5BqOxbCHXrfBfLJR4AaABAg,if it's under 600 i'll buy
UgxEsB_KdZBA5F53_U14AaABAg,The ü•ä at one plus. üòÇ
UgxKOzjA7XHEUs0iD3R4AaABAg,The ringtone called _coded_ (4:10‚Äì4:14) sounds like back in the day when you left a cell phone close to a speaker and before the phone started ringing the speaker caught interference when someone was calling
UgxEHlkzLG3Fw2mw8a94AaABAg,I wish they put colour led up at the top right  so that whenever there is a new notification it shows. you the dominant colour of that app eg blue for twitter red for YouTube and so on
Ugxg2td5ZoxH8cjP8pN4AaABAg,take my money already.

UgwhlPGjtKqOucZjWfB4AaABAg,"I like that, it has the look of an iPhone, but the OS of Android. I'd buy that"
UgxNJM9n7AOxCar63bJ4AaABAg,If they moved away from the iphone-esque design elements I'd be more itnterested
UgwmbDs1IYwUZZaA2J14AaABAg,What a cool iPhone knock off
UgypU3lIWOu_P1eluTh4AaABAg,At 2.14

UgwD5ca2-m3acgVWyzt4AaABAg,"I think with what Oneplus did and eventually had to happen to them, android users have become more aware and in a way more cautious than ever. I think it's definitely a cool strategy to differentiate one's self from the crowd sure but it's never going be enough for where we are today. People will just gravitate towards a Samsung or a Pixel or go extremely reasonable with a Xiaomi. The expectations from a new entrant is unbelievably high."

UgziTbOXL4NDpkDZnll4AaABAg,"Love what they have done with the Rear panel and the LEDs. Giving them some actual functionality such as the battery level indication also seems like a good step. The ringtones on the other hand didn't seem like anything I would use, but would absolutely love using the lights for notification. 2:24 based on the UI, it looks like Nothing is indeed sticking to close to a Stock Android experience much like their Nothing Launcher suggests except for their ""dotted"" title fonts (hopefully that's customisable)? 

Minor details like the all round symmetrical display bezels and a rather convenient radius of curvature is also appreciated. Looking forward to what they have planned for the UX now."

Ugzrmn908kDoqO6Vjkh4AaABAg.9cY04oZRzA59cYI5fJD5eY,"@Fantasytky Current iPhone user here who relies on their phone all day for work. If I used AOD, my phone would make it probably only an hour. Not everyone can be plugged in or connected to a power bank all day. And also, I can‚Äôt stare at my phone all day. I need a way to know when I‚Äôm getting a phone call or text at any time. The current flash system works for that because I can see the flash from across the room or out of the corner of my eye. But it is blinding if I forget to put my phone face up for example.

Ugzrmn908kDoqO6Vjkh4AaABAg.9cY04oZRzA59cY7KBEYSUm,Lol you literally have the whole front display to do that or through aod. Literally pointless to add the white colour led at the phone back
Ugzrmn908kDoqO6Vjkh4AaABAg.9cY04oZRzA59cY6sgH1FMC,"@Sergey Zakatov he did say there will be a couple other colour options, they could even change the colours of the lights eventually or just have ones that are capable of changing colours, thereby increasing it's usefulness and application."
Ugzrmn908kDoqO6Vjkh4AaABAg.9cY04oZRzA59cY6474M7_l,@Sergey Zakatov I suppose they chose white cause it fits the Monotone Design of the Phone
Ugzrmn908kDoqO6Vjkh4AaABAg.9cY04oZRzA59cY3XpSRe7Y,Yessssss!!! Hearing impaired here and this was my immediate first thought.
Ugzrmn908kDoqO6Vjkh4AaABAg.9cY04oZRzA59cY2Urhn0ya,"If only there was some better way to communicate visual information to hearing impaired customers than a white LED design on a white phone. Maybe some sort of matrix of RGB LEDs that can light up with different colors to show text or even pictures. Unfortunately, Nothing like that exists yet‚Ä¶"

UgxAkjjgJr0FmAoV9qZ4AaABAg,"Brilliant brilliant video this time. Most people will comment. I will write why I liked it better than most videos of MKBHD ( he certainly doesn't need my validation, anyways)
A) There was no fan boy drooling
B) The most distinct feature was given lot of screen time 
C) That split screen render of the ring tone must have been hard work but was super dope
D) That veiled Oneplus disclaimer at the end 
E) He also in a veiled manner told us that apart from these, the rest of the phone maybe slightly underwhelming"
UgxYjhmbmNO51-PQwbR4AaABAg,Looking cool but wht is the price in India ?
UgwcFurkhSGHOfBEM5N4AaABAg,Always wondered why they've left LED notifications behind.. also the LED on back its way too good for recording or photography :)
UgwcFurkhSGHOfBEM5N4AaABAg.9cY-tNSsZv19cY93pO3A1t,"@Fantasytky I'm not even talking about that. LED notifications used to be in front side of the phone at the top, I've had a couple xiaomi's with that, but then they just gave up. The back LED as a notification led its not that useful because as you said phone needs to be laid down with screen facing down, but, in a photographic manner it looks great. Especially if you can change the light instead of being completely white.."
UgwcFurkhSGHOfBEM5N4AaABAg.9cY-tNSsZv19cY6O0rPPl4,Because it literally pointless to put led behind the phone when you have the whole display or area at front for that without stupidly put your phone display facing down and scratching it

UgwlFC-yp04N6OhShFV4AaABAg.9cY-q74Boua9cYC-u84-7X,@Shellyman Studios i think they wanted to keep it minimalistic
UgwlFC-yp04N6OhShFV4AaABAg.9cY-q74Boua9cY5uUfBmma,Right? Now i wonder how useful that is lmao or just bigger gimmick ever
UgwlFC-yp04N6OhShFV4AaABAg.9cY-q74Boua9cY3viiB_wb,Yeah! I wish it was RGB though.
UgwlFC-yp04N6OhShFV4AaABAg.9cY-q74Boua9cY3SgwO-xA,@Ronin R same formula of high tier specs for dirt prices will eventually gone to a null point of vaporware if companies cannot differentiate themselves apart from others
UgwlFC-yp04N6OhShFV4AaABAg.9cY-q74Boua9cY2ppFgfzC,Like we are gonna ignore Samsung did it
UgwlFC-yp04N6OhShFV4AaABAg.9cY-q74Boua9cY2S4pTmnb,"Honestly, one of the features I miss the most from legacy phones are the notification LEDs.  It would be impossible to give up my Fold, but I sure wish it had some additional features."

UgwlFC-yp04N6OhShFV4AaABAg.9cY-q74Boua9cY0ugKpCtM,What all maters is spec and price considering it's startup. If price is high with mediocre camera setup then people would prefer something else.

Don't cancel me pls"
UgyqEQVF-p-h5KqHBIp4AaABAg,"6:32 Sounds familiar?  OnePlusüòÅ
Really sad many companies do that they forget their fan which leads them to uncertainty. Also sometime sticking to same also disappointing but what really matters is how the fan are reacting. I have seen people disappointed and no one cares so, it also play a part in falling of a brand."
UgxlaXxg4Az4gB7j91d4AaABAg,The phone looks so tron-ish
UgzGypb7PLt_6r3HkpN4AaABAg,"I hope there are some better ring tones cause those are all awful. The light show is cool though. Kinda reminds me of Samsung's edge lighting customizations, but for the back. But I like having a case so it's all rather worthless for me. I never put my phone face down either cause it's basically useless that way if I want to actually use the phone. Looking forward to see the rest of the phone though. Hopefully the back isn't it's only trick"
UgxKIArBDr2KmAK7Ylx4AaABAg,"Ok the uniform bezels look impressive, finally some other phone doing the Pixel 5 look. Hopefully we get a black Nothing Phone as well"
Ugwk3I__7N0jqZq1_Y14AaABAg,Look Like similar iPhone 11 but Design is So So Amazing
UgwAOW_HeV3s84292DB4AaABAg,RIP Apple and Samsung‚Ä¶ yeah sure lol
UgzSpMq2KY44KI5NZWR4AaABAg,The clear iPhone 12 looked so much better. This looks tacky AF.

UgyxxReJZ4EZ3OC5mbF4AaABAg,Lit back light üî• but is it me or does it look like the outline of an apple with a bite and a tilted leaf at the top? ü§î
UgzIxAtXtkLlxATRd3B4AaABAg,Interesting. An actual clear case that actually protects the phone from drops like a Spriggan case would complete that. I have a missing finger that helps me drop crap a lot lol.
UgxV391Bn5xDrz_zDG14AaABAg,They finally mixed Apple and android
UgyIrLWK2wSCOxbf7_d4AaABAg,The nothing phone looks pretty cool tho ngl. If it ships with stock Android or something similar to the OG oxygen OS and is priced properly it makes it a really compelling purchase.
UgxZ65p2IGhmN0hRk-14AaABAg,We want RGB LED Lights !!
Ugw8FWWzL1XrntSdyjF4AaABAg,"Its the coolest phone I've seen in a while, BUT are people actually going to place their phones on the table screen down with all the scratch risk? No."
Ugwb_fZRN4dYCFm-Si94AaABAg,"Well, I  must admit the design and the originality are really dope. Good job Carl Pei and Nothing."
UgwcDoy5o6moGY8swJJ4AaABAg,That design is really cool I must say.
UgyDGkXvjzwa1fLgnoF4AaABAg,"I'm a two phone guy. I've been on annual iphone upgrades for about five years (it's my main device) but I tend to stick with my androids for a while, because I'm a lot more picky with those. Right now, I'm still on the oneplus 7t pro, the mclaren one, and honestly, I really love it. Wish it had wireless charging, but overall, I love it. Every new phone that comes out just... doesn't really seem impressive? I was really looking forward to the pixel 6 and considering that for an upgrade, but that was obviously a mess of a phone. I just like that sort of stock android experience.  Oneplus has just been so disappointingly normal lately. They're not unique anymore. But this definitely has my attention. Really looking forward to reviews of this. Might be my next step up."
UgxJ4cA1d2M34doxhG54AaABAg,I want this
UgzI0euJycWbciGREz14AaABAg,"Easily the CyberPunk 2077 official phone. The style, ringtones and leds are inspired or influenced by this style. 
Also it seems like a new Essential PH-1 era of 2017 all over again. Modular connection with unique features and add-ons but didn't lasted long... I hope this stays and evolves."
Ugwaw-hO8Tw4FcIvWn94AaABAg,I miss the phones' light indicator.
UgxUCBmaTDfZYOhzAr14AaABAg,"I would get this if it was a middle ground between Apple and Android. I love my blue messages but Apple has been so conservative lately with new *useful* features, it‚Äôs all just aesthetics. I think it shows how conservative they are when we‚Äôre all freaking out because we can finally change a font on the lock screen."
UgwDH8YanXcEn-fiD794AaABAg,"Surely people would just use  MP3 file to set their own ringtone. Plus battery percentage is better than a flashing led on the back. 

It's a tough market if it's midrange handset, as Samsung seems to have that covered with the A series which I believe is their biggest selling range"

UgxnVpIwWpxOE486-814AaABAg,"They literally just looked at the iPhone 12 and probably thought like ""why the hell do Android manufacturers put like 17 useless cameras on the back?"" and so they also only do Dual cameras an made the bezels symmetrical - like Apple did with their very first bezelless model in 2017...

Your comparison to ""what a clear iPhone 12 would look like"" is also off since the Nothing phone also looks like this from the inside... they simply put some white stickers on top of the components and you could easily do that on an iPhone too."

UgywVtcU-CrzMab86Td4AaABAg,"In real life, this phone is legit mesmerizing on the back, I can see the appeal, but it's still a risky move for which that specific product is made, but also I kinda wish there will be a black version of the phone(1), that phone is really a different class of it's own right, mostly I dig it with the software front since I'm using a Nothing Launcher installed on my phone. This is early OnePlus vibes that I witnessing right now.

I don't have high expectations around the hype, the company should make it or break it from the launch of this phone by next month, I needed to wait and see how the company matures overtime."

UgyUvKdWfpAgzKkv1IV4AaABAg,Does it really matter how a phone looks? Anyone who buys a phone is going to have a case on it
Ugw8H7RCwBKs5wgSBbV4AaABAg,"The design is interesting, but to be a player nowadays you need camera. Essential phone came up short with the camera, even though the phone was interesting and unique. Camera depends on a high level software team, the Pixel series proved camera hardware is very secondary to image processing software. So if Nothing gets the camera into the top tier at a reasonable price, they've got a shot at success. The design factors are a bonus, but not anything completely new - just exaggerated versions of features already tried out by now-defunct makers like HTC (remember the quasi- see through back on the blue U12+?)"

Ugxe2RoRdPpe3RvQ6MN4AaABAg,All of that lighting can be achieved in an always on display.

I don't think people see any other reason to switch their phone nowadays unless another model has an amazing camera or under display tech. otherwise why bother. I could be wrong, but if I were nothing I would put everything I've got into the camera performance, it's already a let down to ""only"" see two cameras instead of three (I know this makes no sense to call it a letdown, but I do believe that people see 2 cameras and automaticaly subconsciously think about the  ""old iphone 12"" stadard...and  3 cameras as the ""new pro"" standard. Like I said I could be wrong but I think that descision alone could leave the phone seeming (not actually beeing) but seeming subpar to newer models"

UgyGcSIULoYRuqlwTwt4AaABAg,"It's a StarWars phone, and I like it for that, but if I was a potential buyer I would be concerned with things like long term software support.

UgzFJboeNl0m2TfLIlJ4AaABAg,I can already see a start wars Storm trooper edition coming.

UgxccdYalko93BoRjCN4AaABAg,Trying to be different.... and than selling out and being broadly more appealing? ..feels like a Oneplus do-over
UgyE5w2zQJrbYbPMfDt4AaABAg,"I think more people that we think will buy this phone, because in a market where phones are becoming more and more saturated in performance for a price point, especially budget and mid segment, its feature like these that are the differentiating things."
UgwhNHY3SqrQJtKkw314AaABAg,It‚Äôs an iPhone with the back panel replaced and an android OS. Or at least that‚Äôs what it seems
UgxAxKGda_xINK2aLrZ4AaABAg,Gimmick
Ugy97RkKdfyChZHrShB4AaABAg,OnePlus
UgxBCDR3bvM4XsOVse54AaABAg,Looking forward to the camera review of this phone.
UgzgZinEhpWoBvIixz14AaABAg,OnePlus Users might be switching their phones in near future. üòÇ
UgxOZjF3cOSpf5gFeJl4AaABAg,No matter how much apple is criticised they somehow still become a benchmark for other companies in terms of designüòÖ
UgyAxiX67N7ykNEVvL14AaABAg,Their marketing is a bit cringe
UgwihZNC3g30bjORS6N4AaABAg,iPhone design with a notification light on the back that will be covered by a case. Seems like a lot of NOTHING ;)
Ugxj2lQE6HXep5KADJV4AaABAg,"Nice design but not sure if that counts as different enough. People have all kinds of regrets with phones - no SD cards, no jacks, no stylus, no LEDs, no privacy, closed software, closed markets, child safety, repairs ... different design and re-adding LEDs is better than nothing for sure, but ..."
UgyK0opFhbUt41NcJYJ4AaABAg,It is nice to something different from the boring slabs being sold. Differentiation is why i bought a Sidekick
UgxiLLLzotIeV4CTBMN4AaABAg,ƒ∞ts reminds me iphone 12
UgwtByqMuQUF12EmVMd4AaABAg,There is a possibility of clear cases as well as cases with cut outs in just the LED parts..that would be really cool to look at especially during night..and trust the name CARL PEI and understand why One Plus is having lots of issues to deal with after he left..
Ugz6k6aLC5xsEjdaezp4AaABAg,cant wait for the full review hopefully it is not too expensive
Ugy3qClah3oCUfZMux94AaABAg,One plus ptsd :( Reached their peak with 6T and 7T Pro and then it all went to meh slab.
UgwiPNwCr_laZRqHV214AaABAg,Depending on how it performs I think it might be something to get in the future! Kinda gives me starwars vibes
Ugy5-MaFyHTLppkbzoJ4AaABAg,That subtle reference to Oneplus at the end XD
UgzBLOWlTeZfYngRyG54AaABAg,"That looks sick, now imagine them on collab with something iconic like anime, movies, game, etc and giving them unique color design on them. If the phone internal and software does decent job on top of it, i would get one myself cause that phone have identity, differentiating from the ""boring"" others"
UgzBLOWlTeZfYngRyG54AaABAg.9cXzb8NGOLv9cY0k2uSAr7,This is like a very cyberpunk-ish phone ive seen. Definitely a bold ass design choice. Very iphoney and android mixed
UgwfEepsUX-fZ_eVD-94AaABAg,That one plus reference at the end though.
UgyzViwGkvk9LFRjoiB4AaABAg,just another over priced android with a shattered glass back
UgwmT_HrfnX8KrAx7h14AaABAg,3:59 did you guys use green screen for this shot? Greast production as always guys
Ugw52On3nUuIlo8wBoB4AaABAg,"Loved the idea of the led...looks great and also full of features.

And talking about the case...people can always use a bumper case(yk...the case just on the edges of the phone)"
Ugxl0i_PpVHRLfBIfYF4AaABAg,Looks different than what ? It looks exactly like an iPhone lol
UgxKtSdwSR6rOTIgWKF4AaABAg,Buying this Phone day one.
Ugwa11xjLgviuEJunS54AaABAg,So you want to tell me‚Ä¶ that he had.. A NARUTO PHONE‚Ä¶ but decided to show this tiktok ringlight of a phone?
UgyjMAMs-Y1W-os1H-t4AaABAg,"It's an iPhone. Stop being a sellout, lol"
UgxkJxYH00BRUq-QiUt4AaABAg,No one is going to buy it. It's an expensive crappy phone.
UgzT1HKOkAqpDZ_vz4d4AaABAg,"pretty sick phone, imagine the colours could change as well"
UgxG6MvumXVBk7RH4wt4AaABAg,Next video will show us a the box o f the phone
Ugxl8Kw4aFqOGY5AK3B4AaABAg,Phone awesome ü§©
Ugx3ELyBh-k-6xpD3Fx4AaABAg,They worked on the light a lot
Ugypo33Dbwd_mxDliv54AaABAg,It looks like a IPhone
UgyLHyiC-zsjn4d4w-94AaABAg,"good luck to them, but i almost never hear people complain that all phones look the same these days. it generally doesn't really matter."
Ugwh3Cn4_v3K6xcV-Nh4AaABAg,"I really like the design but I also feel that it's heavily useless.
The whole new ecosystem thing is a great idea but for now we've seen a gimmick with a light that won't be used that much.
For sure it will be really noticeable if someone has one, but it's gonna be too different and too gimmicky to buy I think."
UgzcfnmfuuxjzqqmCkl4AaABAg,The LED on the back side looks like a gimmick to me!
UgwNj8_M2APY30-LT0V4AaABAg,6:08 That was a good one.
Ugx6wnxaWRyUyOkTEU94AaABAg,"I don't know, I just don't tend to spend that much time looking at the back of my phone. It does look cool though."
Ugyvb78Fb6E55gEmxsd4AaABAg,It appears that everyone was waiting for this video.. The number of views hitting 3 lakh in just a few minutes üî•üî•üî•
UgyDCg1J54EoPxq7cDp4AaABAg,It's pretty much an iphone 12 design
UgxBtrXMwvMK7z60-6N4AaABAg,"5:41 Minor detail: that's Wild Rift, not League of Legends."
UgxBtrXMwvMK7z60-6N4AaABAg.9cXzYAQuv_B9cY-_I2KMFn,@E Corp Kinda yeah :p
Ugy5UdRYsTHu5Ev2zT14AaABAg,"The LED gimmick is such a stupid feature. But aside from that, the design is very promising! I love the block-ey rounded iPhone look. Don't even care if anyone shamelessly copies that design, it's gorgeous."
Ugzu3mE3cHvDlz7RVb94AaABAg,"You are right about your predictions if it works xD it's the same strategy with oneplus , disrupt the industry in order to make a name and  join the list of the big companies  and when you make it  ,  well now settle xD"
Ugw0QqJuztmm0RGSIQh4AaABAg,If an iPhone was an android
Ugwkh_a0-vCy9wqyFYt4AaABAg,4:10 reminds me of those light up cases of old Nokia phones
Ugw8X5k0EgxcTFVVH5d4AaABAg,This is kind of jaw dropping to me. Finally something new!
Ugyo2cpbFlN4Q_KlU3F4AaABAg,"That's really cool new feature after a long time in phone industry, but what about the battery life because it has more LEDs than any other phone in the market?"
Ugy4PSQdtH4cGRCQPKt4AaABAg,"Forget the back, the front looks dope af."
UgwuaXJ57zRSS4TQzfh4AaABAg,I just hope the lights won‚Äôt be their only selling point
Ugzv7Pq3LlKVjZnNNfZ4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve checked, but flashing lights, could it trigger seizures in folks with epilepsy??"
UgzvpnCdemBr81YeJwN4AaABAg,"1:10 : ""what im allowed to show is the back of the phone""
2:25:  *proceeds to show the front*

Am i missing something? ü§îüòÇ"
Ugyjrfv4SutZDqdtzkV4AaABAg,6:08 I knew the endgame was 1+ üòÇüòÇ
UgxxVsLO1p_fr0QE_Hd4AaABAg,Technically it‚Äôs not transparent because they covered everything then add transparent glass‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs transparent
Ugzt9qan_POJsQYmB8V4AaABAg,Nothing phone looks killer bro üëçüëç
UgwKK4f0B4cH4yBBnsB4AaABAg,Yep... I knew the swipe at OnePlus was going to come and it did happen.
UgyNFr7pNQmyYDAZ0Md4AaABAg,if this has a flagship chipset them I'm buying this.
UgycDWeG2_XkipAenYR4AaABAg,"The phone is really appealing, hope the processor, performance and camera does match to our expectations and as well as the price"
UgycDWeG2_XkipAenYR4AaABAg.9cXzTqdNHMR9cY5WDDhEgT,OnePlus? The camera going to be underwhelming
UgxeN1eEJtp9H26jGDJ4AaABAg,"Come on dude, 20 second unskippable ad?
And that too on all videos?"
Ugz76uWjTmfTlegCqnV4AaABAg,This was a great concept but why put the LEDs in this ridiculous layout? Like they did too much. If they just simplified the led layout and made it more usable in different ways would probably not only allow cases with places for the LEDs to shine through easier to make (or just clear back cases I guess) but I would be more customizable
UgyUl5hFVdcWpyDqYmR4AaABAg,"Didn't you just show the front too? Hahaha 
Looks ok"
Ugwlf-i2B9UazqtiF554AaABAg,1 +
UgyY1-kKrf78K7Wh-2x4AaABAg,"I have nothing ear 1 , so definitely buying this one asapüòçü§ò"

UgyL6DJTRiwrHHlcl0h4AaABAg,looks gimmicky
UgyyGQrXrnalNlYZVzJ4AaABAg,It's looking different.
UgwzE4C3Mt0JVTF5-FZ4AaABAg,RGB phone when?
UgzCsFZGD0ItzwBQ5K94AaABAg,Lol That last line throws shade at oneplus
UgzGOBR8NUqB80_rw694AaABAg,"If google pixel had this design it could have been a perfect iphone competitor with stock android ,stock camera , and it look so minimalistic"
UgxzSCYmYLXn49fGRYd4AaABAg,"""You know hows calling you, just by looking at it"" 
Hey! I do that with my phone!"
UgxWIRpwNOlHrWZszAh4AaABAg,"This is just stupid. Why the heck would you keep you phone turned the other way around on a table? Makes no sense to me. It' a gimmick so that people don't focus on the fact that they have shamelessly ripped off Apple, it's not even a slight resemblance, it's literally 90% the same phone. Just a gimmick, NOTHING more."
Ugx4MoW2x_aof0nAz1B4AaABAg,This is more interesting than I thought it be
UgyDkh__W15a0a0vflx4AaABAg,"I told y‚Äôall, he‚Äôs already using it"
Ugw2XSqDs_z-0eKYVyF4AaABAg,You were taking about oneplus phones at the end of the video right !
UgyYoyC0hiMk-cAY9i14AaABAg,Headphone jack?
Ugx9V9-4DuNaucerzd14AaABAg,6:30 yeah that sounds familiar one üåù
UgwlXB364Z2LZCLoa4B4AaABAg,This thing looks absolutely awesome I would buy it
UgwUVpR577-fA7KJ6Bd4AaABAg,We just saw Nothing üëÄ
UgxoYJOIFXi532VOoOJ4AaABAg,3:29 What's the name of that laptop?
UgyuSlv_pxIUD8CbLEt4AaABAg,Nothing is getting moreover than iphone....üòÇ
UgyQsxAQXlGBjX027jV4AaABAg,those lights on the back of it is enough to make me want one already
Ugy16O6vwix0WUrH82x4AaABAg,I'll pass.
Ugz3cFWRCBLKnN5KpAd4AaABAg,So they just stole the iPhones whole back design and shape? Smart. If people think it looks like an iPhone then they‚Äôll be more likely to buy it. Maybe more companies should follow
UgwFOXEBbfc6pywrXaF4AaABAg,They could bring back the HTC dot cover as a case for the back
UgxeOIG0irbBEFjRWtN4AaABAg,Wow brother I appreciate you
UgxxLTp00Ge5vKlzsgF4AaABAg,@MarquesBrownlee trying to indicate the footprints of OneplusüòÇüëå
Ugx_p1I8X4zpo2HGRM54AaABAg,New OnePlus is in the Market
UgytJqFpwD1V6ZN9LL54AaABAg,"Looks cool, but I can't be the only one who never puts their phone face down onto hard surfaces(Tables, counters) Sure maybe on the bed or the couch but even then usually face up to avoid scratches. 

Won't the constant want to put this face down in combination of shaking it, lead to tons of display scratches? 

I like the idea, and look, but feel I would still have my phone face up 75% of the time."
Ugx0peByaIuHGQyUQmd4AaABAg,You revealed front design too....
UgzyzB7S8rWVuBcxMrN4AaABAg,1+...
UgyM2S5CrRiwUxBY5b14AaABAg,At least they could copy the notch too so there is perfect blend betweend the iPhone X and the iPhone 12
Ugzfy2KRM5q0-N8LQZp4AaABAg,Sounds familiar with Oneplus like they start with flagship killer low costing phones.
Ugx6HKnwUbS4qBJFJAp4AaABAg,Price point needs to at least compete with the Pixel or it‚Äôs gonna flop. They set an affordability precedent with the $99 buds. The phone can‚Äôt be expensive or they‚Äôre done.
Ugyem1L7UC4DJY76jD54AaABAg,"dafak, iPhone ripoff lol"
UgwdPyNnvUAFKc6TZJd4AaABAg,daaaaaam it look good
UgwUxPwkgMjMXbpR8_x4AaABAg,ok guys i just want to say one thing *NOTHING* üòé
UgwSUmvYxJ3ECIEzfIZ4AaABAg,What phone?
UgzEv16Ia28UAuO5iXd4AaABAg,"The biggest issue with today's phones is stagnation. They look the same (as in each main brands phones look almost the same from generation to generation), they all have almost the same performance, and now Android 12/13 and IOS are almost the same....it's gotten to the point that we really need something more than the same old, same old. I honestly don't want to upgrade to the next gen phone simply because it's not bringing anything new to the table. There's simply no point in the upgrade except to get the latest OS updates---which are nearly the same as last years ""updates"". THIS is at least SOMETHING different, from a company that looks stable (that can't be overlooked), and I welcome it. I look forward to your review Marques!"
Ugz8tXAWKsGwGEixZx94AaABAg,Can we get a review of the power bank in the background?!? Please and thanks
UgyJqAm57Az_UDwToPN4AaABAg,Lights üî•
UgxjvazZlN-UelAp7p14AaABAg,Take my money üíµ I want that phone.
UgwZ45YkA3AeyZCpeGR4AaABAg,I like it's features. I would buy it if it was a little bit more slimmer
UgycGtL83gKo37lZ1Z14AaABAg,I love these lights A LOT. I can't wait to have them on my iPhone in 6 years.
Ugx1sFfqNuzcmnlR5A54AaABAg,The only phone for which the back is more dope than the front
UgwNZsK0XzG51GMKyjl4AaABAg,I appreciate the shot he took at OnePlus lol
UgyKQORa_VgsTdQnoNZ4AaABAg,"No jack, no buy. Is it too hard to make a more complete flagship phone?"
UgyyXXZOAlaDdhNqVVV4AaABAg,Android lol

Ugz6EAeu7ex31t1JlpF4AaABAg,The nothing phone matches exactly what type of brains people have these days.
UgwYSrb0MwmgPNAFf494AaABAg,Looks amazing. Bored with the regular stuff. Can someone introduce a camera on the sides ?
UgxargZCpWd6BZSPj0p4AaABAg,My god this thing is literally an iPhone 12 üòÇüòÇ
UgxqDaQg6czPIJt5Y-x4AaABAg,Another hype phone to wow people but no one will buy after thinking and comparing phones in gsmarena with a cooler head.
UgxEUu9ULdAfFCSSNZR4AaABAg,"Don't care, I just want epic specs for a little price and crispy clean software. Just like the OG Oneplus."
Ugxw70KQb-jm6V4kjIx4AaABAg,I was wrong... good job Nothing..
Ugxoe26FNZJBnFLgWW54AaABAg,This thing is going to impress the youth i am sure i will buy this.... Its so fancy
UgyvXHrFBYfrL803inF4AaABAg,I should you this light pattern to ignore my wife call.
UgxZNls4t4neHMtHeuh4AaABAg,"This iPhone copy looks quite cool, interesting design for sure. The only negative is that front display, looks like every other default copy-pasted Android phone."
UgxzGVHR2Z3JsiwVtcF4AaABAg,i am on the Samsung Note9 currently and i would totally switch to that.
UgxDwex_RTxB3u034GV4AaABAg,"It's cool, but never going to really exist in a meaningful way and support will be extremely limited. Looks cool though. View this as one of those prototype cars that car companies put out but never exist."
UgwccZR2vvCv4HuG6994AaABAg,"5:55 - That broke my ""OnePlus from 2015"" heart, man"
UgzBIfhhx4p6vynhGLF4AaABAg,"Curious person: what phone is that you're holding?

Owner of phone: oh it's nothing"
UgwV9dTjwW9IYrsc8Tp4AaABAg,It's just an iPhone with fancy transparent case with worse ecosystem. Nothing special
UgxiYQdjWhkP7wjMnKF4AaABAg,Looks like an iPhone 12.  I mean it looks cool but you can‚Äôt not make the comparison
UgwhriElaI8HMbmg8-B4AaABAg,"Nothing has to nail everything with this phone to have any chance of being successful. Pricing, performance, software experience/support and marketing; all has to be done right. Otherwise it will be another case like the Essential PH-1."
UgymvgldgB2T7Pwpscd4AaABAg,"Cool things, but do you really need even more distraction than phones already provide?"
UgzJBf_PpZyNR5qTAkt4AaABAg,"If Nothing created its own ecosystem that‚Äôs non-Google based, I‚Äôd pre-order now."
UgxwrZ0glH1_yiD5WwB4AaABAg,"Am I the only one that think it looks more like a needless gimmick that complicates the phone's build even more?

Don't get me wrong, it has it's charm and could be useful in SOME usecases, but other than that it seems like a useless feature that not only is another part that can break (and might make it harder to repair).

The fact that creators are also not allowed to show it in use and show the software until it launches makes it an even more questionable product.  It's at the very least not marketing strategy that gains trust. Just hype."
UgyuK98O0h3F4qJQIPV4AaABAg,What
Ugyh5U6TtvKOlsuFqrh4AaABAg,I can see other companies copying the light strips right now. Because that‚Äôs the only thing that has real functionality: they can double as circle light for photos.
UgxQhAoq97YMx9M2SRt4AaABAg,The Stormtrooper Nothing phone official
Ugz67KMY1678LYlIla54AaABAg,"I like the ringtone, it reminds me of old cell phones, symbian phones"
UgygT8yIUkojC_o0Jdl4AaABAg,That‚Äôs it? A whole ‚ÄúNew‚Äù phone with a bunch of LEDs in the back? The name seems appropriate. I DO really like their aesthetic though‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ more of a nothing burger.
Ugzmu18AAW4J1RuTIbl4AaABAg,"Me: **sneaks phone into class**

UgzQz3Pbbgr6-Hjl5014AaABAg,"goodbye OnePlus, welcome Nothing"
UgycsY3QHomATdDZ4JJ4AaABAg,"Looks interesting, certainly different but I guess at the end of the day the key feature is gonna be the software. Light+Clean a la old Oneplus with the Nothing design, or a bunch of redundant apps and unnecessary changes like Oppo/Oneplus of today?"
UgzD1ao3obMmwVoxlAh4AaABAg,at least someone is trying to experiment with the design
UgygPfFBSyGBZsoDQct4AaABAg,A Matte Black version would be SICKKKK

UgxUE2AZ2HTh1gujGPN4AaABAg,"I've always been an android fan, but I am in love with the iPhone edge design. Something about that sexy rounded glass screen with metal borders. This is like the best of both worlds. If I was looking for a new phone, this would definitely be a contender, but I love my Fold 3."
UgxEgXOTH8urWWKh-Lp4AaABAg,"So they made the entire back panel a flashlight With all those LED-s and with all of them to dance with different user activities... The battery would also be ""NOTHING"" ...."
Ugyhi26WmYfaPjYqqLl4AaABAg,"For a video which was only allowed to show the back of the phone, you sure let us see a lot of the front design üòÇ. Really like it though, love the LED design on the back."

UgxrB_gvITm63K9e2M54AaABAg,This phone kinda gives me Transformers vibes.
Ugxly7igepSXIFsWGjt4AaABAg,"The price will make this or break this.
It can't be 700$+ because google delivered a good 700$ experience with the Pixel 6.
But with these specs I just don't know if the Nothing phone will be priced low enough to compete"
UgzHmoNp_E3pbY8cK454AaABAg,"I'm sure it's selling point will all depend on three things, 1. software, 2. camera and 3. battery performance. The look is beautiful and familiar."
UgzaH-DgxXdFG_Ea2SN4AaABAg,Fully thought that was a modded iPhone
Ugwb7dhuj3s60JUVJh54AaABAg,"OMG, did he just start the video with ""Hey, what's up! MKBHD here..."" I swear, I haven't heard him say that for a while! Nice!"

Ugzsfl57tNii30O4Ayh4AaABAg,I'll buy it.
Ugydw1_uznbD0smYzQl4AaABAg,"Hi Marquees, I think you have to make some decisions regarding making videos about products when you're only allowed to show 10% of the product. You complained about this brand when you couldn't say too much about the headphones in the sneak preview video. You made an entire video saying how you don't like these sneak peak video's and how it's distorting the view of the phone, yet you keep making them. Just feels untrue to your word."

Ugw-NTA13uxEK4jPOI94AaABAg,That's just a knockoff iPhone
UgxWvNqfIafsfZAawtp4AaABAg,It‚Äôs all going to come down to pricing and software support.
UgzfCbJgxa_TVyue6A54AaABAg,"honestly, while the lights are cool, they have zero actual new ""features"". you can check the battery percentage (and way more precisely) by just lifting up your phone. you can see who's calling, again by just lifting your phone. the lighting up when wirelessly charging is nothing but a gimmick, what actual value does that add to the phone? the red recording led also adds no value. this is all just cool looking gimmicks, but i think for most, it certainly wont be anything worth switching for."
UgybOC4eQkhMi3Jl0B94AaABAg,iPhone stripped

UgwZjaC01DnGnPXw4g94AaABAg,"Ahh oneplus. Still can't believe they fooled me, I really thought they cared about us tech heads. I was preaching to my friends saying ""get a oneplus for years"" . And they were good phones from oneplus 1 to 7. Got a oneplus 8 pro, it was great initially but oneplus have really slacked off on their fast updates, the software isn't as slick as it used to be, it just kind of feels like a a generic android phone and I'm now regretting my decision and wished I got an s20 at the time. They got greedy as a company."
UgwaLHSaTUpazwlt4W14AaABAg,"I like the design but that's not enough alone to make it. Look at Essential phone. It completely failed as a phone (ignoring the marketing aspect) because it's hardware was let down by poor cameras and mediocre performance. 

Put simply, I don't think they stand a chance. Smart Phone start-ups never go well. Many will argue OnePlus did but they weren't really a start-up, merely a branch of the mega-company BKK."

UgzGjmvvbwX2ji-Za-94AaABAg,"I hope that blinking red light for indication that you're recording a video can be disabled. For many reasons, being able to stealthily record without others knowing is good for your safety."

UgwveyJBgovPVzbYdZB4AaABAg,I‚Äôm confused. I thought he said he can only show the back? Why are we seeing the front too?
UgzUbFTcCkhiy8m7eMZ4AaABAg,I could be wrong as we don‚Äôt know how it is as an actual phone but this seems to be falling down the trend of Nothing being a design company before a technology company. Their products always look cool but in the case of the earbuds are mid at best
UgwNXdH8Po-yNixyklR4AaABAg,"So cool. I just hope the UI is as good as the galaxy for me. Some things when I switched to the one plus for a bit stood out to me, when I realized only Samsung does live locked wallpapers or a customizable always on display"

That basically already removed all the interest I could ever have had in this"
Ugzr34y0E-yaFwd6Ma94AaABAg,"No frills symmetrical bezels, I'm intrigued. Pixel 5 still doing well for me, but if they can nail the formula in the right way, it looks compelling!"

Ugwf_92xiB5J3gwrwgd4AaABAg,Its cool but seems a little gimmicky.  tbh the doesnt look much different from an iphone 5s.

UgykFOsBoBmUBfG6c394AaABAg,"Love the design, its tempting btw ‚ù§Ô∏è"
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg,I think this phone will discourage people to put on a phone case. The chance of breaking phone goes up if they don‚Äôt put it. But it looks cool though üòÅ
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cvTZ6HCAHC,@Thorn clear cases with tempered glass or certain hard plastic backs don‚Äôt yellow. It‚Äôs the soft parts that do and they can easily make cases with colored bumpers for the sides
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cYJFiPBZYt,@Corktail yeah I know what you mean. The case are not nice to touch and hold
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cYChOj5kZb,@Daniel Mond√©jar Clear cases are expensive as you need to buy many of them at once- they all go yellow and piss colored after a few months/years from the oils in your hands.
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY8DReFMTa,@GHMR one more thing is if the phone is slippery you can consider a case else no point to use case(This nothing phone has solid grip so no point here)
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY7vQ_ywSX,@GHMR this is right even technically its not good for battery since heat gets trapped in case
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY6dx7CagY,@Unknown Egghead I'm not arguing with anyone. I stated my experience. Most of the people I know don't use cases. They're still thought of as something that boomers use. But that's obviously anecdotal.
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY6GXvi2L8,@GHMR your experience is not equal to the experience of 5 billion other people who own phones. Come up with a better argument
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY1hZY70xJ,I think this phone will work well with Bumper case.
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY1_2hB-FW,"Probably only cheap clear case will be available. The question will be how much will they sell. Premium casing maker wont make case for phone with small numbers of sales. That's why only iphone have lots of good case available on market, more than case for samsung phone."
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY0ylg6sBG,That's the thing. I hate phone cases. I buy a phone because I like how it looks. I choose the color because I like it. Why would I put a case on that?
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY0QbZTz_e,@sendoh7x they feel gross and suck even if they arent yellowed and nobody is buying replacement clear cases because thats stupid
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY-zhIouf9,I've never in my life used a phone case. Number of damaged phones: Zero.
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY-xpr6hEL,@Thorn not those cheap clear cases that come free with phone.. there are rugged cases with transparent glass back. Or just a case that goes around the phone with front and back open. Like dbrand grip
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cY-F-jijfJ,@Thorn you can change to a new one tho. It's not like clear cases are expensive
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cXznJ2gvtZ,"Not putting a case will lead to breakages which will lead to maintenance charges, so Nothing wins there too"
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cXzZw5IKWQ,"@Daniel Mond√©jar but clear cases suck, they become yellow over time. i had it once and never using a clear case again"
UgzlmLtAlDdsJt7e_gN4AaABAg.9cXya4XyOM-9cXzC2Orsks,"@Daniel Mond√©jar Okay üòÅ I didn‚Äôt think about that. Sometimes, we do forget about things that are common sense to us. Thank you for the solution. üòÅ"

At the end youn surely meant One plus (IG)"
UgyDy6aFqtqu8782D_B4AaABAg,That's nothing
Ugw0tUD0DlxL03BNMbF4AaABAg,What really makes a phone different these days? Even when attempting to make something different you end up making something similar to the competitor‚Ä¶ the light is cool but is that really enough to make people switch from a brand their use to to give this a try? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
UgwXqp6B4-Fj1sQewvJ4AaABAg,"Again just like therir first product. This phone is pure hype, and ""Nothing"" else. The idea sounds appealing. Make a competing eco-system. But the pace of the world has changed since the first iPhone launch. Companies are not sitting on their laurels waiting for companies to catch up. Apple spent years building their eco-system. And as much as Google and Samsung try, they are not there yet. And Nothing WILL NEVER be there. Because their whole market plan is hype, and the problem with hype is it dies down.

Sure it may end phone being a good phone, but it will be one in a sea of many. Basically amounting to thier namesake, ""Nothing""."
UgzDfgUgiDnDeZHZ9Ah4AaABAg,it looks like something out of black mirror. seems sick as hell!!

Ugy6dGSEDGmnJ-P-6I94AaABAg,Just another company that won‚Äôt be successful and won‚Äôt have much recognition for it . Only YouTubers will hype this up with their reviews but you know well they won‚Äôt be using a phone like that since they are more attached to Apple or Samsung.

Ugx4a9vYbja0k5KER594AaABAg,Now cheaters can leave their phone face down and still have an idea of who is calling. Golden!!!
UgzRU3Ul84L6jmJ7l194AaABAg,Call me crazy but can we appreciate those beautiful symmetrical bezels? They look so sick! And the camera hole being on the side just makes it look a lot cleaner!
UgzRU3Ul84L6jmJ7l194AaABAg.9cXy8QCbuz-9cY2kc2e-AF,"Just the iPhone X and onward (though they have that ugly notch), and the Pixel 5 have no bottom chin"
UgzRU3Ul84L6jmJ7l194AaABAg.9cXy8QCbuz-9cY2WNrxK-a,"I know that others have done an impressive job at minimizing the bezels, but just a couple of phones have the bottom chin the same width as the sides and upper bezels, it may be insignificant but details are details.

UgyztLT-_KFDa9srcpN4AaABAg,Case? I assume they have realised most people slap a case on their phone. My level of interest in a video about the back of a phone was low before this video and remains very low....

UgwKmbHR7nnHrbVl1_V4AaABAg,Those default ringtones are definitely not annoying at all
UgzGTplBgVi1Q_M28Mx4AaABAg,"THINK. ABOUT. THIS. üëá

for years, everyone has been happy with iPhone design and we all take pride in it.
with that in mind, isn't it actually a genius move to just have a replica with a different OS. 

Why are we humans even complaining, when everyone gets what they like or prefer. All of our needs look like they're fed. what even is the problem? lol üòÖ"
Ugz14-VvWrJ6kJN4-el4AaABAg,The front looks like a iPhone without the notch and extra bezel. Very similar but different
UgwbgLEJujR_xhpghXd4AaABAg,"Ngl this phone just makes me want to buy an iPhone 13 more lol. When I see that design I think ‚Äúman, apple has really nailed their smartphone design‚Äù"

Ugw1f2geu9TrqcH2Lmt4AaABAg,"The Last Pun may not pan out as that super accessible, recognisable, top selling phone will be made under a CEO name Carl Pei! 
Not Dumb Deaf Pete Lau!
I have a strong feeling that because of Lau, OnePlus is now in this Crisis on Identity situation at this moment of time!
If Carl Had Been Here,
OnePlus Would Have Still Retrained It's Identity AKA Oxygen OS At Its Most Pure Form & Prices As Well As Features Would Have Been Up To Expectation!"

UgytpQiEIH5qdAVUugh4AaABAg,"Anything made clear runs the risk of looking like it was made to use in a prison. They managed to avoid that, I think. It looks really futuristic to me. It looks like something on the set of sci-fi show like Foundation or something Aloy might find while delving in the ruins of Horizon."
UgzSZUlaXXeUMz7GXPN4AaABAg,"Only 3 years of Android updates... üòèüòíü§îü§® That's meh...

UgxmvQhukNhpF8hTqV94AaABAg,"Super hard pass on this. Got the Nothing Ear (1) on launch day. Til this day, i find it very finicky and just overall MID."
UgwDsm3ncdr3J2axvW14AaABAg,"Absolutely sounds familiar. No point supporting these guys, when they choose to abandon their original philosophy. 

If they choose to be unique, they've go all in and let their fans do the job.

That's what worked for Apple. No matter what people's expectations with a phone are, eventually, they feel Apple is the best. All that didn't happen over night."
UgxOX6IIRZwQ1sr8DG14AaABAg,I feel bad because I love you and wanna support your channel but at the moment I am just not in the market for a phone and so I brush past a lot of your content even though I want to support you
UgzmxpCvdLkEr9dRy5J4AaABAg,Why would I put my phone face down on the table so I can view notifications when the screen itself can give me that same information with more details? Why???

UgxKhTbVzyitJ-S8ef14AaABAg,Price wouldn't be sky-rocketing since their main focus is on Indian and Chinese market.
UgxymTs5gamZRAEgtKt4AaABAg,The front also looks very pretty.
Ugw3iKit4w095JT3eNJ4AaABAg,This is remarkably gimmicky and unremarkable
Ugw4GB149LsPUCVW_vl4AaABAg,"What this phone needs to nail for me;

(1) Price; I'm not buying a phone from new company when for the same price I can afford tried and true 

(2) Performance; it better be fast, Snapdragon 870 at minimum.

(3) Don't give me slow charging. 65w or more, and support stuff like USB PD 45w or above.

If they tick all of these boxes I can see myself upgrading this year, but I don't think I'll get everything I want."

UgyfozKOPa5S6gse7RZ4AaABAg,Actually this looks cool af. If the price is no more than 550 euros I could buy one to replace my old redmi. I was skeptical around the hype but they actually did something original
UgzLEjuWWOx6cI5umGZ4AaABAg,Is this coming to the iPhone 13 or what?

Jump ship like he did with OnePlus and create a new ""revolutionary"" company that just buys qualcomm chips, slaps on android and call it a day?

Ugz4MFZHhL77j5huMM14AaABAg,"Other than the sharp corners, I really like this design, kinda cyberpunky, and god the LEDs are beautiful like fr it's insane"
UgzH7Z6gUQLhdioBIvF4AaABAg,"It looks really good, I like it a lot"
UgywgktuCtUNJ3tbIOd4AaABAg,TAKE MY MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
UgzP2IE6vOsAcncvVXl4AaABAg,mmmm ..from apple boy perspective üòâ
Ugw5izJcxeR9txyTg3R4AaABAg,IPhone with LEDs on the back? Meh
UgzCe-0WP7ArZNFvUyd4AaABAg,The layout of the leds kinda looks like a stylized Apple logo.
UgyG6elJd3W6Z0tjM694AaABAg,These ringtones make me physically ill
Ugwyob0QDMmf9iceh2p4AaABAg,I was really hoping to see inside of phone through the back glass. But this looks nothing like transparent phone. I would rather strip off the paint from my glass back OnePlus 6 like Jerry did
Ugyp3DyZGcYHiazOS6F4AaABAg,Did he show us the front of the phone!!!
UgwWJlVEjLCRm058Q2J4AaABAg,Im curious about the price they will announce. If its not to high i would consider it escen though I live deep in the apple ecosystem
UgytMV2gppHB3_0ural4AaABAg,"I feel most of the general consumers out there put a case on their phones (myself included), as many drops and cracked screens have taught us to be wise and protect ya, well erhm, junk. But I‚Äôm sure Nothing/3rd Parties will make cool transparent cases that maybe even intensify the LEDs when they shine through. Definitely super intrigued by this concept!"
UgxQU-nEcVlV7atZ5Sp4AaABAg,I'd put a seizure warning on this because of the flashing lights. And I dont understand why they didnt allow the led color to be customized and changed\
Ugx9dnclxjDJdYZmIm54AaABAg,It amazes me how people are angry with the ones who use their flashlight as a incoming call marker on iPhones but this version of basically the same feature is considered dope. It really is quite decent-looking however
UgxNE46lKtRTGdEhTYx4AaABAg,iPhone 5 with a clear back and some lights ü§î and a regular android phone on the front?
Ugzs6HkyDkemIYKFha14AaABAg,Coming from the same guy who did OnePlus. Im pretty confident that this phone's specs will be alright but is it good enough to be the option that everyone goes for? That's questionable but definitely looking forward to it
UgwFEtWhFaQHa8Zrb154AaABAg,"Looks pretty good, I like it.
We‚Äôll see if this is style over substance but so far I‚Äôm intrigued."
UgwCRuNHONX5Qp-2zwp4AaABAg,This is so unique and honstly super cool. But I have some very mixed feeling on Nothing. Soooo..... yeah idk if I'd buy this.
UgzEk-RZdmQT5Ey0jTJ4AaABAg,Gimmicks dont last.
UgzByRW2AX7DsyTAM3Z4AaABAg,Hope it does good than Oneplus.
UgzNkv3aXOqGzL7_CBJ4AaABAg,"the only thing that matters is price. looks and all that come second. if nothing offers a budget phone with flagship specs, itll be successful. anything else it wont sell. thats what made oneplus so good. best value for buck. until oneplus got greedy."
UgwXwyT7uRhvRTiZQSB4AaABAg,looks like an iphone 12 but cooler.
UgwvKHQvZBDL3kFS5Mt4AaABAg,Looks like shit
UgwtExjoR9xMGwQ3ieh4AaABAg,"This phone was over hyped and retarded.

The only five people will buy this niche-fuck phone."

UgxnAIx_740su6VpSRR4AaABAg,"I must say, those are the worst ringtones I‚Äôve heard in a while."
Ugz1fyhmJZy_nasXYqN4AaABAg,It will be 1199 $ üôÑüòê
UgwtR87X1SeTK_46dvZ4AaABAg,The design of this looks very cool. Need so see what kind of features it has and price.
UgzZ5fP9H-ugBZZC7514AaABAg,"#6:32
OnePlus"
UgxXemiSJPupgf9apAJ4AaABAg,"It's not jsut the shape and layout that makes it look like an iPhone, but also the LED strips. If you look closely, it resembles the Apple logo a bit. The fact that on the right side there is a bit of the LED missing (the Apple bite), and the diagonal LED strip looks like the twig of the apple."
Ugxjvrfx1pGJExoVm-N4AaABAg,"shite phone ngl, i'd rather buy poco f3 any day of the week"
Ugx7NXnX7mkaAhRIb2p4AaABAg,LMAO at that dig at OnePlus
Ugy_-mKbC5py6zu3pl94AaABAg,"Lol, one of those ringtones reminds me of the interference you used to get on your tv a second or two before your phone would start ringing back in the the mid 2000s."
UgzfIlxy_I2YFvxP_mB4AaABAg,Good for them who have needs good battery backup üòÇüòÇ....
UgzLSkSoFwfNWffZsv94AaABAg,It would be better when those led's in the back of the phone can use the mors language pattern
UgzLTBkI7lPFGhBdcwZ4AaABAg,Does it run on stock android though?
UgxS-S8a5E6giodZDYp4AaABAg,Mehhhhhhhhh
Ugzvpa3ZgXlxPkUdvJd4AaABAg,Interesting. Love the design! If it‚Äôs within range i guess it‚Äôs a good phone to turn peoples heads and act as a secondary device. Let‚Äôs hope the OS is good!
Ugzvpa3ZgXlxPkUdvJd4AaABAg.9cXxZgBEWAq9cXzNTRVdkp,Well it's Android. So it can only be either bad or average at most. Let's hope it's at least average.
UgxuKLHWfgqb8rybeXl4AaABAg,Gimmicky feature. Rest of the phone would most likely still be the typical chinese shit.
UgyhIV7F_rS0nOTZrRh4AaABAg,"Wow üòØ, this video is üî•‚ö°"
Ugwa6yyw_n4TAjdJ0td4AaABAg,This phone would have been very cool in 2010....
UgzemsfE80EWhY6O2nx4AaABAg,"wow the ""             "" is really cool."
Ugz0gqr2EJnAf2UThgh4AaABAg,I really hope they can pull this off because it looks awesome
UgxQwfHq26xZcCak2pJ4AaABAg,"Number one rule of not getting your screen scratched us to never put it screen down on a table.
But those LEDs are cool. Shame you can't show UI too."
UgxJZYlKXMcGY3gmxmp4AaABAg,6:00 that future is inevitable
UgyY_0aV8EZF6rz5SW54AaABAg,"Yes, it does sound familiar lol. Never settle, they said but they did settle."
UgzfFkhBYt3aizMnsnh4AaABAg,"Looks really really cool, but the only light i would actually find useful would be the charging indicator.
Seems to me it's going to be a Sony case scenario. The videos will have tons of views (especially Zacks durability test) but it will sell few phones."
UgyDKZ8Fz2l-SnOwZ094AaABAg,coolest phone ever seen
UgxG6OO2A2y0IUVg__94AaABAg,"Achoo-ONEPLUS-ooo ü§ßü§ß 
very familiar."
UgzHNBZijOV4efwfqUN4AaABAg,6:00 explained the downfall of oneplus in seconds.... Nd nailed it!
Ugyu7o77_MYQ5AY7ejh4AaABAg,I didn‚Äôt care for the look but that light gimmick has me wondering if that‚Äôs something cool enough to have me try it. Obviously camera and display need to be great but price is the biggest factor.
UgwWIvNTupvZiet21uR4AaABAg,dope
Ugwz9yFeDF3DQcjWtU54AaABAg,"0:12 , 2:24, 3:38 he said he's allowed to show us only back of the phone till the release but......."

Ugw8Knx-OkKQ6DZPWnt4AaABAg,6:32 One Plus
Ugy1XWxKb5C3sRgeyQB4AaABAg,I don't keep cases on my phones so I'm interested lol. This looks really cool. I only worry about dropping it and busting the LEDs. Maybe Nothing can make a bumper case like the Nexus 4 had.
Ugy1XWxKb5C3sRgeyQB4AaABAg.9cXxUTRVP0S9cY1UJg0QEv,Carl pei already confirmed it about getting the customers covered with providing a case that's suffices the need
UgzkO7nmGnXqv0hb3SN4AaABAg,it's actually a cool looking phone.. cyber feeling stuff
UgyI9PO2a5S-dgjaMvF4AaABAg,Does it have the headphones jack ??
UgxRxr7S6ZNqAipG2XJ4AaABAg,Better have good and long software support

UgyhJPWTd0EnoYRauKl4AaABAg,rgbw lights would have been much sexier..!!
UgzxR4RF93QLigCOBDp4AaABAg,Totally loved the equal borders across all sides on the front display. Finally an android phone with no ugly-ass chin (except Pixel 5).
UgxOg2zjvXDtQ3gStJZ4AaABAg,The price will dictate whether this succeeds or not
UgziAYydGE5VZzMIDhF4AaABAg,"It looks ""Nothing"" like I've ever seen before ü§£"
UgwZxKyFwH0E_zFT38R4AaABAg,"Well it'll be the performance that decides it for me. Since OnePlus turned trash, the market is open for disruption"
Ugxa5NUHFO1igDkvL_d4AaABAg,"Imagine Nothing in the next 5 years. I smell competition for the big tech companies. The Ear1 buds were so cool, plus the aesthetics of the phone."
UgwjauRPvaV4RTcVeP94AaABAg,Yeah it‚Äôs cool but I don‚Äôt wanna have to put my phone face down. Gimmick for now. I‚Äôll wait until the full review to change my opinion.

UgxaqalAE63IdfZITSh4AaABAg,from what I understood. He is only allowed to show the back of the phone 1:10. Up untill He showed the front üòÇ. Opsies?
Ugz3E5H5MYeEuDiNKch4AaABAg,"""I can only show the back of the phone""  Immediately shows the front of the phone for the Glyph app"
Ugz10w3FYrJklKP51Fh4AaABAg,Cool but overhyped. I don't see it lasting or even reaching mainstream.
UgxejE9vep5yUjEgc_V4AaABAg,"Damn, shots fired against OnePlus at the end üòÖ
My thought at first glance was ""That's an iPhone"" and I'm still kind of scared whether this is a lawsuit waiting to happen. I hope I'm wrong. The design of the back looks really nice and the LEDs are super unique, but I wonder how their software update policy will look like. I usually don't really care about phones looking all the same, that just means it's easier to support them with custom ROMs after the manufacturer has stopped providing updates... with a custom element like this, you're more likely to be locked into the original ROM."
UgzJ11_G-tjs-fUfeqR4AaABAg,I am still waiting to see the specs of the phone. The lights are cool but performance and other specs matter the most.
Ugx8yH_KryL1_YHKOE14AaABAg,"I mean come on,the design is far too similar to the iPhone."
Ugxh3Pof99XZEskziGd4AaABAg,Were u talking about OnePlus? LOL
Ugx9NquQ0rcvwrArril4AaABAg,This man says a lot without saying a lot. Absolutely amazing how he summarised the journey of 1+ without even mentioning the name
Ugx9NquQ0rcvwrArril4AaABAg.9cXxRANauNN9cY3hkt-15t,He purposely did that the CEO of nothing was the cov founder of one plus ü§£ but stepped down to create nothing.

Ugx3qtNA7wNP4o6c3l54AaABAg,From Nothing to Something
UgzTL9TMui3tJevqgBB4AaABAg,"It looks awesome, but I'm the kind of person who immediately puts a case on my phone for protection so I'm not sure how much utility I'd get out of it. If the price point is good I'll consider it, otherwise I don't think it's a fit for me personally."

UgxL6HM-OUhbJPUtBoB4AaABAg,Yawn. ü•±
UgwTc8pSV7Qrvxfuc6J4AaABAg,$599 to $699 seems like a bit to ask for this phone
Ugw4DpLJFaaYQdvGXiF4AaABAg,WOW THATS LOOKS VERYYY DIFFERENT. I NEVER SEEN LIKE THAT BEFOREEE
Ugx-a2R8SEgnZZgnU_Z4AaABAg,"Ok come on MKB. You're sugar coating. Two things. 1. It's an Iphone inspired design, just say it, lol. 2. I'm never putting my phone down screen first so those flashing lights based on who is calling is a gimmick, you can say it lol. The one cool thing is that those LEDs at the back does make for a great light source for photos. Not hating or anything, I just found you were, oddly, tip toeing around this product."
UgwT87t5uCTVNy24Blt4AaABAg,They gave him the phone and said to only show the BACK of the phone? Ngl that's super lame. The back looks cool... but seriously?
UgwT87t5uCTVNy24Blt4AaABAg.9cXxOGSsP9L9cXyInV5pjc,"How is that lame? When the folding phones came out, they were only allowed to show the hinges. That's what happens when a company has a new concept. Makes total sense."
UgwA9x7jLxZkblwVacN4AaABAg,Clearly I see nothing
UgzsjwDClYWDDRvvH0J4AaABAg,So the nothing laptop or computer next year then?
UgwnAyD9LJ0HYXAp2cR4AaABAg,The ringtones sound like R2D2 on crack.
UgxfTFRfgRXqLCcUKPR4AaABAg,Meh. You‚Äôll put a case on it and won‚Äôt see any of it.
UgxTLNlUv8c4CGXisJl4AaABAg,"Like the phone, but I think Nothing promises too much. They present themselves as an alternative of Apple, the company who has reinvented the concept of smartphones. So I personally have high expectation of it, and this level of innovation does not look enough for me.

Tbh, with their ambition, I think Nothing should work on a ""new device"" that can reasonably replace the smartphones we all know too well today since smartphones have come close to their peak. They are a startup, this will be a great opportunity for them.

In fact, I believe Apple's AR devices around the corner will be their answer to potentially replace smartphones. If Nothing does want to compete with Apple at the same level, I would like to see their answer to the question."
UgwQBNl86RVe-IIvZhh4AaABAg,Thinking of buying Poco F4 GT or waiting for Nothing phone 1 to release
UgyRQbjdiI-knYUTRmJ4AaABAg,An edge protector or edge only case will look great with this phone.
UgzwWuEV1JXpRFO-aOF4AaABAg,Title should be -- there is nothing in my hand
Ugz7cObYb_S7Z3J3emJ4AaABAg,So pretty much a phone with built in some lights and that's the uniqueness?
UgwY5ltG1iAr-erU-Vh4AaABAg,After decades Different Phone is ready to Launch
UgwgVGgptobVK_5SZuN4AaABAg,Imagine some idiot buys an iPhone 12 case for this phone üíÄ
UgyqtJ3cw-kQEl4TbIJ4AaABAg,Okay. That is dope. It's like something out of Blade Runner 2049
UgxlqAudyOZo4NWoLsd4AaABAg,"It looks awesome. I never thought I would get hyped for a phone with a hole punch,"
Ugyran3Bh85OKYn6xqR4AaABAg,Lol how can you possibly say it looks different??
UgznQj26zvVWr2I8Hrp4AaABAg,"If I were on android I would totally get this phone. Or, you know, wait until they make that super broadly appealing phone and have to go back to their roots with the Nothing North or something like that"
UgwU0vD_HNYljJaNP3N4AaABAg,"Looks sick
03:15 Unless that is your LUT, those lights have a lot of green tint (probably missing some Red/Orange in the LEDs)"
Ugx8EWmWqD7Q6d95XeN4AaABAg,"If they put triple embargo like the ear 1s, it's not worth it"
UgxtOBf6v5s0kL5AQb94AaABAg,"Look closely to the LED, you can see the Apple Logo right there, Yep I know you can't ignore it now."
UgxPwfto5qYSdnJDCxB4AaABAg,why does it look like an iPhone?
UgwhrTDM6mxPWhc20nB4AaABAg,"Sorry, it looks exactly like an iPhone, especially the back and the side rails. Only difference being the notch on the front."
UgyfBj7dULgH17U8K0R4AaABAg,"Dbrand: the back on the phone is DOPE, anyways here's a skin you might wanna put on it."
Ugzrw5btKcGdxaZ_nzB4AaABAg,First I thought it was quite ugly and meaningless but after this demonstration I still think it looks ugly but it seems super useful. I really wish that it gets super successful so that other brands also start implementing lights on the back. I know that there are some gaming phones with LEDs on the back but they don't do much.
UgyWMPZ_F-mijYB4wc94AaABAg,Wow . Looks cool üî•
UgyNG776h_5lUzDuahV4AaABAg,I like the 1plus diss in the end ü§£
UgweDmg7RHovNQtQHAd4AaABAg,Sounds familiar
Ugz4KSXAmc3fLOojcfB4AaABAg,"It.. looks like an iPhone. 

Yeah, that's an iPhone"
UgxaOn6e0lHwiC6EbZl4AaABAg,Cool but gimmick
Ugyp0NOu5ePk8sYupkR4AaABAg,Idk. I don't think lights and sound is gonna differentiate it.
Ugz2lHvsaD0Cw5p0R5F4AaABAg,I am HOPING that those LED's can change color based on what app it's receiving notifications from. Now THAT WOuld be sick!

UgzaNJqs7DyfEC_8FDN4AaABAg,"As cool is it is, those ringtones sounded pretty annoying to me üòÖ
Anyway, my only hope is that at least for a while they'd have the same spirit that oneplus originally had. Clean, stable OS with good features. Good build quality with great QA (device won't start having hardware issues after only a year or too). And at a reasonable price.
But maybe a better camera this time"
Ugys8tWSBAks_KOraBx4AaABAg,Cool phone but goofy ahh ringtones üòÇüòÇüòÇ
UgzVGXwCxsNXoyFuAK54AaABAg,I‚Äôd give a benefit of the doubt. Also one plus is not what it used to be. They really settled and they are a mess compared where their vision were when they started. I can see ex one plus user going for this.
UgwZla7WjC77Sx41aA54AaABAg,I missed widely coloured and themed phones for years! Realme really did a good job with those anime and video game themed phones. And the Nothing phone is looking good.
UgzRhZDDT-CUGwS2oxx4AaABAg,Everything is cool but why corner punch hole? It looks old. Wish it had a center punchhole. But let's see the pricing now.

Ugw4TeO5AK7gfkjN-2F4AaABAg,"the bad copy of various versions of the iPhone, 11 and 12, behind they wanted to do one thing but it seems to me when you break the glass of the rear iPhone that you take it to change before you put the I expected a lot more, not to mention a processor not even top of the range"
UgzYN2PNNfd3DdCy4uR4AaABAg,I would buy it if it doesnt have a bunch of pre installed browsers or system apps that end up useless like samsung and apple and google end up having that you cannot delete or turn off. So if it has that id be switching to nothing brand phones for a long time etc.

That could change depending on implementation and how utilized it is, but it took a folding clamshell to get me to go dual phones and pull me somewhat back to android.

UgwJ9fghsdaNROO1sx14AaABAg,i bought the ear 1s and they are really nice but have slight errors and inconsistencies sometimes (like random disconnects and charging) which isn‚Äôt much but it does worry me as they move to making a whole phone. i‚Äôm no doubt excited and will def consider it but I also hope they can iron out those issues because a phone is an object you‚Äôd want to be fully polished
UgyaBnGKYIVzuvfqybh4AaABAg,If their next phone has a pop up I'd definitely buy. Kinda sad that since 1+7pro there weren't any

UgzPDeYa_fCDIWAFkVV4AaABAg,"The no in nothing is for no fukin thank you. Buy the best phone at the time, keep it for 5 years and repeat. Trust me I've had the OnePlus 6 since release and that was a midrange, and other than battery and cameras it's holding up"
UgwrbbS2cZ8wlO_qrHp4AaABAg,So it's the iPhone with the back skeleton
UgzKNR0R7PYkYTuqRnR4AaABAg,I would have bought if it had a god damned headphone jack (and sd card slot?)

UgxWop17X0pblK4lNc54AaABAg,How durable of those LED ?
UgwPpm5_LbBLz86j9jF4AaABAg,"I think how long the battery lasts and how good the cameras are will define how big of a hit this phone is. If it has meh cameras and meh battery life, people would much rather buy similarly priced Oneplus/Samsung/Mi phones"
UgyJU2pSfb5bEA-F9lt4AaABAg,Cool!
UgxOHuAel7OlJuNxyiB4AaABAg,I guess 95% of people really wouldn't care much abou the lighting at the rear of the phone as it's glass and they are gonna slap a case on it or at least a skin for additional grip.
Ugwn7ZXclHc3hURD3Fd4AaABAg,I hope software situation is good
Ugz57Q1IHUPIFOJd-SF4AaABAg,The light notification shit is highly unnecessary.

UgzwV6B_-sC8bRdz-Kh4AaABAg,"""Sounds familiar?"" 
Yep it sounds exactly like OnePlus. The recent update from OnePlus made my 8 Pro look partly like an Oppo and partly like an iPhone, and I don't like it. Plus it's full of bugs."

UgyaCm7Obg_cE2HNJLh4AaABAg,Also that some real 2012-13 sh*t with that light and ringtone
Ugy8ZaKFkJmyANyE3ep4AaABAg,"I don't know. This strikes me as yet another bog standard Android phone with a skin slapped over the top of the UI, more than a little ""inspiration"" from the iPhone chassis, and a gimmick in the form of the lights on the back. If they'd said ""hey, we're going to release a neat looking phone with a decent number of years of support for an Android phone,"" that would have been one thing, but ""we're going to disrupt the industry and change the world"" is a bit ridiculous."
Ugwe2srkGZqQ9_D6UBl4AaABAg,Really looking forward to buying this
Ugxe0yK06Xzg_Kf7axF4AaABAg,is the hardware cool? yes. is the software cool? well.. not really because its android. So billions of people will never switch because of that. I'd like to see a company completely reinvent hardware BUT ALSO make their own unique software.

UgxWZ4dBWXQNFKwTcJx4AaABAg,Enthusiasts don't want this light BS. They want good price to performance ratio with a smooth UI and timely updates. Gimmicks
UgzjzKi5Och9IB3Av0Z4AaABAg,"I am all for more different designs that have some personality to them, instead of just being fragile hunks of glass, all looking the same. I love the design of ROG phones and I also like where this one is going, I would like to see more of them."

Ugx0we730moWJLO7Fih4AaABAg,The eye appealing back light design is dope but as a user it all depends on the price range and the specs. It will be good if you could just go through it as well.

UgzFdh61wFqkR0IClu54AaABAg,It's giving TRON Legacy vibes.
Ugye69UCEqJ98thtX4x4AaABAg,Only issue i see about this design is that a case company can copy that idea with having lights on the back of the phone. which is exactly what i would want for my iphone. I would love that subtle glow when taking pictures

UgwZy9n_xcnrKySSqx14AaABAg,Why are they placing all these gimmicks on the back? i look at the front of it 99.99% of the time and place it face up on a table...
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg,"The back thing looks really cool and all, don't get me wrong, but this looks like the kind of feature you'll be very excited about at first, but completely forget it exists after two weeks.

Nintendo does a ""gimmick"" right in that it actually revolutionizes the video game industry as well. Wii, motion controls, Switch, mobile AND console gaming in one.

Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cYwl9DZ_H0,"@Gare ya literally pointless and purely for hype purpose. We have people saying traditional led light is pointless when you has oled display to be customised for notifications, but when this even more pointless single colour led come in at the back of the phone, suddenly people buy this hype saying it's so usefull"
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cYKSsBEmDd,"@Kojisan1 I love having a notification LED, but there's a difference between a simple RGB LED on the front of the phone, and an array of (supposedly) single-coloured LEDs on the back of the phone. The former is something I find infinitely useful, and the latter is something I find completely pointless."
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cYH_gs61iH,@Pranav Settaluri what does that even mean. Most android phones use very appleesque software design.
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cYHRV4H43v,@Fantasytky which is like exactly what i said. That's why i think it's a waste of a good opportunity.

But they are the sturdiest I have found over the years.  Regardless if it is transparent, the design disappears. And those fully transparent cases one they turn yellow and two dont truly protect your phone."
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cY1tfyADy2,@SaintAlia_of_the_Games I don't think it's bad looking but I don't understand why you would go through the effort of making the back transparent and then covering it up. People make their phones transparent so they can see the electronics. And here they just covered them up. It doesn't make a lot of sense.
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cY1fhPzGaV,"Actually, I've been having Pixel phones for the past few years and I miss having a notification LED. More than a gimmick, I think it's still pretty useful."

Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cY0nB5iApw,"@Freeze I'm with you on this(apart from the looks, I think it looks okay).  Like the LED thing is cool and all, but I'm not gonna put my phone face down intentionally and OLED screens are a thing and can be always on anyway, and even on like an iPhone 8, you just wiggle your phone and it lights up to give you info.  You can use certain light patterns so you can know who's calling you....or you can, you know...look at the actual screen to tell...or assign different ring tones instead?

It just seems like a weird and wholly useless focus."
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cY0gTFR79y,Who looks at the back of their phone. may be the person sitting opposite to you can tell you have a notification.
Ugywa-EhYUovXXKxRFt4AaABAg.9cXwGDjBj6E9cXz48m0YY8,"Indeed. Especially because I would never, ever out my screen face down. And so if you have your phone the right way up. Lo and behold, there's a screen there. Which can just tell you who's calling. Or how charged your phone is.

And the back of the phone doesn't really look that good either. They've hidden away all the good stuff. You can't really see any pcbs, or chips or coils. So it kind of defeats the purpose of a transparent back."
UgxW0aj5pVM81Z6x3J14AaABAg,Dude oh my god I use a freaking Galaxy S7 yes S7 for this reason alone.  Having a gd little flashing led to let you know you have a text or call is so important that I wont even join the current century.

When Carl said there wasn't ""enough innovation"" in the android space, I didn't expect him to counter it with light on the back. A foldable phone is radically different, but this is as different as the pixel back is from other phones.

I'm still going to refer to the Nothing phone as the Nothing Essential Phone. Why? Because the first Essential Phone only had the bare essentials. No bloat ware. Just what's needed to run.

For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.‚Äù Acts 2:38-39 KJV 

‚ÄúJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.‚Äù John 14:6 KJV 

‚ÄúHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.‚Äù John 3:36 KJV 

‚ÄúFor if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.‚Äù Matthew 6:14-15 KJV

‚ÄúAnd I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?‚Äù Luke 11:9-13 KJV

‚ÄúAnd Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.‚Äù John 6:35-40 KJV 

‚ÄúAnd fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.‚Äù Matthew 10:28-31 KJV

‚ÄúWhosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.‚Äù Matthew 10:32-33 KJV 

‚ÄúThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù
Romans 10:9-13 KJV 

‚ÄúJesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.‚Äù John 3:5-6 KJV

‚ÄúWho hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.‚Äù Colossians 1:13-20 KJV 

‚ÄúLook not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.‚Äù 
2 Philippians 2:4-11 KJV 

‚ÄúTake heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.‚Äù Matthew 6:1-21 KJV"

And on the software side they're a closed wall garden that forces you to pay an apple tax to buy products that are only useful if you already have spent thousands on other devices.

UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cYDxzBt9S5,I disagree completely.  Nothing was created by one of the original founders of OnePlus (Carl Pei) & has been in the business for years.  Just because he left his company to start a new one doesn‚Äôt take away his experience or knowledge of what sells & what doesn‚Äôt.   If anything he has a huge advantage going into the market & should be able to have a more concrete vision starting out vs an actual start up.  Selling a mid tier android phone without a headphone Jack or expandable memory when most android fans want this is a huge mistake.  Especially when OnePlus took those options away why would you buy from a new ‚Äústart up‚Äù when you can buy a phone with better specs from Samsung or Motorola for a similar price?  Just because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúnew‚Äù company doesn‚Äôt shield it from any criticism.

UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXyFnpdY_x,@Levy Roth Unless Tesla comes out with a phone and better software.
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXyAgLo6Ry,Another Essential Phone that will fail.
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXy7HUO2OA,"tech altar ‚Äúrevealed‚Äù before the mainstream, the oppo backing of oneplus. are they (karl pei) really an independent startup today?"
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXy159Ry_r,"@Levy Roth no, they just achieved their own design goals, but their goals are really bad sometimes."
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXxsV5eoL1,Nothing will amount to nothing.
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXxcpmclZ-,"Let me create a startup tomorrow & copy an existing phone's design to sell stuff. Let's watch the original designer watch how his design for which he wasn't paid or credited for, sells millions of units with no benefit to him"
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXxXFd1LZM,"Like idk about the hardware yet but they do have a lot of things going for them. Like it is run by the same guy that founded OnePlus and we know how that has gone,  also Nothing is just a rename of the company that made the Essential Phone so I'm assuming that they have their manufacturing etc sorted."
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXxOPaQ2u8,"@139 windows phones were crap, because Microsoft never supported them properly - they were mainly a quick grab for them"
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXwzQ4WFOn,"What competition? Right now, we only really have two types of phone, and only one of them being the sensible choice. If there was fair competition, windows phones would have succeeded."
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXwcdFi9VU,No one can take on Apple without the software ecosystem. Apple is near perfect.
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXwMsY4Z-2,"it's just an iPhone design-wise, the rest is just bells and whistles :)"
UgwhgFgRXJNZ5X9IScB4AaABAg.9cXvgzdLFc_9cXwHU1Gine,Yeah this company is going to fail hard
UgxuWfGylwhpTIS2Dop4AaABAg,There is a reason why back lighting was gone - no one will put the screen side on the desk.  The funcction is fun but not practical.
UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg,"My first thought is, can you change the colors of the back lights? But then I was thinking, if not, imagine how dope it would be if they came out with some cases that had strategically placed channels on the back to allow the light to shine through and maybe those channels are tinted to give you a different color. Honestly now I really like this design, like alot"
UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg.9cXvgyEhtze9ccDUSQcLxq,@√¶ what if its a single color LED just like on POCO F1
UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg.9cXvgyEhtze9cY0hYvWW47,Great idea!
UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg.9cXvgyEhtze9cY0KWqxqDl,Wow !! Even I thought whether the LED could change colors. But your solution is actually cooler. You can personalize the phone with a single color instead of a RGB light.
UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg.9cXvgyEhtze9cY09PliZww,RGB will be the next gen and cost $1000 lol.
UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg.9cXvgyEhtze9cXzulBtIA4,Already there are gaming phones with RGB lights and if this would've that RGB's then what makes this standout?? It'll again become an already in market thing ü§∑üèª
UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg.9cXvgyEhtze9cXznd-eV34,Honestly if they don't do that I'll bet you dBrand will with a skin

UgxZF_j_przO2MB6DgR4AaABAg.9cXvgyEhtze9cXwtbYsp7Q,"Changing colors will be on next gen probably!

Going all out on first gen product is not something companies want to do, also want to be subtle without going to call it a another RGB"
Ugxi42946U3R3TaNP2J4AaABAg,"If this'll be the android phone you daily drive, would you switch back to using ringtones?"

Ugza20ALbr8p7yveFux4AaABAg,So this video is all about nothing. I never thought I would say that.
UgzMJoX_9Ov-_NSLL2l4AaABAg,"What all we have seen of the Nothing phone 1 till now, the back design, LEDs, front display, the features,etc seems on point and just enough to draw attention of the customer.
I think Nothing is going to be massive hit in India. People are looking for a good 400-500 dollar phone. Oneplus used to fit that criteria but its in shambles right now. Just hoping that the software experience is also great. That would seal the deal for me atleast.
I have the ear 1 and I have not been disappointed by them. So hoping for another great product from Nothing"
Ugwy9hf_cyWUoQksYmp4AaABAg,Nothing to see here ..

UgzVARezXw9sdHA_sE14AaABAg,As an Op-1 and Op-z user I'm really excited to see what they've done interface wise. I hope they live up to the hype
Ugz_AH1YPxDFv59mfMN4AaABAg,He talking about oneplus? When saying left the original fanbase
UgxYFTK3GNu7XuuRqj14AaABAg,What kind of maniac sets their phones glass side down?

UgwtfxUJvXg7o2IfN_V4AaABAg,"Shut up Apple sheep, you lost all your credibility a few days ago."
UgwkonIas91YQfcv7o54AaABAg,Coooool
UgxF7xaWmpCICAYpD-R4AaABAg,"I think the design is appealing, but design only helps you so much. Performance wise I'm sure there's little to worry: Nothing's phone is probably best placed at a lower price point, which means that they have good and fully sufficient performance stats compared to entry level phones by the big dogs (or better). For the normal user, this is all fine.

I think the differentiating factor will be software and service integration. It's the main reason why I won't switch away from Apple anytime soon. I wonder whether they will build their own OS instead of doing an Android clone... this would be real interesting then."
UgzAmEZ1afK8czdaBlN4AaABAg,Watching this video on that familiar phone üòÇ
UgwsDCZeN-RMZL4yvGl4AaABAg,I would buy this in a heartbeat

Ugw6Qv3nLrxjy8vgcPV4AaABAg,I feel like the Nothing Phone's iPhone-centric design was deliberately designed to lure those who would have wanted to switch to an iPhone but didn't want to pay the extra money to actually switch to one.

Ugwj7Ednm0VQ3lWuXa94AaABAg,"6:33 Reminds me of One Plus. They started off as the flagship killer and gained a loyal customer base, but with time they started appealing to a broader customer base, to the point where they are indistinguishable from most modern flagships and their pricing."
Ugwj7Ednm0VQ3lWuXa94AaABAg.9cXvY6Mt2L59cY1sWW6Cqy,Thanks for stating it! I was pretty sure he meant OnePlus but haven't been paying attention to the market for a while so wasn't certain.
Ugwj7Ednm0VQ3lWuXa94AaABAg.9cXvY6Mt2L59cY1acs5_yf,@Atasna143xx I don't know why I feel all this is staged and nothing is secretly funded by BBK or even some Chinese investor. I have been following since oneplus 1 and used 3t and current 7t. After price increase and worst software bugs I was about to get s22 ultra. But with 8gen 1 hating issues I just put that on hold. In my country iphone 13 and oneplus 10 pro cost same üòÇüòÇ.. I might try nothing if it has good camera and price is low. Still we don't know about soc
Ugwj7Ednm0VQ3lWuXa94AaABAg.9cXvY6Mt2L59cY0gU_hJPF,"same can be applied to samsung.  they started with niche phones:   a camera-phone-camera,  a  pico-projector phone,  etc etc.  then  they surrendered to the average consumer."
Ugwj7Ednm0VQ3lWuXa94AaABAg.9cXvY6Mt2L59cY-dhA7gdT,A company can‚Äôt survive selling thin margin electronics to a niche set of users that don‚Äôt upgrade very often. The goal of the start up game is to eventually be profitable.

Ugwj7Ednm0VQ3lWuXa94AaABAg.9cXvY6Mt2L59cXwMKpMR9f,"@Atasna143xx yeah . Carl pei was one of the co founders and right after OnePlus Nord he left the company. And maybe it's coincidence but after that OnePlus released Nord 100 which was mediocre at best , OnePlus 8t and then in 2021 they went really downhill, and merged with oppo , replaced oxygen OS with color os"
Ugwj7Ednm0VQ3lWuXa94AaABAg.9cXvY6Mt2L59cXwGtRVefp,I always thought you could sell to larger customer base while still putting out creative looking and functioning phones...

It even adds a bit of character to their company imo."

UgyMoKu5l9zZP_cCgK54AaABAg.9cXvHPjewvt9cZXfFbbGUP,"@GH√òST there are lots of products which are ""pretty good for the price"". Nothing does - well, nothing - to differ."
UgyMoKu5l9zZP_cCgK54AaABAg.9cXvHPjewvt9cZXF90MNB1,"@Avichal Vishwakarma Unlike Nothing, Apple actually showed some real innovation when they joined the market, and maintained this course as long as was possible."
UgyMoKu5l9zZP_cCgK54AaABAg.9cXvHPjewvt9cZRw5deUfQ,"Agreed the approach is weird and off putting for a ""startup"".

UgyMoKu5l9zZP_cCgK54AaABAg.9cXvHPjewvt9cYXhGYRiUJ,"Exactly. Like it's totally fine if the phone is a transparent phone with lower price than a flagship. But the problem is, they pretend that it's something else, something revolutionary, totally new, never seen before, extraordinary and the most innovative phone ever. They pretend that it's the phone that will change the industry and a ""finally a worthy rival to iPhone"". Thus they raise the hype and expectations to the outer atmosphere just so that it gets so much social media coverage and more people talk about it and then the product doesn't turn out to be how they marketed it and then boom! Dead silence. That's what the OnePlus Nord was. Wayy too much hype, I thought they found something revolutionary, totally new (not that I didn't know what it was going to be). They hyped it up with episodes of documentaries by saying what was wrong with the industry and how their phone was going to be different. The phone launched and then after a few weeks everyone forgot about it, cause the phone didn't reach the hype and expectations."
UgyMoKu5l9zZP_cCgK54AaABAg.9cXvHPjewvt9cYWwi0iJIF,It's a crowded segment. They don't have the budget to get attention any way other than building hype. I'd rather pay less for the products than have to pay into a traditional marketing budget

UgyMoKu5l9zZP_cCgK54AaABAg.9cXvHPjewvt9cY8td-Lo9k,I actually didnt hear good things about the ear buds. There was a lot of hype around them but I heard the sound wasnt actually that nice. Makes me miss the days when tech reviews were more review and less promotion.

UgzUC7Xw9DXZYWuOm9Z4AaABAg.9cXukKkG1c_9cYDs117NPK,front looks more like a Samsung phone since the bezels are equal like with the S22 series. It probably uses a Samsung screen to get that equal bezel as Apple also uses a Samsung screen to get the equal bezel.
