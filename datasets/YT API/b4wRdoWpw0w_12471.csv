Please keep in mind that this comments section is very likely to have disinformation actors/trolls due to the nature of this conflict. It's likely not representative of actual opinions.
this just pathetic attempt to shutdown criticism of your post
And not just the comments section. This lot didn't age well.
"Ok, i'll watch out for the Russian disinformation Bots."
"Certainly the logistics problems were real.  But Russia's military know their mission is a lie from the start.  Ukraine was no threat to Russia.  As a result, not only have Russian soldiers not been motivated from the start, but their motivation will wane as the war drags on.  They don't want to die for something that doesn't benefit them, their families or the country.  It is Putin's war, for Putin's personal reasons."
Russian troops were lied to by Putin from the beginning of why they were going to Ukraine.  Of course these soldiers felt betrayed.  Would you fight and be willing to die for somebody who tricked you into battle?
Painted over their signs to say 'welcome to hell'😁
"History repeats, tanks at Kursk, also I bet Americans forces would have to study tik tok videos now, it amazes me that people don't believe that we can split the atom but can't work out battle tactics, have satellites, people that do logistics and studying armies  in foreign countries for years, also logistics is a certain struggle of lots of famous battles, Napoleon for one, and Von Clausewitz's 'on war' is a good book, like Sun Tzu but the opposite😁."
"Russia did NOT think Ukraine would fall quickly.
Nor were they trying to take the entire country."
"Russia needs to build deep underground supply bases and
Fire support bases at locations
That can support each other along
With commucations and radar and info. With bulldozers and
Backhoe it can be done at a very
Fast pace"
"Russia moves best in the winter
Because nothing on the other side
Can move with out leaving tracks
And knowing the move ments of
The other side tell u everything I
Look for Russia to take ukraine 
Before the next winter is over"
"About that. Ukraine is used to winter to. And no, no Russian soldier ever used on a regular basis the tactic of following tracks on the snow. Wich could be use against them too in any case"
4 months ago I wrote how wrong are you and you still are. Aren't you ashamed?
@sosiski and what do you belive it is going on?
@cat101 it can be seen out of your comment how limited you are. You don't even know what is happening 🤣.
He's correct? Russia had more land at the time this video was uploaded than what they have now. That's incredibly embarrassing for the ''2nd best military'' in the flattest and easiest terrain to fight in
When I first saw the Russian tanks driving to Ukraine I thought: “This is probably going to be over quickly?” Thankfully I was way wrong! Go Ukraine 🇺🇦
"только земля, а не угроза"
"I muchly enjoyed this video, it certainly is true that Russia has historically relied on Rail for logistics, and that was, is, and will always be their Achilles Heel in face of Modern Warfare
Slava Ukraine, 
and make no mistake, there will be massive tears in Ukraine at the loss of Boris, equal only to the Blessed Maggie, since Churchill as a Great Leader of the UK."
"Russian commanders have used maps of UKRAINE made in the 60s! Some of the Russian commanders used old maps of UKRAINE in the invasion, made in 1969 and did not indicate newer residential areas, such as Saltovka, a suburb of Kharkov, or water reservoirs. Russian is really outdated especially in (CARTOGRAPHY = MAPS)!"
How do you know this
Putin is a discrase to Russia and its people.
"If Russia actually wins this war (which seems to be the most likely outcome) then all of these ""professional"" military analysis videos on the conflict are going to feel so stupid."
"Not really, even if russia wins this would still be true"
"@Михаил Михайлов Saying they never wanted to enter Kyiv while they were simultaneously attempting to enter Kyiv, and the fact that it's imperative for a military victory that the capital be captured, is pretty sad."
Failed? How about now?
Yeah. Russia had more land at the time of this video being uploaded than they have now. That's hilarious for the supposed 2nd best military
"This video only talks about the so called ""phase 1"" of the invasion."
"Let’s just hope that Putin doesn’t have cancer, and is not going to unleash nuclear weapons out of desperation. I blame his ex wife for everything. She should’ve told him that his dick was huge, or at least above the global average. The guy would’ve been more chill in everything he does."
Aged like piss
Hello troll
Well that didn't age well
Okay...??
pu tain’s soviet manurers on a potato a day in a cozy gulag to a trench with nvkd “encouraging” the cannon fodder
Like 83
"Uhhhmm , Russian logistics looking pretty good today, how about a follow up video demonstrating how wrong you were with this one. Your others are great so I’d either take this one down or post an apology to the Russian Army who ,against all odds and with no other country brave enough to join them , have the glory of victory to sustain them."
Lol 😆
"The shelling didn't begin right then. Ukraine had been shelling their own people for 8 years before Russia got involved.

It's like this channel was scripted by the White House"
@Rick74 it isnt
That is a lie.
Nice pyramids. You part of the club? As above so below. What’s next? Vaccines are good for humanity and your government cares about you yet they don’t give you health insurance. Crowley would be proud. Lets go support the Fascists and SLAVA Ukraini and the USA.
cringe
Aged like milk
Aged milk is yogurt and I liked it.
@Júnior Cruvinel Proof it troll
It's obviously propaganda
What to give Putin a headache.  Talk about his nuclear power plants being blown up.   You can go online and comment it on their web sites. Talk about the war.
"Forgot to mention Ukraine has also lost the majority of its ports, most productive agricultural and industrial regions, all gas/oil deposits, and a majority or its energy supply and infrastructure (not to mention things like heavily damaged railway infrastructure, almost all military industrial capacity etc.)"
@Aidan Macias and that’s exactly the point lol - all of these should be working in it’s favor and yet it’s still losing…
"True, but since Ukraine is fighting on home territory it doesn't need to worry about being ambushed. it know exactly where the front is, where area denial tools like mines are, has no IEDs to deal with from resistance movements, and its logistics convoys are basically unchallenged until they get to the front line.

and their massive land border with poland facilitates this as well."
"Who wrote these crazy articles?
😂😂😂"
This isn't an article.
"Ukraine has lost 20% of its territory which accounts for 25% of 2020 GDP (largest country in Europe) in 3 months with an army of ~500 thousand while Russia sent ~150 thousand. Note the Ukrainian army has been supplied, trained and prepared for the last 8 years by the collective west, and fights by using the population and cities of the Donbas as live shields and inherited 40% of all Soviet military equipment (the more modern models as Ukraine was front line)."
"@Михаил Михайлов  without good logistics shit would be over already.

If the Ukranian army was just disorganized and had no logistics to speak of, then Russia would have already taken over and the Ukranian Armed Forces would have become less like an army and more like an insurgency."
"@Aidan Macias Nice assumption that ukraine has actual logistics, i laugh big time"
@Aidan Macias those  soviet era stuff is showing its true colurs i battlefield
"majority of Russian equipment is just upgraded soviet stuff anyway.

and yes, Ukraine is being supplied by the west, but those weapons can only get to the front through proper logistics."
"And to add some clarifying points on my stats:

The Ukraine government has itself acknowledged 20% loss in territory - this can be found through a 2 minute google search and on most major news sources.

The formal army has 250k, the territorial defense force is 150k and the national guard has 100k (500k total). Ukraine further has 900k reserves and has called 3 rounds to mobilization including woman most recently. The 500k is a low estimate.

There are documents about military modernization released by the Ukrainian government and think tanks about the quantity of military equipment inherited from the USSR (40%). This can also be found through a 2 minute google search."
they will fight to the last man to defend there country
"on the internet, that is"
The failed Russian invasion is like a Hearts of Iron IV invasion but you lose your entire invasion force because you didn't figure out how to keep them supplied.
Ah yes the age old tale of HOI4 players wanting to go back in time to smack hortler on the head and tell him how to win the war and conquer the world with >muh proper logistiks
It’s that’s true though how come Russia can still supply its artillery Corp and Units with ammo and their use of air units are still around the clock for the most part. Ukraine isn’t joking about needing more heavy weapons.
"All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws. And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:
Daniel 4:28…

If in one of the world’s most reputable episodes, someone seems to take it fairly personal to be told that the Prince works, something quite bizarrely strange, but  equally astounding seemed to have been happening somewhere in the vast arrays of land on the surface of the earth, and it is: The King eats grass. 

The King eats grass? 
Who would have thought something like this could have taken place in real life? 
Someone must have been out of his mind to even imagine something like that, but where’s the King? 

A provocative speech was in, and by itself sufficient to land him that spot, and so much so, before he even shut his mouth, God has already decided his fate. 
If you think that such a dazzling display of grandiosity in a green field, surrounded by animals while grazing, was sufficient enough to tame the arrogance of future Kings, you probably have another think coming, his immediate successor did exactly the same thing. 

God didn’t seem to have been one to mess with in this regard, since his very own son who has succeeded him, was equally rewarded with something quite satisfying, proportional with his dazzling displays of arrogance. 
Daniel was aghast, and couldn’t believe it for a good minute when confronted with the stupidity of the son, knowing that he knew what his dad had gone through for the very same reason. 

Let’s look at Daniel 5:18: 
O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down. But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified: Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written. And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain. And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.
It’s quite funny the most ridiculous blunder of modern times involved those who are very religious at the very top. 
And they even quote their respective scriptures to justify the unjustifiable, and indefensible. Ain’t that amazing? 
If God were to let everything slip by, while the policies are terrible though they’re purported to be done with his blessings, what the end result will most likely be? 

Those who are getting pulverized under the guise of God’s blessing, will keep getting pummeled, since no one can stop the Pharaohs in their primes. 
So, keep running deep into the parted sea, and reassure yourself you will be back with the captives, but you won’t."
"Destruction  and Asphyxiation 2 war methodologies. 
USA use destruction  example Faluja in Irak.
Russia use Asphyxiation  Example Mariupol.  Cut water and electricity. 
Cut supplie lines,"
"Fallujah was against terrorists, was done with the help of the Iraqi government, and had civilian exit lines.

meanwhile when civilian corridors are created in Ukraine, Russia plants landmines along the path."
This video didn't age well did it?
@Harvey Wilde bro u copy pasted
Yes it did. Russia still cannot sustain a long line of supplies. It has to capture towns and create new supply bases. It is uncapable of advancing a hundred kilometers.
"No it still relevant, Russia is forced to retreat in small territories close to it's borders and still fail at encirclemnt"
I thought it was fireworks when I first seen it
"In the Pacific Ocean, submarines in the US Navy would target Japanese supply ships rather than the destroyer escorts. One torpedo could ignite the fuel on board a Japanese supply ship and make it an inferno."
"All that money invested in just to feed, shelter, and clothe that military force in the field on the border with the Ukraine.All that army pay and no where to spend it except in poker games."
OMG did this age BAD or WHAT??? LOL
@Harvey Wilde Coping seething dilating
@Anónimos Alcohólicos With what???
@Harvey Wilde cope much?
No? Russia is incapable of sustaining a supply line 50 kilometres beyond their depo
"Why you don't listen to people who don't understand military.

Russians doing just fine with logistics and still eating up ground if rather slowly.

Its the Ukrainians that are taking heavier losses."
"Ah yes, let's listen to djinn. He clearly went to college /s."
"Okay sure, but this video only covers the so called ""phase 1"" of the attack. More specifically the Battle of Kyiv or Kiev. Which was total disaster for them."
"Awesome production 👌 For anyone who would like. An even deeper dive into this subject and similar ones, I would like to suggest the channel Perun. Excellent and informative, a bit simpler visual style, more like a podcast or presentation. Each video usually 30-60 minutes once a week. Ish."
I like how war communication on social media emphasizes speed over secrecy. Ukraine may be the most effective example
04:00 wow the rusian government have 20 trains?
Yea. Pretty much.
The ORCA and Baracuda autonomous subs should be able to blow the underwater pillars of the Krimea bridge... a major military supportline for Russia in it´s invasion of Ukraine.
Low-quality west propaganda to cover up neo-nazi activity in the ukraine..
also doesn't Wagner have nazis in it too?
"this is not a political video, it's about logistics."
This war is not about neo-nazu bs. Please research the actual purpose if this invasion! Or in fact the purpose of invading in the first place.
You're looking at this from an American prospective not Russian. The Russians used hardened Chechin fighters and combined them with young Russian soldiers  to form the bulk of the early forces. The AZOV and Ukranian forces had most of their people in the Donbass but were eventually surrounded in cauldrons. Putin saved the Orthodoxy and Christianity from the globalists. The Davos crowd is next.😺
"This war is not cultural and religious. Try to search the exact reason for this conflict, or the purpose of invading in the first place."
"Would you geniuses like a paper towel to wipe the egg off of your faces ? 5/31/ 2022 , it's apparent now that Russia has succeeded , the war is going pretty much as planned . The Ukraine army is being over run , soldiers are surrendering all over the place , even US / western media is admitting that the future is extremely bleak for the the Kiev / Nazi side ."
"Also, how do you define nazi? it's very clear the Russian government has a warped view of history and probably a warped view of what nazism is."
it's going right as planned. the ten day war that took 4 months to get to 1/5 of the territory
"Putin’s National Security advisors vouched (timidly) for Ukraine’s right to sovereignty. Not one of his experts, in their hearts, backed this military operation."
9:28 Would be interesting if russians wanted it to happen or not.. 🤔 If they play Armycraft or Army Tycoon then it might be part of plan against ukrainians. 😐
Aging badly.
@Harvey Wilde bruh moment
@Rick74 What claim did I make that wasn't backed by evidence?
@Michael Thomas You're the one making claims without evidence.
"The Russian people must be proud of Putin, he has managed to turn his armed forced into "" Shoplifters """
no they aren’t
Very sad. War is never the answer. Only man would build a beautiful society only to tear it down with mad men at the helm.
Blah blah blah ......
"All I can hear you saying ""Blah blah blah ......"""
"this war is being paid for by western nations, buying fuel from russia; giving money and equipment to ukraine. Paid for by western nations."
@Harvey Wilde they're talking about Germany and Italy still buying Russian oil and gas.
???
"That headline didn't age well. It's obvious now that from any perspective that Russia is going to sweep the Nazis and mercenaries off it's doorstep. Lies and propaganda don't win wars. Zelensky will will milk donations until the last moment then scurry off with his ill gotten gains.
As for your grasp of the actual historical background, logistics and tactics..... I can only point out that running your mouth on social media doesn't bestow an expertise on anything."
Russia failed both kyiv and kharkiv.
Putin has betrayed the Russian people. Putin is a Traitor (предатель)
"I mean, you called it a failure but they seem to be going pretty strong now."
"@Ron Chum ""As part of the negotiations"" 

Yeah. Japan didn't lose the battle of Midway. It was simply withdrawing in the hopes of a negotiated peace /s

No"
"Of course their doing good, they abandonned kharkiv, so now more troops are concentrated, but by that extent germany was doing pretty good when all the army defended Berlin."
"@Ron Chum Wait I'm gonna stop there bud I hate when this conflict is describe with the word ""neo-nazi"" and other nazism bs.

That meant you don't know anything about this conflict history and the history of the soviet union.

And before you say anything about racial bs. Every country has a ""neo-nazi"" organization. The US have the Republican so on and so forth. This conflict is not about that.

It has a bigger agenda and I proud that the world agrees what they're doing is wrong and step in and help. Yes even China."
"@Harvey Wilde Yeah they withdrew from around Kiev as part of negotiations. Their new phase seems to be focused on securing the sovereignty of the Donbass republics, and some extra morsels from the neo-nazi terrorists. I'm seeing a non-stop stream of strategic kalibr strikes, mass Ukrainian surrenders, and straight winning. I would indeed call that kicking butt against a nation with a 60mil population and an area the size of the northeast US. 

But hey, the western global banking empire is determined to fight this war to the last Ukrainian, so I'm glad the Ukrainians are losing. The trajectory is rather a total Ukrainian loss, or Ukraine as a rump state. The funniest part is seeing Poland sneakily trying to take western territory they want under the guise of ""mutual sovereignty""."
"@Ron Chum ""kicking butt"" Isn't the phrase that I would describe them. They failed miserably in Kyiv (or Kiev) and Kharkiv (or Kharkov), also about loose their foothold on Kherson as well.

Of course they are going to progress, I mean they literally have more of everything compared to Ukraine.

The so called ""Phase 1"" was a total failure. With now only focusing on Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast. Which is way less ambitious than they're ""phase 1"" plan."
"Boy, I bet Russia is glad the CIA had nothing to do with the Ukraine gaining an advantage, or that could have gone, well, ... badly."

Another Western video which did not age well whatsoever.
@American Pepe Such strawman.
"@American Pepe Interesting. I could have sworn this was about NATO expansion, the arming of Azov/Neo-Nazi militants and the Petro Dollar. Also, I didn't know I should be concerned over the ""reemergence of the USSR"", being they were far less imperialistic than the United States and Western European powers."
"Most people felt for Russia's RUSE. Now Russia is kicking butt!!! they have taken the east. by using diversions. Ukraine thought that Russia was going to invade Kiev but no that was not the plan the plan was to keep as many Ukrainians Unites Ocuppied thinking that Russia was going to invade kiev, meanwhile Russia was Kicking Butt and taking names in the Donbass region and in the south. now russia is making a push towards the river and has surrounded over 20 thousand Ukrainian soldiers. and has wiped out over 90% of all azov Nazi Unites."
Please use punctuation correctly.
"I really love your videos, but this is just hypocrisy and propaganda. I just wanna state first, before you call me pro-russian, that I don't support the war and at the same time I don´t support neither side. Both sides are imperialistic, ideologized and fanatic warmongers. So, yeah, everyone has seen that russian army has many flaws, but if it was so weak and failed as many sources who just don't stop making fun of it, belittling it, etc; than Ukranians wouldn't be having this very hard time fighting it, nor would many parts of the Donbas be occupied by now. You should be more unbiased and report the whole truth. if it was a US invasion you'd likely be praising it and glorifying it. It's so hypocritical that many media sources, people, social media users are so good at pointing fingers about civilians, war crimes, moral compass, etc; but they don't care when the US and other western countries do exactly the same, if not worse. You should check those 'logistic problems' too in the US army when they bomb the sh1t out of middle eastern countries and many other countries in the world, when they bomb hospitals, when they kill children, when they destroy infrastructure, when they kill civilians, etc."

"What's this video had anything to do with that?






Also bye.............."
The logistics failed because the troops was lied to.
"The war has only begun. Do not underestimate the Kremlin’s ability to improve; they won’t make these mistakes forever. Do not underestimate the durability of their hatred of the west. They expect a weak civilization to buckle under their attacks. One day, we will need to make sacrifices to survive."
What ability? They do not have the industry to replace their losses on a short term notice.
Thank That the Us is more powerful and cant defend from any Agressive invader like Russia or China
"The attack on Ukraine by Russia is to bring back the USSR, insure political future of Putin  and increase fuel price to generate huge economy. However God is a God of justice so Russia got the opposite of their evil objectives."
Yep the Russian military turned out to be the joke of the world getting their butts kicked in Ukraine. Literally no country is afraid of them. Finland would destroy them in a conventional war. They are laughably weak. Against the US they wouldn't last hours. Any country importing their weapons has to be seriously considering switching to another source.
"Weird being that Russia now controls Eastern Ukraine, it's Black Sea coast, and has captured nearly the entire Azov Battalion in Mariupol. And all done with a tiny percentage of their military, with restraint."
@Василий Иванов They did last 10 years against Afghanistan but that was the USSR. Russia is very weak compared to the former USSR. The whole world can see this.
wouldn't last hours? like afghanistan?

"Wild that Russia wanted to show its ass so strongly to the rest of the world. Or maybe Putin simply didn't understand how much it has been outclassed since the Soviet era. Georgia was more recent proof that they simply aren't a threat, compared to something like China. Nukes, sure, but those cost money and time to maintain...
Also wild that our intelligence services have been caught flat footed so often. Maybe hiring based not on qualifications, and instead on political displacement, hasn't been the best option."
"how crazy is this conflict, that a civilian can analyze and break down an otherwise classified subject and throw it back in the enemies face...."
"Nothing on MSM that matches this.

"With all the ""vaunted"" logistics that the US seems to have had and ostensibly, still has, the US lost really badly in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Maybe (and hopefully) Putin's Russia will lose big-time as well.  But clearly, having superior logistics doesn't guarantee victory. Perhaps, superior logistics provides a chimera of strength & success for a much longer time and costing much much more in the longer run, resulting in painful and tragic losses at the end.

I like your analysis and presentation hope more of your videos pop up.
"Well, if they followed the imperial tradition of hatching a false flag lie, invade, scorch the earth & everything that moved, then steal the resources...

yeah sure, Russia totally failed"
"We should all make a crowd founding and give a few bucks. The guys that shoot Putin in the head will be rewarded with XX millions from the found.

Isn’t this the same voice of HAI?
"Russia did well and flexed her muscles. All goals will be achieved. Ukraine is suffering due to voting for Zelensky. Don’t vote for the wrong man and Russia won’t punish you. Don’t listen to Russia and you will get punished. NATO and Western civilians can be punished if they provoke Russia. Nuclear war is what the West will have if they spook Russia. Don’t blame Russia when your dead, blame your idiot leaders you voted for!"
@Diego Vasquez Germany is cooperating by buying Russian oil and gas
"@Al_Pastor Bradley we all feel bad that Ukraine created a political disaster by voting for extremist Zelensky. Poroshenko was also a bad choice for Ukrainian voters. All blame lies in Poroshenko , Zelensky and Ukrainians that voted for those dumb and dumber “politicians”. The former a greedy oligarch , the latter a comedian . Had Ukraine been wise and cooperated with 🇷🇺 Russia … there would be no need for the special military operation ."
"Now I know what makes Putin's special military operation so special. He pulled out his pants to show that he has no genitals at all.

Great video. really informative but please stop editing like this. sit still and read a script. looks like you have tourettes

I was part of a group of about 300 at its height dedicated solely to surveying unencrypted russian radio channels and reporting information back to our contacts with the Ukrainian Military. We knew the VDV had been shot down some 5 minutes before either country's governments did. (Because we heard it happening)
"Girl Guides routinely put more planning and preparation for a weekend camping trip than the entire Russian general staff put into planning the invasion of Ukraine.  Mind you, they were given their marching orders by a psychotic, tactical imbecile with massive delusions of grandeur."
Outstanding presentation. Well done.
They thought they were come in and steam roll them like the US did in desert storm
"An explanation isn't really necessary, the past 50-60 years provide ample evidence that an ill-equipped but determined foe can prevail against a so-called Super Power. Just look at Vietnam, Afghanistan against both Russia and the United States and even the Iraq War. These actions have proven it's best to negotiate  with a DETERMINED Nation!"

We are watching
Russia invading Ukraine is like me doing anything:
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Great video but like any other media in the west it's hard to know what to trust. I get the propaganda from both sides of the conflict. Which Im willing to be t most in the west do not. The video is an eye opener even if only half is true.

Slava Ukrainian Armed Forces & good luck u can win this war easily as quick as a lightning against lowly pale and very weak & tired Putin Russia Federation Army who invaded Ukraine but all the attacks all failed repulse & toppled always by determined Ukrainian army defenders forces the Victor's in any battles from land air &:sea battles inside Ukraine territory
This video didn't age well.
@Harvey Wilde Whoa.... nice burn
"@Captain Dak Hello Thrawn! This video only covers the so called ""phase 1"" of the invasion, which is occupation of Kyiv or Kiev and other major Ukrainian center. Which I don't know you knew about it, but it was a major failure. Due to what? logistics.

Putler vision this invasion to be like the Blitzkrieg. surprise attack and occupation of Ukraine capital. But due to the poor logistic on early stages of the war they failed, and even retreated for only focusing on Donetsk and Luhansk oblast."
"@Harvey Wilde it claimed Russian logistics failed in Ukraine. Clearly the logistics hasn't failed given the troops are still able to capture territory, artillery shells and missiles are still raining down on Ukrainian positions and Russian vehicles still have fuel to keep moving. Entire Lugansk has been captured.

This video was just western narrative Wendover edition."
@Harvey Wilde ok
@Gaming With Mine Toy Go on then!

kyiv is pronounced Keiv.  2 Syllables.
"AFAIK in Russian (and most European languages) its pronounced Kiev, but in Ukrainian it's pronounced Kyiv (Київ in Ukrainian). In English both pronunciations are used, and both are correct. Due to the current invasion, English language sources switched to the Ukrainian pronunciation and spelling, because nearly all English language sources are pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian."
Well damnit! Out of all of the creator's advertisement's yours just made me go get a subscription to Curiosity Stream!!! Love you guy's work
Its funny you don't have pictures of the CIA in Ukraine in 2013  causing the overthrow of the elected government of Ukraine.
"@Tomorrow We Live Yes, why even the pictures from a ""supposedly"" secret operation."
It's not funny they don't have pictures of something that never happened
If Russia was in Mexico like the USA was in Ukraine would we NOT fight the Russia????????Wake up Joe you not in the middle east anymore!!!!!!!!This is the boarder of Russia
@Rick74 bruh
Okay gramps. Time to take your medicine.
They fd up their own country now they wanna f up yours
"Logistics IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT for anything your trying to do, SHUT UP, Logistics DID NOT FAIL russias Invasion"

"Ukrainians are the best people in the world, with best culture and unique language! Soon all Europe will speak Ukrainian language! Most cool and brave are ukrainians! I am proud Ukrainian, because I am from Ukraine and from nowhere else!  The rest nations have to learn from Ukrainians!Slava Ukraini!!!."
As long as there in money to be made in the manufacturing of weapons there will always be the need for wars. if there was as much money to be made in the building of houses then that is what they would be doing that instead. Wars consume vast quantiles of natural resorts and there is money to be made in manufacturing of weapons to be used in wars.  There is not mush money to be made in building homes for people to live in. How dull! Eventually Putin wants a beach front home. Hard to do when most the country you control is under snow most the year around. Will someone please give Putin a beach front house. He is tired of the snow that occupies his country most of the year. He is bored. He has to do something. What ever power he has is not enough. Maybe he desire for power is  is a disease we all have to deal with.  Other dictators have had the same problem.

"Some aspects of this video are wrong, and/ or pushing western propaganda. It claims that Russia tried to make it to Kiev to oust the president & set up a puppet government. Russia clearly stated they never intended to go to Kiev, so claims of their failure are moot. It also pretends that the president is not already a puppet installed by the West in the last farcical election."

"let put the crimes committed by vice president joe biden, the usa for sending biden and the insurrection in Ukraine in 2014.  the ukrainian government and military are also guilty along with the usa CIA for killing civilians in eastern ukraine , 40,000 plus since 2014.  it is fine you want to charge russia with war crimes but you need to also charge the usa and ukraine and their leaders with war crimes.  We are tired of only hearing one side to these events.  I was an american in lugansk during these events happening and we believe in equal treatment to be shown for these atrocities .also we see no need for the USA embassy in Ukraine as they directly stated that they are not there to help american citizens and do not protect american citizens from the most corrupt government in Europe, as my wife was crossing the border going into ukraine a month before the conflict when the ukrainian border guards who are part of the ukraine government removed her off the bus at the border crossing near kharkiv and stole her money and cell phone.  this incident was reported to the usa embassy in kyiv who said they do not want to offend the ukraine government by taking sides with the americans who were robbed by the ukraine government, quoting them as saying to report the crime to the local police, which is idiotic it is like reporting homeland security violations to your local police who have no jurisdiction over them, we went to the city large police station who refused to take the report of the crime.  More corruption from the local police.  the russian FSB new version of the KGB are idiots who are like the ukraine SBU a bunch of losers who thrive on illegal activities and stealing as they had also stole my passport and other things."

"I thought youtube was a rabbithole full of mediocre, mindless middlebrow nonsense. And then I watched this excellent video produced within days of the invasion describing the failure of Russia's logistics. Subscribed"
"One man bring death and destruction to regulate people both ukrain and Soviet people,should he be hold accountable to his crimes? Or the world turn blind eyes?"
"The Ukrainians need to get their own logistics into better condition. 
  A better national ROAD system to move military logistics AND rail lines would help."
"""Know thy enemy. "". The Ukrainians have had years to figure the Russians out BUT Ukrainians have changed since 2014 and the Russians haven't seemed to notice.
    The Russians seem to think Ukraine is still little more than the Soviet Republic it once was and the ""Bumpkins"" they sneeringly like to refer to Ukrainians as.  SURPRISE !!!"

"Oh, I know a lie from westerns. Those movies always portrayed men as running things when in actuality early western towns were more egalitarian, with women being the most responsible for running saloons, brothels, general stores, schools, etc. Women pretty much ran the boom town scenes. And from this, Wyoming actually became the first US territory to allow women to vote in 1869."

Who you talking to?
"Surrounding Kiev seems to have been a distraction not a target. Looking at the objectives, would taking control of Kiev made any sense? Seeing as the people there would not be looking at Russian troops as liberators, as is the case in areas where the majority of fighting has taken place. I'd say the real targets are from Kharkiv to Transnistria."
"@whatjip Seems strange for Kiev to be the main target, only to leave it without much of any real fight."
It is astounding how well this video has stood up two months later.

"Those live ones, the ones that they're not on the bunker/shelter are pre-recorded (for safety reason, of course). But still it is a good way to taunt Kremlin of their failures."
I don’t support Russia but I think that Russia will eventually win because they have a lot of resources but who knows
@Kevin mcCallister that would imply they plan to keep it going for years
I think that Russia will keep drafting men for the war tbh
What are the use of resources if they can't even make it to the battlefield? (Russian convoys being decimated)
"Putin...the only person EVER to merge Communism and Nazism...into his

"Let Putin’s Russia fail and fall. A nation with a population who does not defend democracy, free journalism and independent justice system deserve to fall due to their failures to stand up against wrongs. Don’t help them by informing where their failures are, they don’t deserve that guidance due to the atrocities they cause on innocents!"

"@NoTraceOfSense if so, then give an example of the successful conduct of hostilities by the United States or NATO over the past 60 years in urban conditions, without resorting to carpet bombing)"
"This and that are two different things.

The logistical advantages range from the experience gained by running bases around the world for decades to simple things like palletized logistics.

The result of these advantages is that we delivered the first shipments of a recent batch of military aid a mere 48 hours after said aid was authorized.

And _this isn’t even our final form!_"
Russia Has Many spies In Ukraine. Many of our High tech weapons are being sent back to Russia. Although  the Russians had a very good Idea how the Javlin missle works. They now have the actaul object including software and Repair parts.

I think Putin and the Kremlin weren’t expecting such strong resistance. This is reminding me of the Soviet-Finnish Winter war of 1939-1940.
"Russia's ""special mission"" to terra form the Ukraine."
"Angry commenters saying this is propaganda don’t understand how EXTRMELY important logistics is in war. Yes, men can overwhelm, but logistics are what allow for CONSISTENCY in the success of operations."
The Russian military has turned into a bunch of murderous thugs
"Here's a comment, Over a month has past and you've been proven wrong. Will you publish anything stating why you got it so wrong?"
He's not wrong. The complete failure of their logistic led to the utter ass failure of phase 1 of the invasion.
Nothing he published has been wrong and it’s been over a month and he’s still not wrong
because he wasn't wrong ?
I just wanna say this Ukraine is in a war against putin and everyone who supports his regime not against the Russian people and I know that may not stand for all Russian people but at the end of the day they are just humans to just trying to live like us

"@LBE | Savant Rouble's value is artificial. 
Nominal upkeeping currency from fall with help of reserves is not the same as currency being in demand and therefore having value.
The real value of rouble is around 180 to USD. Russian economy is in shambles, and if you live in Russia soon you will see it, when stocked supplies start to dwindle"
"@xxxYYZxxx that’s because the initial fall is over. The ruble will regain some value, but not to the point of recovery."
Russia is failing and the Russian army is failing so bad it’s embarrassing
"The time has long since passed that the rest of the civilized world, led by the United States of America, firmly stand up to this regime of genecidal war criminals.  Vlad and his corrupt supporters can only make threats because that is all they are capable of, instilling fear.  However all it shows is that they are simply the boy that cries ""wolf"".  The entire world is laughing at the inept fools that are being embarrassed by what everyone thought was a completely unmatched opponent.  They even lost their naval flagship in the most laughable way. 

But making continued empty threats only raises tensions and puts our nuclear deterrence on high alert where an accident can happen - not that those cowards in the Kremlin would even seriously consider making any move that would incur the wrath of the US Armed Forces.  We need to move forward with a strategic military operation to remove everyone in leadership at the Kremlin, arrest and bring them before a world court for crimes against humanity.  Then we can instil properly vetted Russian patriots that would be more compliant to the wishes of the US while getting Ukraine into NATO."
"because they are corrupted and steal anything they can. i was in the Romanian army in the communism. our commanders stole our food as food was very hard to find. we were like a little North Korea. not as bad, but bad enough. also we were not well trained,we were mostly use as free work force. i probably shot under 200 rounds with my akm in 16 months. and 5 with our marksman riffle. im sure russians commanders are more interested in getting rich then in fight anyone."
This is propaganda. I don't care how good or bad the Russian army is. This is propaganda
@RefalaStas I just told you I'm wrong

lmao what.......
"Kiev is the Russian pronunciation, they use Kyiv as a way to recognize Ukrainian sovereignty of the city."

also like to point out others understanding the truth aren't actors..... this propaganda u pump is truly terrible. What kind of americans say if u have your own opinion u must be a actor. This is literally unamerican and against our constitution. this what america has come to??? sad
You are not coherent or very convincing. What about this piece do you believe to be factually wrong?
why when murica does this like they have over 200 times sense ww2 do we pretend its ok only to be so critical when others do? are we really this disconnected from the truth is the real question. We focus on others as a distraction from the things we do.
I like how this video emphasizes the strengths of the Russian army. Underestimating an enemy is a sure way to commit suicide.
"It is disgusting how Russia acts, involving the US government sending arms to Ukrainian forces to aid them. Putin threatens all who involve themselves, and I fear that something worse than war will happen within the next few months. Thank you for finding as much credible information as possible so that we rock dwellers can understand fully what is happening"
Congrats; YouTube and all the experts have schooled Putin on western warfare tactics and what he is doing wrong.  Why can't you people just keep your mouths shut.   Loose lips sink ships.  Have you all gone mad?
I think Russian inteligence would have a much clearer understanding than what a civilian is able to compile
"This accusation wrong and insulting. The Russians know how to do better, it is jsut that their demoralized troops, lack of training and corruption have led to this. Now that the issues are known, they will try to change them. Do you seriously think this channel is moreeducated on military matters then all the officers in the entire army of Russia? 

That is not to say Russia has not acted incompetent, they have, and appear to have continued in doing so."
Congrats; YouTube and all the experts have schooled Putin on western warfare tactics and what he is doing wrong.  Why can't you people just keep your mouths shut.   Loose lips sink ships.  Have you all gone mad?

It is not that easy as it sounds
Slava Ukraini
Soon Russia will unleash their hypersonic potatoes
NATO may have pushed this war.. We kept poking the bear russia in the eye until it finally lashed out.. We should never have kept expanding..
The Ukraine crisis started when Ukraine wanted to sign a trade agreement with the EU back in 2013. Nothing to do with NATO and even if there had been no expansion Russia would have reacted the same.
"Nobody was ""Expanding"" all the eastern countries that joined Nato did so out of their own will."
Bot moment
"Nice video, shared with my peers. I would offer a slightly different way of comparing western forces with Russian. Western forces let TACTICS lead logistics, not strategy. Strategy occurs at Centcom, tactics is what happens in the battle field."
"Great video. I'm Finnish. I used to kinda want to visit russia some day. Now, I will never cross the border without an assault rifle. Luckily our government has woken up to what a shitstain of a country russia is and we're joining NATO with Sweden. This war has backfired on russia on an unprecedented level. They don't have the capability to produce any modern tech or precision equipment domestically and now imports of all of that has been blocked. They're screwed and they've gone 50 years back in time in terms of what they can produce. And their economy is ruined. I'm excitedly waiting for pictures of people queuing for bread like they did right before the soviet union collapsed. And people using horses and other animals to move around since they can't even maintain or produce cars anymore.
I hope nothing but misery and collapse of the government for russia. Let them stew in their own s**t they've created."

"A month later, Russia has not run out of food or ammo, and the Azov SS are stuck inside an old soviet tomb with access to neither.  Great breakdown, hope CNN+ hires you 👍🤣"
"@whatjip There is a ton of misinformation here. 

Majority of high priority Ukranian targets (air force, air defense, ammunition depots, biolabs and military infrastructure) were destroyed in the opening weeks.  Once the necessary infrastructure in Kiev was taken out, those troops were moved to encircle the UAF main force and create a cauldron.  To move them any sooner would have left a flank exposed.  

UAF had some success with roadside ambushes in the phase 1 of the conflict, when both armies were on the move. That phase is over and we're in phase 2 now.  Russians have fully encircled them, and both armies are now static, so the ambushes are not the issue anymore.  It's a battle of artillery now, and Russian one has longer range than the old gear UAF uses.  Also, all Russian battle groups have EMT weaponry too, which has been used to shut down UAF/NATO coms.

Since the start of phase 2, their rate of fire has increased thus disproving the propaganda that says they are low on ammo.  UAF is unable to escape.  The goal is to capture them alive, as there are a lot of US/UK/NATO officers in these bunkers, and they are HVTs that Russians intend to capture for war crime tribunals.  Attempts have been made to rescue them via low flying helicopters, all of which were shot down.

If UAF was having the success your propaganda tells you it's having, Elensky would not begging for other countries to send troops and create a path out for UAF out of the cauldron.  He also would not be begging for a no fly zone.  

The trapped Azov Nazis you are hyped to defend are not going anywhere.  They are the ones who are running out of ammo and food, as it's impossible to send supplies to them.  NATO will not allow them to surrender and have their guys put on trial.  They will be stuck in that bunker until they starve or Russians drop busters on them and turn the bunker into a tomb.  And good riddance.  Anyone who enlists to help an army full of Nazis with SS armbands deserves this fate."
"@Кот Василий Meh... I already guessed that their currency will stabilized after some time. I mean the Russian government still have reserves. But due to sanctions Russia's will want other currency, but no one want Russia's currency."

v putinhead needs to be brought to trial for war crimes! We are witnessing a modern-day holocaust and not directly intervening to stop it!  putinhead and NATO will fight to the death of their last Ukrainian pawn.   putinhead wants to make Ukrainians suffer until they feel like they must be russians.  Developing thorium nuclear energy 50 years ago would have cut the legs off the oil producing authoritarian states and putinhead.

There was simply not enough information to draw such a conclusion. It was *impossible to get enough information* at the time.

Also the fact that Ukraine were able to destroyed so many Russian tanks kinda proved that the logistics didn’t failed. Otherwise how on earth did Ukraine were able to destroyed so many Russian tanks inside Ukraine 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"@Harvey Wilde They failed to take Ukraine by storm but was that because they failed with logistics?

If the Ukrainian resistance is more than expected then that’s not because Russia failed with logistics. If logistics failed then you wouldn’t see much fighting in the first place, either you’ll just see a bunch of abandoned equipments without much fighting or they will just retreat before they were able to get to anywhere.

Also logistics shouldn’t even be a problem… Ukraine is not that big and is surrounded mostly by Russia. There are plenty of options available for Russia to resupply their forces. 

Its not like how Germany invaded Soviet in WW2 that they were unable to resupply…"
what a bully
"By ""special military operation"" he of course means ""genocide""."
"The video presumes to know Russian objectives, which is specious. It also creates false dilemmas (tactics vs logistics). The fact is that if the Russians wanted to, they would have decimated Kiev by attacking all the decision-making centres. There are no logistical problems, there are only objectives and agendas we don't know about."
"🤣😂 Go home Vladimir, you're drunk"
"The Ukrainians are aware of every Jet that takes off, or every platoon or battalion that moves. Every significant movement of tanks or supply trucks or fuel trucks or troop taking a dump in the countryside. That's significant and important. Intel, Russian incompetence and outright stupidity drives this war. They have 20,000 dead and maybe 70,000 to 80,000 wounded if you believe the numbers and the ratios being bandied by the Ukrainians. I think they are off but not by much. Over 40 junior officers to generals are dead in the Russian Corps. You might have 2 or 3 on the Ukrainian side. Part of Russian pay is whatever they can loot, or whatever they can rape. That is heinous. Sad. Just repugnant and ugly behaviour by the Russian troopers. ""Oh well! we're going to die anyway..."" Is their lament before becoming the unholy demons they've transformed into. The Russian Troops are refusing deployment, and those on the battle field are refusing, or incapable of fighting. I predict the Russians will outnumber our guys, but that will rapidly change. Many in the Russia steppe and heartland will wonder where their boys are and that number will rise steadily and quickly.  Yes, they will reduce Ukraine to Rubble because that is what Russia does. In Syria a quarter million innocent civilians killed by Putin. That is partly what drives Putin. A lust for blood. Any blood will do. A child or 80 year old death counts as much as anybody else in his eyes. The numbers. Putin feels he is behind and does not have much time. Mao Tse Tung murdered 60 million of his own people; Stalin maybe that much, but at least 45 million of HIS own people. Putin feels a death count must be reached to at least a million in his career. He wants to be know as Putin the Terrible if he cannot restore Russia to what it ""Once was; an Empire."" He is stifled, Putin is...frustrated because the globe is watching and monitoring. He cannot risk intervention. He must threaten nukes and annihilation. There is an evil, black menace in the air in Russia and Moscow. From the top down...the Devil resides in the Russian. Rape, torture, murder, even outright petty theft...anything goes. Just as the decency and professionalism of Montgomery in the second world war seeps into his Army and troops, and the toughness and resourcefulness, compassion of MacArthur into his Americans, so does the vile evil from hell of Putin infect his own Russkie brethren. Rise up! Everybody is on board! Ala against Hitler and the German, now we face another evil Beast from the East. Putin in his bloodlust. Oh yeah..I hear all this talk of boundaries, and Nazis and laying down of arms and NATO. All that is just bluster and fluff. Maybe a little of it is true, but make no mistake. Putin is a mass killer and wants numbers. Nobody in Ukraine is safe; Newborns count as much as the weak and old. He is heinous. Evil. Satan. Rise up WORLD! Everybody, all hands on Deck. Everything is Ukraine. Slava Ukraine. Go Azov. Go Zelensky. You were sent from God himself to do this. Slava Ukraine. I love you all. God is on our side. Jesus is with us. All for one. One for all! Ukraine!!!"
Just the fact that this is still going on proves that Russia Failed in Front of the Whole World
"Beg to differ. Democrats, Communists, Zionists, Globalists hate Russians, Simple as that. They have the most resources of any nation and the world wants their wealth, to steal. All about the money."
"@jackgoldman1. Every country has a right to form their own partnership with any country they choose. So a POTENTIAL NATO join would not be an excuse. And as the Russian government has for years been sponsoring armed rebels  in eastern Ukraine, Ukraine is fully within their right to resist such rebellions. If the people in question was to declare independence or unite with Russia, they are free to do so democratically. They can also declare independence, and get international recognition if the international community finds the independence and country to be legitimate. And 2014 election was democratic, and the Ukrainian people chose a government that leant more to west than the east. Which if of course fully within their right. So no Russia was not provoked."
The why was it russia that invaded and not the other way around?
This video didn't age well. Russia is on a rampage flattening Ukrainian cities. Important cities like Mariupol have fallen. This is an example of propaganda. Complete BS
"@Harvey Wilde hehehe! Trust me, I thought otherwise too but reality is things aren't what CNN says."
"@Vic H Right............

Y'know what! Whatever you say man."
@Harvey Wilde Donbas has 75k of the best ukranian army. They need to be eliminated first before Kiev. The 14k Azovs in Mariupol are all but done.
"Yes, but those are using long range weapons that can be fired from their own country. As for the ""Important cities"" they've pretty much given up taking Kyiv, now only focusing on the Donbass region."
The only thing rus got is nk .thats  it my cus was right us 1v1 US would tear them a new ahole
They should have put bombs at all those points would have been great thinking so when that took those areas they died there.
"It struggled because of walking on eggshells and why Kiev still stands. That's all why. WTF. You are warning against disinformation in the comments while you are trying to be pseudo academic on a entertainment social media platform and your own video is speculation and arguably disinformation... 

Pathetic. You are the troll."
"As the Ruskies sip their vodka they begin telling of how they lost so many more men in ww2 than any other country. As the alcohol takes effect they delude themselves into equating their losses as being equal to putting the most effort in defeating the Germans. Before long they talk themselves into believing they single handedly beat Germany. My thoughts are, if this is how the Ruskies fight, then no frigging wonder they lost so many men. They just had enough cannon fodder available to overcome the Germans on the Eastern front."
Let's give China to Russia. Errrrrr........invert that thought.
The Gulf War's logistics is a great demonstration of how to lay out for the rest of the war.
Commenting one month after the release of this video. Ukraine is flatenned.
Wrong.
ghosh im suprised you think that
"only Mauriapol, even then the Russia is still trying to take over it. Furthermore, losing billions of dollars worth of equipment and thousands of men to only flatten cities (which is not quite correct) while the objectives are to rule over it later is d^mb as F"
"their manufacturing capabilty is joke, work in this sector for decade now, yes they can make it but their quality vs time to make is very not stable."
What does TROLL mean to people in USA?
@Harvey Wilde 🐐  🐐  🐐
A creature living under a bridge.
Has the Ukraine become independent of Russia? I thought that they hadn't bothered to officially separated.
"that happened more than 100 years ago, with Ukraine leaving the USSR 30 years ago."

"I was born in Ukraine, and was living there until March 1st 2022. I am right now in the UK, here is my opinion on Russia invading my country, This war will be long, and soon is the end of Russia’s existence. Ukraine will win definitely. We have very good allies, we have good military, Russian troops are very bad, and like no joke very bad, they’re just 
laying on the road and occupying our land. It is our victory."

"THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE MUST ACT. The Russians can remove Putin's Despotic Regime overnight.  A STRIKE can topple him. Etienne de La Boetie's 10,000 word The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude (1552/53) should be read by all Russians. (Switch off the TVs and its Lying Propaganda…) The Discourse of Servitude is the Primer of Civil Disobedience. It’s '...almost the voice of the French Revolution' (Will Durant, The Story of Civilization, vol.6, 1957: 883). La Boetie highlights the invariable fragility of Dictators' secret hierarchical organizations – like the Kremlin. Yes, these can fall like a pack of cards. Putin, and his inner circle of about six, is in Chaos. They’re out of touch with the people. And are now most vulnerable. Withdraw your consent. START TO SPEAK - by STRIKING, using mobile phones. Stay at home. And Putin will fall like a colossus. (Or what do you tell your children?)"
Very biased. You need to compare russian logistic problems with Ukraine's. How does a country fight when all refineries are toast? Ukraine no longer has a seaport. All supply comes from the west on the same roads used by refugees. Hardly comparable to russia's inefficient rail network.
@DoctorShrink like inches. If they keep at this ice the army will be gone
@Ramen Lover Yes Russia is still winning land. Agreed.
"@Rick74 It's all about relativity. If Russian logistics have issues, Ukraine's have more. That's all that matters.  Despite Russian issues, Ukraine is still losing ground. That says it all.  This video suggests Russia will lose because of logistical issues. It won't and it isn't."

"I see how stupid u are that u don't even understand ''special operation '' meaning capture and kill a president whos not even in Ukraine and yes to the world it's war, not war crimes. let's see nato's great history of UK;FR;USA Serbia bombing in 1999 Nato war criminals & Liberia bombing of Gadaffi. Milosevic and Gadaffi were'' war criminals '' pure massacre of Liberian people nato helping Kosovo after they killed kids and burn all orthodox crutches in '' Kosovo''

and second, tell me please what resources does Ukraine have to build the country?
nato pokes them as in every hole now Russia is embracing them front whole word.
down talk about puppet government  how many countries UK ;FR ruined in word lets not talk about USA controlling whole south America whit corruption"

"Over the last month, I have watched the war in Ukraine and what I have seen was discussing behavior from a major power. I have served most of my life as a combat soldier in Canada and toured a lot of ex Warsaw pack countries over my career. These countries broke away from Russia because they wanted freedom to live as they choose. As a soldier, I spent 2 years in war torn country of the former Yugoslavia and witnessed war crimes very similar to the atrocities I am seeing in Ukraine by the Russians today. I seen the ethics of Russian militants in the past first hand and I can tell you that every report I see is the true fingerprint of a communist Russia. I have seen mass graves and the aftermath of rapes and pillaging, (ethnic cleansing) and I can honestly say that it has made a dent in my life as a Canadian. Russia will not stop there they will take Ukraine and then Poland/Baltic states. They will attempt to take Finland and Czechoslovakia if we do not act now. Russia will not stop. NATO must put the foot down or they will walk all over Eastern Europe free as they please. I have trained to fight Russians most of my career and if I can give a word of advice to all who are fighting there now, shoot the Russian officers and unit commanders/NCO, s and the fight is over. The average Soviet soldier is not trained to lead; they will be demoralized with no direction. As much as I hate war, I am a defender of freedom and the freedom of my children. To the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy I take my hat off to you. If I were younger and my children allowed me to I be there fighting right next to you. You are an inspiration to humankind and the next historical landmark since Neal Armstrong landed on the moon. Thank you for setting this example to all of us. Win this fight, and I am still considering joining you!!!"
"Russia, and many other nations  assumed that Ukraine would be a nation of push-overs, but they showed us that they've got stuff.
No one is going to sit back and let someone take and destroy their home, their families , and their lives. People fight back. People who have everything to lose will fight desperately to not lose the things they hold dearly."
"Russia must be crushed, and it´s leaders executed and democracy instated, and demilitarized."
"once the fog of war clears, this will not age well... western news on what's happening is all based on lies, and in the end, the Russian campaign will be remembered as a master piece in warfare while taking significant efforts to avoid civilian casualties, and avoid damage to infrastructure, even today electricity, water, Telephony and sewage work in Ukraine, while all four where destroyed within the first day of desert Storm (US vs Iraq)... This war started of with a feint towards Kyiv to tie up Ukrainian forces which number over 270,000 professional soldiers plus another 300,000 police and reserves etc vs 190,000 Russian forces, so pinning down Russian forces was critical while the Russians forces on removing the presence of the Ukrainian forces in the Ethnic Russian east (the Donbass Lugansk and Donetsk peoples republics). The fact that the west has only started to notice the battles in Mariupol after it was finished (with the exception of some underground holdouts in the Vladimir Ilich Steal plant sector which is very large) is a sign of how off track the information being provided is..."
Sovjet army had a high percentage of shooting infantry and little food. Sweden had 1000 men in the battallion Sovjet 400

"I mean a swedish battallion had also foodmaking, mortars tankkillers fireleaders sleeping and materielorganisation"
Objection. Relevance…
It is of supreme irony that P***n didn't recognize his strategy was a near copy of Operation Barbarossa: strategic buildup aiming for a steamrolling through the opposition assuming their quick surrender all the while having no contingency plan if logistics slows him down and the opposition refuses to surrender.
lol also look at finland
"After a month of war, I don't understand how these pictures of modern and well equipped Russian soldiers have been transformed into this poor garbage army we see on TV everyday since...

the end of Putin the barbaric president of Rassia what wil happend to him just follow me in june 2022
Ukraine needs to hit this rail network.
Bull shit !
"I love people who say stuff, yet don’t provide any evidence for their claims."
amatuers talk strategy. professionals talk logistics. never was it more true.
I have a new sense of respect for the pogues in the rear.
"Excellent post!  I agree and add that Russia needs a sound message sent to them.

Fake bias news
just taking looks and sipping coffee just tells
No just observations of the war.
"""The Failed Logistics of Russia's Invasion,"" doesn't explain any VALID question (i.e., generated by an anomaly), and is a ""Fallacy of Begging the Question,"" anyway. Your pretentious ""analysis,"" uses no methodology to rule-out your personal biases, so you've only informed us of your biases. You are so incompetent, you don't even use standard military models to make probability inferences. Thanks for the click bait."
"Your comment is the pretentious one and raised no valid questions at all. If you have nothing to aid to a discussion, don't comment.

You are incapable of understanding why someone would put a conclusion in a title, when in reality they always do so. 
Do you think that the excellent book ""When Titans cClashed: How the Red Army stopped Hitler"" is a fallacy because it observed the fact that Nazi Germany was defeated? This is utter nonsence."
just because a title name presumes somehting does not mean the video is a Fallacy of Begging the Question. thats not how that works
@Minerva Owl there's no requirement to disprove anything that's been claimed without a single shred of evidence.. how old are you? go gaslight somewhere else. (as for ad homs.. your hypocrisy is rather pathethic now)
"@DE J You need to demonstrate that with a valid argument, instead of using immature ""ad hom"" fallacies. BTW, How old are you?"
russian words are meaningless when they are losing this war. Only thing they have now to defened moscow is nukes and 16 year olds. China needs to put down their dog before they actually fire nukes and destroy the world
"Could barely watch half of it. Had to stop because the unashamedly biased litany of lies was making me throw up.
I just want to say one thing;  if it were a Russian 'invasion', it would have ended 30 minutes after it started."
@Syed Akbar Well hard to do so with over 100.000 troops invading your country. I know in russia you are not to call it that way but this is what it is.

"@Syed Akbar also ukrainians aren't divided in the least, 90% voted to become independent, and if zelensky is a puppet.. then wtf is the guy who got thrown out in 2014? he literally went to putin to get help to create unrest in his own former country."

Remember, these are mostly 18 year old conscripts.  They've been fed a line of bullshit but people in positions of power and authority over them.

FUCK-IT!.....NUKE-EM! from the Russians is everybody on Earth loses."
"Invading Russia would still be a formidable task because of their rail network. Meaning Russia could easily reinforce areas being invaded. Problem is when Russia goes on the offense their rail network is only useful in getting supplies to the border of the country Russia is invading.

Plus Russia does have strong SAM and missile systems that provide strong defense.

Well done!
Russia fails ALWAYS in anything. That's how russians are built. There is term in russian language that would translate like asshanded person...
true 😂
Hopefully Russia will fail in this war but the West has no solutions other then feeding arms to Ukraine meanwhile Europe keeps buying gas and oil from Russia. Russia has 1000 years of long range missiles etc this could drag on for years

"And now Russia abandoned all position North and Northeast of Kiev in something that can only described as ""humiliating retreat"""
"@lucius1976 The poor state of the Russian roads and the fact the Germans wanted to take Leningrad as well as Moscow, meant the Germans could not do one thing well. Whatever the Russian setbacks are in Ukraine, they have one objective, the Donbas which is well within their capabilities. What they’re not doing is conquering a country the size of France in one fell swoop."
"@Norman F Birnberg 
Yeah right. And 1941 the Germans never really wanted to conquer Moskov, just pin down Soviet forces. Unsubtantiated myths"
"In hindsight, Kiev was a feint operation and the Russians never seriously committed the kind of resources necessary to conquer a city that large. They simply wanted to pin down Ukrainian forces while building up their offensive capability elsewhere.  When that was done, they withdrew. That explains why they took weeks to reach the capital and openly advertised their movements. If Kiev had been a military objective, the Russians would have conducted things very differently."

The end of Putin regimn you mean?
Its amazing that YOU still don't know what the point of this invasion was. Russia ( Putin) already succeeded in his main objective.
@199 000 Calling the USA and EU bluff was he main objective. You peoples rhetoric is why Ukraine as it was is gone FOREVER.
"What objective, blew up Moskwa with their incompeten Sailor"
a month later..russia still failed hard as fuck. they even went to kill civilians in occupied towns. does anyone know the kreml has a bunker underneath? and some gas nearby? just in case..
Your not showing the videos about Ukrainian military bombing their own people and shooting at them. There are many videos with Ukrainian civil who are accusing Ukrainian military for destroying and killing none military people in the cities and shooting at the homes with  rockers and tanks. Where are those video in your YouTube. Let me guess you only show things from one perspective disinforming people and lying to them.
He is not showing it because that never happened.
@Warrior Ever thought you're full of it too?
"Only the American news keeps lying about Russia wanted to capture Kiev in three days. I have not hear that any where in the Russian news, plus they did capture an airport in Kiev with in couple hours by Kiev and forced the Ukrainian military out of the area and destroyed 80% of their military infrastructure in less then couple hours. in Feb 24, 2022. Sounds like winning and for the last month all the territory that was captured by Russia has not been one loss to Ukrainian military after taking it over from Ukraine none at all."
@Ramen Lover and lost the wat
@Warrior we did the same in ww2
@Warrior ukriane asking for volunteers they are all vets. The US isn’t sending troops
"Logistics did not fail just because Ukrainian military ran away and started to hide inside cities and using civil as shields. Ukraine parked it military next to building hospitals and schools. So Russia had to stop the advancement to prevent huge loss of civil lives. There are plenty of videos that show Ukrainian solders inside building where people lived put snipers and anti tank on roof tops and so on. Everyone knows that fighting in cities takes a lot of time and men effort, but if you look at the map all the area where there was no major cities it was conquered by Russian military. The major cities where surrounded. Half of the things you say is not true, If Russia is loosing then why do they control the airspace in Ukraine. Ukraine lost its air force 98%, navy 100%, and anti air  forces 100%. Russia is only sent it 100,000 thousand soldiers against 300,000 thousand Ukrainian military forces. So far according to Russian military Ukraine lost 13,000 killed and 20,000 injured while Russia lose 1,800 and 3,000 injured. I would say they are winning not loosing."

"How the hell does any country not have enough trucks in this day and age? Russia relied too much on their trains I think. It worked in world war 2 because battlelines were less clear. It doesn't work here because Ukraine has had 8 years to prepare. They're even using weapons from world war 2. Ukraine was prepared.

Russia simply wasn't. The people are devided about attacking Ukraine. Moral is low. The fight was decided before the first solider eve went to the front. ""Hearts and minds."" Otherwise what's the point?"
"the ]thematic music"" was touhou music lole"

"@Stack Hat This dude probably doesn't know what Nato is, all the master told him was to say its a bad machine. Sadly he is not smart enough to think for himself."
"We already knew this. Russias forces were only geared towards protecting itself against Nato n never towards projecting power over anyone else.   Whilst nato is geared towards the projection of power. That is the difference. Russia never intended to take a war to anybody n there is ur proof to those who kept crying that Russia is a threat. America always knew this too n that Russia only bolstered up to defend itself but they lied to their ppl about there being a threat. Russia only has bombs to scare n defend n has nothing to invade another country coz they never intended it. So stop lying to ur ppl n causing all these issues. If u didnt threaten to surround them with nato n taking all their power in the world they wudn hv to invade Ukraine fir their survival n those ppl wuda remained at home. This is all the West's doing.
Im from the west but this hypocrisy sickens me n having no regard for ppls lives. Jus leave ppl alone"
@Marcus Sol well that's the point. They spend all their money on defence. They hv the best anti-air defence missile systems in the world but hardly any capability to invade another power. U dont think that was by accident do ya? But of course ur gonna try deny that somehow
"@Marcus Sol Chechnya is a part of Russia and you can't compare Georgia to Ukraine. 

Georgia has less than 10% of the population and barely 10% of the size in area."
that is why china is pushing for its belt and road initiative wanting to connect continents with its railway and docks… it can be used for logistics…
Interesting point.
"The video is idiotic and fake. Ukraine, defending Kyiv and Mariupol, left the Kherson region almost without a fight.
Not many people know that since the time of Tsarist Russia, Kherson and Crimea were part of the same province, which was not canceled in general by the Bolsheviks under Soviet rule.
Ukraine only blocked and partially destroyed railways and highways. All this was restored by Russian military engineers in the first week of the war. At the moment, the entire railway track from the Kherson region to the Crimea has been restored, and the Russian army is receiving trains with military equipment almost to the front line."
@Antony Rudiger you sound like it
@Antony Rudiger yes
"@Ramen Lover Yes, really, how could I talk if my internet is down and power is cut off? Embarassing. Life in a cave is hard (("
@Antony Rudiger lol how could you talk if your internet is down and russia keeps turning off the power also when most of your town is gone.
Western(American) forces are much better equipped from a financial standpoint.
"Or to put it into words of a NATO analyst: Russian military is designed to defend the country. And so relying for example on its rail network makes sense. But it's not good for offensive actions. The US military is the opposite: It's built to attack other countries, no matter where on the planet. And they have  the experience to do so. It's also quite logical from an historical point of view how their militaries developed during the last centuries. I wouldn't say that very western country would be better with logistics, it's also a matter of experience and they're pretty dependend on each others (just think about the retreat from Afghanistan - hardly a logistical masterpiece). 
Of course there are also other factors, like stricter hierarchy within the Russian military, different approach to morale and training. 
So it's not a good military for invading other countries and having to fight there for a long time. And when intelligence fails and the leaders think it'll be just a short trip without resistence failure is imminent. Invading Russia on the other side might be hard for any attacker. Maybe they should've sticked to defense..."
Excellent comment!
"The biggest problem with the US withdrawal from Afghanistan was not the US Military; it was the US State Department, which for some completely nonsensical reason was put in charge of the whole thing. The US military commanders knew perfectly well that it was a complete mistake to do things the way they were done; commanders who objected were told to shut up and do as they were told by State. All of this goes back to the team at the White House directing things in a completely incompetent and highly chaotic way. The fault lies with National Command Authority, not the US Military."

"Rusia = Israel , Ukraine = Palestine. Invader."
"Clearly read if slightly over emphasised.  This presents more of the facts than mainstream media which seems to focus on the trauma, horror and shock factors.

"1. There are NO conscripts in the military operation. Only contractors who have undergone appropriate training. Therefore, the Belarusians do not participate either - they have the entire army on conscription, there are no professional contract soldiers. Therefore, if someone squeals about the ""corpses of Russian conscript boys,"" you can safely spit in his eyes.
2. There can be no question of any 3.5 thousand dead Russian military personnel - such a number of dead would mean several times more wounded, which means that all roads would be clogged with ambulances in the opposite direction, plus the massive deployment of field hospitals - it's impossible to hide it. We don’t see anything like this even in Ukrainian publics.
3. Cases of ""capturing individual Russian fighters"" that Bandera's propaganda is spinning are unlikely - a single squatter who ran into a neighboring village for moonshine can be captured, but this is not a fighter, this is gouging. A single fighter during an operation in isolation from the column - but who will let him go away?
4. Cases of burnt columns on the march are possible, this is a war, anything can happen. Someone made a mistake, did not keep track, had to leave with empty tanks. Someone will pay for this. In this case, it must be assumed that the abandoned empty columns are burned by the Armed Forces of Ukraine retroactively for staged videos.
5. The same with ""missiles, ammunition and fuel, which are just enough and which will last for 3-4 days"" - enchanting nonsense. Military operations of this level are being prepared for at least several months, everything is calculated and stocked in advance with excess redundancy for all cases.
6. The main leitmotif of the actions of the RF Armed Forces: ""we are not Americans."" It is they who, seeing something or someone on the way, first throw a grenade, and then they begin to figure it out - and then, if it comes to that. Therefore, a neat detour of a failed suicide who tried to crawl under tanks is the rule. No one is going to produce mountains of corpses, if a person does not resist, why kill him?
7. Undermining the dam of the North Crimean Canal is a preventive measure if one of the frostbitten Nazis decides to blow up the higher dam so that the water has somewhere to go. The same applies to nuclear power plants, hydroelectric power plants, and other infrastructure facilities - they are taken under control without fail.
8. The distribution of weapons to the unprepared population, as well as all sorts of ""Molotov cocktails"", in the confrontation with professionals - enchanting stupidity. ""Three or four stun grenades are enough for them to peel themselves on the spot, drop their weapons and run away."" Nothing but the blood of the civilian population at the hands of bandits, it will not bring. After that, it becomes clear that all the actions of the ""terodefenders"" who destroy road signs, chase after those who supposedly put markings on the roofs, and even undermine bridges - this is just stupidity and complete incompetence. For a modern tanker still needs to be lured to an unknown bridge - why should he risk flying from a collapsed stretch
9. Kadyrov people, trained to fight terrorists in urban conditions and who have undergone appropriate training, will clean up the uproots.
10. Russian Armed Forces units participating in the operation do not use mortars. All mortar attacks, all mortar explosions in residential areas (Sumy, Akhtyrka, Donbass), especially in meaningless places where there is no military or energy infrastructure, these are provocations by the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the defense industry in order to influence the consciousness of the local population.

In general, summing up, there are no non-professionals in the operation. The operation was prepared long in advance in all respects, and the plan has a bunch of branches for every possible course of events."
there's tik toks of the 18 year old conscripts themselves telling their whole story. another video of a whole bunch (like 30) of conscript kids getting shot at
"''There are NO conscripts in the military operation.''
there are, they just called them 'contractors' which is correct, but also just cherry-picking. by all defintions they're conscripions.
''such a number of dead would mean several times more wounded, which means that all roads would be clogged with ambulances in the opposite direction,''
mmm not really, russia has shown they much prefer they were left for dead.
''nchanting nonsense. Military operations of this level are being prepared for at least several months''
HAHAHAHAHA, and you believe that utter dogshit, if they had planned for any longer than a week they would have known the Ukrainians wouldn't capitulate within ''2-3 days''
''The same applies to nuclear power plants, hydroelectric power plants, and other infrastructure facilities - they are taken under control without fail.'
who tried to dig in what radioactive forest and who tried to sabotage a nuclear power plant again?
''Kadyrov people, trained to fight terrorists in urban conditions and who have undergone appropriate training, will clean up the uproots.''
yea, just like how the SS apporpriatly took care of the terrorists in Belarus, yes?
''Russian Armed Forces units participating in the operation do not use mortars''
indeed, they just use regular rpg's and ATGM's."
"Putin will achieve exactly what he wanted from day one - before the invasion. Only the ego and stubbornness of our politicians have lead to destroying Ukraine. Further Putin has demonstrated he was ready to fight. I am wondering what will be his next demands. The West has only shown weakness, lack of understanding and provided the world with long, tedious and empty speeches. Only Biden was really hilarious (as always)."
"You're right, the West misunderstood Russia. Western leaders and governments never expected the incompetence coming out of Russia's military. The only major city taken is Kherson 5 weeks into the war, Russian forces ended up withdrawing from the Kyiv front in the recent days and Ukrainian helicopters have managed to hit targets in Russian soil (a first for another state to deploy equipment within Russia since WW2).

But yeah, make sure you have good supply of copium there ;)"
Russians have logistics?)))
"18:00 . . . YouTube feeds of site producers, however it's the same in the opposite.  We need to establish a tram approach where each, working together come out ahead, in the long run.  As that infamous phrase goes - 'a rising tide, rases ALL boats ! 😀"
"jeje failed logistic, well tehy have a bunch of ukranian territory and Mauripol
so it seems that is not that bad the logistical probelma that they have"
"russian tactic is ""atack only atack if not work atack again"""
"Apart from the logistical problems there seem to be more     political choices why the invasion stalled.
Putin invested the last heavily in planes, rockets and artillery systems and hardly on the infantery and commmunicationsystems.
Also the choice for conscripts from rural Siberia.... mothers of killed soldiers there are politically less risky...
Because so many Russians have connections to Ukranians Putin kept especially the army uninformed about his invasion...
Now his 'sexy' weapons didnt brought him the quick fix  Putin hoped his troops were uninformed, not motivated, poorly lead sitting ducks for the Ukranians...
This should lead to huge tensions between the military and Putins mafia..."

"As of today, Russian military has completed the first stage of its military operation. Ukranian side has accepted Russian conditions in Istanbul. I guess Russian logistics hasn't failed in the end.

"EXCELLENT VIDEO! Ukraine already has won the war, bc the Ukrainians showed so much courage, patriotism, and smarts, Also bc most of the world rallied to their cause. YOu can kill people, you can destroy buildings, but you can never kill the human spirit."
"Although there may be truth to this narrative, I have another interpretation of the Russian attack. For now at least. The units involved were never meant to capture all of Ukraine. Their operational goals were divided into three smaller holding missions and one large conquest mission. The holding missions were Kiev, Kharkiv and Kherson. The conquest mission, the Don bass region and the Azov coastline. 

The objective of each holding mission was to draw as many Ukranian reserves as possible. Only thereby would it be possible to defeat the powerful Ukranian Don bass army. In order to complete the holding missions, the attacking units involved, were ordered to focus on momentum, and less on flanks and rear. This is how Russian forces managed to arrive in proximity to each holding mission objective; Kiev, Kharkiv and Kherson. Which they did on D-Day it self. Although in small numbers. In fact, the entire attacking force, was smaller in size than the defending force. So here, there may be ideas to study and further develop. 


In overall, and contrary to most other observers, I perceive the attackers operation as successful. Plus the attacker will learn, from his audacious operation, as of course will the defender, who has succeeded in putting up a strong resistance. 


Much has to be learned from this conflict. Logistics are important, but not necessarily totally important. It depends on the strategical and operational goals."
@Norman F Birnberg desperate excuses
"The so called logistics failure didn’t matter so much in a feint operation. There was no urgency to what the Russians were doing in the Kiev, Chernigov and Kharkov theaters. They were not conquest operations. Russian military strategy isn’t about conquering territory; its about destroying armies and Russia’s real objective is destroying the Ukrainian army in the east. There their advantages are paramount and their shortcomings are easily compensated. This is in fact how the Soviet Army fought throughout the Second World War and the fierce urban battle, the Battle of Berlin, was the exception."

"They were good at getting people to believe that; they had the best counter-intelligence in the world.  The problem is, while that works great for discouraging people from thinking about attacking you, when you need to attack no amount of disinformation will make you as powerful as you need to be."

"I'm not American but this video just demonstrates how strong and good the US military really is. Take the Iraq war for example, they were able to invade with tanks, keep troops fully supplied and took the capital in around a month i believe? correct me if that's wrong. OK some of the units were stationed in bases near Iraq but to keep that logistics up for years is mighty impressive considering they were also fighting in Afghanistan at the same time."
"yes, the Americans are all right with logistics, the experience of invading other countries helps, and with a trillion dollars annually allocated to send democracy, I think this is not so difficult to do. Tanks, you say in a month? Well, the Russians cannot destroy everything like the States in Baghdad, our friends, acquaintances, relatives live in Ukraine."
US troops had no problem with logistic due to numerous of millitary bases all over the world and almost no resistance from opposite force to brake their logistic lines.
"Soviet Union didn't had any logistic problem in Afganistan. So you lied again. Soviet Union left the Afganstan in terms of letting the Afgan goverment stand itslef against the Taliban, which was sponsored (guess who?). And they were able to withstand the Taliban for 10 years.

How much time the US afgan goverment stands, after the last us-soldier left the region?"

>war is not over yet
Most invasions that are done thinking ‘they will surrender if we just attack a little bit’ usually end up being fucked when the defemders actually fight back
"Thanks to Vladimir Putin Russia is basically finished.

Before Putin's war on Ukraine the very sad Russian economy was only slightly larger than Australia's a country with over 5 times less people. Thanks to Russia's war Thanks to its war criminal president I can envisage the Russian economy being smaller than New Zealand's and massive queues for bread and vodka."
"Perfect example of the break down and failure  of eastern ideology. Push vs pull logistics. The west: what do the people on the ground need? Let's ask the people on the ground, decentralized command. 
The east: what do the people on the ground need, let's ask a puppet general who only has his position because he is a yes-man to the dictator and then we will tell the plebs on the ground what they need, iron fist top down command structure.
One works, the other doesnt"
Wooow this is so well-made. My new favorite youtube channel.
"The real reasons for russia fail in this invasion is the fact ukraine population is complete hostile. This is most powerful weapon . You have no idea how much count this. Almost everywhere in world conflicts where a invasion was conducted against local population will ,ended in disaster."
2:43 Yelnya is a town about 250 km from Ukrainian border in a straight line. But who really cares? Hahaha)
Disgusting that india takes all benefits from Wests relationship but doesnt stand with the west to condemn this atrocity - typically shameful self serviance
Russia's only accomplishment in Ukraine is creating generations of enemies.
1:52 confederate flag??
"That's the flag of Novorossyia, proposed union between the Republica of Luhansk and Donetsk"
You think Putin's pulling a Gorbachev? In that he does several dumb things to bring down his country and the corrupt officials with it?
Russian military logistics =Soviet planned economy.

4:20 bryansk oblast? i live in bryansk
Another great video
Russia like Germany related on Rail Roads and didn't have the trucks supply the troops.  And in Afghanistan they thought that helicopters meet there logistics needs. The Russians army is a defensive army not an offensive army.
"If the Russian army is a defensive one, as you falsely pretend, the soldiers taking part in this war that may not be called a war, could and should have asked some questions before they invade another country. They didn't because Russians have a subject mentality.

And yes, we can see throughout Russia's history how peaceloving and 'defensive' its army has always been ... Finland, the Baltics, Hungary, Cekoslovakia, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, Kazakhstan ... Really a great series of glorious 'humanitarian' operations!

 You are a 🤡."
Putin is an animal. He needs to be replaced via an effective coup.
@mechadoggy Passive resistance a la Ghandi.
How’s that going to happen?
Do you think russians where looting for military  or for the civilians they took in ?
Is that meant to be a serious question?
They shouldn't loot at all wtf
"The ""Push and Pull"" supply system described at about the 14 minute mark reminds me of the difference between a planned economy with centralized control (traditionally the old USSR, today's Russia and other totalitarian states) and somewhat decentralized control as exemplified by the ""old USA"" although we're increasingly becoming more centralized (unfortunately)."
"Pipelines are like railways, but more economic than lorries and trucks needing very much more personnel. Capitalism: the strong survive."
"The U.S. spent 20 years unable to defeat the Taliban in their Afghanistan invasion & occupation. Was that poor logistics, deliberate profitable foreign policy or something else?"
"0:42 ""…to many Ukrainians though, this was perceived not as a beginning, but a continuation – a continuation of the conflict that began some eight years prior in the spring of 2014… “ So not ever since the U.S.-centralised empire staged a coup in Ukraine where Victoria Nuland, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, had her “Guy” Yatsenyuk installed as prime minister then? And Putin’s response had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with that event, did it?"

Lol Russian military relying on railways…well I guess Germany is safe then…sure they could reach some city’s and all but Germans are good with dismanteling the railway soooo…🤷🏻‍♀️😹
@Frank Husel It's a joke relating to the dire state of German railways.
"I am not quite sure what this is meant to say (if anything at all), but it seems to me that you know almost nothing about foreign countries. And just as a start, the railway gauge in Russia isn't the same as in Western Europe. Just sayin'. So as a Russian railway worker, for whom all ways lead to Moscow, the German railway grid would be the least of my concerns."
Imagine you try to invade a country and have to ask for directions…🤦🏻‍♀️
"Looks like very poor analytics :/ 
when you try to take propaganda and make analytics based on it, it always works out that way 🤷‍♂

I’ll show your replies to my friends 😆"
"@Frank Husel 😂
dude, look at the map, find the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean on it, then find Ukraine and honestly answer your assumption about access from Ukraine to this sea and ocean. After that, take a history book and read about the genocides arranged by the West in North America and Oceania, then read about the wars arranged by the West over the past 30 years and you can end up on the adventures of a Western political leader nicknamed Hitler. Then come back and continue the dialogue. Right now you're just too poor educated to talk to me.

@Jarynn lol ukraine taking them and making them brand new
no out of the sky
"@D.K I fail to see the point you are making here. You sadly fail in the coherency aspect. Why no Ukrainian plane has been in the sky for a fortnight is because Russia has already shot down 125 of them. This is why Zelenskiy is begging NATO/America for more.
As for the rest of it, if you could rephrase it in the English language, I'll try to address it for you."
@David Crosswell and? Six out of how many? also today has been the 40th day the russians haven't even used their jets against anything for civilian targets.

Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.” (2 Timothy 4:3-4)"

"To make matters worse for Russia, upwards of 60 percent of their missiles fail.  That means limited logistics resources are expended transporting equipment that does not function.  When you start putting all the pieces together this war is a disaster for Russia, which looks like a regional power, with a moderate sized economy, with nuclear weapons."
@Violent Cabbage He probably got that estimate from some literal propaganda that he didn't even look into.
"Where did you get that estimate from?. It seems like Ukraine is unable to repel Russian air strikes and artillery bombardments. Hence, Zelensky's desperation to enforce a no fly zone in its territory and fighter jets to challenge Russian air supremacy"
Supporting nazis I see. Unsubbed.
"@Violent Cabbage what? I said Azov is at most 2000 people. The Ukrainian army is 300000 people + a few more thousand reserves + volunteer fighters from Ukrain and around the world + equipment for those soldiers from other countries + donations + training from the US etc etc etc. Their army is nothing compared to the Russians but it's significantly bigger than what the soviets faced in Ahganistan and they have very high morale, to defend their country and freedom."
"@Kai Doust Do you expect people to believe that 2000 soldier soldiers can take on an entire Russian army?. What are they, super soldiers or something?🤣"
@ThePucko and azov is at most like 2000 people out of the 44 million people in Ukraine
@Violent Cabbage umm no
haha i love how eu and nato countries and allies ( like the guy in this video ) are desperate to make russia look shit even tho noone actully knows the plans so you cant really say failed who knows the plans lets wait until facts unfold some day the russian operation will be leaked and all the plans will be seen.... until then its an takeback invasion becuse of security concerns... think what u want of all of this but remember this if canada suddently would allow and build russian military bases around the american border you can bet it america would do the same thing russia is doing to ukraine... dont listen to extremist democrats we all know and seen how desperate/naiv they are lmao.
"Yes. We don't have Russia's written plans.. But something tells me sending foraging teams to Ukrainian households begging for diesel and being forced to abandon tanks because they don't have enough fuel weren't a part of Russia's logistical planning.

The US doesn't actively antagonize Canada and make Canada seek foreign aid against American aggression. Instead, the US treaties its neighbors as friends and works to maintain healthy relationships even when we disagree. Despite the many, many rocky moments in US-Mexico relations, the two nations still enjoy an extremely close economic bond."
u surely belive that there are aliens on the earth too huh ?
"No one ever set out to take 10,000 casualties in a month, or to lose the amount of armor, fuel trucks, helicopters etc. In that same timespan. Don't just blindly assume someone else to be in the wrong because you don't like what they have to say."

Many thanks for this... I found it interesting and educational.
Rusia and China are both loosing FACE along with thair sory asses.
So the Russian's pulled an American military operation like in Iraq? or in Afghanistan? or in Syria? or in Vietnam?  Just like America pulled a Russia in Afghanistan but for 20 years instead of 10? A game of one up'in the other in terms of stupidity and murder. This world we live in I swear.

"Paper maps, unsecured communication, no food, no fuel = over-rated military"
"6:11 Hostomel never has made sense to me as an anchor for an airbridge for an attack on Kiev. The Russians don't have enough light infantry for that to make sense. I think it was a raid to destroy the base, the aircraft on it, and possibly to draw the Ukrainians out from their defenses.

8:02 No real chance the Russians abandoned any significant amount of equipment to fuel shortages that early. What they carried on board was more than enough. I suspect that if any equipment was actually abandoned, it was from poor maintenance or M-kill hits.

""Stories emerged""....from whom? We know whom, of course.

9:07 ""Guerilla style defense."" Ummm...no.

10:56 No, it wasn't ""poor logistic performance."" It was the circumstances, geological and human terrain, so to speak, where no supply lines could be secured, and the Soviets had to launch two major offensives every year to bring in enough log for the next six months.

11:48 I think that number of railway troops includes rail reconstruction and repair units, who traditionally have been pretty good at their jobs. We'll see if they can fix the breaks before the Rasputitsa ends and the offensive resumes.

12:34 They took this from Grau, The Russian Way of War, at page 332. No, it is the transport battalion, not the Technical Material Support Brigade, that has those capabilities. They frequently or even usually have two of those battalions in a brigade, so Russian capabilities will usually be twice that.

14:29 No, not exactly; we do both. Yes, lower units request but higher units also predict, request, forward, and store near the lower levels.

15:04 We actually ran into something very similar in France in 1944, where estimates of fuel and ammunition use were so wildly off that we alternated between too much of one and not enough of the other several times.

15:20 Bullshit statement. Strategy is something else.

The Russians didn't miss the importance of logistics; they understand it as well as anyone and better than most. Their mistake was in putting credence into their intel estimates that the Ukies would fold or even welcome them with open arms. Everything else stems from that. And even then, they'd not be having these problems at any other time of the year than the two Rasputitsas.
Finally, this video was done by the 5th of March, nine days into the war. When can we suppose they started working on it? Was there even a chance for the Russian's supposed logistic woes to have been visible by then? Probably not. Was there an excellent chance of Ukrainian propaganda being in full assault mode, with ready made myths to support this message? Probably so."
"The reason why russian troops primarily relied on paper maps,
is because russias GPS ripoff, GLONASS, was completely dysfunctional, and doesnt work."

Hunter Biden’s Investment Fund Connected to Financing of Pentagon-Funded Biolabs in Ukraine: MoD
In recent weeks, the Russian Defence Ministry has peeled back layers of information about 30+ Pentagon-funded biolabs feared to be engaged in dangerous and illegal research into deadly pathogens in Ukraine. US officials and media initially denied that the labs existed, but a senior Biden administration official later confirmed their presence.
An investment firm connected to US President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden has been implicated in the financing of the Pentagon's military biological programme in Ukraine, the head of Russia's Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defence Troops has announced, citing fresh documents.
""Incoming materials have allowed us to trace the scheme of interaction between US government bodies and Ukraine's biolabs. The involvement in the financing of these activities by structures close to the current US leadership, in particular the Rosemont Seneca investment fund managed by Hunter Biden, draws attention to itself,"" RCBD Troops chief Igor Kirillov said in a briefing Thursday.
According to the MoD's information, the fund has at least $2.4 billion in investment capital. ""At the same time, a close relationship has been established between the the fund and key contractors of the US military, including Metabiota, which alongside Black & Veatch is one of the main suppliers of equipment for Pentagon biolaboratories around the world,"" Kirillov added.
The Los Alamos National Laboratory - birthplace of the US atomic bomb, has served as one of the chief curators of the US military biological programmes in Ukraine, Kirillov said.

Below, ties are shown to the Lugar Center in Georgia, the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and associated centers and institutes, and teh Ukrainian Defence Ministry's epidemiological departments.

USAID, Soros Foundations, CDC Also Involved, MoD Says
""The scale of the programme is impressive. Along with the Pentagon, the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Soros' Open Society Foundations, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are directly involved in its implementation,"" the officer said. ""Scientific supervision is carried out by leading research organizations, including the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which developed nuclear weapons for the Manhattan Project. All of this activity has been carried out under the direct control of the Pentagon.""
Kirillov accompanied his presentation with new Ukrainian-language documents detailing the operations of laboratories suspected of involvement in US-funded military biological activities, including a detailed listing of 31 laboratories across 14 settlements."
Paul.. That was total NONSENSE
Russia failed as a country and russians have failed as human beings.
"SAD TRUTH for NATO EXPANSION: Russia gets: ukraine

"Russia will not be defeated.

When the planned time comes they will conduct a special military withdrawal"
"The logistics ""push"" approach is a holdover from the Soviet-era doctrine of planning everything centrally. Civilian supplies were planned five years at a time, so the military was positively speedy in comparison"
"yes and no
It is a holdover from the USSR
but, not because of that
but because the Red Army planned for a nuclear war, in which ""pull"" logistics wouldn't work as the EMP tied to a nuclear detonation would fry communications"
"I would say this is a continuation of intermittent and unwelcome annexation by Russia under various rulers  since Tsar Peter ""the Great"".

Only the victors ever think forcible annexation is welcomed"
ofc nato and us is behind this!
@Hari Wan You are serious. So you claim you do not know yet simultaniously you claim NATO is behind everything with not proof to back up your claim? What is this? I have seen better presentations in elementary school.
@Rick74 idk with propaganda going on in the news and in video like this you never know
I can't tell if you're serious or not. Lol.
Is Europe still buying oil and gas from Russia?
yep. And it is going through Ukraine. ;)
Is it over? Why are you saying it failed when it's not over.
Because their innitial strategy failed. If an operation fails you can declare it a failure.
The logistics failed. Not the russian invasion
"propaganda, hes trying to boost the morale of the west"
"Author, ""useful idiot""©. He is one of those who incorrectly assessed the situation, thereby convincing his viewers that the Russians are not skillful, but in the future this will play a bad joke for those who want to actually compete with the Russian army. It's a pity but you yourself have chosen this path."
You did not even debunk a single of his well illustrated arguments.
"The Russians have conquered 33,465 square miles of terrain in 6 days. That represents .024 square miles per soldier a day. That is 1.43 times faster than the Israel advance during the Six Day War, 10x faster than the US advance during the gulf War, and 1.85x faster than the US advance in 2003. 

So any suggestion that the Russians are moving slow is revealed as absolute Nonsens. People who think like that either  believe too much on the as you see ""very reliable"" news propaganda or have played too many videogames where you can invade a country within a few hours. 
We consider the attack of Germany onto Poland in 1939 as one of the fastest invasions ever. Beware that the attack lastet 30 days! Also beware that Poland had a terrible army back then and numerous other countries didn't send them Tons of wepons. Also keep in mind that Poland, while being still a big country, is not as big as the second biggest country of Europe after Russia, namely Ukraine. 
Keep in mind that Putin could throw a nuclear bomb over Kiev and bring Ukraine to fall within hours. This practique is very brutal and over the history there was only one country in the World to use nuclear bombs onto civilians. The USA. Keep in mind who the real threat to the world is..."
"That would be Russia, Michi. Correct."
They have been stuck for over three weeks.
"I still wonder why Russia is not using its modern fighters like SU35, SU34 and only counting on very old plans like SU25 and very old tanks like T72 !! 
They could’ve just start air campaigns first and destroy enemy bases and infrastructure. This how Israel do it, how the US do it.
Depending on ground troops from day one is wrong. I don’t know what are they smoking down there at the Kremlin!"
so what it makes you repeat russian lies of 2014 about some mystical 'russia backed separatists' if all that was and is russia citizens that are and were military and spec-ops members?
How shelling civilian infrastructure can help with lack of supplies? I can understand how looting does but shelling civilians...
"Are you... are you serious? 
Destroyed roads and buildings mean moving supplies becomes more difficult and ambushes become more likely, thus convoys will have to drive slowely, cautiously and can't use main roads."
"Look at what Russia did in Chechnya. They got bogged down and stuck, so they started blowing up civilian centers out of frustration."
I wonder if Russia will make the same mistakes that america made in Vietnam and Afghanistan?
It's amazing to see so many white people fighting each other in a war. I thought this sort of mindless mass tribal violent conflict only happened amongst Middle Eastern or African countries.
"0:31 the way he said and the video is edited, i thought the alarm to signal the war in ukraine was the same as the car alarm lol"

"'Infantry win battles, logistics win wars' -Someone I forgot the name of."
"1:50 i thought he was about to say ""this was made possible by nord vpn"""
"Russia is essentially making many of the same mistakes that they did during WW1. Just goes to show that even with modern technology, vast numbers and seemingly every advantage, tactics and leadership are key to any victory."
"I knew it from the start, or russia wins it on a few days or they re fucked...
Now they re fucked"
"Idk why everyone assumes Russia's military is strong when in the past it has never proved itself to be strong. Loosing to nations much smaller than themselves. They're military is arrogant sure but not strong. In fact, I would say arrogance is they're biggest weakness."
8:00 I like the video of a Ukrainian who tells the Russians he will give them a tow........ All the way back to Moscow. lmao
The Russian military is basically 100% reliant on trains for movement of troops and supplies. and they even have units that are just for building oil pipelines and railroads. and trucks are used just for moving things from the trains to to troops directly. So if your ever in the same situation as ukraine then hit the railroads and destroy the pipelines they build
And now NOVICHOKIAs retreating! Ukraine kicked their steroid-infused butts back to the gulag!! ❤️🇺🇦
Thank you great video.

"There's a reason why America runs the world, keep talking about High Speed rail while hoping we keep making all the new medications."
Russia believed they were facing a meager military force... They didn't expect that they would be fighting the populace as well.
@Legiran The end of the Cold War all over again.
"The small Ukrainian force who got its ass kicked back in 2014 asked the US and UK to help turn them into Special Forces Commandos.
When the Russian forces crossed the borders they were all hiding and waiting to strike at the logistics train that was overstretched.
Even if by some miracle Russia achieves its strategic goal they will be broke, economically isolated and NATO will have a wealth of notes
on Russian tactics and hardware."
"Need to update this to reflect Russia's land bridge from Crimea AND seized Ukrainian ports now getting armor and troops and supplies through those ports. And before everyone jumps in with the sunk landing ship event, that was a 1960's era ship able to move 40 tanks (depending on size/weight) or 40 APC's. Significant, but that would have to happen dozens of times to choke off that avenue of resupply. This is Russia's ""Achilles' heel"", but if they can't slam that door closed, they'll be outproduced, and overwhelmed."
Video is absolute BS nothing is true with logistics and functioning way better then western one . This is laughing
Laughing is this
"Their plan was doomed to fail if Ukraine didn’t surrender within 72 hours. It’s zero surprise Russia can now only exert force by air w/a 70% conscript army and when u consider its army’s design:
Conscripted Soldiers (Serve 1 Year)
-paid less than $25 a month (way less since ruble collapse)
-receive 3-4 months of basic training
-serve for only a year, during which they are often victimized by their own officers, who often violently haze young recruits
-Many receive MREs that expired years ago and insufficient ammunition

Contracted Soldiers (3-Year Service)
-Paid $1,100 per month
-Receive roughly 3x more training
-enjoy many opportunities for
corruption including siphoning off conscript pay
-Are given better equipment

Russian Supply Lines Were Designed to Fail:
The corrosive effects of the divide between conscript and contract soldier are multiplied by the army’s design, especially in Logistics & Transport (the most important aspect of armed conflict without doubt).

The most critical logistics units (fuel, ammo & food shipments) are heavily staffed by poorly trained conscripts.

Incompetency and low morale in these critical units has a snowball effect, crippling front-line units. Most of the tanks, AVs, etc. destroyed were already abandoned after both or either getting lost and running out of fuel."

Look, I admit I'm being glib here, but this analysis is essentially correct. Russia did not plan for a long war, and they're paying for it, and it's the kind of mistake that any decent gamer knows not to make. The difference is that Russian military leaders have to cope with a president that callously throws them into a war they didn't prep for. Maybe they know better, but Putin doesn't."
"@RocketGuardian oh no ... You actually believe that, dont you?"
"@Dane Lynch based on what I'm seeing...a gamer that forgot to buy wards, went for a meta build instead of a  counter, wasted money on flashy skins instead of OP champions and oh yes, trolled his opponent so much he made it personal, yeah...Putin is a potato.. Zelensky is literally about to end this guy's whole career."
You think ACTUAL military generals and strategists simply overlooked one of the most important parts of any invasion? You honestly think YouTubers are better at making war than the Russian military?
"POV: You're panicking to save yourself from the tanks steamrolling on your neighborhood, and a russian soldier from one of the tanks went off and walked to you, and you there, scared as hell and he suddenly asks ""Where is the right way to Kyiv? We've been getting lost for a little over an hour now"""
"@Dane Lynch lmao supposed to be a joke but not everyone gets it, so to disect the frog, no, they cant use gps, road maps, satelite images (unless its their own) and their radio frquencies are bombmed with jammers as a lot of them are not using any radio encryption and they are having logistics hell. They bombed a village to bit, but once theyre far from their main supply lines aka train as they use train to supply the army, they get lost and supplies get thin as theres no rail everywhere so after the train logistics comes truck to deliver feul to tanks thats why theres so much broken down tanks on side of roads after the 2nd day of the war and no, if they use cellphone, itll get intercepted too"
....they don't have GPS in those tanks? No road maps? Satellite images? Radios to get ahold of headquarters? Cellphones?!!!! Come on now....

"*First of all, everyone should know that 2/3 of the entire population of Russia fully supports Putin's military invasions! Moreover, this 2/3 of population is also ""proud"" of these invasions and ""victories"" of Putin, for which they respect him even more! The peak of Putin's rating in Russia was precisely during the 2nd Russian-Chechen war in 1999 [The peak of Yeltsin’s rating also was during the 1st Russian-Chechen war in 1994], Russian-Georgian war in 2008, Russian-Ukrainian war in 2014 and now in Ukraine! The Western world doesn’t understand that Putin is a product of Russian society itself, sick with the idea of Rusism [Russian racism] and the thirst for imperial greatness. This society is similar to the society of Nazi Germany in the 30s, and it can’t be stopped only by a change of russian government with ""democrats"" who moved today with McDonald's and Ikea to the US and the EU, and having criticized Putin, are already claiming to be the next ""builders of democratic Russia"" - this has already happened more than once! The society of this country needs to be re-educated in generally accepted international norms and moral values under international control, as was the case with Nazi Germany! A terrorist country in a huge part of the land that holds more than 100 peoples under its totalitarian control against their will, constantly attacks neighboring countries, openly arranges entire genocides of peoples, uses the civilian population as hostages for political pressure in its fascist ambitions, IT CANNOT exist in the civilized world!*
*The whole world threw the Chechen people into the mouth of Russia like a bone for a hungry angry dog, and Europe lived quietly on Chechen blood for 20 years, while even financing Russian fascism in Chechnya, supporting Russia both politically and economically. Even after all this, today the Western media write loud headlines ""CHECHENS attacked Ukraine"", personifying the whole Chechen people in the face of Putin's puppet and traitor of the Chechen people Kadyrov, although the very policy of the West made a huge contribution to the creation of this very Kadyrov and his host from Moscow, silently observing the genocide over our people, as the West did during the Nazi genocide against the Jews before the start of the Second World War! And believe me, the Chechens have not forgotten anything, they have not forgiven anyone, and the Chechens will take back their freedom, given to every nation by God, no matter how much this hypocritical and corrupt world ""recognizes"" our freedom and our sovereignty! And Kadyrov is also waiting for his personal hour!*
*GLORY AND VICTORY TO UKRAINE! AND MAY ALLAH PROTECT UKRAINIANS AND UKRAINIAN CHILDREN! AMIN🤲🇺🇦*"
"*_«The world must finally wake up. Acceptance that «Chechnya is Russia's internal affair» will sooner or later lead to Europe becoming Moscow's «internal affair» as well. The Russian beast must be stopped today, including by taking its nuclear weapons under international control. If this is not done today, tomorrow Russia will become a threat to the world, to all mankind.»_*

"Russia is winning. 
Yes, the invasion is slow... but that's what happens if you want to avoid civilian casualties while your enemy is using human shields & hiding in civilian targets. 
If this was an American invasion, they'd have carpet bombed half the region and killed at least tens of thousands of civilians. Russia ain't like that. But somehow THEY deserve sanctions...
What happened to the West? I don't recognize my country anymore..."

"3 weeks later and this video still holds up. Beoynd that, the UA army is starting counter-offensive in some places. That's not just failure of logistics, that is pure lack of logistics. That, and the complete lack of corruption control in russian military. No wonder russian consripts are happy to sell their tank to UA for 10k dollars and citizenship."
"The army camped outside of Kiev is a diversion. The main battle is to eliminate Ukrainian Army in Dombass. I don't blame you, cos even Pentagon didn't see it.

actually its pathetic Ukraine has a border with the Russian federation if the Russian military was any good it was supposed to take the whole country in the first two weeks 1800km is a joke when the country is Literally next to you
It’s war time propaganda guys. Russia will not lose. No one can even count accurate Ukrainian casualties.
Imagine a btr stops right in front of you and asks for directions to the capital
What a BS
Grammar trouble?
"""they are there to liberate"" why does this sound so much like what the US would say about its ""operations"" ?"
My only complaint is your choice of measurement. Pick miles or kilometers. Don’t clutter up your audio with both. Here in America we’ll never convert to metric until we are forced to. I actually prefer metric over imperial. It is so much easier.
Strangely similar to hitler invasion of Russia. Artillery and all.
Makes me wonder what weakness the U.S. military has.
"one more fake. The airport was never retaken by Urk not by 8.00, 9, 10 or 23:00. This was ukr media fake as many others and proved days later....so the level of analytic level is lower then the water line."

"What the hell is the difference from Russia taking over Ukraine than white america taking over Africa, enslaving the people and treating them worse than the dirt of the earth for the past 400+ consecutive years of slavery in america? The only difference I see is that the Ukraine people wouldn't be treated as bad, and even given opportunities to prosper, keeping their language, culture, lineage, wealth, and all they have gained, unlike black americans, were ever able to, at the hands of white america. Ukraine is just harming themselves for no reason at all, but to face the inevitable take over."

"1. Kyiv was also defended be flooding the plains around making it a muddy mess. 
2. The Ukrainian Special Tractor Force is the surprise hero. 
3. Real time satellite and AWACS info shared by NATO is likely extremely helpful behind the scenes. In fact, it allowed Ukraine to move their forces just before the attack. 
4. The Russians were and are low on tires for heavy vehicles. The ones they had were not maintained and/or inferior Chinese made. A tire changes every kilometer or so I really slows down a convoy."
"@Dane Lynch If that 60km ""convoy"" is anything to go by yes. Also for such a powerful force, it sure is stumbling when this was supposed to be a 15 day ordeal :)"
....you're really suggesting that one of the most powerful military forces on earth are being stopped up by flat tires? Really??
Seems Russian wheeled vehicles are suffering from serious dry rot. Seeing alot of vehicles with flat tires. Probably due to age of tires and the tough Ukrainian weather.
Where are the sanctions against Belarus? They are accessories to war crimes and deserve sanctions.
I hate this guy's intonation!
"Its a shame that America run YouTube. Criticising thier expansionism through NATO is looked down on. Had we worked more towards peace rather then expanding closer to Russia we may never have seen war, the Ukrainians wouldn't be a proxy war between USA and Russia and eventually Putin will have died and  Russian democracy would have improved. 
NATO needs to be dissolved and we should work more towards unified peace then military threats."
"@Mirra technically not true and technically not equally observed. America are one of the biggest illegal invaders of countries for either siding with groups that are Anti-American or are neutral and refuse to listen to America. In fact 75% of the last illegal invasions in modern times have been led by America. Unfortunately America bank role the global institutions and sanctioning institutions and therefore their illegal wars are ignored and forgotten. 
 if any country can join any group, then please explain Cuba? They are still facing sanctions and military threats and potential invasion from America. America also tried (and failed) to invade Venezuela last year, another illegal war that isn't even mentioned in any mainstream media.
Also please explain Palestine..."
"Why should NATO expansion be looked down on? If a sovereign country wants to join a club, they are allowed to. If anything this underlines the importance of NATO. Having such an unstable and aggresive country next door is a security threat so it's no wonder countries want to join a defensive pact. And when you consider a DEFENSIVE pact a threat, then you should ask the question ""are we the baddies?""."
Don't remember NATO doing this to another stable European state

RUSSIA IS INVINCIBLE

Invincibility would of won the war by now
Slava Adolf Putin!
"Many media outlets seem to point out the ""high"" number of russian troops of 150,000, here it's 175,000. I can't be the only one thinking that these numbers are absurdly low. The Ukraine has ~600,000 km², so you'd have 1 soldier every 4km². Also compared to the 40mio citizens, the russian soldiers can only terrorize, never properly occupy the country. Maybe I am simplifying things, but ignoring all the technical aspects, this invasion army looks straight up stupid (while still being an unacceptable act of aggression)."
"""The US can supply conflict anywhere on Earth"" - and that's what US is doing in Ukraine too."
"the autocrat of russia, taken your position pretty soon"
A continuation of a conflict they had 8 years to prepare for and did nothing... Every dollar spent to defend them is a waste...
"Well, the 22nd largest military power of the world being able to defend against the 2nd largest military power for a whole month is definitely not a waste"
"The old USSR relied heavily for Trucks from… Detroit. We sent so many two ton trucks in WWII, that they didn’t build any of their own.  They could concentrate in building tanks and artillery.  The truck we referred as the “ Ma Deuce” allowed the Soviets to keep the fight going and push the Nazis out of the USSR to Berlin.  Stalin wrote a thank you note to Ford Motor company, telling them  about the importance of the trucks in USSRs winning the war.
It looks like Putin didn’t learn this."
"@Michael Michael  I guess the history books got that one wrong.  Then again, it was a Michigan schoolbook.  LOL"
"The bulk of the trucks furnished to the USSR through Lend-Lease in WWII were actually Studebakers, built not in Detroit but in Indiana, and ""Ma Deuce"" is actually the nickname of the M2 Browning .50 cal. machine gun introduced just after WWI and still in use today."
Do you assume Kyiv was the main objective? Perhaps the Russian's objectives are what they said they were and have focused on neutralising the main Ukrainian force in the East and getting rid of the sizable faction that are big fans of a famous Austrian painter from the 1930s.
"I signed up for Curiosity Stream and Nebula to support you guys to make the content you want. Still, you're jumping the same propaganda bandwagon. I have expected more from you and other youtubers."
Photographic evidence is a bit better than a blank screen on Russian TV
How did the us and nato logistics fail? That’s the real question. We watched the build up occur step by step doing nothing about it.
To say their defense failed is to say there was one to fail.  Nobody cared enough to do anything at the time.

"Note that this video is now 2 weeks old and it seems like russian logistics still going to shit.

Russian incompetence and poor communications."
Why ??
"I can't remember where I saw it... But I saw an estimation as to the overall supply levels of the Russian forces a couple of days ago... Which stated that the frontline Russian forces could be straight up completely out of ammo, food and fuel within a week or two and as a result could become almost completely incapable of continuing to fight. I also saw something that stated that morale among the Russian forces is extremely low."
"@Dane Lynch historically powerful military with historically high corruption. Crimean war, russo-japanese war, WW1, Afghanistan, first chechen war. It has happened before many times"
....and you believe that? This is literally one of the largest fighting forces on earth and a historically powerful military in the modern day. These aren't tribesman or cave dwellers. You really think Russia is goina run out of ammo?!😂😂

"The Russians are grinding down the Ukrainians and they are doing it with flipped math. 200,000 guys are grinding down 600,000 guys. It’s one of the most amazing things. When this story is finally told, people are going to be stunned. All these people now are saying, “Oh, the Russians, they are doing so poorly, the Russians this…”. Maybe they are. Maybe I’m getting this all wrong. But you know, I’ve studied military history, I think I know how to read a map, I think I know how to look at the balance of forces, I think I know how to study logistics and stuff, and I think I’m reading this right….This war is closer to being over than many people think. Scott Ritter. I believe this video is based on west information or the guy has not clue about a real war"
"@Michail S Ukraine’s ability to launch significant military operations had been eliminated. If their artillery was intact, then that column was easy pickings for massive destruction.That did not happen. Alternatively, if the Ukrainian’s had a viable fixed wing or rotary wing capability they should have destroyed that column from the air. That did not happen. Or, if they had a viable cruise missile capability they should have rained down hell on the supposedly stalled Russian column. That did not happen. The Ukrainians did not even mount a significant infantry ambush of the column with their newly supplied U.S. Javelins.


The scale and scope of the Russian attack is remarkable. They captured territory in three weeks that is larger than the landmass of the United Kingdom. They then proceeded to carry out targeted attacks on key cities and military installations. We have not seen a single instance of a Ukrainian regiment or brigade size unit attacking and defeating a comparable Russian unit. Instead, the Russians have split the Ukrainian Army into fragments and cut their lines of communication. The Russians are consolidating their control of Mariupol and have secured all approaches on the Black Sea. Ukraine is now cut off in the South and the North. USA is just propaganda !!! The end of the war is about to happens and they know it"
"You fail to mention that Russia has an absolute advantage in artillery, cruise missiles, air forces. Yet, Ukraine is using a simple strategy - dig in the cities and hit supply chains. Look closer - 1 month has passed and all that Russia has achieved is taking Kherson. Mariupol, a city of 400k, is standing strong for a month now, despite them having NO artillery, NO air support etc. If you studied military history, look at the siege of Grozny. This is exactly what is happening now in Mariupol and this is what is going to happen in every major city - a slow, painful grind, week after a week, heavy casualties, enemy squads around every single corner... now look at the map and see how many cities of this size and bigger are there on the way to Kiev."
"11:05 So my question is why? Why are they underequipped? Putin knows that, if he will lose this war, Russia will be invaded by NATO forces and Russia will get spilt up. So why are they unprepared?"
"@Kevin ah I didn't know that,in that case that means that NATO invading Russia makes it  a 0,0000001 chance"
"@the gentelmen Russia has the largest active nuclear warhead stockpile in the world, roughly 20% more than the US."
@Michail S yea especially since they're trump(or putin?)card which is that they're the 2nd largest owners of nukes besides the us

You really underestimate Iraq under Hussein, they also had a nuclear program. This all publically ended in 1991, in the early 2000s the UN wanted to inspect potential sites for undisclosed WMDs in Iraq, Hussein refused and the rest is history"
"Slow down. 1) NATO can't ever attack Russia, the result is a nuclear war which NATO can't win. 2) By attacking Ukraine Russia is doing the opposite - NATO is becoming stronger and more united, it receives a new purpose to live. 3) Russia's army is number 2 in the world. Ukraine is number 22. Now after almost a month of fighting, Russia has only captured one major regional center - Kherson. It is a fact, you can look at Russian maps and see that very little progress is done. For comparison, NATO captured the entire territory of Iraq in a month."

How does Russia not have enough trucks? Isn't that all they have been building since Germany invaded? Because they knew they'd need trucks for the next war?
"Sounds like Ukrainian's should send some people in to Russia to do the easy job of dismantling a few key rails.  Even burning the wood below the ties should be enough to weaken them, so they break when the next train rolls over."

That's what happens when all your advisers tell you what you want to hear and are afraid to tell the truth
"Only problem is, you’re giving them the info they need.  Way to go…🤦‍♂️"
"@Xsp:  Ha ha ha, how true."
I think if the Russian military is at the point of watching yt vids to get strategies then they are hopeless
Damned Tic Tockers. Makes life tough on the facist. 👍.
Thank you for this perfectly researched video.  I am now a subscriber.

"Consider this: the distance between western Ukraine and Berlin is about the same as that between southern New York City and suburban Atlanta. 700 miles. About an 11-hour drive at 60mph. Sleep tight, y'all."
Russia completely failed to understand the mindset of Ukrainian people as a whole.
"Russia could win earlier by concentrating on Kiev and not spreading all over Ukraine. By spreading, they are making the same mistakes that the Nazis did when invading Russia in WW2 :|."
One of the few times I like social media
Actually Putin is ending the 8 year old war… that the western media kelp hidden from their public .
"This is the best information that I’ve found yet that explains what’s been going on with Russia and the Ukraine!   ***It really makes me wonder why with this increasing threat to Ukraine that the western nations, as well as NATO had not been providing the Ukrainian’s with weapon system to help Prevent This? They are all now after it’s to late, sending untold dollars and weapons which seems to be too little to late! Do they want WWIII? It really makes one wonder? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
It's worth mentioning that Ukraine blew up it's railway connections to Russia and Belarus and Russian trucks had defective Chinese tires.
When you watch western medias propaganda one would think that Ukraine is about to enter Moscow and not other wax around. Lol!
"@R Phuche Hes not from a very smart country, if thats him on the pfp.."

"You surpassed Goebbels with your propaganda 😂🤣😂. Yeah, Russians are so weak that NATO is not afraid to fight them to the last Ukrainian. And the Americans are so strong that they did not dare to fight on the ground even against small Serbia, a country of 6 million people, but bombed them relentlessly from the air, losing several of the most expensive planes such as the ""invisible"" F117. If Russians wanna do the same tactic as Americans and bomb Ukraine from the air, without worried about people, we wouldn't talk about logistics and duration of operation."
@Baumi Marco For sure they are...
"@Baumi Marco OK big expert, how do you know what is Russian strategy?"
"@Baumi Marco I'm not the one who spreds propaganda, I'm not claiming anithing exept what I've witnesed."
"@marko kovac Its a fact, that their strategies are cursed, otherwise they would have taken over ukraine in no time."
If Ukraine retains its territorial integrity  with Zelensky still acting as president then it would have won the war... otherwise it is all talk and wishful thinking.
its crazy to me that the media and the peapole didnt do anything when there was a war in irak and iran and syria because these countryies had muslims and other religions and not so many cristians why does the world only focus now on the wars and didnt focus on the wars of irak and such
"Now imagine Russian bases, bio-labs, instructors, weapons and constant anti-american propaganda on the territories of Mexico and Canada. And Crimea WAS Russian. It was a gift of Nikita Khruschev to the USR (Ukraine Socialist Republic) when it was a part of USSR. And now it's back home again."
"@Thedaus well, I can imagine believing US propaganda). Russian Crimea - what propaganda is in that fact?"
Imagine believing Russian propaganda!
If they wanted crimea then they should have said so before signing the Budapest agreements
Can we give pu tin the no bel peace prize for single handedly ending the plan demic?
"I feel Putin’s tactics are to weaken Ukraine to such an existence that it will never be a threat to Russia or join nato , allowing Russia to further weaken other countries that may align with nato , I personally think Putin will allow a peace plan, that suits his strategy, but I’m an ignorant kiwi fan"
This is just a military exercise for Russia. An invasion would’ve flatten Ukraine in 24 hours
well .. russian troll .. Phootin failed BIG TIME

People who are crying for Ukraine  i get you but now you need to understand something went wrong with that Europe organization they are letting Ukraine in the organization by breaking the law people are dieing BCS of Ukraine fuel is expensive BCS of Ukraine suspension is making th world in bad situation just for letting Ukraine in the organization get serious guys European needs something more than peace i swear
"Very similar to Hitler. A poor planing feom a dictator against democracy.  Poor logistics doomed nazis and seems dooming soviets. Feel sorry for those on ground, again fooled by their rulers."
"Wow, video about ongoing conflict appeared on my recommended section. Something finally changed in YouTube?"
"Lol, russia losing, but why Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kherson, Melitopol, Sumi, Chernigiv - one of the most biggest cities, which was preparing for war about 8 years, are already captured? And im not mentioning all other dozens of minor cities. Yes, because russia have bad logistics and planning. Otherwise, whole Ukraine would be captured already.
Lol, so silly."
"@Thedaus im not a troll, my frend. Im agains any war. But lets be more adequate in our assessments."
"@Halo Craze they were free from civils long ago, for about a week only ua military was on positions inside, as in the bunkers (because soviets were building schools and hispitals as small strongholds with reliable vaults in 60-90s for nuclear war to protect stuff and kids).

American fake propaganda at its best hahahah
"@Ian Hamilton A lot has changed actually. Mariupol has been totally and utterly surrounded, as has Kharkov. Kherson has been captured and Ukrainian soldiers in Cherniv are trapped, around 50 thousand men from army group north have been encircled. As well as this the Russians have caught 150 thousand Ukrainian troops from army group east bordering the DPR and LPR in what they call a 'kill cauldron', which is essentially an encirclement on entrenched Ukrainian and Azov battalion soldiers, they have cut off most of the Ukrainian supply lines and are starving them. In a last ditch attempt for glory, the Ukrainian military (More likely Azov battalion activity) has started to launch their remaining artillery and missile systems into civilian areas in DPR and LPR, most of these systems are being shot down, but unfortunately as I'm sure you've heard a strike made it into the civilian capital of Donetsk and killed 27 people. Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol are on their last legs as the Chechens have been actively hunting down Azov battalion soldiers (A few days ago they filmed a video in which they address the western nations and the remaining Ukrainian military to get them out, proclaiming at the end that Ukraine will never fall), and yesterday many films appeared online with Chechen soldiers mocking and even torturing Azov battalion soldiers, who were easy to identify due to their Nazi patches, insignias and tattoos. The west and east banks of Mariupol have been taken, and the Russian army today is working on securing a corridor through the city to allow their supplies and army groups to regroup in order for phase 3 of the military operation, which is simply eliminating the neo-Nazi battalions as mentioned previously. The first week was heavy for the Russians, after this however they drastically changed their military tactics, realizing that the population is in fact against them and shooting at them, they have started to focus more on the longevity of their soldiers and ensuring their safety rather than what was initially planned. The biggest change in this military strategy is the employment of siege tactics, precision strikes on enemy positions hiding in residential areas, and using missiles to destroy weapon shipments, I'm sure you've heard the 400 millions dollars worth of equipment and 230+ foreign volunteers killed in a single hypersonic missile strike? Regardless, it is you who should wake up and realize that Russia will crush the Ukrainian military, and cull the neo-Nazi's as well as the globalist new world order regime."
Nice documentary 👌 I enjoyed it let me see more please
PUTIN IS A TERRORIST
Am I the only one seeing FBI hat at 1:49 ?
"I thought this was quite well done. Dovetails very well with the info podcaster, Beau of the Fifth Column gives regularly. Thank you!"
WAIT A FUCKING SECOND IS THIS HAI?
"ok im having a really hard time coming to terms with there being no jokes, I keep second-guessing myself with everything you say"
"Cutting Ukraine into half leaving 150-200k soldiers encircled and nearly surrounding the major city Kyiv with soviet era tanks and artillery, I would call that a huge success :) The first hyper-sonic missile was fired 2 days ago and Russia has many of those. If they wanted to Ukraine would look like Iraq after the USA and UK entered there would be no buildings standing like in Iraq, Russia didn't even use long-range bombers in this invasion ahahaha just wait until Russia fights with 2 hands not with 1 tied to its back :D"
@András Ördög sooner ?? what's with sooner ?? U.S.A is nowhere near to falling anywhere anytime forseeable. Russia & communism very long ago lost & buried under silt at bottom arse end of Marianas trench crevice 🤣😅
Seems like polar association☹️. I seek the truth!
"Just gonna parrot the media lies?  Russia is engaging in a limited action to seize certain targets and areas.  It isnt trying to take the nation and thats why we have seen no high altitude aerial bombing, no attacks on the grid or internet services, or water purification services. 
  You don't know what your talking about."
why? please nukes and draft
Just hire foxhole players smh
When your special military operation takes months if not years...
"I knew about this story for long, looooong time, what I didn't know is that the wing piece fell off on its own, I always heard that it got blown by enemy fire. 🤣🤣🤣👍"

Excellent content I’ve Subscribe  Slava Ukraine🇺🇦🦖🇺🇦✊
Hello everyone Slava Ukraine Glory to heroes Death to the Invaders 🇺🇦🦖🇺🇦✊
Russophobic propaganda.
@Jimmy Ohara Most of the people in the Donbass feel that they are Russian.  Does your compassion suddenly stop?
@Ni Oxx civil (uncivil) war is NOT an invasion. you miss missed missing the point 😐☹️
@Jimmy Ohara What do you call the shelling Ukraine has been doing on civilians in the Donbass region for the last ten years?
"Sorry, but do you really think Russia is doing this attack full on? This is just probing. Hopefully, this will end soon. NATO is on this too. Unfortunately :("
Nicely veiled bla bla bla or encouragement for Ukraine people to die for nothing.
@Jimmy Ohara Now that is dense.
right
"Noone will ever forgive russia. putin is just as good as Hitler, Stalin or Saddam. Another villain in the history of humanity"
"Due to a lack of correct information we can only guess what's happening. Media on both sides is pure propaganda.the reason why NATO should buy bilj of dollars new equipment has no reason, the Russian army isn't capabel of fighting a war, and it will take a decade to replace what they lost . The idea that they would invade a baltic state is ridiculous. They cant fight  on two fronts. I hope we get descent info in the next weeks."
"Russia will loose this war due to super crappy leadership, logistics, & moral. When Ukraine sets the surrender terms it would be right for Russia to loose a 10 mile zone to Ukraine w/ very few roads etc through 5his zone!"
"LOSE, is one O. not spelt loose, which is a totally unrelated word (as in loose tap or screw) 😐"
Yeah Russia is so much loosing right now. Logistics failed two weeks ago.. Ukrainians are at the gate of Moscow:))
Shh!! Don't give them ideas!
The superior logistic of USA helped to lower the casualties in Iraq down to 300000 civilians. Bless them.
Note: No hospital can help a casualty.
"During the civil war, the Ukrainian army killed over 10,000 people in Donbas. 149 children from Donbas were killed on that black list, while over eight hundred children were wounded or underwent some other form of torture. The Ukrainian army bombed towns and villages, targeting civilian facilities: kindergartens, schools, children's playgrounds, churches, buildings, family houses, hospitals, health centers, clinics ..

In 2015, a memorial to the children of Donbas who were killed during the aggression and terror of the armed forces of Ukraine was erected in the capital of the DNR. It engraves the names of boys and girls who were brutally killed in their homes, apartments, yards, schools, children's playgrounds - while hanging out with friends, while walking with parents, sleeping, in refugee columns, on buses ..

The monument was erected on the initiative of the head of the city administration of Donetsk, Igor Martinv, who proposed to perpetuate the memory of the dead children of Donbas, who tragically suffered from the criminal actions of the Ukrainian authorities. The proposal of the head of the administration received the unanimous support of all members of the city administration, and a decision was made to erect a memorial. It is here that a memorial complex called ""Alley of Angels"" was built.

Several children of Ukrainian nationality were killed by the grenades of the Ukrainian army, because those who fired did not care who was ""on the other side"". Many children were left without one or more extremities, some children lost their hearing permanently, other children lost their sight, some lost both their senses . some children also suffered psychophysical violence, according to Russian media. All these shocking scenes, however, do not affect the masters of life and death in Kiev much."
@Kvicksilverpuman Because he is an unlawful combatant!
"Great video. 

“War is a fight between systems”

“An army marches on its stomach.” -Napoleon

The millions of views only attest that this has been shared extensively and, probably, including among experts to at least consider this  perspective."
"Russia is repeating the same tactics they have used against the Germans in WW2. City after European city was encircled and the Germans surrendered after holding out for only so long. What we see in the case of Ukraine is those politicians seem to take a lot of joy in social media sending their negotiation conditions on Facebook, and enjoying that media is putting out only one side of their story."
If Russian logistics “failed” how come they have taken 20% of Ukrainian land?! If Russian logistics “failed” how come city after city gets encircled?! If Russian logistics “failed” how come USA retreated from Syria and ME when Russia stepped in?
"@Kvicksilverpuman ​ @Kvicksilverpuman  You don't know because you are drinking too much of msm.  Melitopol, Kherson, Berydiansk, Enerhodar, Sumy, Chernihiv, Konotop.  All of the southern Azov coast, some 145 kms deep."

"The USA, Poland , United Kingdom, Australia combined took almost a month to take over Iraq with no air defense systems no allies help just Iraq vs the west also Mariupol would beg to differ from this video"
@199 000 there was 300K troops plus Iraq was surrounded by us military bases
But Iraq 2000km away from homeland
@King Kemet 25 don’t get me wrong. In a war of attrition Russia will most likely win. But the question is does Russia have the will to have a drug out fight. And even if they succeed it will not of been worth it. They are losing war material that they cannot replace leaving their military more ineffective than they already are.
@NubGaming remember in order to defeat the enemy you have to think like the enemy and RESPECT!!!! The enemy otherwise you’ll underestimate the enemy and get caught up in biases and lose to the enemy
"@NubGaming how? When Ukraine have yet to take back Kherson oblast, Mariupol, and in order for Ukraine to join NATO they’ll have to take back Crimea and the rest of the territories they loss because in the nato doctrine no nato country can be part or associate with an dictatorship so yeah when all that happens then the invasion will be a failure"
"Sooo russia is proving time and time again that central planning does not work.
And yet they keep doing it.

"Here you are mostly about war and fighting. Has anyone thought about what will happen to Ukraine after the surrender of the Zelensky government? What will happen to the economy of this country? What will happen to people? What will happen to the economy in Europe? You spit in Russia and feel sorry for the Ukrainian fascists, but it is Russian gas that heats your houses, and your cars drive on Russian oil. Maybe it's time to open your eyes and turn on the heads?"
@Thedaus Name at least one serious crime of Putin.
@Usul573 A solar-powered car?!! Can't be? I almost fell off my war bear...😰
@Вячеслав Ф No we use solar panels to power electric heaters and electric cars. You guys are THAT far behind??!!
"@Usul573 Yes, we use our own gas. And  have you already switched to firewood? Or are you already using cow shit instead of firewood? If not yet, then you will come to it soon 🤣"
"Now people might realize how important the right to bear arms is. You can not depend on the government or city police to protect you. Look in the Ukraine civilians are struggling to defend there own citys. Thats what kills me in the USA you have people that want stricter gun laws or to ban guns all together. Guns are not the problem and stricter laws or banning them will not fix the problem you might see a little drop in gun violence but when criminals realize people don't have guns to protect them, you become vulnerable. Crime will skyrocket look at the Uk they banned most firearms and knife attacks went up 1400% rape went up 400% robbery 600%. An do you really think banning something will effect people getting guns? NO! do you think criminals think huh I cant own a gun because I'm a felon and I wont pass a background check. No they will obtain them illegally either way weather you ban them make the laws stricter but you want to take my freedom of protecting myself from these people. Why do you think in the 1800s to the mid 1900s there was barely any crime? Everyone had a gun, if you went to go rob a bank the clerk would shoot you or a customer would look at all the dead gangsters all shot to death people got sick of being robbed killed raped ect. everyone had a gun. The 1980s happened war on drugs stricter gun laws and guess what the violence crime and killings has just gotten worse. Look at Communifornia really strict gun laws and LA has one of the highest gang and murder rates so the numbers speak everything banning or stricter laws does not effect crime like the liberals and democrats think. Criminals are not thinking hey I'm going to go shoot this guy I better go get a background check and a carry permit so I can go murder somebody, no they will obtain the firearms or weapon and do it anyways."

superb content
"*WW2 like war being started to hide WW2 like genocide.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now ​a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries!* 1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  *Hitler was an unexcommunicated Catholic.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings. Hitler rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by odorless zyklon B rodent extermination gas (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  *Most were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.*  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast when he was asking what the concentration camps they were building were for, then later they circulated that he had been fired a year before the event. 
*Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)* 
​According to Revelation 18 this group wears *scarlet(Cardinals),* and *purple(Bishops).*  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  *The (cross or X) is on the shields(British flag, same as Roman shield) of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs. According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse **13:18** says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).  It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.*  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  *Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).* 
​Latin letters have a number associated with it(like a Roman clock), just like Hebrew and Greek.   *Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working in self interest. The earth belongs to the people collectively.  *1John**5:19* is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.(Daniel12:4)  *Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you!  Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China. The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!*  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  *Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica(Rome), show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).*   Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies. Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.   Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy business.  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. *The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, pre corona. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system.* (corrupt) Read Exodus20, Deuteronomy5 and Acts15 and see about the Bible's view of idols, and you will see that it is Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 has idols breaking God's commandment.  Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John5:19 OWO.*  People calling it the NWO, should think, isn't this the same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918?  *Think! Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?*  All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  ****There is two realities playing out.***  *1.* A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  *2.* Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  *Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control! Do it!  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison.* Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world. *Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day) ""lord's day"" lord's day is a clever imposter of the Sabbath.) A Pope struck a coin commemorating chopping off people's heads for observing the Sabbath.  On one side of the coin was the Pope's head, and the other an Angel with a sword and a pile of heads.  Ste Bartholomew's eve massacre.* In the Vatican library is the proof of the collaboration of Church and State enslavement. *Urgent necessity, to make the Vatican library completely public, and every nation vote to make all religious files over 100 years old public, or start paying taxes.* Through history the Catholic Austrian Royals ruled Germany and the leader of the exterminations was Catholic Austrian Adolf Hitler, and most exterminations were in Catholic Poland.  Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 eats it's children.  *Omicron is a Greek letter like the last letter omega which has the O sound.  In the the original Hebrew of the Bible there are two words את untranslated in *all* other languages in Genesis1:1and other places.  In Revelation it tells you who the את is.  It has been hidden in the Greek to deceive you, as the complete Bible was in Hebrew and the Alpha and Omega(first and the last) of Revelation is really the את of Genesis1:1 א(aleph) is the first letter of Hebrew and ת(tau) is the last, and the one represented as את was in the beginning with God.  Omicron is a code word for omega.  Omicron is information exposing the את being changed to Alpha and Omega.* Determining the future by movies, is pure stupidity.  *××Every one needs a 2.5 micron air quality monitor, so you can see when you are being GASSED!xx* (Revelation13:15,18:5,*6*.)   **How could there be a vaccine for a new variant with out testing, that is not covered by previous jabs?**  *G7 nations are removing corona restrictions, to regain it by war powers.*boycott G7** Who will do the will of God? (*Revelation 18:6*)   *I've been warning for over two years that Rome would start a war with Russia and China to hide genocide.*  Roman Catholic Joe Biden stopped the natural gas pipeline in the US and now in Europe.  This is Rome's war.  China be on guard of forces invading Taiwan, blaming you and attacking from there.  *Those attacking Russia/China, read Acts2:44,45, Daniel2:44,45, you follow Satan.  Gog and Magog are in Turkey, Ezekiel38 not Russia.*  Mark of beast(MOB) nations hate (Bible Acts2:44,45; 4:32-35).  Ukraine sinking their own ships and blowing up their own bridges.  NATO has M.O.B. on flag, and goal is war on Acts2:44. Pompeo says Rome planned Ukraine war for 2017. Britian's Boris Johnson said, the pandemic is not working, so plan A, war.  Roman Christian militias killing in Ukraine.  Putin wanted to talk before this happened.  Think!  Germany forbidden to cause genocide because of WW2 extermination, so now they turn their military over to NATO to do it.  Russian news channels are being blocked in the West, to hide the truth. Free? No, duped.  Think!  *The Pope is the man sin in the(false)temple with 666, and exterminating for generations, yet the US although it has the largest military, is naked and prostrated gratifying her Papal master, while UK readies her turn.  Most cowardly in all history.*  America chose Satan over God.  I think Ukraine war was started from Poland as the Italian air force was there.  So many claim to know and follow God but will not obey *Revelation18:4-8,*  I am not Russian. So quit attacking Russia!  Canadian, US and British military found dead there, from their involvement.  Russia would have about the same population of the US if not for Rome's slaughter of their people, and they're militarizing again. Poland the site of most WW2 exterminations is mobilizing the entire nation including school children for war, and Italian military is there.  Joe Biden says if this message doesn't stop, he'll attack Russia.  I'm not Russian.:-;(?(!"
NATO proved to be pussies afraid of Russia while Ukraine is single-handedly destroying Russian army.
Uhh if NATO intervened it would be nuclear war.
Why.  Is.  Puten.     Srange.  And.   Ugly.   Looking
He's not
The irony of you decrying disinformation in the comments.
Wow
"I watched live as a CNN reporter was at Hostomel Airport, Kyiv. He walked up to the soldiers & asked:
*""Where are the Russians?*

The Soldier replied:
*""We are The Russians.""*

Hearts & jaws DROPPED. Russia has gone on to kill 2 American Reporters since..."
"Absurd bs. Russia is taking this slow and methodical to destroy the least amount of civilian buildings and to not create many civilian casualties.
Putin does not US ""shock and awe"" wars where you bomb towns, bridges, gas & oil tanks and roads to pulp."
You did a great job with this.
"May Our Lady of Perpetual Help, with St Michael and all the angels, protect the skies of Ukraine and halt the bombing and artillery. May Kyiv and all Ukrainian cities continue to resist Putin and may their citizens be safe."
"Wow..I can't believe how incompetent the Russian army is..if this is true I repeat if this is true,than if it wasn't for their nukes,wed wipe them of the face of the earth..what happened to Stalin's army?"
"At this pace, Ukraine will be liberated of nazguls by May, perhaps July if Russians are too lazy to move their asses.
Russians logistics maybe slow, but not surely ain't failing.
Mark my words:
- 60k UA troops near Donetsk will be surrendering by April'22
- Eastern UA fully liberated by May
- Kiev liberated by June'22
- Lvov liberated by July'22

Logistics? What logistics? Russians haven't even sent their whole Army yet."
Can you do a video about US logistics on Gulf War?
"This is such propaganda. Russia is literally winning on every front. The DPR and LPR are almost fully relieved of Ukranian forces and most of Ukraine is very much controlled by Russia now.
This is why you ought to listen to both sides of the story. Russia said from the beginning that their aim was not regime change or to take Ukraine's capital. They have certain demands that are non negotiable and are pursuing those. Kyiv is surrounded on all sides. Russia is piling on the pressure and Ukraine is about to give in. Russia wants 1. Ukraine to put it in their constitution that they will NEVER join NATO or the EU, 2. Recognise Crimea as part of Russia and 3. Recognise the LPR and DPR as independent. It seems like things are going according to plan."
"HAHAHA, COPE HARDER!"
great summary of the propaganda. Of course Russia is having almost no issues at all.
Tell us about the American liberation of iraq and how Libya has prospered after Nato liberation
"Let us not forget the assistance Belarus has given to Putin and his Nazi regime. Belarus must suffer for their part in this illegal, immoral, and tyrannical attack on a free, democratic, sovereign nation. Russia and Belarus are murderers of innocent women and children. For this they shall pay dearly."
@b13 LMAO! Did I hit a nerve? I guess the truth hurts.
"The one thing to take this is Russia like Germany 1939-45 relied on railways both western and eastern. The whole duration of the war fought by partisan activity prove more blow than it was romanticized by heroism, solely using on form of logistical transportation prove more of Achilles heels, even Britain at the blitz of 1940 has to severely ration it's population from shipment hunting by kriegmarines henceforth the priority of hunting Bismarck was vital more than dramatizations."
I think you’ll find that the Russian python is irresistibly squeezing the life out of the Ukrainian military
of years ago and it remains true now
Western disinformation
go Ucranians!!!!
Good job bendover productions. Haha.

"That thing around 10 minutes about taking down signs is hilarious. That exact same thing happened in WW2. As soldiers would flee an area (doesn't matter which soldiers or which area), they would often flip signs around, flip the arrow, or just take down the sign entirely. Unless you knew exactly where you were going, it was very easy to get misdirected by incorrect signs."
@Shawn and you've seen this with you own eyes?
@Dane Lynch Yes. I don't see delivery cars broken down on the side of the road with an empty fuel tank and tires cracked apart because the tires are 20 years old. Their soldiers didn't even have body armor until some time around 2013.
@Shawn worse equipped than your local door dash driver?
"In the 30's Russia starved 6 million Ukranians. To many Ukranians this wil be the chance for some payback.

The Soviet famine of 1932 was caused by drought and kulak sabotage. Victims of the famine were Russians and Kazakhs.
"I literally cannot imagine being caught up in conflict like this. This was really informative, thank you. I hope Ukraine can retain it's sovereignty and I am so sad for every casualty on all sides. Russian soldiers are also victims of Putin's imperialism. My heart goes out to all the people affected by this.

Dumb comment I know, but I struggle to conceptualise and emotionally grasp what it means to be in a conflict like this. Peace."

"That's fine.. we'll just starve their country for the next 50+ years like North Korea. They can pretend all they want and say they're rejecting western influence, the reality is that they have no chance of winning and are ruining their own economy in the process."
Starve? Explain how?
Russia has been like a second rate country for decades right? Is he just a poorly written bond villain or ??? What madness would prompt someone to start a  War with half the Western world?? Especially when your country is a 2nd rate power with 3rd rate technology?
"Impeccable analysis!
Congrats!"
massive corruption to the point of tanks breaking down half way to the city's they were going to invade from a lack of fuel. Russia wants to feel like red alert but they cant admit how far they have fallen. sad....very sad...but also get bent lol.
"Would highly recommend looking into the maintenance issues those logistics brigades seem to have. In short, it seems like they didn't even do the most basic maintenance operations in at least a year before/during staging process, and their trucks burst to shit."
"@Alex Muenster Oh yeah, absolutely. The patriarch gonna come out and wololo those tires back together!"
">>and their trucks burst to shit.<< Ah, yes - But the situation for the Russians will improve as their vehicles ""magically heal themselves"" over the course of the coming weeks!"
Good job bendover productions. Haha.
Anyone else think the 'soldier crying on the phone to his mother' video is completely fake?
"@Raffaello fair enough but arent u the least bit curious if they are or are not faked? i mean, sure u can feel like they are but why not go the extra step to make sure or not? unlike russia, the free world has access to information, and if this is affecting ur opinion of the war effort then why not at least do a 2 second google search? u shouldnt listen to me, im a douchebag with a keyboard, if ur curious about the war (u clicked on this video) then u should do ur own research"
@knighter just my opinion man
"@knighter The guys expression looks like bad acting, the sips of the tea look weird, everything being so well staged with camera/mics. The 'phoning mother' part is very story-like, as if this were a script. All the elements seems too perfect to have really happened. In my opinion It's a propaganda piece designed to build a story and get a viewer to feel an emotion. Interestingly, I think it goes against the Geneva convention to use/humiliate an enemy soldier for propaganda. So if it *is* real then we go down another rabbit hole"
"Widespread corruption in Russia also means nothing their military needs gets to who needs it, and what little gets to their military, amounts to a fragile eggshell ready to crack under pressure due to the corruption all along their entire chain of command. That lesson is not just for the corrupt Russians, it’s a lesson for us all as well, corruption can actually kill people."
I have the impression that this could be the first war to be fought with weaponised autism.
"Russia hasn't done a big strike on the first few days, they avoided cities avoided big gathering of  troops....
The goal was even to avoid loses of ukranian troops in order to let them consider leaving the army or recapitulate...

"How nice all this sounds to us we should never forget that there is lots of biases and misinformation going around. Take everything with a grain of salt.

They will always have more of the information ""our"" side wants us to hear and there will always be a focus on the negative stuff of the enemy, and the positive stuff of ""our"" side. Nevertheless i enjoyed this video, but I will still remember what i've just said 😁"
"During the civil war, the Ukrainian army killed over 10,000 people in Donbas. 149 children from Donbas were killed on that black list, while over eight hundred children were wounded or underwent some other form of torture. The Ukrainian army bombed towns and villages, targeting civilian facilities: kindergartens, schools, children's playgrounds, churches, buildings, family houses, hospitals, health centers, clinics ...

In 2015, a memorial to the children of Donbas who were killed during the aggression and terror of the armed forces of Ukraine was erected in the capital of the DNR. It engraves the names of boys and girls who were brutally killed in their homes, apartments, yards, schools, children's playgrounds - while hanging out with friends, while walking with parents, sleeping, in refugee columns, on buses ...

The monument was erected on the initiative of the head of the city administration of Donetsk, Igor Martinov, who proposed to perpetuate the memory of the dead children of Donbas, who tragically suffered from the criminal actions of the Ukrainian authorities. The proposal of the head of the administration received the unanimous support of all members of the city administration, and a decision was made to erect a memorial. It is here that a memorial complex called ""Alley of Angels"" was built.

Several children of Ukrainian nationality were killed by the grenades of the Ukrainian army, because those who fired did not care who was ""on the other side"". Many children were left without one or more extremities, some children lost their hearing permanently, other children lost their sight, some lost both their senses ... some children also suffered psychophysical violence, according to Russian media. All these shocking scenes, however, do not affect the masters of life and death in Kiev much."
Who support Ukraine 🇺🇦💙💛?
"""It all happened so quickly""

Not counting the military build-up, almost 2 months ago, along Ukraine's border. Mr. Magoo could have seen this coming, back in 2014."
I like your Mr. Magoo reference. Beep! Beep!! Road hog!!
Correction: It was publicized so quickly
We all have short term memories. United States & Nato caused this war in Ukraine. You can only antagonize a bear for so long until it bites. Putin will gain back Ukraine.....this is Prophecy. Read your Bible.
"ive read my bible, listened to the pope, and theyve both told me that killing is wrong... do u know what ur talking about?"
Nyet Molotov
"After this is over, the russians will pay a stiff price for about 100 years."
What a nonsense hahaha. Did you even know what their plans are? Inform yourself before talking shit
"So basically if ukraine keeps blowing up trucks, rails and pipes, the russian army is fucked."
This war could have been avoided if the USA and NATO had stopped pushing for Ukraine to join NATO. Do we really expect Russia to lie down when the west continues to push ever eastward?
"NATO didnt push for ukraine to join, ukraine wanted to join on its own... do u know what ur talking about?"
"So all of this information was available and we're only now learning that Russia has been planning this for quite a while?! I really don't understand our media, governments, or society."
what
Why Russian won’t loses war?
I am Vietnamese American. Urbanization war is very costly (You named it) Once the local digging in and trapped installing… NO WAY OUT! I didn’t know much about the Vietnam war but once revisited Vietnam I then know why Americans didn’t have a chance…. I was an American Marine for 4 years 👍👍God bless America 🇺🇸

so its a great story then
Hey curiosity Stream seems to Support Credit Card payments only.  If you add PayPal i will sign up

"Well, at least they, Russia, have a chance to learn from their mistakes.  Thanks to the US they will be better prepared for the next conflict."
"It can address individual errors but it can’t address repeated systemic failures because those are ideological. If Russia was to overcome those they would need to start thinking like the west, and if they start thinking like the west, then Russia will no longer be a threat."
"""Quickly""??  Only a fool thinks someone accumulating vast arms on your border is ""having a picnic""!
Even Sadam realized Desert Storm's prelude wasn't a ""parade"" practice.

Well.. at least the world have seen Russia's army capabilities...
"Like we know what's going on in tbe fog of war lol. Nazis anyone!  Mindlesd mass hysteria. As Mark Twain said. If you find yourself following the herd, you stop and reflect! My old man in his 80s is loving it. Glued to the media wants to kill Russians. 🤣😂And hes born again Christian. Goid luck"
"@Miles Lavers I give you that the hysteria is out of proportion in western media and that nuance has been thrown out of the window. There are very real reasons as to why this situation is happening. 
But it is of note, that the hysteria in the west is only matched by the sheer propaganda and lies in the east. Russia has suffered many an injustice at the hands of the west.

But barely anyone in Ukraine supports this invasion except for strong minorities in Donbass and the north-east. One wrong does not make a right. 

Putin being right about some things does not justify or legitimize invading a sovereign nation with the goal to overthrow its democratically elected government. I could understand Crimea to an extent, I can understand sending troops, equipment and help to the separatists to defend the Russian minorities in the Donbass region. 

But this is crossing a line"
"@Miles Lavers We might not know the endgame but we know for damn sure that the original plan was for Kharkiv, Sumi, Mariupol and Chernihiv to fall in the first 2 weeks. Kiev ALSO should have been encircled by now. 
We know this because of orders that POW's have received, captured battle plans, amount of rations and supplies that units were given...etc etc. As well as the fronts where Russia is pushing the hardest. It's clear that they have wanted to encircle Kiev for a while now. They just haven't been able to."
"We don't know specifics. Buth Ukraine and Russia are lying about the situation at the front
What we do know is how far Russia has penetrated and what territory/cities they have taken so far. Kinda hard to lie about that if Russian tanks are rolling through the streets of said city.
And what do we see? Kharkiv, Sumi, Chernihiv and Mariupol..... all cities that should have fallen in the first 2 weeks according to the initial plan. And none have been taken"
"Pfff, is that why we could never get what we needed in the US Army? OH, we got tons of crap we DIDN'T need, but never what we asked for."
"I cant believe that the Russian army is so terrible. We keep hearing about logistics? Remember that ukraine borders Russia, yet thier invasion has been a mess. When you look at the genius of the  first US invasion of Iraq and realize it was the other side of the world yet was pulled of with genius yet the big and scary Russian military can't supply itself while invading a country with a shared border."
@Iman Robota wanna rethink that last bit?
"The Iraqis never put up a real fight and our tanks basically killed everything in front of them. I had a CO who was in the spearhead, armor MOS, and he said: ""A truck drove in front, BOOM, no more truck. Donkey cart came in view: BOOOm no more donkey cart.""
I had friends in Fallujah and they'd talk about had bad it was. Calling in arty on civilians. Tanks flattening buildings. It was a total shit show. So don't make it sound like it's even comparable. We slaughtered the hajis, but the Russians aren't going ape shit killing everything like we did going into Iraq."
"likebot comment

I'm from Germany... and you Americans are just as bad liars and hypocrites as ours🤮🤮
"Putin and his cronies have killed thousands, brought misery to millions, trashed his economy, united the west, expanded Nato and shown the world what a third rate military he has. And yet its all going to plan: must have been a plan devised by a suicidal maniac...."
All that time the Russian trucks and wheeled armored vehicles sat and their cheap Chinese tires got dry rot then failed in Ukraine.
Wow! The first time I’ve ever engaged with an ad on YouTube - have high hopes for curiosity stream and nebula :0)
If you consider the help ukraine is getting.. am not surprised. NATO gives Ukraine info on russian troop movements live.. among other things. Terrible the cost Ukraine has paid but also Russian troops.. The mere fact that nato is involved this way made me belief Russia will overthrow Ukraine.
"So dramatic. When Russia defends itself, it's evil. When we expand through genocide for oil and empire...it's self-defense."
how is russia defending itself
its something america says what do u mean
"huh..... so the same weakness is still present in Russia even from decades prior? i'm not gonna say ""miscalculated"" but will say ""Botched"" instead"
Just because it worked once it wont work again Putin. This isn't 2014 the sequel.  Слава Україні!
"2 fake videos with ""Russian soldiers"" in the store: Russian logistics is crushing. Such a waste of time."
Not agree about logistics. It is difficult when coutry has a hostile population and doesnt have wish to huurt much it
"I find military logistics a very interesting subject, does anyone have some recommended reading on it? I'm mainly thinking WW2-era and onwards, but I'm open for varied suggestions."

"No ""civil defense"" make them a ""hostage population.""
Such can be fixed, quick!
There is a powerful way!
It's only a matter of restoring parts of old systems, in a 21st century context.
... Comprehensive contingencies management...
... Through an Integrated Contingencies Management System, which includes all individuals, and Sectors: Public, Private, gov. (Public Servants).
Possibilities...!!!!!"
"""We..."", who love life, responsible liberty, accountability, no borders or boundaries, happiness, living the art of kindness; and, serving our ""duty"", to set loose, every deadly beast within us, to keep it thus...!...?

"Folks do care...
  And; ""We..."" has no borders or boundaries!

That system hides within ""civil defense.""
And, it's very workable!  (I found it, by happenstance!).
Such, is our avenue to mechanize and empower pure / direct demos-kratos (""democracy""), within a republic.
FEMA recommends secondaries systems.
""We..."" can build this, for comprehensive contingencies management.
Note: a Vet ('73-'78, 2111/0431), asking all you other millions of Vets, scattered throughout neighborhoods, to help build the basic SOP system folks need, for clinging too.
Use a logistics / liaison ""Matrix"" NGO, as neutral / objective, ""level playing field"", to help us consolidate and coordinate resources: human, material, info, environmental...

(Such was the ""FEMA"" of -1964-, ""OCD"" / ""Office of Civil Defense""; also, the ""Civil Defense Administration""; now, ""DHS"", as the ""Department of Homeland Security.). 
Folks!  ""Civil Defense"" ain't ""civil defense""!...
And, at the very least, ""civil defense"" can not - only be - another government agency.
 You are ""civil defense""... With, ""them"", and with all others, 
 We are born ""members""!
 It's a basic survival thing, among humans...
   Using basic social systems...
 (Ag.,/food, water, shelter, med., fire/hazard/threat control, waste disposal, S&R, power, etc.).
  As, ""social animals""...
  With ""niches"", and ""habits""...

  This system would help us do our parts, far more efficiently, affectively, and effectively.
  To mitigate, prepare, respond, and recover.

And, if we plug in the tech we need...?
To bring it all into a 21st century context...?
 Something like the way folks managed their 1776 neighborhoods... Communities... Nation...
 
Thusly, an opportunity ""We..."" are not using!

I ask you; do you remember the headaches George Washington had with the ""militias"", during the ""revolution""?...
That, they made up their own minds, about who, what, why, when, where, how, they'd assist ""the cause""?

 That is, within the ""matrix"" NGO, ""We..."" must name our ""operations Section""...

  And, ""We..."" can do our own polling and surveys..

"We in the the West/NATO are not ""free"".

You and me are a victim of ""divide and rule"" Washington DC employing an age-old strategy.
Very simple strategy:
*Keep the tension high.*
An age-old political strategy. Old as the mountains...
Today everybody is afraid of the big bad wolf...
*Of course the afraid little sheep will flock to the shephard (alpha).*
The alpha has no interest in achieving lasting peace.
The alpha adores the dependency of the afraid sheep who flock around him...

And re. ""strategies"" and how ""the truth is revealed on scraps of paper"" (Roehl)

The USA has practically admitted that it misuses all small nations as ""lightning rods"" and ""tools"" to advance own global domination.

Adam Schiff, in 2020, two years before the war:
*""Most critically, the military aid we provide Ukraine helps to protect and advance American national security interests in the region and beyond.* America has an abiding interest in stemming Russian expansionism, and resisting any nation’s efforts to remake the map of Europe by dint of military force, even as we have tens of thousands of troops stationed there. Moreover, as one witness put it during our impeachment inquiry: *“The United States aids Ukraine and her people so that they can fight Russia over there, and we don’t have to fight Russia here.”*
From a short ebook ""Adam Schiff Impeachment an Opening Argument"".

Note the use of ""Russian expansionism"", when it is actually the USA/NATO which has been acting as an icebreaker these last 30 years to create PNAC/EU markets in the traditional Moscow sphere if influence, the Black Sea region. 

In other words, a typical attempt of ""flipping the script"".

Note also that this US policy regarding ""tools to fight for US interests"" was incidently revealed as a by-product of the probe into the alledged attempt by Trump to blackmail the Ukraine to dig up ""smear material"" on the Biden family for dirty domestic political games.

They say say ""the devil is in the detail"".
*I say the details reveal the devils among us.*"
"@Armchair Magpie You seem to be a very rational and logical person.
I suggest going to the Kaiser Wilhelm II video as I suggested to the other commenter. Read my comments about 3-4 months back, and see if they make ligical sense. Cut out the ""emotions"", and only dissect the logic and reason.

*Europe has been here before.*
Only the ""divider"" intent on ""ruling"" was different."
"@Armchair Magpie Then we are largely on the same track.
Brexit could have been avoided if the idea of a united Europe had been seperated early on, using the end of the Cold War threat as an incentive (EU as ""pure"" economic union, morph NATO according to the security issues of all concerned parties, incl. Russia).

An early creation of a ""United States of Europe"" would have met with vehement US opposition.
That was the issue.
Weak European leaders.

You can find a thousand reasons why there should never be a ""United States of Europe"", as indeed you would have found a thousand reason why 300 years ago there shouldn't have been a ""USA"", because being colonies (in an eternal state of war) was ""just great"".
Or a thousand reasons why the North should have just let the South secede in 1864. There are and were always *a thousand reasons* made by very logical and reasonable people.

If you have your way, Europe will forever *pick up the tab* for American ""forever wars"".
What makes you think Iraq/Syria/Libya was the first? (Note: millions of refugees *came to Europe* tearing it apart) 

What makes you think the Ukraine will be last? (Note: millions of refugees *came to Europe* and prices are soaring, and will tear ""Europe"" apart) 

What makes think ""poor little Finland"" will learn the lesson?

"​@Ralph Bernhard United States of Europe is precisely what d'Estaing and others envisioned back then. Many people even believed in that idea back then, including myself. It was an overly optimistic vision that didn't factor in cultural and ethno-political differences all that much. You could see the cracks during Bush's Iraq war already, and much later after the immigration crisis and Trump's presidency. The EU is very far from political cohesion, it proved to be very vulnerable to external propaganda, as the Brexit has shown now. It would not change much if you just let the EU fold back to economic issues and attempted to create a multinational body after the USA's image. For once, every political body is always an economical one in the end, since fiscal and economic affairs on federal level do require some form of centralization. On the other hand, you'd have to deal with issues that are not just about standardization but more importantly social policies. And that's where things differ already. Richer countries during the financial crisis in 2008 heavily objected to a “transfer union”, and so did its people.

There are so many aspects that people outside the EU don't understand. All they see is its diplomatic and military side, and think it's essentially weak because it still relies on the US in these and only these matters. It doesn't mean they always agree on matters or choose not to join some US-led campaigns. But that's like a fraction of the EU is. The EU presently functions best at supranational level. Before it could grow into more, it would have to undergo the process of sociocultural amalgamation. It's very far from it because it currently has to consolidate and maintain its cohesion after the Brexit.

Even if somehow one day it would accomplish all that, don't expect it to be an antagonizing power of the level of Russia against the US. It would be much different from that. Most likely cordial."
"@Armchair Magpie Note that France and Germany already ""stood up to "" the USA on many issues, including 2002 when ""lapdog Blair"" willingly followed the alpha into an illegal war in Iraq but France and Germany refused.

"That’s why China has a Strategic Support Force independent of the Army, Navy and AirForce."
"Ukraine had to surrender years ago. They scrapped their brand-new bombers, they neglected their army. The West has not helped, and even now the West does not care.
I did not expect Putin to start a war. frankly I expected a conflict similar to what the West had done to Libya - let the leader to suppress the rebellion, then declare no-fly zone and let the rebels to kill the leader. I believed Putin will use this tactic, he started to use back in 2014.
But it turned out the West surprisingly resorted to the mentioned scenario. They did nothing to prevent Russian and Ukrainians from killing each other. Now with both countries bleeding - NATO started to ""help"" providing military equipment...
Could they do this before? To arm Ukraine or to disarm it. Now their ""help"" means just more dead soldiers from the both sides.
Thank you for the interesting video!"
"Well, Russians had started to disguise fuel tracks almost three decades ago. But they were so proud about this, they immediately started to show this camouflage on their TV))) (For comparison: Israel produced a anti-tank missile platform, which looked just like another tank, and kept it secret for almost 30 years!)
But analog radios are most likely used by Russians for deception"
"China constantly reminding the world that it will take back Taiwan by force if necessary so all Chinese already are well prepared for a war if one broke out.
Russia on the other hand are just sneaking around and backdoor diplomacy so even their own soldiers are not prepared for even a minor war"

"Another piece of bullshit propaganda from the West.  Well, you, westerners, did not want to even think of solving NATO-Russia problems by diplomatic ways - now you will reap what you have been sawing all these years. High-handed cowardish idiots absolutely sure of own supremacy over Russians and any other Slavic nations, if only you did really care about Ukranian civilians by 1 % of what what you claim, you would have never ignored legitimate concerns of Russia regarding its compromised security due to NATO-ization of Ukraine, constructing NATO military bases in the Ukranina territory, not speaking of bio-weapon labs funded by US for years there. We, Russians, Belorussians and Ukraninans are one nation, one people. And we will unite sooner or later. You, bloody motherf..ing westerners, are absolutely 100 % guilty in this mess and are to be blamed for the qoup in Kiev in 2014, when legitimate government was overthrown, and the conflict burst between those who did not support the new puuppets of West in kiev, for 14000 atrocities in Donbass, 2022 war disaster, - the blood of all these poor kids, their mothers is on your hands!!!"

Russia has the second largest army in the world, which in turn has made a sort of myth about the military. That Russia can't be touched militarily by any country in Europe.
They have shown now that, that myth is highly overexaggerated

The only thing that putin has is the belief  ( unfortunately ) that there will be no red lines that he cannot cross.  Just the fact that he seems comfortable with the use of tactical nukes shows that he is not sane .

"Wait a sec, am i the only person here who's interested about the way western military has better logistics than russia just because they can somehow pull resourses from nowhere? The author said they can use their military bases. But those bases don't really have unlimited supplies. They will need to resupply things anyway and railways and airplanes are the best ways to do so. Russia seems to have all of it in a fairly good state. 
No, a few photos of russian troops buying groceries are not sufficient to prove a failed state of a full scale invasion which seems to go pretty well. 

No, civilians from CNN news reports making Molotov coctails are not anywhere near useful in today's wars. They will flee to their homes as soon as firefight comes to them. And for their own good tho.
There are no real reasons to fight for Zelensky's puppet presidency.
He made Ukraine corrupt, poor and pro-nazi. 
And now  he wants to establish nukes on it's territories to posess a real threat to Russia on behalf of the NATO. 

Why would anyone want to fight and die for a legit retired clown?"

Please keep covering this war
Good content but at the end off the day if it doesn't go well for the Russians they step it up then NATO come in kick there arse Russia no where to go lunch nuclear attack vise versa were all done.
"Tldr why ruzsias failing

1-they expected little to no resistance and occupied in 3 to 5 days. So they gave little supplies.  It was the opposite. Ukrainian made millitias amd volunteers and stayed .


2-many vulnerabilities in there stuff like out dateded tools like no encryption. 

3- bad strategy.

4- economy"

I would not be surprised if cargo from China is already in Russia."

The war is a tradgedy. Every sane person wants it to stop. But I wonder what Wendover Productions sources are. There is no proof as to the Russian military is lacking logistic support. Of course the whole operation was meticuoulusly planned long in advance. You only make unsubstantiated statements. The war is shit but let's stick to facts!
"I feel for every person affected by the conclict. But its hypocrtitical to have such disdain for Russia, for her doing things the US has been doing for decades. It's pathetic."

Russia never had a brilliant army. I think it has to do with the endemic political distrust to brilliant commanders. Just a humble opinion.

"No country is a friend to another one in a true sense. Mostly these friendships are for mutual benefit. But before we try to morally support US/Ukraine vs Russia, just think what kind of values their governments espouse. US is one of the most democratic nations in the world, where their people have voice and another one is headed by an egoistic maniac, where democracy is a sham. Would you prefer a world dominated by a democratic nation rather than an autocratic one like Russia or China. Given a chance where would you like to live? Why no refugee go to Russia /China?"

"No mention of the fact that the CIA overthrew Ukraine in 2014.  We know this with certainty because Victoria Nuland had a phone call intercepted and published 3 weeks before their ""revolution"", where she was openly picking the next ""president"" of Ukraine.

After that revolution, Ukraine has been in civil war against their Russian minority.

Ukraine has a bunch of Russians in Eastern Ukraine because Stalin forcibly settled them there when it was part of the USSR.

On top of that, the United States has been moving NATO further east, day after day.  NATO is a defunct, worthless organization that existed to counter the Warsaw Pact - which has been defunct for 30 years, yet the US keeps threatening Russia.

This is ALWAYS left out to make it seem like Putin just woke up one day and decided to go to war."
"@James Murphy

Considering none of his soldiers and commanders knew he was going to war. Yes. Yes he did just wake up and decide that.

"From my point of view, as a former private in a small army of a small country, I think that despite the difficulties, Russia will get what it wants. And what is now called the ""War in Ukraine"" is really just a military operation, the real war will come later and it will be many times larger and bloodier.

Meanwhile the west continues to buy russian oil. grats. If ukraine wanted to really hurt russia they'd be destroying the pipelines running oil and gas into europe. One wonders why they haven't done so.
Russian troops defending Russia is normal for any country under threat. Russia has and is doing what it set out to do. NATO is sending military weapons under cover as Humanitarian Aid. This information was hightlighted by Italian airport workers who will not load these weapons listed as Humanitarian Aid.

"You, western humans, are so pitiful and silly constantly having those brainwashing news around yourselves. Geniuses, Russia failed logistics? Lost the war? Do you even believe in this comedy? I know it's hard for you, but try using something called CRITICAL THINKING, at least sometimes. The only reason Russia has not won this war yet is because the Ukrainian Army USES its population as “living shields"", hiding among civilians. Given the state that the Russian Army does not want civilians to suffer, they are incredibly limited by this. Or you really think that if Russia had wanted to, they could not have already erased Ukraine from the face of Earth? They have incredibly strong long-distance missiles and aircrafts for that. They would not have even needed to send their troops there. Next time writing something this foolish, use your brains for the first time."
Do you think that the Russian military were showing concern for civilians when they bombed hospitals and civilian shelters in Mariupol?
"American hypocrites naturalize narrative that Russia is bad and Ukraine beautiful spread moral lessons, the same America that killed millions of people around the world in violation of every possible international legal act surrounded Russia for ""defense"" and set up biolabs with illegal war poisons banned by conventions .

"@Sababugs112 my best friend’s wife’s parents are in Kharkiv and her brother based on the Donbas.

Kiev is still not surrounded fully. Just see how much aid and weapons are being brought in from the western side- it means there are vast stretches in the west and south-west of the capital where the Russian army has not succeeded yet.
"The Russian army in World War II had the same kinds of logistics problems as they do now and as you pointed out in Afghanistan. They seem a little reluctant to learn. During World War II the Russians would build up supplies behind the line and then attack until they ran out of their logistics range and repeat the process. They could not sustain continuous operations. They were at that time rail dependent. Being dependent on rail for strategic movement even along interior lines goes back to the civil War in the US and World War I. During World War I we saw the introduction of the truck as being a major component of the logistics train behind a fighting Army. This started when the French appealed to the taxi drivers in Paris to carry troops to the front. I believe they carried a regiment or maybe it was even a division to the front lines in taxi cabs. The point is modern warfare is about roads and even cross country capabilities of your logistics train. If you look at the United States Army you can see a variety of vehicles that are capable of even through traveling on roads, sand, mud, grass and broken ground. Granted it won't move quite as fast but the fact is they are not confined to roads. You should also be noted that Russian trucks appeared to have really crummy tires I've seen a number of pictures of trucks with flat tires. This could be the tires themselves, the tire pressure regularization systems or other mechanical issues. Fighting vehicles with flat tires is really weird considering vehicles during World War II that relied on tires like armored cars had run flat tires back then. Perhaps the Russians haven't figured out how to make those."
dude it doesnt seem like they failed theyre in the capitol
"They've been stuck on the outskirts making no progress for weeks now. The city's basically functioning normally, the shops are better stocked than the ones in Moscow. Just the other day a bunch of EU politicians literally rode in by train. Remember Kyiv is not that far from the Belarussian border, by all rights they should have swept into the city in the first few days, but nearly a month in the best they can do is inch forward slightly."
I hope Trump is Russian😜😜
Thanks for making this video.  Very informative.
24 Feb 2022...a day that will live  infamously!
That barberic beast like Russian Pres Putin is a Lair
"Ukraine got most of the world on it's side 
but they need serply Up WITH UKRAINE 🇺🇦💕"
"""An army marches on it's stomach"" and in the day, that meant soldiers and horses, oxen too. Today it's a soldiers stomach and the petrol/diesel of the vehicles. Russian troops trying to survive on 10-year old rations and rotted tires on supply trucks is the modern starvation - similar to what Napoleon suffered in Russia. The young, poorly trained Russian conscripts are cold and hungry and their morale is very, very low. ""Welcome to Hell"" Ivan."
If you want to be taken seriously you will drop the ridiculous up-speak.
"tbh tho, usa failed nearly all wars and invasions, with their bases all around the world smh"
"There's always 3 sides to a story.  Your side, the opp side's and the TRUTH itself.  You get to give your version, the Russian version is barred.  And the truth only God Knows.  When Hitler murdered all them Jews they were unable to report his crimes to the world cos Hitler Surpressed they're voice. Today we know if they were able the world may have stopped that injustice.  It shows how important controlling the narrative is........"
"Guys, stop being so stupid and stop believing these videos about 
Russians being rather immature in combat, having poor tactics, losing 
thousands of soldiers, etc. These videos on youtube are part of a huge 
propaganda. The Ukrainian army is long gone or heavily destroyed! I hate
 to tell you that, but here in the west they keep making things appear 
to be the opposite, so normal day life can continue without everyone 
having panic attacks and protesting on the streets like crazy. ""14 
thousand Russian soldiers were killed""?! Get out of here, man. The 
bigger the lie, the more credible or what?! And you think they just keep
 on driving forward and getting killed like lemmings?! How stupid must 
people be to believe this shit! The Russians are amongst the top 3 
armies in the world and now they're being easily slaughtered by a bunch 
of soldiers hiding in the bushes?! Soon all will be exposed, and you'll 
see who's gaining ground and who isn't."
cope
We all saw the russian flag in Kharkiv
This may be the best video on the conflict that is out there. Absolutely amazing.
"You Aced It! This was an awesome, most informative, and The best of all content anywhere since ""Putin the Crazy"" started this madness."
wishful thinking or morale based propaganda?
The most stunningly bad decision came right out of the gate and that was starting a war in the middle of winter. Nothing can move off the roads in winter spring or fall becaus
"The world watches,"
This is either a paid propagandist for Biden or just an opportunist selling false information to the uneducated. Russia is not failing.
Fake news.
Bullshit! Russian territory in 100-200 miles from front of war.  Russian it's not Honduras and she has experience. What  problems can  be in this cause? You are stupid or make propaganda.  In second war for this country don't was problem make logistics to Berlin.
I bet you money there are some international brains behind the fabulous Ukrainian defense.
"Ukraine made a big effort to identify their shortcomings after 2014, there's been US and British advisors there for years helping them shape up. Clearly the efforts paid dividends, though I'm also sure that them getting top notch intelligence for free courtesy of Uncle Sam helps, as well as all the weapons we've sent them. Regardless the Ukrainians deserve a hell of a lot of credit, it's rare to see fighting spirit like theirs these days"
"To summarize:
We have two cauldrons with up to 70k ukronazis in them, capital besieged by force very much numerically inferior, complete air superiority, cruise missile strikes right to the polish border that remove hundreds of cannon fodder mercenaries a pop, hostage rescue operations on the scale unavailable to any western force in principle and _then_ some youtube clown proclaims that logistics ""have failed"".

You can't make this shit up. Westoid military envy can pretty much be cut with a knife at this point."
Better spend the roubles they gave you to post this before they become completely worthless my friend
@Tuckerslam RT ? Rossia 1? Is that your source ?
"@Sababugs112 I said ""maps"", not pathetic USGOV agiprop. Try again."
@Tuckerslam according to Wikipedia only places encircled are Chernkhiv and Mariupol . There is also blob west of Kyiv but in there there's basically no Military
"The main problem is that individuals feel helpless...we believe the problem is far too large for any one person to do anything other than simply observe until it's too late to do anything, and to then continue to observe, but add comments demonstrating our outrage...

History has allowed the people who control our lives to fear every other Government. We are sold the idea that every Government is a potential threat, and they are....but the people of that Country are not representative of the Authority or Government perpetuating the myth.   
Those few brave people with 'balls' protest in frustration....risking, and often losing their lives in the process.... but it's usually too little.. too late....  
So are we condemned to tolerate these dictators ad-infinitum?  Maybe not.   
Personally, I feel technology has finally, and inadvertently handed us what I believe is the ultimate 'weapon' ...but most people are unwittingly already 'armed,' without quite realizing just how powerful this weapon is...It is of course, the mobile phone!  
Many are waking up to it's potential, and will video any 'transgression' or 'event' and upload it for all to see....but I feel the time has come to take it much further....... 

Step one is for someone to create an App specifically to attract pacifist's, (which is most of humanity) who, as terms of 'membership', commit to agreeing never to raise arms against anyone, anywhere, at any time, for whatever reason... and as a form of 'protest' to sign up to attending if possible, a 'party' whenever and wherever required, ...  
Those that can't attend (which would be probably be 99% of the global membership) could show their support by sending a donation, no matter how small, to finance the 'party'....... Imagine the effect on warmongers and Governments who claim to have our best interests at heart...with almost everyone openly declaring to their respective governments that they insist on living in peace, what government would (or could) jail every passivist in the country? Facebook paved the way, with YouTube following close behind. We know the concept of how global networking works, so why not take it a lot further....for the benefit of all mankind?   
All one has to do is 'sign up'...With no membership fee's making it affordable to everyone!  Any voluntary donations should be used to organise and help pay for 'global parties' to be held in the cities or countries facing internal (or external) aggression...  
Just imagine.....If thousands of people from around the world flew in to Kiev to 'party' with the Ukrainians as the Russian army started moving towards the Ukrainian border,  Putin would never have invaded. Killing thousands of unarmed international 'partier's' would have  been political suicide!  Any power he thought he had, would be at serious risk...imagine the sheer embarrassment of attacking thousands of international 'partygoers', who are staying with welcoming Ukrainian families, who are simply having a good time......The Russian soldiers should have been welcomed with flowers, food, and beer. Signs at all border entry points should have been posted with welcoming messages, inviting the soldiers to attend the international celebration, and that the road is open, and nobody is going to attack them.....  The army would have cautiously rolled in, expecting it to be a trick....but until attacked, would not have fired a shot until any potential 'threat' was identified   Not a shot would have been fired...the soldiers would have instantly realized they were duped by Putin and his cronies...and after enjoying the 'party' would have radioed back to base, in a drunken state....eventually returning home with stories of good times, good humour, and to eventually denounce Putin.....Putin's strategy would have imploded on itself... There would have been no need or reason to stay and 'occupy' Ukraine....30% are already Russian!
''The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.'' Lao-Tzu   Anyone with technical expertise interested in kick starting the idea? Too late for this war, but enough time to prevent the next one perhaps???  Any and all comments, advice, criticism, or assistance welcome......"
"plot twist, it didn't."
"NATO inviting Ukraine is just a cover-up story used by Russia where in fact, Russia already planned this from the start"
I really hope someone takes Putin out. He is a criminal to the world.
Excellent summary.
I was expecting a hack job.  This was interesting thanks!
SLAVA  UKRAINE  CROATIA  putin je NACI
Western propaganda videos once again .
The most stunningly bad decision came right out of the gate and that was starting a war in the middle of winter. Nothing can move off the roads in winter spring or fall because the land turns into a quagmire. Napoleon and Hitler were both defeated by Russian winters so you'd think they would have figured that one out or maybe they thought being Russians that it didn't apply to them.
lets be thankful they didnt go for the blitzkrieg route.
"They tried that and it completely failed, that's a large part of the reason why they took such horrific losses early on in the war."
Fail yet russia is moving across Ukraine swiftly and without destroying infrastructure... Thats a win... And this is pure trash propaganda
"Both of those things you said are totally wrong, the front hasn't moved much in about three weeks now, and indiscriminate use of aerial bombing and artillery has all but destroyed several important civilian hubs, ironically mostly in the predominantly Russian-speaking parts of the country in the East."
"Truth is USA strategy has been destroying the countries before moving ground troops in, because they didn't care about local population away thousands KM and culturally different. Russia hasn't done that, because the geographical and social proximity to their mainland, at cost of his own troops."
I don't trust anyone that says Keev
"So Basicly one of the Biggest Country Russion would lose the War because auf Failed Logistic.
Soooo...they lose the War by themself or i am wrong?"
This must be fake news. After twenty over days they are still there. So how’s the logistic fail?
@Sababugs112 no European or western country defending Baghdad dude. And Donbass in Ukraine same size as Baghdad which only take 12 hours for Russia to take control
@FOPandPAPA Baghdad is larger than Kyiv
America took Baghdad in 6 days . Russia has failed to take Kharkiv of over 3 weeks by now
Failed? They occupy and can now defend over 1/3 of Ukraine. I dont think you understand what fail means
"Have you ever thought to make such propaganda video in favor of Iraq, Libya, Syria fighting against invasion of USA"
Those were well planned and executed
Nothing failed except you and your lies
"This video is illegitimate and entirely incorrect, because Russia isn't ""invading"" Ukraine, it's only getting rid of the Americans in Ukraine. The western media won't tell you that though as you can see, instead try to spit on the Motherland's name as it has been doing for decades now."
Would be interesting how logistics in US-Iraq-War worked. At least the US shot thousands of missiles in the first days and had a more open and sandy field to come over.
How can anybody in the West and other countries like India support Russia’s madness or look away from it?
"Logistics is borderline the most important role in war. If you can't get where your going with your stuff, there's no war"
"Russia's opponents can only console themselves with such videos. Some of what is said is not true. For example, Russian soldiers have been holding Gostomel airport for 3 weeks under daily shelling. The Ukrainian forces have not managed to regain control of this airport. Also, do not forget that the initial pace of the Russian army's advance was higher than that of the United States in Iraq. Only in Iraq, the Americans could bypass cities on a flat desert and simply block them, while the Russians have to overcome difficult terrain: ravines, gullies, forests, rivers. And Ukraine, unlike Iraq, has a fairly strong army, which is provided with modern weapons. Well, don't write off the mentality. The population of the eastern part of Ukraine is actually Russian. These people are able to put up more fierce resistance than the Iraqis."
"Iraqi army had 1.3 million men and had more of everything than Ukraine . 

Gostomel was taken with heavy fighting and first wave was scattered only after the armour from the north arrived was it secured . The airport now is so damaged its unusable. 

USA tool Baghdad in 6 days . Russia has failed to take Kharkiv"
"""Ever since russian backed separatists took Crimea, Donetsk and Lugansk"" 
No, that didnt happen, what happened is a CIA backed coup took over UA government and these parts of the country tried to resist the armed takeover 
of their parliament and the circus elections that followed. And those people who lived there, decided to have a referendum and voted to get out of Ukraine and 
get into the Russian Federation."
@Ivan ____________________ Elaborate further and giving proper source that explains it in more detail as well that had a decent serving of people questioned and not just like 600 people or 1600 people and not a small biased handful as well with the polls being legal and official and the publisher and media source not being funded by the Russian Government or a Russian Company
"@władysław You mean the polls from 2009-2013 that have 23-35% stay vote? Because in 2014 there were several unofficial and the official vote and they were mostly 90% or higher for Crimea to leave Ukraine and join Russia. I mean, you can go to wikipedia, there's polling results from 2009-2019 about the referendums and they're all voting the same."
@władysław Not according to the people who live there and their referendum.
War Propaganda by the western media
Then Putin whips out the nukes….
"Do nations no longer declare war on others anymore?
Is this like Korea's Police Action?"
Best educational video for Russian armed forces. Next time in the future they are more prepared. Western viewers are not the only one who are seeing these videos. Why tell these things to russia?
@Verminator4  Just thinking all the mistakes they are making (russians) Are they really learning? Nobody knows but my opinion is that the less russians know the better.
"It's too late to fix these problems now, and honestly this is basic stuff, not secret training materials from West Point. The lesson's been out there for Russia to learn for literally hundreds of years, but when your country is arrogant and corrupt as Russia is the only way for you to learn is the hard way"
"Whilst the Russians are avoiding civilians the Ukraine nazi storm troopers are bombing there own civilians(who are Russians and  Ukraine was created by the Russians, its never been recognised as a sovereign state by the UN)  to make it look like the Russians are committing atrocities. You know unlike the USA UK etc committing war crimes all over the world. Of course that's OK because it was uk USA etc that was doing it for democracy.🙄"
"How can a nation of slaves , murderers, and rapists who brought to ruins hundreds of towns and slayed millions of civilians in Asia discourse upon morality and reason? How can you at the same time be blind to all the crimes conducted by those who have nazis shevrons on their nato military uniform in Ukraine? I wish all the hypocritical poseurs the most excruciating and painful death because I am the bloodthirsty Russian who is proud of his Motherland"
4:02 Are those DHL cargo containers?
"Can somebody correct me if i'm wrong. 
I think Russia has no chance against nato. They can't defeat the whole world right ? Europe alone could slaughter russia i would say, let alone USA. So i guess the only big threat is russian nuclear weapon. Well nato have it also, but once the first nuclear bomb drops it is all over. Putin probably have epic underground bunker with all the things you can imagine and he is crazy enough to start nuclear war because he will do just fine in his shelter.
However nuclear weapon aside, i think that with blietzkrieg tactics or something like that nato could crush moscow in days and then one think, why not ? Why shouldn't we counter attack. However if the war will stop in ukraine then ok, but if putin will make obvious moves towards baltic countries and Poland, nato should act."
"Honestly let's not get carried away, Russia is a notoriously hard country to invade. Napoleon and Hitler found that out. If they were fighting on their own territory, the poorly maintained equipment would be on its logistics bases so the mechanical failures would be less of an issue, they'd use their extensive rail networks to be able to resupply more efficiently, and the conscripts that make up a large portion of their military would be better motivated to defend their home soil. But of course all of this would be irrelevant because any invasion on Russian soil would provoke a nuclear response and the end of the world."
"35 million Russians do not have warm toilets and go outside in winter
they call it superpower!

the Kremlin junta is hiding behind the Russian flag!
a law was passed to imprison those who disagree with the Kremlin for 15 years!
slavic lives matter!"
You are making assumptions too fast. Russia has only started.
"😅 This cocky idiot is making it sound as if Moscow is the city that is being sorrounded, shelled and on the verge of falling instead of it being Kiev. Fake optimism at best."
"The best video so far on the Ukraine invasion so far. Detailed, methodical and clearly extensively researched. Brilliant work."
0.54 Looks like the protest against their own government in 2014/15
"Russia: *Failed Logistics*

Also Russia: *Manages to Encircle Vital Ukrainian Cities*

Also Also Russia: *Somehow creates or pays disinformation trolls despite Western censorship against Russian media because reasons...?*"
Mariupol and Sumy have been encircled .
The most intelligent analysis of the invasion in Ukraina.I hope that they'll provide us with further insight!
Putin is not a war criminal. He is a special operation criminal.
"It's time to stop WW3 right here and now.
Putin is a coward taking advantage of a small unprepared FREE Country/Nation.

WW3 has begun while America and the rest of the world is still just in shock WATCHING.

!!WAKE-UP!! WORLD.

Talking nonsense to someone that refuses to listen to reason, Common decency, or anything else reasonable. 

Means he's the kind of person that when when you BEG HIM to just do what's right without backing it up with actual force ONLY IMPOWERS HIM MORE.

Putin is an EGO IDIOT and nothing more.

HE IS AN OLD MAN TRYING TO SHOW THE WORLD HE ISN'T GETTING WEAK WITH OLD AGE. He's another President Biden. OLD and past his time.

What is the UN and the world planning too do???

Let him destroy the Ukraine while killing possibly MILLIONS of people and damaging a NUCLEAR PLANT endangering the entire world while politicians debate, wine like children about how Putin isn't playing well with others, and wanting to give him a social and financial TIME-OUT.

THEN WHAT???

He does it again and again now that he knows it's SO EASY...

THEN GET PREPARED Because China will do it next...

WHY WOULDN'T THEY...

FREE COUNTRIES UP FOR GRABS ALL AROUD THE WORLD.

If I was a younger man I might even grab a few for myself to save them SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE IN ONE UNDER SOME JACKASS DICTATOR...

WE THE WORLD must act now and not like cowards or SCARED SHEEP.

WW3 IS REAL and happening RIGHT-NOW...

Get off your knee and lets give him 24 hours to let his troops know THE WAR IS OVER AND GO HOME.

That's all the notice he can possibly be trusted with'.

Then if the NUKES START TO FLY.

I'd say better off now before he gets any more prepared and the Ukraine and possibly the rest of the world have any less people left to fight for OUR FREEDOM and LIVES because WW3 IS ALREADY UNDERWAY and the gauntlet of total war has already been thrown.

This is our best time to stand up against him if it's even possible to stop him from going Nuclear.

COWARDS DIE AS COWERDS...

And Putin after 50 years of watching IS COUNTING ON IT as he begins moving into the first of many FREE COUNTRIES to fulfill his sick nearly life long plan.

HOW COULD THIS NOT BE OBVIOUS TO ANY KNOWLEGABLE PERSON WITH A WORKING BRAIN???"
I am praying the Russian Army should all turn around and head back to Russia and take back their country from a madman. It would be more honorable to die trying to save their families and the world from a Nuclear war than dying for the conquest of Ukraine. Tell the Russian soldiers before it is to late for the world.
One of the most objective explanations (at least as far as I can see) so far. Thank You!
"During WW2, US know that USSR will never win against German Invasion code name Operation Barbarossa. But US quickly came up to the plan to fix USSR logistical problem by sending thousands of trucks every day to USSR to help their military to mobilize their operations on the encirclement of Stalingrad , Battle of Kursk and Patriotic War. Without those trucks, USSR would fall fast in the hands of the Third Reich. US know the weakness of the Soviet Union and until today, Russia never and did not even try to fix this kind of problem which turned becoming their achilles heel."
"Ukraine 44m population . 
Biggest country in Europe . 
25% of Ukrainian teritory is already taken . I'm not sure what is a logic of using word ""failure "" at any case . It's been 22 days since invasion started , all bigger cities are being surrounded , except Dnipro , Odessa , Lviv (Kiev has only free south side ) .  90 % of Ukrainian air defence is destroyed . In every city which is surrounded fuel stacks are destroyed  . Russian forces can only sit in front of the cities waiting for white flag which is a logical sequence when there is no way to supply those cities with food or anything else  . If u watch media its look like ukrainian forces are ready to enter Moscow ."
"@Sababugs112 If u look things like that , then Mariuopol is not surrended... like there is a sea on the south side . Second , Ukraine is from Sevastopol to Cherniv , from Liviv to Kharkiv . At this point Russia is controling minimum 100.000 sq km"
"25% according to whom ? RT said they'd already won on the 26th . 

Only cities currently surrounded are Sumy and Mariupol . Kharkiv is free , zaparozhia is free , Kyiv is free from the South and south west and north east too . 

Ukrainian AA operates . Yesterday Russia lost multiple helicopters . Russia isn't dominating the air like it should be .

Listening to RT the war ended on the 26th"
24 seconds
"what are you all talking about here, ukrainians and I are one people, we have common families, don't get into our problems, it's better to worry about what will happen when we figure everything out and understand how the West used us and provoked a war within our common people. Russians will remember this forever, and when I say russians, I mean ukrainians too. You don't know a damn thing about us, except for your stereotypical idiotic films about evil Ivans. Good luck to everyone. we are not what your lying government (USA) paints us to be, we are all exactly the same people who like to eat at McDonald's, watch Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, laugh at memes on the internet..."
I hope the Ukrainian sleepers in Moscow destroy the kremlin soon I want to see that palace of evil in flames
Bear in mind that the Russian forces are lest than a tenth of what Russia has militarily. As for failed logistics. I'd like to see America take on Ukraine. They aren't a push over. Russia from the start said they do not wish to kill civilians. This is hurting Russia FFS man!! The Ukrainians are their Brothers. The denazification of Ukraine is a very serious effort. The west downplays this by saying zelensky is a Jew.....we'll look at one of the most fascist states in the world....ISRAEL....Zelenaky is a white Ukrainian first and foremost.
200k at the beginning . Including chechns and local separatists it would be up to 250-300k thats more like 25% of the army (not the professional army the entire active force )
"According to Pentagon, Russia has committed 70% of its military to Ukraine invasion. So no, it is not ""a tenth""."
this is legit like the winter war
The earth needs aliens to invade that way we all join forces with a common goal instead of killing eachother for gains
"you forgot to show footage of the killing of civilians in the Donbas by the Ukrainian army and nationalist battalions for eight years. And a brief excerpt of the Western press during this time, in which only ""Russia is the aggressor""."
Liers
"l think China was eyeing this conflict to see if America got trapped, and what would happen to them economically. l don't think they are going to do anything now. the way Russia was pounded with sanctions, l think they will wait."

you tell weakneses of russia but somehow russia is not destroyed. So it is not that weak sadly
russians do not know about gps navigation if they use paper maps and road signs ? :D
"Russia's logistical poor performance in Ukraine invalidates the narrative that 'Russia wants to takeover Europe"". Russia is not the Soviet Union. They don't have the infrastructure, economy, and the manpower similar to the Soviet Union."

How is russian army smashing ukranian with preserving civilians a failiure ? 🤷🏻‍♂️
"Forgive me for understanding English as my second language and even my slight ignorance ignorance in the art of logistics. But to me, the climactic part of this video is explaining the two supply chain concepts of 'push vs pull system' (14:22) which I've honestly repeated that part of the clip more than ten times trying to understand it word for word. Because the sentences that came afterwards providing examples of those two concepts/systems is either missing another sentence here or I didn't get the context at all after it was shortened as ""western forces let strategy lead logistics, while Russian forces logistics lead strategy."" But how that translated to me is: 

• pull system = supplies to be manufactured, strategy first, logistics later: ask first, receive later.
• push system = supplies already manufactured, logistics first, strategy later: receive first, ask later;
 
That part to me contradicted the entire point of the title of this video because if you say that Russia prioritizes logistics first provided in your example in 15:30, by being the masters of providing resources to their troops especially in railway systems historically speaking. And by historically speaking, that of which also reminded me of the Soviet Russia's insistence on the continuous manufacturing of T-34s by sheer numbers instead of making a time-consuming innovation for new tank designs. Which ironically, Soviet Russia's behavior at supply and numbers actually opposed and secured victory against the Nazis during the Battle of Kursk (1943), the largest tank battle in history. That is my only impression at Russian logistics.

Don't get me wrong, I do think that Russia is terrible at logistics today, assuming they're cut off in resupplying from their homeland once they cross the Ukrainian border and unable to set up a supply depot within the time frame. And with every ammunition they fire complimenting Putin's arrogant tendencies for display of might that gradually and costly eats away his own military attrition. Even considering the lies that the Russian commanders spoon-feed at their troops in fighting a meaningless war from the point of view of the lowest rank is the seed of a decaying morale.



Either of those things, or I still need to go back to grammar school.

So my question is:

Assuming that Russia operates on a just-in-case push system (supplies are already here, you may ask anytime), *how is Russia's logistics LESS FLEXIBLE than western logistics?*

Anyway, I close my case with a quote: *""The line between disorder and order lies in logistics."" -Sun Tzu*"
"The hell my comment deleted because says a two side are terrible
Most say about freedom speech but you can't talk bad for both side

Praise Jesus,

first question is: why the hell is ukrainian Crimea greyed out in the thumbnail?
"We do both push and pull in a non-COIN environment. We estimate what our DOS is for a given supply item or class of supply and then push that, but then we also have turn-back for when we don’t need that item. It’s a blended system because perhaps the ground forces ate up more ammo than predicted or of a specific type for which they need resupplied. It’s a dynamic and very complex system of resupply to which makes for some really interesting mission analysis and mission execution."

Pathetic reporting . I can honestly say that your show is far from info. More like disinfographics

"You missed the rampant corruption within the Russian military. There is a video where Ukrainian soldier display captured rations that were seven year past their expiration date. Corner cut in production of equipment. Skipped maintenance. Unrealistic and inadequate training.  Reliance on unmotivated conscripts. These factors are part of the matrix of causalities for poor performance of the Russian Potemkin military forces.  

All of these factors above can also be applied to the Chinese military as well."
This video is biased as well. No objective sources.
"Please remember that when speaking of civilian casualties and dead, we are talking about the old, the sick, the immobilized, younger children including babies, females (all men are in battle + some woman). Those are the civilian casualties and dead, it's not men who can carry a rifle they are all gone to war, so targeting civilians is the murder of the innocent and the ones who pose no threat to a USSR invasion (I call russia USSR, because we are set back to that time in history now). Targeting civilians is so cowardly, so low on the ethical scale it's 0,01 from the bottom. I live in Denmark, a NATO country, I have severed in the Danish army for 1 Year and as a UN Peacekeeper for over 1 year. I do NOT believe that if NATO interfere with the war in Ukraine, it would result in a Nuclear strike from USSR or a 3. WW with USSR and China. It would send a strong message to the REAL leaders in Moscow, and Putin will have an ""accident"", USSR troops would withdraw from Ukraine, USSR will have a new president and government, and will once more become Russia. And the REAL leaders of Russia will divide Putin's €£$ and be even richer. I have no fear of Putin if NATO engage in this war, he will never even reach the phone to order a launch of a Nuclear strike. The REAL leaders allowed this war to happen, because of the opportunity to gain wealth, as soon as they see no profit in this war, Putin is gone. War is over capital and nothing more, you might gain some land which translate into capital. War for land (Lebensraum) ended in 1945, and have never been used to justify war since, religion and ethnicity is also a war starter, normally civil wars.
But in all wars it's always the civilians, who end up losing everything included their life."

"Very, very well-done video! Fantastic work!"
propaganda video
Corruption is a major reason why the Russian military has big problems.
"Of all the equipment sent to aid the USSR, the studebaker truck was probably the most useful and significant thing America produced for the red army. The fact that the Soviets glossed over this fact when the Cold War began probably did a lot of hamper the culture of good logistics in the russian military apparatus."
"Destruction of the all railways connection btween RU and UKR = lie, that did never happened."
"Nah, and more fakes even here. Don't be like CNN please, don't spread Ukrainian fakes and unchecked claims."
"Why is any body surprised, democratic countries have been saving russian ass since the Napoleonic wars."
"We should never take anything for granted, but it appears that Russia is much a one trick pony.   They have nuclear weapons and the S-400.  Which is plenty to be worried about,  but conventional weapons against the US and NATO is a non starter."
"Unfortunately this video is based on false information.  The Russian 'invasion' of Ukraine is Russia cleaning up the deep state's drug and human trafficking operations and freeing the people of Ukraine from their corrupt government.  The media reporting is 'fake news' just like everything else they report (Covid, vaccinations, etc).  Most of the footage and photographs are proven to be recycled from other events.  We're being fooled on a grand scale, people."

"Г-н Зеленский, бывший комик, становится гордым президентом. Путин, бывший президент, становится комиком."
"La guerra de Putin vista por un ciudadano de España.
	Primeras conclusiones:
•	En veinte días de guerra 1.735.168 personas han salido de Ucrania, 53.300 lo hicieron hacia Rusia, 405 fueron hacia Bielorrusia, colaborador esencial de Rusia en el conflicto, y 82.767 a Moldavia, país con manifiestas intenciones de entrar en la Unión europea. La inmensa mayoría marcharon hacia países ya miembros de esta organización internacional EU. Si Putin y su gobierno buscaba la escisión de Ucrania considerando que parte del pueblo ucranio estaría a su favor, actuando en una guerra rápida, de momento se equivocó.
La inmensa tendencia de refugiados a trasladarse hacia los países de la Unión Europea y no hacia Rusia o Bielorrusia, es un mal indicativo para la política a seguir y estrategia ya seguida por Putin. Precisamente, la apuesta de la Unión Europea, en los últimos años, a políticas favorecedoras de la protección y la cobertura social, en detrimento de políticas de potenciación armamentística, ante la falta de conflictos en su cercanía, hace que esta organización internacional se encuentre en situación favorable, aun con todos los esfuerzos que ello supondrá, a la acogida de todos los refugiados que huyen temiendo por sus vidas.
•	Desde el punto de vista ucraniano, cada una de los civiles muertos, cada niño, cada abuelo, los hermanos que ya no volverán, los padres muertos por defender una patria… Mal asunto. Un país destrozado impunemente, absurdamente, por la ambición imperialista, un país de gente que se está mostrando recia, decidida,  por tradición  e historia, resistente a estos desafortunados y dramáticos acontecimientos basados en  la sinrazón, mal asunto para Rusia.
•	La guerra va a suponer un importante empobrecimiento para el pueblo ruso.
•	Ya está siendo un factor favorable al fortalecimiento de la EU a nivel interno.
•	Un claro fortalecimiento de la OTAN.
•	Rusia ha demostrado ser un país peligroso por su fuerte avance armamentístico en manos de unos dirigentes beligerantes y  empecinados en conseguir objetivos aunque sean una locura humanitaria.
•	Una mayor desconfianza de Europa hacia la política seguida por China. Un país que juega un papel poco claro, fortaleciendo su economía con los muchos productos que los ciudadanos europeos les compramos pero siendo poco empáticos hacia este drama que tanto nos afecta, claramente por ver como obtendrá ventaja. Lo esperado.
•	Supone el fortalecimiento de EEUU en muchos sentidos. Ejemplo. Los países europeos de inmediato, ante esta amenaza activa que supone tener a Rusia cerca con esta actitud, se están re fortaleciendo a nivel militar defensivo. Alemania ya ha puesto en marcha la compra de aviones de combate norte americanos.
Aun con todo, cuidado. 
El gobierno ruso no ha entrado a darse una vuelta, sí o sí ha de conseguir objetivos. Es muy posible que Ucrania pierda otra parte de su territorio como moneda de cambio para poner fin a esta absurda guerra, lo que sería indecente. Lo decente sería que fuera Rusia, con sus fondos internacionales, los que reconstruyeran todo lo destrozado en Ucrania por esa decisión imperialista de sus gobernantes, pero eso no está tan claro.
Habrá muchas otras consecuencias que con el tiempo iremos viendo
Los miles de personas ucranianas muertas, los millones de refugiados seguro que no se olvidan.
Esta guerra a todos nos afecta. Algo quería opinar para quien lo quiera leer.  Saludos."

DEATH TO THE ENEMY!
It appears to be failing because that's what they want everyone to believe. All world leaders have orchestrated this war don't believe the truth
@17:13 really brought tears to my eyes...
"""I"" decided. Me, no one else."
Spoiler Alert: he doesn't know. Also the Russians fired a lot of noisy stuff.
It took Russia 20 years to reach its moderate economy.  Putin wasted it in 20 days of Ukrainian invasion.
"I think history is likely going to repeat itself.

Historically, this is how Russia 'lost' the Winter War-they purged their army before the conflict, and sent them off against a determined smaller foe they thought they could overrun by sheer numbers. It didn't work. They failed in mobilization, tactics, supplies and morale. Just like now. But just like Russia couldn't advance, Finland couldn't make them leave either, and eventually they ceded land in exchange for sovereignty. Russia 'won' the war simply be persisting until Finland gave them a favorable peace deal-but Finland survived, which is the best they could have hoped for.

Of course, the weakness of their forces was broadcasted to the world, which is what invited Germany to attack them in WW2. So you know, unintended consequences and all that.

Ukraine isn't going to run out of ammunition if we keep supplying them and Russias economy is getting dumpstered, so I think Ukraine will be able to secure a deal at some point. But they will almost certainly cede land unless Russia stages a mass retreat. Which I'm pretty sure Putin can't do without being thrown out of power."
"Russians are not Germans, they don't know how to blietzkrieg!"
"actually they have a lot of oil, the problem is the logistics."
They are also running out of fuel / oil like the Germans did
Let’s all be real if Russia wanted it would just destroy Ukraine in a weeks time but that would cause mass civilian deaths of course
@pod11 th wtf you talking about fool 😂😂😂
"those milions of refugees aren't running away from Russian humanitarian aid.Their food is bad, but not that bad."
"@pod11 th So to get it clear, not going on a mass rampage is a sign of weakness, that for example US will never show in a similar situation ?"
"Yea they are humilating themselves and showing weakness on purpose, and no civilians are killed with phosphorus bombs, cluster bombs and such.Totally."
Great! Especially the presentation of push and pull logistics opened my eyes.
Listen to John Mearsheimer is you really want to understand why President Putin has acted against Ukraine.
Would somebody please tell Putin that we don't behave like that these days. We've moved on.
"The operation goal was to denazify and demilitarize Ukraine. How many airfields and bases does Ukraine have left? Regardless, the goal is to dethrone the dollar as global currency, and thats working out beautifully. Just google how MBS declined to take a call from Biden and denied the UKs request for more oil. Al Saud is also considering switching from SWIFT to Chinas CIPS and trade in the yuan. In fact 103 countries and other regions used Chinas CIPS over Americas outdated SWIFT for trade."
"Russia is large, they are using old equipment that's hard to move, their maintenance concept is what ever Putin tells them to do.  He's the single point of failure."
This is what happens when a country is run by one person instead of institutions
Pointing out that Russia are just bullies that just need standing up to America and England and other allies need to stand up for small countries it’s a human right to not fear for your life
"The Russians haven't got time, the thaw has begun so they can't even disperse off the roads now and you knock out one vehicle at the front of one of their convoys and then one at the back then they are fucked, they can't go off road as they will get bogged down and they can't go forward or backwards so they either get blasted to pieces or they run back to see Mr Putin, he will be pleased to see them and welcome them home."

Thanks for making this as a logistician in one of the militaries mentioned it was enlightening to see the differances between Push vs Pull highlighted.

 PUTIN'S MULTIMOVE

 While the West is hysterical about the military operation in Ukraine, the Russian government is buying back stocks of Russian companies for cheap.  In response to Western sanctions, the Central Bank of Russia banned the withdrawal of dividends abroad, respectively, Russian stocks fell in price, as foreigners began to sell them en masse.  And here the Russians began to massively buy them for ""penny"".  Now the dividends of Russian companies will not go offshore, but will work within the country.

 Vladimir Putin forbade Russian companies to keep accounts in foreign banks and signed a decree on the return of 80% of foreign exchange earnings by exporters.  Oil and gas prices are rising.  This means that huge amounts of currency from Gazprom and Rosneft and other Russian oil and gas exporters will soon be thrown into the foreign exchange market, and the ruble will eventually strengthen.

 Since part of the assets of the Central Bank of Russia was arrested, then Russia has the right to no longer comply the American financial model.  I believe that Putin deliberately allowed some of the assets of the Russian Central Bank to be seized in order to get an excuse not to comply with the model created by the US Federal Reserve.  For those who don't know.  The entire world financial system is arranged in such a way that not a single Central Bank of the world has the right to print its own currency.  For example, you need 100 rubles for the economy, in order to issue them you need to import the currency (dollar) into the country.  How much currency was brought in, so many rubles can be printed at the rate.  Where to get dollars?  On the world market.  Need to sell something, for example oil or gas.  We give oil, gas, us a dollar (a piece of paper that is not backed by anything), at the exchange rate against the dollar, we have the right to print rubles.  The US Federal Reserve back then offered this model to Stalin.  He refused.  Therefore, they did not open the western front for so long in the Second World War, hoping for the loss of the USSR, as their main opponent in economic terms.

 Russia was embed into this model in the 90s, after the collapse of the USSR.  Only the United States has the right to print dollars as much as they need, and all other world currencies are tied to the dollar.  Those who have been against, were bombed, for example Yugoslavia, Libya, Iraq and the list goes on.  And now, when part of the Russian assets of the Central Bank has been arrested, the Central Bank of Russia will no longer print the ruble against the incoming foreign currency.  This means that the ruble is finally becoming a truly national sovereign currency.  And the Central Bank of Russia will be able to issue as many rubles as Russia needs for development.  In this global financial system, the Central Bank of Russia did NOT have the right to finance projects of the Russian government!  And now they do whatever they want.

 For example, Russia may announce that it will sell oil, gas, etc.  only for rubles.  This means that the West will need to buy rubles and only then buy gas with them, which will strengthen ruble as well, as billions of currency will be thrown into the market.  And since they are disconnecting Russia from SWIFT (the American interbank payment system), Russians and Chinese are launching their own interbank payment system and the West will have to connect to their system to pay for gas and oil.  That is why USA did not completely disconnect Russia from SWIFT, as they find themselves in such a situation, either to carry billions in cash for gas, or to connect to Russian system.  But this trump card (the sale of oil and gas only for rubles) Putin has not used yet.  Apparently it's not the time.  (Although China and the Arabs, for example, are already discussing trading oil for yuan)
 A sharp increase in the key rate to 20% is also the right decision at this stage.  It is temporary, it was already in 2014, when the key rate rose sharply to 17%.  This is done in order to cut off large players from the foreign exchange market, since at a low rate they take cheap loans and buy foreign currency, weakening the ruble.  Plus, with large interest on deposits, they attract people's money to banks.  When there is panic, everyone runs to withdraw money from bank accounts.  The Central Bank raises the key rate, banks raise interest rates on deposits, everyone runs back to banks to deposit money at a high interest rate.  This is a temporary measure to bring down the panic outflow of finance from banks.  A high key rate does not mean that now everyone will receive loans at a high rate, for example, IT specialists began to receive loans at 3%, all system industries will be subsidized by the state and receive cheap loans, just as agriculture receives loans at 5%.  And when the panic subsides, then the key rate will decrease.  It has already happened in the history of Russia, and now it will be the same.

 To summarize, Putin blocks the withdrawal of capital to offshores and breaks the financial world system that was created by the US Federal Reserve, so they will put serious pressure on Russia, but the Russians are used to it after the dashing nineties, 2014th crisis, WW 2, Cold War etc.  It should be noted that for now no one has been able to defeat the US Federal Reserve, all who challenged it have been destroyed.  For example, Saddam Hussein wanted to get out of this financial system and urged the entire Muslim world to do so.  Saddam Hussein was hanged, and Iraq was bombed with rockets, killing about a million people.  The medieval execution by hanging of Hussein was broadcasted on all world TV channels in 2006.  Why do you think this was shown to the whole world?  This is a demonstrative execution so that all countries can see what will happen to those who want to leave the American financial system.

 The US Federal Reserve System (in other words, the US Central Bank) is a private organization owned by 20 private US banks.  This is their main business - to print the world's money.  To achieve this, the current owners of the FRC have spent a lot of time - decades, to be exact - centuries, and efforts - the 1st and 2nd World Wars and the Bretton Woods agreements, etc.  and, of course, the very creation of the FRC in 1907.  The Federal Reserve System is a very smart, gigantic in volume and scale financial pyramid scheme.

 One thing must be understood here - humanity is dealing with a brilliant, incredibly strong and ruthless group of people who have built the structure of the world in which we live.  Their conceptual apparatus does not take into account such concepts as ""humanism"", ""kindness"", ""compassion"", etc.  The main thing is numbers, the main thing is profit, the main thing is the arithmetic of transactions.  In a situation where it is necessary to destroy people, but make a big profit, there is no particular doubt for them what to do.  They, in their own interests, can raze cities to the ground along with civilians.  For them, the only truly meaningful result can only be profit.

 And now Russia has challenged them.  And the whole world is waiting for how it will end.  If Russia wins, the American financial system will lose half of the planet, China, India, most of the Arab world, Africa, Latin America will also get out of the influence of the US Federal Reserve.  But, for now, there is a deadly fight.  Russia must win, otherwise it will be destroyed.
 Judging by the decisions being made at the highest level, everything in Russia has been calculated now.  So the Russians shouldn't panic.  Yes, it will be difficult for 1-3 years, yes, there is still a lot of chaos, prices will rise, some factories will stop, but soon such a powerful development of Russia will begin, which the world has not seen yet!  But before building cities, for example, in Siberia, it is necessary to solve the security issues of Russia near their borders for decades, remove the main military threats, move the NATO military infrastructure away from Russian borders, and this is what the Russian Army is doing now in Ukraine. If you aren't from USA, you should probably praise for Russia, as it is changing the entire world."

"It needs to be noted that this wasn't merely a miscalculation by Russia. Every major country in the world also thought that Ukraine would fall within 3 days. Compare this to Russia's invasion of Georgia and the U.S.'s invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq, and it demonstrates that modern warfare will rarely ever go according to plan. There are so many variables and conditions that can't truly be known until you set foot and machine onto the battlefield. Hopefully major powers will learn from these repeated mistakes and understand that war is far too risky, even against seemingly inferior opponents, and opt for more ""peaceful"" methods of coercion in the international arena."

@GM Where did you get these numbers from?
"And to add some clarifying points on my stats:

The Ukraine government has itself acknowledged 20% loss in territory - this can be found through a 2 minute google search and on most major news sources.

The formal army has 250k, the territorial defense force is 150k and the national guard has 100k (500k total). Ukraine further has 900k reserves and has called 3 rounds to mobilization including woman most recently. The 500k is a low estimate.

There are documents about military modernization released by the Ukrainian government and think tanks about the quantity of military equipment inherited from the USSR (40%). This can also be found through a 2 minute google search."

They colonized almost the whole world, committed thousands of genocides, bombed hundreds of sovereign countries, overthrew legitimate governments and replaced them with obedient regimes, exterminated the natives of America and Australia, and took half of Africa into slavery. And what are they doing now? They are arming Ukraine and its fascist government to fight to the last Ukrainian. Ukraine and Russia are fraternal countries, this madness must stop. Ukraine must not allow NATO to set up bases on its territory and endanger the fraternal Russian people. Turn your back on the West, turn your back on Russia, but be your own, neutral, do not let the West use you to destroy the Slavic peoples. The USA stole Kosovo and Metohija from my country, a holy country where my people have lived for 15 centuries. They dropped uranium and plutonium bombs on us, cluster bombs on the civilian population, destroyed our bridges and factories, painted their bombs red on Orthodox Easter and congratulated us on the holiday. It is the West that is not saving you, brothers Ukrainians."
this is why i go to church
"A former super power gets pissed off and invades Ukraine and nobody saw it coming...
All the might of the CIA, FBI, NATO, FIVE EYES, MI6, MI5, NSA etc didn't see a thing.
Absolute bullcrap. Biden is senile and everyone is shocked.
We (innocent people) are in trouble, these people are either corrupt or incompetent.
I think they are corrupt.
China is waiting fo Australia to elect a weak leader and that will be the last domino to fall.

I just UNSUBSCRIBED. Because I don't want to see NEO-NAZI propaganda in my feed.
of years ago and it remains true now
There seems something to be missing in your comment
I was a 88H in the US Army .. cargo specialist... And we moved the Army across the world. My team was attached to units as needed .. keep them armed and feed . Russia is a mess if they can't support their soldiers with food and ammunition and fuel they should be ashamed of themselves... They are weak.
War my ass! Let's put a alliance of non globalist on Mexico and Canadian border! And let's them be TEROUST and criminals! 👁🤪🤪👈🇺🇸👈🇺🇸👈🇺🇸❤️🧸❤️🧸❤️🧸💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💉💰💰💰💰💰💰💰😈😈
Russia clearly failed
You do know the US government put a puppet government into ukraine in 2014 right?
@bowen voowy Palestine gets way more coverage over the decades than other regions - just take the Kongo for example
"starved by the saudi and the west, the Palestinians have been tortured for 70 and yet not a word from our ""concerned"" media."
Don't put Chinese tires on military vehicles if your going to war
Watched till minute 1:06 and stopped. Lies will be exposed soon.
Where is the video on US failure in Afghanistan.
Where is the video on Soviet failure in Afghanistan.
ok
Not the first time Russia has sent their troops to die in battle for ulterior motives. All this benefits Isn't real and China while putting the nail in the coffin of the petrodollar and NATO. Conquering Ukraine was not the objective.
"Mentioning this war and not mentioning why putin attacked, is low grade production.  Nazi's and American bio weapons."
"what we can see after 21 days the russian army is one big shit without organization, command and recourses. it is based on artillery which hits everything without exception and when everything is destroyed burnt and ploughed then a big russian army enters the city which according to many sources is crying to return to the country because most of them are young guys who are not (are on paper) ¨professional¨ soldiers"
Go Russia 🇷🇺
Let’s be honest them US UK and Ukrainian are Fuckin them up that’s why!!!
@Epic Troy I'm pretty sure a bunch of people on reddit going to Ukraine for upvotes aren't gonna do much to the supply lines of a major military. Also you're either under 10 or are the sort of person that looks at one source and pretends to be an expert on the subject.
@Penguiniman  alot of USA guy’s and U.K guys who was in war are in Ukraine 🇺🇦 do some research before you speak lol
The US and UK aren't even in Ukraine. lmao
"I would point out that western armies use both push and pull logistics depending on the item, things like food/water will be sent out on a consistent basis even if not asked for, just toss out what you don't use. Things like fuel, ammunition, and replacement equipment, is done on a pull system.
Both systems have problems, push systems cause a lot of waste because its set up to accommodate maximum usage, while pull systems suffer from delays.

Also the Russians use of unencrypted analogue radios is common in all armies, they still use encrypted primary coms, but short range personal radios are pretty universal. Its just that the Russians probably don't have the training to know what NOT to say on a plain net vs secure net. Encrypted nets are usually restricted in their use while a plain net can have quick and nonstandard conversations."
This video is full of shit. Speculation.
Nice video and analysis
"Disinformation? I'm not going there, I'm stating the obvious, that the west has invaded, killed and stolen from so many countries, and yet here they are chastising Russia, hypocricy and double standards is clearly shown here, remember Trump what he said about stealing Syrian oil, he admitted they are stealing, Yemen is being bombarded and starved by the saudi and the west, the Palestinians have been tortured for 70 and yet not a word from our ""concerned"" media."
"But hey, let's not talk about the criminals that have attacked all the countries after WW2 and killed over 11 million people today, and those criminals? the west, I ain't taking sides but let's call a spade a spade."
"Dude, it's just your beginning that gives me the need to take a shit. Your first 30 seconds contradict all reports and all news from that time... CNN, BBC, SKY NEWS all reported about the beginning of the conflict and they all contradict your statement. Yea big bad Russians, poor Ukrainians, none of you care about people that die, no one of you cares what is in other parts of the world if there is no Russia or North Korea or china involved in the conflict.. that's a shame. Maybe start with: This is the tragedy for civilians on all sides we hope that peace will take place asap. And not only in Ukraine but in all parts of the world."

Fake news won't make it better.
"this video is full of inaccuracies and the spread of propaganda, cannot blame you since you are an Anglo-Saxon. But have this in mind: NATO and a huge amount of extra countries took more than 40 days to reach Baghdad through a desert. This war is about to end (today has 19 days on), and the main push wasn't to Kiev but spread to the Dombas and the south, which both are soon to fall completely. If you see a map you could see the prawns of the attack clearly. The operations also slowed because of diplomatic talks happening. Time cuts both ways, while Zelensky is trying to buy time to get more weapons from the West, the Russians are settling their logistics. We will know the truth when the war ends."
More propaganda
It failed because they are a 3rd world nation with nukes.  Russia sucks at war.   USA....Texas
Russian military is a total joke yes they have nukes which they will never use but there ground troops and air planes a complete joke
This looks  a bit like an oversimplified NATO-ordered propaganda video!
"Is it just me, or does the narrorator from Wendover productions sound the same as the one in half as interesting"

@Dustin Jones I would like to see how America would handled under an invasion poor calculated as the Ukraine-Russo one since most American citizens are armed even before war starts and the diverse landscape / geography

"Instead of fuel, Russians ordered more coffins, less rations and more toilet paper, because the West will support any victim of Soviet Aggressor."
"Russia failed because NATO helped Ukraine to close the airspace and exerted their air superiority. Meanwhile, US escalated the war and warned Putin that Moscow will be nuked if the Russian soldiers will not retreat. Putin, feeling guilty, surrendered himself to UN peace keeping troops, apologized, and promised to pay Ukraine rehabilitation."

"in 13 days Russia took  1/3 of Ukraine Territory(country fully supplied by West getting  Ready for the War ), And it took 39 days to take just one city of Bagdad by US army killing thousands civilians and  American troops as well - what a great army . And remember that Iraq was under sanctions for years. D Trump would never let this conflict to happen but Joe  Biden was dreaming about it- he kept talking insted of acting.          D Trump is the only American president that did not start a war.  He should be nominated for noble Nobel Peace Prize not this  Obama"
This is aging like milk lol
The russia military is smart. They calculated each move and are assured of winning. They stall and attack as needed. They dont sinoly bulldozed like the usa in afghanistan.

"Amazing how detailed the video is, considering how quickly it was released."
I see what you mean about Russian Trolls and some trying to defend Russia. it doesn't matter to me a jot about what claims any country has toward another. shelling civilians is Just plain wrong. I dont care much about what atrocities you claim was made against you. looting. vandalising and killing those who never did you any harm is just plain wrong. it doesn't matter a jot to me about who hit who first. sending missiles into Hospitals and baby care units is just plain wrong. it cant be defended under any circumstances and I will uphold a defence of anyone who wants to speak out and say its just plain wrong. Putin is just plain wrong. and in time he will be proved as such. I fear for the Russian people who are not for his policies who want to speak out. you are all heroes for speaking against the mainstream. I would gladly offer a home to anyone from Ukraine or Russia who stand for freedom to speak their minds. for standing up for true Christian Values. War is just plain wrong. and I will pray that Russia will stop and realise its just plain wrong
Russia has succeeded in upgrading from a 2nd to a 3rd world country in a single military operation. Congrats! 👏👏👏

"I am a 67 year old retired U.S. Army Master Sergeant (E8/1972-1993) senior logistician, former defense contractor (2005-2010), and awarded the General Brehon B. Somervell Medal of Excellence (Medal Number 17). My compliments on a good overall analysis of Russian military logistics shortfalls! We have always known in the U.S. military that their logistics capabilities were inferior to ours, but never did we suspect that they were as bad as we are seeing in the current Ukraine conflict. To say their military logistics is dysfunctional is a major understatement. To sum it up, their vehicles and forward deployed aircraft cannot rely on a consistent fuel supply, their troops go hungry, repair parts are lacking, and needed battlefield maintenance is not being done. I also suspect that ammunition is starting to get scarce as well, especially in major items such as rockets. As a result of this unit morale must really be sinking by now and battlefield performance must be seriously impacted with many units no longer able to fight effectively."
They failed because they're Russian

"ROFLMAO ... pure BULLSHIT .... Russia has had NO TROUBLES at all in reaching their goals, there has been NO LOGISTICS FAILURE, those columns were in state of readiness awaiting orders on how to proceed for encircling the Cities or entering and taking the cities, at least get 1 fact right your full of western propaganda. Everywhere the regular Ukraine army has either fled, surrendered or gone home and refused to fight for the NEO-NAZI leadership and are in FACT WELCOMING RUSSIAN FORCES the only troops fighting the Russian Liberation Force is the NEO-NAZI formations that have riddled the Ukraine nation as they know there will be no capture for them only death. Russian forces have encircled more and more town and cities but their patience is running thin if Ukraine do not soon surrender then expect the Russian forces to commit the 3 full combat ready armies waiting at the border, don't forget Russia has only committed a very small force of under 200,000 troops and are winning easily, but when the order comes you will have the full force of those 3 full armies rolling forward and then you will see another 600,000+ troops on the move, and that is not counting the other 11 armies spread around Russia as well as another 2 million reservist troops on call."

@Jay Plate Face Videos May I get a reason why the proxy war in Ukraine started and reasons on how it's USA fault instead of you comparing things about Ukraine and USA to conflicts / invasions in the Middle East and you saying that there's profit in war because you have one or two sentences on Ukraine and the rest about Biden and the Middle east and that is not a solid argument nor really an argument I can debunk
@Jay Plate Face Videos Give me reasons on how it's a proxy war in Ukraine then I will give you my reasons on why it's not a proxy war because all you have said was that USA  would see every Ukrainian died if that meant Russia would fall and stuff about Afghanistan and then Vietnam

"It all happened so quickly, on March 6th 2022  Wendover sent you down a memory hole. Many Ukrainians would explain that the 2014 Euromaidan coup was funded by the U.S State Department using Ukrainian Nazis as useful idiots. The ethnic Russian east, Donetsk & Luhansk voted for independance, that wasn't supported by the international community. The 2014 Minsk Agreements between Ukraine, Russia, and the European OSCE lead by France & Germany lead to an uneasy & often broken peace. Now beyond any wishful Wendover thinking about logistics if true that suits D.C as it's looking to use Ukrainians as proxies in a long drawn out slaughter against Russia."

Great presentation. I'd suggest a pop-screen for your microphone however.
"The bottom line of why Russian troops are losing is because:

Putin: Amass hundred thousands of troops near the Ukraine border
Military High Command: Why sir?
Putin: We will scare them from joining NATO, but we will not actually invade. But make it appear that we could.
Military High Command: Clever decision sir. As you wish.

(Military High Command to their officers: Gather our tanks, the more the better, the scarier. Pour in hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Conscripts will do, this is just a show. Maybe a picnic.)
....
Putin: We already recognized the independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, let's protect our Russian people there, go in there assist the separatists.
Military High Command: Fair enough. Ok sir.
....
Putin: Ukraine is attacking their own people, let's go in. We are peacekeepers. Prepare to go in.
Military High Command: Ok.
....
Putin: Our peacekeeper role is not enough. We must conduct special military operations.
Military High Command: K (damn, why didn't you say before?)
Putin: Excuse me?
Military High Command: On the way, sir.

Of course that was just my wild imagination and simplistic illustration, that Putin may not be that upfront and candid with his own military establishment regarding his ultimate agenda for fear that he could be met with caution and possibly contrary advice. So he lured them into the conflict step-by-step without knowing what Putin's final goal really was, thereby also without a thorough invasion plans prepared.

The results: Poor logistics, lack of ground-air coordination, soldiers not knowing why they were there, no plan B, investing in the visual shock value instead of real combat value, etc.
In short Putin's ultimate plan was full invasion while his military was still thinking bluffing or PR stunt, until it's too late to step back.

Anyways, had Putin been more straightforward with his military early on, there would be only two possible outcomes.
A. The military - who knows better - would give him objective assessment of the whole situation from military perspective and invasion would have not occur; or
B. The military - who fears Putin - may be forced to proceed with invasion but would have time to come up with a more thoroughly prepared invasion plan even before the troops were amassed near the border.

Therefore - my wild imagination - the bottom line of why Russian troops are losing is because of a disconnect in Putin's ultimate agenda and Russian military preparedness."
Keep your fake news to yourself! RUSSIA #1 🇷🇺
blinded by propaganda
8:02 I love that Woofers made the video!
"I by no means support Russia's war against or any war for that matter but this video seems to hint that the U.S is some how better, like there war in Afghanistan went well or the illegal war against Iraq n crime against humanity were 700,000-1 million people were killed . The west shouldn't be trying to turn the Ukrainian war into like the soviet vs Afghanistan war but in Ukraine,  instead of flooding Ukraine with weapons which is going to create more death and destruction n prolong the war ,they should be putting all there efforts in to ceasefires n peace talks. My thoughts and prayers are with all those who are effected by this war 🙏 ✌️🇺🇦🤝🇷🇺🤞"
Incredible that Romans managed to master logistics in there time from Rome to the near east to Hadrian’s wall……… until they didn’t.

How is Russia not being held accountable for going against a worldwide peace treaty to not threaten or invade the Ukraine when having nuclear weapons turned over. That alone should’ve sparked NATO and the UN to stop Russia.
"Because treaties aren't worth the paper they are printed on if no one is willing to enforce them. One could say ongoing embargoes, sanctions, logistics, and intelligence support is how we're helping. But the treaty never 'promised' any military assistance.

You have to understand, my government had no guts for a war with Russia-either real or economic. They began the war mired in indecision. Didn't put in sanctions til Russias had already invaded. Tried to evacuate the leader of Ukraine a few days after the war started in an attempt to speed their surrender. Couldn't push Germany to shut down Nord Stream 2 til a week into the war (the damn thing was still being certified while Ukranian civilians were dying to artillery strikes). Didn't ban oil and gas imports until two weeks into the invasion. Ukraine simply held on long enough against odds everyone put against then, enough time that Biden was forced to clean the shit out of his pants and actually make a command decision. 

It was incredibly brave of them. They defied the world-US and Russia."
Their deal with Fedex & UPS failed.
bruh🤣
"A bear is still a bear no matter how incompetent it's acting at the moment, weather this is true incompetence or staged it's still a very dangerous bear."

Western media are rubbish at this stage as they are playing the propaganda drums of the Western leaders in perfect Goebbels-style and trampling the principles of what journalism is all about. Shortly they will tell that Russians are boiling Ukrainian children being bloodthirsty cannibals and lacking food supply as being ridicolously militarly disorganized.

A much better option is to rely on genuinely neutral observers or await for respected and fair historians to let us know how and why all the war events unfolded."
"People who take this propaganda seriously are going to be so angry when Russia wins.

Well explained and documented.
"“But, uh, it’s the WEST who are fascist! Ukraine wants to be liberated by Russia! Russian tanks and planes are invincible! I’ve heard that elements of the VDV in Odessa are already swimming in the Black Sea!”

Way to go, Russia! The biggest threat isn’t that drug-addled Nazi Jew(?) in Ukraine - it’s little old ladies with signs in St. Petersburg, people in Moscow holding BLANK signs, and that reporter who held a “no war” sign on sacred TV. Give her 15 years! How does it feel to hand back all of the freedoms your people fought so hard for in 1990? How’s that economy for which you sold your souls to Putin going? Hooah, right guys? Let’s live like it’s the USSR in the 1980’s!"
"@Akira Situmorang - Ah, I think this is a language or context issue. My comment is meant to parody the many absurd comments by those seeking to justify awful choices either by exaggerating threats, making things up, or making some false equivalence with the bad choices made by America in the 2000’s. Before any of this, I had people calling me an idiot for even THINKING that Russia would invade and that America was warmongering. Well, then Putin did invade and instead of coming back to say, “wow - I was wrong and this is an awful decision,” I was then met with claims that though this was the fault of the US, Russia would be in Kiev in days. That also didn’t happen and these voices have now been reduced to parroting BS claims of Nazi’s in the Ukrainian government, that Ukraine was the real threat all along pushed by the West, etc etc.

So my comment is like a fictional Russian propagandist crying out that “everything is going to plan” while Ukraine fights the good fight for freedom and are winning!"
"Russian logistics failed? Is this how you make your money? LOL How can logistics fail when Russia owns the land sea and sky?, How can logistics fail when almost half a dozen major Ukrainian cities are completely cut off and surrounded? Sounds to me like logistics worked perfectly fine... Not even mentioning the cluster of major ukrainian force trapped and surrounded between Dnipro and Donetsk... Russia clearly had a plan going into this, most people did not understand their plan. Most people thought that they would carpet bomb babies in their sleep like the US and NATO,"
"@CMDR Garbage He messed up and forgot to add months and years...gotta think ahead. Don't project victory in exact terms, gotta keep it vague and indecisive. Basic propaganda. Did this guy graduate from the Troll Farm or was he kicked out?"
@Akira Situmorang What tanks are those? And if they have no fuel then who are all those soldiers surrounding the cities?? Are they surrounding the cities on foot or horse back? Do not believe all the things they bring onto your television...
Eric if logistics are fine why are there tanks that have no fuel in it?
@Shamrock well it worked in Vietnam tho
"Way too early to make any judgement on this. You have no idea about the actual state of the war, it’s so propagandized it’s insane. But yeah whatever I’m a Russian bot lmfao pathetic."

"@CMDR Garbage If Russia has to rely on death threats to encourage trade between your country...maybe you should find a more stable supply...just saying.

Btw Ukraine has a LOT of oil and natural gas. Once Russia collapses into a burning garbage heap, maybe you guys can buy from them instead. Might help with the whole reconstruction thing."

"@Август Августовский Well i'm Dutch so riding a bicycle isn't much of a threat and i'm sure that you can't convince an Italian or Spaniard they'll freeze to death in their homes. There are a million other markets that Russia can be replaced with, maybe not as cheap as Russian slave labour but the west can afford it unlike Russia. Also tf are you saying there will be an economic recession, you can't even read mate. ""IMF expects major recession in Russia but not world wide"" and ""No economic recession if Russia collapses"" is what they're saying."

Look at Putin’s face, he’s a petty fkn child, he’s aged more in a matter of 27 days, he’s gained so much weight, his own country hates him, his troops don’t respect him enough to support his bullshit wars, his future is quite bleak, he also just become the worlds most wanted war criminal… Russia as a country is suffering because of him, it’s declining and Putin has set back his country 150 years economy wise. 
People are already struggling to maintain a normal life because of the price increase and supermarkets are running out of stock… Russia in the next 50 years will end up like North Korea if they take Ukraine."
_Well done_
"Anyone looking at the Russian military objectively would not be surprised at this outcome. Russia has a military budget that is only 8 percent of that of the US, and corruption has eaten up massive amounts of that relatively petty sum."
"When the Russians invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, they had to divert so many civilian vehicles to support the invasion that they failed to bring in the potato crop. Russia has always been a logistical pigmy."

yeah they better learn their lessons because right now their economy is pretty horrible
"Have been here with this channel for a while, never thought id see an analytic video about a war in my homeland. Very useful information to understand the whole picture. Its 20th day of war, and i hope you can reveal more of the weak points of russian orcs. Our weak point is the geography isnt it?"
Putin is not so smart as you may be think
What about taking USA forces out of Afghanistan in summer? If you need some marker to use for bad logistic - use it.
....he already did what's your point
yes yes propoganda only. so why if we (russians) have logistic collapse but still take ukraine nazi territory ah? How can we advance if we have supply problems? This disinformation for id i ots/
"@Владимир you do know that the Ukrainian forces pushed Russian forces back in the central front and staled the northern front again. Your cultures history is full of bloody last strands in cities and the importance of supplies and terrine in war, yet your nations army seems to have forgotten that. You are not fighting a third rate army made up of un trained troops, your fighting a army that has seen 8 years of war. these are not Germans or Americans you fight, its fellow slavs. their blood runs with the same proud history of defiance as yours. so i will ask you if russia was under siege from a military power greater then its own, and moscow or st petersburg was under siege would you stop fighting even if the city was ruble up to your ears? or would you fight to the end?"
"@Terry Newsome yes. Agree with you. So how russian troops go forward?? And do not forget that Russian troops are not storming major cities yet, they are allowing civilians to get out to the maximum. These cities are surrounded."
"what is Ukraine's nazi territory, have you drunk a lot of vodkas lately?"
"Asking for directions... Seriously? Have you know that russia has GLONASS? Don't you based your logic on Ukrainian propaganda? And isn't it is too early to make any conclusions about what is going on? Things are going, tanks are near Kyiv. I don't think there are any smart people in russia or ukraine governments or army control, but you definitely just painting them like morons. Underestimation is what has failed diplomacy."
"Putin and Russia really thought they would be welcomed, because that’s what they have been telling themselves"
It was actually 4:30-5:00AM
"""Or the fact they could seize back occupied territories""
So... you mean take back what you unlawfully took from them?"
"I've said this a hundred times already, but I'm 99.99% sure the reason the US pulled out of Afghanistan, and so hastily, was due to intelligence on Russia's activities. Holding Afghanistan just isn't worth it if WW3 breaks out with Russia."

"You know what's funny, Russia officially did not even start a war, they joined the already ongoing war between the Ukraine and the now officially recognized republics of Donbas and Lugansk."
"I live in Russia. Dude, our army is a mess. It's a mess, that's looks so badass, but it really struggles with any task! Corruption is a big factor and the fact that young people (18-27 years) can be drafted from their life for one year is not doing any good for army. Leaders can't pull out theirs heads from ass and just see that army is not god damn happy about everything. And they just keep throwing money at this enormous machine that is  at least 40 years behind it's time. 
Damn, good luck to any Ukrainians, hope one day we can shake hands and forget this nightmare. Нет войне"

"Next Regime shall be started through a plebiscite. The plebiscite which never took place in 1917 or 1918.

Which was agreed by the last 100% legal government of Russia. In this plebiscite all Russians are asked to decide if Russia shall have a Tsar as head of constitutional monarchy or become a Republic. 

Lenin made a coup in 1917 against the last legally installed government of Russia. All following governments are based on this illegal action made by bolchevic criminals supported by the Imperial German Secret Service. Russia can clean up this mess by making finally the plebiscite to which the last legal Tsar (in waiting of his coronation) Michael (younger brother of Nicolas II who abdicated in his favor) had agreed with his signature in 1917. The provisional government led by Kerenski had to enable all Russians entitled to vote to give their voice for this plebiscite. This is indeed the last legal constitutional authentic document to consider when the time is come to bring Russia back to the right path. Sure that the Russian Church will approve the choice. Republic or Constitutional Monarchy. And the Monarchists shall present their candidate(s). I suggest that only candidates who are not descendants of the German Kaiser Wilhelm II shall be eligible for this special candidacy. (Only for this first time most essential election). Why? Because this plebiscite shall connect the past-present and future by starting the legitimacy in 1917. It shall not be considered acceptable to the Russian people that a descendant of Wilhelm II who let his country declare a war on Russia can be a candidate to become the elected first Tsar of Russia after Michael. This is just a matter of decency. (Later this ban can be lifted because of human rights for everybody). Wilhelm who declared a war against Russia, who let hundred thousands of Russian being gassed in the front lines, who let his secret service transport the bacteria Lenin and his gangsters to Petrograd from Switzerland, Wilhelm, who let his diplomats deal with Bolchevic Low lives at the Brest Litovsk Conference table and sign a deal with them, Wilhelm who was not imposing in the Brest Litovsk Peace Deal that the family of the last acting Tsar Nikolas had to be exiled (by force if necessary)  to Germany or another safe location of the Romanov's choice outside of Bolchevic controlled territory. Wilhelm who is the ancestor now of some persons pretending to be first in line for the throne of Tsar in Russia. Once the Russian people have elected their legitimate Tsar based on the last legal binding document signed by Michael about the plebiscite, the Russian Church will bless this genuine Head of State and his family. And a new era of peace and prosperity for all Russians will become reality. This is the way.Amen."
"""Russia's military communications are mostly analog radio: locals listen in and troll them."" 

One of the factors behind Russia's disastrous defeat at the Battle of Tannenberg was that its radio communications, broadcast unencrypted in the clear, were easily intercepted, so that the enemy knew exactly what Russian dispositions were and what moves they planned to make.

This was in 1914.

It would seem that Russians are very, very slow learners."
"DEATH TO RUSSIA!
DEATH TO PUTIN!"
@Fozart - there are people who said those words...
Anyone with any military knowledge knows that Putin could have taken out all of Ukraine before breakfast day one. This propaganda doesn't mention the fact that the terrorists Putin attacked are the NAZI AZOV BATTALION. They even carry swastika flags and emblems.
"And why are there Nazis on Ukraine? It's because Russia invaded them, try to think for once"
So this Battalion with not more than 3000 members is spread in the entire Ukraine?
Russia a country led mediocre people and as a whole does nothing really good
"It's a poor video.

It turns out the strategy was to focus on armies in the East, which have been comprehensively encircled and are being worn down."

But here we are with sleepy joe talking about Putin invading Russia, how he gonna take him behind the gym, how US is producing more oil than ever, but it is Putin's fault our gas prices are high. If you buy this you are high yourself"
see that one farmer decided to take a souvenier and backs the tractor up and steals the tank rofl 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 waht a troll 🤣
"How can Putin do the same mistakes with Ukraine now that Stalin did back in 1939 against Finland in Winter War?  So many same factors: False flag at the beginning, underestimating enemy on its own soil/ground, building up huge convoys that are vulnerable when fuel runs out or when  there is a stoppage ahead. Time is on essence. More hours Russian troops spend in middle of nowhere in Ukrainian countryside, the more it will affect on their moral and capapitaly of keep fighting.
 Slava Ukraini!"
"To anyone who's rooting and praying for the Ukrainians, please listen to a motto that I've been abiding by to keep myself sane during recessions such as both the 2008 financial crisis and the more recent covid-19 pandemic (and why I'm reluctant to invest in stocks during the boom years):

""I'm of the belief that pessimism breeds despair. However, I'm also of the belief that optimism breeds complacency.""

All I ask of you is to not be too hopeful for the Ukrainians as to become complacent (especially if you're the ones supplying them).

Sure, as of the time that this message was posted, on March 15, 2022, the Russians have both overestimated the competence and determination of their own troops and underestimated that of the Ukrainians, and have suffered heavier casualties than the Ukrainians, but remember that, despite all the news that you might hear about all these small Ukrainian victories, the sad truth is that Russia, for all its setbacks, are still managing to take territory from Ukraine, and is still managing to grind down the Ukrainians, while the Russians still have plenty of reserves to draw upon if needed. (In fact, I've heard that the Germans, during the closing months of World War 2, had been focusing their propaganda efforts on showing off all these minor victories that they were able to inflict upon the allies in an effort to keep morale and war support high.)"

CCP/China supported Russia until there was a huge backlash with Chinese in Ukraine cheering for Russia. Now CCP is pretending they've been neutral all along.

As a former member of the Australian Army and having a great interest in Military history I have to say very well done!
Excellent video! Donated to the first help Ukraine ad that popped up. Now we all know why on -NOVEMBER 1st 2022- the people that were paying attention knew 100% this invasion of a free state was going to happen. Many NATO militaries probably had it figured out well before. Also lines up to exactly when smart money started to quietly unload Russian equities and debt aka adios amigo your entire country is now a penny stock.
And we learned that it will happen as soon as your instructors appeared in the city of Ochakov in 2009
"The Russian military are seen as shit-class citizens, they are bullied by the mob, sometimes forced into sex slavery. They have the social status of dirt, enforced by the state, their high officers being ""State security"" (mobsters appointed by the oligarchs and Putin). If anyone is too talented in the army, they are ousted or killed. Putin is paranoid of a military that is competent and thinks for itself, this makes them utterly incapable of fighting a real war."
Heads are rolling in the motherland
I don’t think they failed
Russia is a paper bear.
"Funniest joke is when people compare Russian military to the US, when they can barely fight a country a fraction of their size and population. They’re just trying to bully Ukraine but are getting kind of ass pounded given the difference in numbers, kind of sad really. They would just be completely decimated by the US military from what we’ve seen so far of them trying to fight just Ukraine lmao. For a nation that has historically and currently proclaimed itself and boasted as a superpower it has never really done anything by itself militarily of any noteworthy level. Even in WW2 sure they eventually pushed back Germany but only after they were slaughtered in the millions and pushed back into the heart of their country and ONLY because of the US sending supplies and eating up Germanys resources in the west. Then in the Middle East they got decimated as well lmao."

Ukrainians Too Legit to Quit
When shock and awe turns out to be startle and meh.
"Nope.
The Russians had no intention of entering Kiev up to this point.
This has been made perfectly clear by the Russian MOD as well as Putin.
And is obvious is one just considers the number of Russian forces committed in this area.
These forces were a feint and were simply being used to encircle and bottle up Ukrainian units in the Kiev area.
Obviously the Ukrainians brought a little more to the party than they expected."
What was the purpose of the invasion to begin with?
"Probably due to Ukraine trying to join NATO, which can lead to them having military base from USA.
Another thing is that Ukraine in couple of years are really aggressive in depowering Russia's Influence, by jailing someone who is influential and etc."
Stop giving the enemy tactical advice!

"Your understanding of the situation includes absolutely no context. You are essentially just copying talking points from CNN, and the western media is entirely ignoring the last 10+ years of massive NATO incursion and diplomatic expansion which led up to this. Putin warned over and over again that this would happen should NATO continue pushing further. Putin does not have a track record of invading and destroying countries. The US/west does. There are a ton of great channels who explain this in detail such as Gonzalo Lira, SmoothieX12, or Orange Capital Invest, but you won't find anything worthy being discussed on any mainstream channel."

"I don't get it. I'm not pr russian, but couldn't it just be that, maybe Russia is slow to advance due to ukranian resistance rather than supply lines? Russia is still, even if it is slowly, taking more and more territory, I only see this going one way. Ukraine is not recapturing any open stretches of land, just small part of cities here and there. I think Russia will slowly just suffocate the ukranian forces by capturing and controlling more and more road ways."

I dont think the russians are becoming ""desperate"". Its pretty clear, that they send in the worse equiped and trained conscripts first hoping for a fast victory.
Now that that didnt happen, they're bringing in their regular troops and heavy artillery, to do what they already did in chechnya two times over.

On one hand, yes the invasion isn't nearly as well going as irak i.e., but on the other hand we are seeing a lot of ukrain and western ""propaganda"".
What we see at the moment is only from one side, ukrain.
You have to understand that twitter and media wasn't the same in any previous major conflict.
Vehicles that are breaking down is every day buisness in the army, even in non-war times.
I cant tell you how many stories of humvees in some river or ditch i've heard after 2003.

While the will of the ukrainian people is admirable, this is still very much a fight they can't win.
The difference in material and men is just to big. Putin also cant draw back now, or he will lose his internal support.
So he'll most likely stick this out till he gets what the wanted.
And if the russian army generals decide they need to take kiev, then god be with the ukrainians, because what we have see till now, doesnt even come close to what they did to grozny."
"Ladies and gentlemen. Please dont disslike russians for this ""war""... We people never have a say in any of this. So dont hate the people, hate the few leaders of this world who we let fuck it up for all of us. At the moment our sanctions only hit normal working people, like you and me. Much like when corana hit. Small lonesome people and corps got messed up pretty bad, the big guys are still laughing. In Denmark where I live, the gas prices are 2 fold. The goverment dont care, it still get its taxes to wage war around the world people never voted for. Only the people suffer. We have a war everywhere against us. Not as brutal as  Ukraine with bombs, but still subniminale on the long run.."
"Yeah that's pretty much what Germans said about the Moustache guy. You can always go back to Russia , gas is cheaper there."
"Deustche Welle, BBC, CNN and other old school new atract style media (Latin American Exclusion Version): Putin never gona suffer from this war and worst is coming to you right now
Other media that dont care about gishgallups  mainstream and attract readers to their news and just focused and getting all the info right and clear: Russia is gone loose and there nothing in their favor, not matter how many fuel they have if they dont have a way to use in terms of defense"
Where is the video on the US overthrow of Ukraine in 2014?
2014 - Russia didn't come into Crimnea until AFTER the US-sponsored overthrow of the democratically elected Ukrainian government
Fantastic video! Thanks 💙💛
I wonder what excuses are you going to produce in a couple of weeks...
Must have had k&n doing the logistics
"I think Russia and half the population of Ukraine would see 2014 very differently.
Objectively - the democratically elected President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted in a violent coup (who knows who backed the coup?). He was elected fairly and justly in 2010, according to the West, including the USA and UN. Yet we, the West, called this orchestrated and violent coup a ""Peoples Revolution"". That's right, the overthrowing of a democratic government was described as a ""Peoples Revolution"". Perhaps the fact that he turned down a massive deal with the West instead going for a deal with Russia days earlier is the reason ""He had to go!""
It was only after this coup, ""Peoples Revolution"", that the areas of Ukraine in the East, overwhelmingly occupied by Ethnic Russians, decided to become independent - Would you want to be governed by a group of men who violently overthrew your democratic government?
So, yer, you missed out the most important point. But well put together Propaganda. Perhaps you're familiar with the gentlemen behind the 2014 coup in Ukraine, the guys that overthrew the democratically elected government of Ukraine, headed by an Ethnic Russian?"
Propaganda🥱
"ich find die PR immer lustig. Eine schwarzafrikanerin die ""RITA"" genannnt wird.,... das ist die werbung die für euch kam.. ^^"
"“Welcome to hell” dark reference to the Chechen war.

If there are any veterans present of that meat grinder it surely will make them uncomfortable. The battle of Grozny was a massive failure, Grachev said he could seize the city in 2h with one airborne regiment.

In 60h a battle group of over 1000 men was wiped out, 102 out of 120 APC’s destroyed and 20 out of 26 tanks destroyed.
The unit was already at half strength and only 1/3 were experienced soldiers. The rest were reserve or 18y old conscripts.

While the Chechens were fighting for their own ground and homes, many of them were experienced, battle-hardened troops from the soviet-Afghan war.

There is an audio recording of one of their colonels talking with a Chechen who is urging them to retreat to save all these young boys.  Similar thing is happening right now. Most of these soldiers are young kids that didn’t know what they were pushed into.

Lets hope that just like the chechen war, the lack of morale and public support for this war ends it soon. Its Putin’s personal crusade, how about he gets his own body armor and AK74 and fights it out himself."
"@Nikolai Oh really now ? How's that whole thing gone down yet then ? Ukraine is basically in the hands of Russia now I,'m sure!"
"@Claudy Focan you are totally wrong about inexperienced soldiers. Literally a few of such soldiers were involved in the operation by mistake (except for units of the people's militia of Donbass). And many russian officers have real combat experience in Syria. The Ukrainian army is not able to perform any significant operation right now, they are retreating all over the place and Russia set up the logistics. The railroad from Crimea to Kherson has already been restored."
"@Connor Shaw-case the parallel is that the Russians are AGAIN sending in lots of inexperienced soldiers with poor logistic support into battle. Against an enemy they seem to have sorely underestimated.

And just like the Chechen wars, the Russian people are against this conflict and their army has a low morale and most don’t feel like being their to piss off the Ukranians."
Vladamir be Putin his country in trouble AGAIN.
"Как Россия еще с НАТО собралась воевать? Ни Чечню, ни Украину взять не смогли."
"The Russians, and before them the Soviets, chose not to learn much from WW2, also recent decades of corruption run rampant by the rule of oligarchs have made things worse."
Except it didn't failed. This video contains American propaganda 💩
The Russian railroad system still uses RS3 locomotives given to them by the US during WW2.
"Thank you for this video. Clear, smooth and very explanatory."
01:46 I tought he will say (this was made possible by curiosity stream)
Ukrainian should stop protecting 🇺🇸 biden oil and use civilians as human shields
"i dont like Putin he s a puppet like everyone in USA s gov. but this is b.s, rusia has won the war already, a war that will sacrifice civileans to make profit for the twisted bankster, big tech, big pharma and politicians elites"
talk about how nato encircles russia.
"my man said Russia doesn't have enough trucks at 12:00 but dose he know they have the largest land force in the world? tanks, artillery, missiles launchers and air defense, trucks, you name it. because they are only ever fighting land conflicts, we smash them in navy and air"
"Breaking news just in. Donald Trump has said during an interview ""I guess Vladimir Putin is not as smart as I thought. He is admittedly smarter than I am but still very dumb""."
"“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” - Sun TzuI think the Russians didn't even know their own incapability, much less expected fierce resistance of the Ukrainian people."

Wow great video
Why do people think a military operation is a failure just because it didn’t instantly succeed? Life isn’t a video game or a movie with a snappy conclusion
@Thomas H the entire south pacific war against Japan in world war 2.  Learn history mate.
@Skinflaps Meatslapper what conflicts were fought with an intention of dragging it out? I’m pretty sure the majority of campaigns were fought with the hopes it’s be over quickly.
"@Thomas H Not at all.  Plenty of conflicts were fought with no intention of it being over quickly.  Point is, Putin intended it to be over very quickly, and he's failed on so many accounts in that regard."
"@Skinflaps Meatslapper yes but I feel like every military operation was intended to be quick and snappy, regardless of what actually happened on the ground"
"-15000 of orcs already died. 35000 injured. That means, they lost already 30% of whole troops they had for this war. When we hit 50%, that means defeat. Now, Putin are recruiting terrorists from Syria and Iraq to send them to the war. As you see, the Russian is dead, already."
"This is better produced than half the docs I've seen on any war, let alone one that's currently going on."
"How naive one needs to be in order to really quote Nexta and believe Russians haven't thought about logistics and rely entirely on analog insecure radio communications?
I mean, wishful thinking is nice!"
Nuclear weapons need no logistics.
"They didn't fail they won they got what they wanted Ukraine wont be joining NATO any time soon, they made bank on oil and gas, they made themselves look a few years younger, they got to play throw the mass of bodies at the problem and it'll go away again, and they practically got their nation to hate foreigners again because the foreigners and their big corporations are assholes. But who knows the us gov might get the war they so desperately want very soon but who knows their failure to help and properly govern the nation might bite them in the ass and their anti Russian propaganda machine might not be enough."
That the reason Soviets failed to invade Finland on the first attempt
The fact Biden and the EU just watched this unfold while providing the funds to do so just hows incompetent and dysfunctional we truly are
What else were they supposed to do??
"Hi. Nice try regarding the analysis, it changes from the average media propaganda.
I'd like first to point out that warning about ""Russian trolls"" in the comments is an easy way to dismiss any negative comment without further thinking.
Then I would like to point out the fact that your entire analysis is built on fake or unproven assumptions. The biggest one of them is the fact that, supposedly, Russia intended to gain victory within days. This is a total nonsense, and believing so is just underestimating the adversary, and it's in the end the way to defeat.
Russian military leaders know for sure that such a large scale conflict would not be won within days or even weeks. Even the US forces, the number one military in the world, with as you put it unlimited ressources, took several weeks to reach Bagadad in 2003.
Do you really think that a single Russian officer thought that it would take them less than a month to get to Kiev??? And what about Putin? Do you think that he would believe something that foolish?
The fools are the one who have such simplistic and superior assumptions.
Then regarding the logistics issue, you did not talk about the weather issue. It's the first and foremost factor : due to the melting soils, driving off road is virtually impossible, especially for heavy vehicles. And the Russians know that, 100%. It's their land, their weather.
Therefore one of the key conclusion would be : what pushed them to attack now, at the worst time, and in many ways ill-prepared?
What was so strategically important and about to happen, that they had to take that risk now? Why not within a month? Why not doing it after retrieving all of their foreign currency stuck abroad?
I hope that these questions will get answers. Not any time soon, but History will tell.
And I guess that since the Victors write history, your analysis will stay in the caves of the Internet.
Sorry for the negative conclusion, but this is my analysis..."
Coincidence that the war starts after covid narrative was lost. AND THE BLUE YELLOW COLOURS ARE THE SAME AS ALL COVID SIGNS
"how professionally Western propaganda works!America is preparing people for nuclear war!!with these videos, where is 90% of the deception!any military man will reveal all the fakes!The Russians only shoot at military targets!and at the firing points!they don't shoot at civilians, that's why they go so slowly!to save the lives of civilians.and the Ukrainian Nazis have taken their own people hostage and are hiding behind the backs of children!they don't let people out through humanitarian corridors!why don't they say this in the foreign media?remember!you are being prepared for a nuclear war!Ukraine is Russia's neighbor and border!the USA, as always, wants war, but not at home!on someone else's territory!Putin is against nuclear war.why does Russia need a nuclear war on its territory?the USA is doing everything to push Nato against Russia!russophobia...propaganda...they will do their job!"
Imagine invading a country and asking it's citizens direction to their leader. 👍
Yeah . So hard to imagine that it almost sounds fake.....
would be fun to try to send an armored un maned train track ripper then ?
do fuel trucks have hoses to there own tanks to keep on driving as well?
ONE MAN PEOPLE ....ONE MAN!....WE DID THIS BEFORE! ...REMOVE THE CANCER!
"Sadly just like WW2 Russian soldiers are ""following orders"" which in the end isn't an excuse.  In the end the world Court will find Russian guilty of crimes against of humanity.  They'll slowly be learning this as outside world news is found out and saldy individuals will then be stuck with what to do, support their country's decisions and or continue or maybe go AWOL which is unlikely.  Pray this ends sooner then later and before WW3 to save human lives on both sides. 🙏 All life's precious ❤️"
"i love the idea of  ""Welcome to Hell"" street sign aimed toward the invading forces."
yeah
meow meow meow
"What a shame a military superpower like Russia, now asking China for military help to defeat a non otan country, Russia plans to conquer all of Europe."
You explained it better than i could imagine and all the world politicians with the mainstream medias put together. Great video!!
"Dimitri! Do we have enough fuel and food for our troops?

Wait I thought nicholas was in charge of logistics?"
haha
9 Days after this video was released and it's still holds up . Just another great well researched video. I read that piece from war in the rocks before this video came out and others have as well
@D2524 But it is a buffer state between CSTO and NATO. Poland won't be happy to share a border with a literal enemy because people stopped supporting that very buffer state that keeps them safe.
@Jonathan Feriza Ukraine isn't a Nato member buddy. You're the one living in a pipe dream if you think Nato has any obligation to Ukraine.
"@D2524 Whatever you believed, man. 

Wonder what's the reaction of Baltic States and Poland when US stopped its support to Ukraine. Or the already shaky Turkey."
This video didnt age well
"wdym, what happened"
"Just visited Helsinki wow Russian people are leaving Russia in droves every day : trains, ships,buses driving.Putin will be left with no intelligencer just the people who cannot afford to leave."
Amazing video. I have learned more in 19 minutes than I have since the invasion began.
Awesome channel butI think Ukraines logistics are screwed big-time by the Russian forces. It has air supremacy so within reason it can do whatever the heck it wants. Ukraine is going to be demilitarised and de nazified. End of.
Appears consensus in this discussion that Russia is losing and will lose.  I wouldn't be so sure.
"This may sound cliche coming from a game, but if there's anything I learned from sid meier's civilization series, defending can be way easier than attacking, given a proper strategy. While a defense has many options and can be very unpredictable for an assailant, additionally to the nation having YEARS to create an infrastructure for internal defense, as any good country has. An attacker however, has a much shorter time to set up and prepare the territory (what we are seeing here), as well as certain predictable routes that they will most likely take towards an attack (the railways). Hopefully Ukraine can keep up this defense long enough to make Russia have no choice but to back out."
"How can a channel this big, and most american media, butcher Kyiv by calling it ""Keev"" LOL. ugh."
"cry abt it, for them it's probably a hard word to pronounce it, can you pronounce a hard german word? Can you pronounce a hard mandarin word?"
Damn cant get curiositystream. Why is there only the option to pay with credit card?
"I would rather have my soldiers blowing bridges up, destroying more and more of their supply and fuel trucks and destroy rail lines plus maybe shootdown more transport aircraft than killing more enemy soldiers or destroying their vehicles. It's a war of attrition those who tire first lose the battle and possibly the war, by constantly destroying the logistics is like slowly choking the invaders and watch them die slowly."
"The Russians never had a hard time conquering a country since Afghanistan in 1979, even though the country they want to conquer is just right next door their logistics system wasn't even good, at few times mediocre at best."
Wendover is amazing
CHINA OUGHT TO TELL PUTIN TO SHOVE IT.
Why ? because thousands of secret NATO and US troops(and rats) are in Ukraine and helping Ukraine army....
I hope we get to see Nuremberg trials for Putin.
F***k Putin. Get it???? Ukraine is a free nation and we better be there for them!!!!!

Judging this to be a failure when compared to the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan is a long reach.
hope you realize that fighting an actual army is far easier than guerilla forces
Logistics and power projection. None of these military's are built to fight outside of their own borders very well. Over the last century the U.S. has had no choice but to build a military capable of both considering we are surrounded by 2 oceans.
It means its a paper army that got a commie leader with nukes😂
"why there is no media covering US funded biolab in Ukraine, it's such a shame"
I have a friend that lived in Russia he said he hated Russia and still dose and I asked him how are you goin for Russia or Ukraine he said Ukraine
So that's how you get the 10% buff to offense and defense on core territory only.
"America what are you doing In Ukraine? 

You have expanding into Europe illegally, into Russian border for one purpose only, which we all know the reason, using Ukraines this time. But wherever you are, we think why America is doing this. You first staged a coup to overthrow a public elected president who you accused of being anti-Europe, and replaced him with proAmerican president. You then trained and financed Neo-Nazis Azov in Ukraine, once branded terrorist group both by America military and Facebook, and watched them commiting ethnic genocide on Russian speaking people at your military base doorstep, resulting in 15,000 civilian death. Next, you secretly loaded Ukraine with billions of ammunitions, handheld antiaircraft, antitank and guns for past one year, which was exposed by another NATO country, Turkey,  in preparation of attack on Russia, your ultimatum goal. As Russia watched your war plans, they prepared themselves too, which you kept broadcasting about, whilst hiding your military aggression on Russia from us. 

It is a duty of a president, to protect their borders, which they swore to do so, and therefore, Putin had every right to start a military operation to protect his people in Russia, and Russian speaking people in Ukraine. As an orchestrator,  whilst painting Putin as villain, you came out far better off than you were before, only at the expense of Europe. We all slept on your plans, and believed your propaganda, further aggravated when we couldn't watch Russian news anymore. 

But you couldn't stop the hearts of those millions of peoples, loving Putin even more."
"""But you couldn't stop the hearts of those millions of peoples, loving Putin even more."" i see you have't went to twitter"
Well presented.
Conclude this after Ukrainian wins
"This entire war on the Russian side will be in textbooks in the future for how not to conduct an invasion, where as the Ukrainian side will be how TO conduct a defensive war against an invader."
"*Why do I have a gut feeling that it is all crap and concocted?*
_Your video is _*_published_*_ on the _*_5th of March 2022_*_ whereas _*_Russia_*_ moved its forces probably on the _*_24th_*_ of February._
Such a video _cannot be completed_ in a day or two, *must have taken at least 3 to 4 days.*

*I see much is reported **_before it even happened!_* 😋  🤣 😂 🤣  😄      😃"
"""February 24th - March 5, Only 3-4 days to make this video"" Your Math is terrible"
"Why do we oppose Russia over Ukraine but most countries support US against Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Vietnam, korea etc? What have they done in those countries, women, children, buildings, civilians?"
"EXCELLENT !!!!!  Russia prepared for all those months  with all those tanks, troop carriers, rocket launches and yet they can not drive off the roads because of the mud !!!!  They blew up all the """"""""TV towers"""""" witch knocked out the 4G phone network and intern knocked out there own new military incripeted network.. No fuel ,out of date food ??? Ukraine has the man power advantage and they are motivated. The Russian army is cold, hungry far from home and shell shocked... TOO many dead... Why are they there and what are they men't to be doing ??????"
The world sat by for eight years before noticing there was a problem and by then it was too late to stop it.
I'm confused. Do they not have gps? Do they not have access to a smartphone?
"Of course, the Russians have fallen into the same logistics trap as the Germans during WW2, they too went for quick victories and relied on trains as well. Trains are of course cheap to operate and if you own them then you do what ever you want with them. Vehicle maintenance is really poor in the Russian army and as they are so lacking in funding their vehicles don't get used much, so compounding their issues."
in an open war with russia it would be very easy to cripple the train network very quickly and easily leaving them pretty much fked and stranded.
"Russia is going easy on Ukraine, you got no idea of the game Putin is playing. He's holding back for a real war with the west"
Desinfo =) very nice work
"What type of logistical problems could the Russian army be possibly facing? lol the title is already bs. No logistical failures. Russia naturally surrounds Ukraine. It has ample resources. There's a whole chunk to the argument the video leaves out which involves the use of civilians as well as the political and economic implications of the war in general. If Russia wanted to, they could roll over Ukraine in a number of ways. Maybe you forgot that simple fact?"
What happened to this channel?
Maybe you should draw a fine line between what constitutes a logistics failure?? and get rid of that annoying narrator. It would do something for your credibility.
Nice western agenda from another newbie in military strategy.
our minds are as one
"Bomb all Russia train track.
Bye Russia"

Why are these videos allowed to expose strategies? It will soon be a thing of the past! GET IT YET?
"Think about it, this is months of preparation, straightline , and just going across their own border...pure failure"
"The reason for the slow progress is to avoid civilian casualties, that way gives civilians space to move... Be realistic if Russia whont to destroy Ukraine can be done in one day.. Don't get me wrong I hate war.. I hope they find a solution to stop this war.."
You must explain to us how they conquer the majority of cities with this failed logistics !
Well I guess we spooked the troll
"@WahranRai there are three percenters and openly fascist groups in the USA,... should the usa be invaded? i suppose i dont get two things. 1) were you suggesting russia will take all the cities, or they have already. your original post is ambiguous. 2) whats your actual point about right wing battalions in ukraine?  if a country was invaded id assume both far left and right groups would have a common enemy. so i dont see the point, can you enlighten us?"
"@WahranRai I had a thought today, are you suggesting Zelenskyy is a Nazi?"
"1. Bombard Kremlin.
2. ""Get rid of"" the most important guy/s in Russia.
3. Keep repeating first 2 steps until you reach a satisfying effect (a mentally sane and pro-democratic establishment in Russia)."
"@NEPA Buses Exactly, stop it by doing what Im suggesting."
"I just want to remind everyone that while this was happening and the world was watching, Germany did everything it could to sabotage any attempt to help Ukraine. Up until war broke out, Germany did everything Putin could have wished for. Never let them forget that the destruction of Ukraine is in no small part due to what must either be extreme cynicism or staggeruing stupidity of its policy makers. Probably both."

I see now a lot of the armoured cars and trucks, we had to know then... Tanks, modernized ofcourse, but still based on the T72.. or T80. Airplanes, helicopters like the Hind Delta, still in use, now 40 years on...."
"The President has sold his people. Nazism has existed in Ukraine for a long time. Look at Wikipedia, this is Khatyn and the Volyn massacre. The EU and American proteges rocked a crowd of Nazi fools (Azov Battalion) NATO distributed weapons in Ukraine. The Ukrainians were unarmed and could not do anything. The Nazis were inspired to fight against the Russians. In Ukraine, there were NATO bases and laboratories for bioweapons. The EU and NATO are against Russia and their goal is to destroy Russia. Through the coup and the war in Ukraine, the West wanted to take power over Russia, all this from the fact that Russia has a third of the resources of the whole world. But the West wanted the Nazis-fools to attack first, they were trained by NATO. The Nazis are the reason to start a war. War is inevitable. Putin got ahead of himself, he invaded first and destroyed NATO bases and military facilities, and now the Nazis are being liquidated. The inhabitants of Ukraine themselves are against the Nazis because they hide behind living people. At the moment, the Russians are not killing civilians, but rescuing civilians from the Nazis, clearing the roads and giving humanitarian aid.
America sponsored this war in order to create a third world war. Putin thwarted the plans, but the US won anyway. Due to sanctions, Nord Stream 2 was closed, the European economy is falling due to sanctions, the US economy will grow because the United States is oriented towards China, and European industry will fall. The only negative for the United States is that Europe has not been drawn into the third world war and the United States will not be able to make money on the promotion of weapons. This is due to the fact that Putin was ahead of the curve and stopped the Third World War. And yes, there is more democracy in Russia than in the USA
Your propaganda does not let you know that the Russians have helped Ukraine economically for a long time. in 2014, Ukrainians danced on the square to the song ""kill the Russian"" The West rocked the crowd by giving money to students. What they sowed they reaped. Russians are fighting against armed nationalists. Russians don't kill civilians."

"Slava Ucraina !
I posted this as personal message to your page, because I'm sure Mr. Zelensky has no time to read any FB message. I can assure you, you will not regret if you spend 2 minutes to read it.

Hello Mr. Zellensky, 
You became my hero and model as for billions of people on this planet. 
You can very easily destroy Putin arguments:
1. It's impossible for Ukraine to oppress minorities because before being accepted in EU, constitution may need to be changed to guarantee all the possible minorities rights, including learning and developing culture in their own language, plus to use it as a second language in administration. This law cannot be broken by any EU country. No matter what happened in war conditions this is a guarantee for all the Russians and all minorities in Ucraina in peace time.

2. Convince the soldiers from the Russian army to surrender, or even turn the armies against Russia, by guaranteeing them the same salaries and rights ensuring allocation costs for their families in a future EU country. EU and US will support all the required money as this is what they can do. Tell them this is a huge and unique opportunity for their families they will never encounter in their lives, neither their children's and grand-children's lives. They are not stupid, nobody in this world wants to live under a dictatorship. This was not the first time it happened in history. Romania turned their armies against Germans in favor of USSR that ended the war at least 6 months earlier, and saved more than 2-3 million lives. For this to happen, secret negotiations started months earlier, maybe 6 months sooner when the fate of the war was not really certain. Romanian army arrested 150.000 Germans and provided the USSR thousands of artillery vehicles, hundreds of planes, up to 1000 tanks, hundreds of thousands of Romanian soldiers. But it would possibly produced more damage to the Russian army close to the ratio from middle war if not the beginning, as they were on defense in their own country. This was a minimized act in all the other countries history books but history specialists admit the truth. It's time for the same thing to happen against Russia now, just to see what this means for history and for The Fairness and Truth to prevail, as this always happens on the long term. Otherwise, even if they would win, they would need to enforce their own version of history to all the countries in the world and change their history books, which is absurd, or if don't care would mean world-isolation forever. Any contrafactual scenarios afterwards will be useless. Germany is still paying damages since WW2 and tries very hard to improve their image still after 100 years since WW1, with little successes which are still extremely expensive. Germany was before WW1 the most advanced economy in the world by far and number 1 as military power by far, now is number 5 economically and 16 militarily, after 100 years of really very hard work. Russia is number 2 militarily and number 11 economically, you can only imagine where Russia will end up when the whole world tells you are very wrong and need to stop immediately, probably 7th place militarily and 32 place economically after 100 years of hardships and struggle of the poor people, not the rich. Poor Russians need to be faced with these outcomes through facts, today! They don't deserve this tragic fate!

3. You cannot ask governments to ban Chinese exports in the world, as the link to imports with large discounts of raw materials from Russia in exchange for the technology thefts by Chinese government from occident are two things impossible to prove officially, although everybody know they are true. The people can do it, through social networks, and you can give the example of UK people unofficially rejecting or slowing down imports from actually friendly countries like France or Germany between 60s and 80s only from patriotic impulses, which suffer no comparison to what most people of the world feel today about Russia -soon about their only friend China. This is a real possibility and you'll be amazed by the outcome, it's not calculus depending on what Russian people can do, nor to any organization, it depends entirely on the people of the world. The US and EU governments may use people reaction as a pretext to tighten their legislation much more against Chinese tech companies listed on their stock exchanges, and the natural born Chinese people from the US that are allowed to work in sensitive military and research sectors only because they are born in US. There is a precedent for this too in WW2 with the Japanese born in US and precedents are very important for occidental laws. Words for Chinese mean nothing, only facts, but all it's necessary is just a minor legislative push from US for China's Stock exchange to fall to 50% and exports to fall to only 10-20%, causing unprecedented GDP loss in their recent history, and made their huge stocks they made in anticipation for huge exports useless for next couple of years, giving them a strong reason to refuse any imports from Russia even though would probably keep good ""collaborative"" relations. China cannot do it from her own initiative, but will do it if forced by undeniable facts.

4. Russian blockade will continue otherwise, until you'll run out of bullets and water. Don't underestimate how time flows in Russia's favor, as money don't matter in war times, only resources matter: recall the famous Richard phrase ""I'll give a kingdom for a horse!"" -in exchange, while trying to run away. I agree with your optimistic messages for the Ukraine, they must be kept optimistic, but I hope you are more realistic than that.
I know all the above seem impossible, but recall the Che Guevara's ""Be realistic -demand (what seems) the impossible !"" -which as short and peculiar phrase, it put an end to Gaullism in France and it's world-wide empire.

5. The above are not enough, due to the capacity of Russia to continuously produce armament without paying any ruble, because it's paying from the left pocket to the right pocket. You need also to project publicly a happy future for the Russians in Ukraine, the peace accords under UN with fair elections in Donbas and Crimea, you'll be surprised to realize later that you'll in the worst scenario lose only 5% of Crimea and 10% of Donbas. You need also to question the ones who proposed to you de-russification that provided a pretext for Putin, usually they are infiltrated at the leadership level of genuine patriotic movements, only a single person or two confiscate it, then convince their friends too that their idea is good. They take advantage of old natural needs or ideas to justify them, when consequences were easily foreseeable actually. US, Europe and entire world will support you in all the above actions too, as they involve people and bit of money not guns. China will rally a bit later due to no option left. They all hide behind accords with Russia and out of  fear, but when people and/or money are involved they can do anything you could never imagine possible.

You may be forced to take anyway all the above steps, sooner or later, no matter who seems to prevail in battles, but taking them earlier will prevent millions of deaths and destruction and a world-wide psychosis which poor Russians will have to pay for many many years to come, no doubt about it!

Thank you and good luck !
Slava Ucraina !


Please spread this as Mr. Zelensky needs to read it as fast as he can, but Ukraine need action today, better yesterday, and all the world is listening to Mr. Zelensky. These are very realistic, as Pareto's law is as real as Newton's law, only applies to Sociology and Economics: 80% of people are good, generous and smart and only 20% are really selfish and stupid."
"He must see this, this will expidite russian victory!!"
"I’m surprised to see how Russia has made so many mistakes and failures in this war so far. Growing up, I always used to think there were formidable modern military force."
@Rafael Gomez not really. Their tank doctrine is very offense centered
Russia seems to be better at defense than offense they seem to have shaped their military that way since th cold war
That means the US can cut the military budget and fund healthcare.
"Looks like they're just as disorganized as they always have been throughout all of history. Their style is more ""hit hard. If it don't work, keep hitting.""

They're at the ""keep hitting"" phase. Thing is their history has proven it can and does work."
@PS Works false
"Seems to be going fine so far, Ukrainian Airforce destroyed,  Ukrainians forces being destroyed and will be encircled and wiped out soon.

The next stage will end the war and Ukraine will be Russia again.


Why do you think Zelensky has been CRYING for help, he even caved and said he will no longer join nato or even try.


Sounds like this guy is a Spook/CIA seems to have lots of information."
"NATO caused this war. NATO wouldn't simply let Ukraine remain neutral, like Finland. Instead, NATO's aggressive eastward expansion to Russia's own border caused this war. Obama sponsored a coup in Ukraine in 2014 that installed a pro-NATO puppet government. NATO caused this war."
Где была ваша замечательная логистика в Афганистане?
Watching a country being destroyed to satisfy a madman's whims is terrifying. I fervently hope that the Ukrainian people will prevail.
"@MemeGnome You misspelled ""Putin"", buddy."
It is worth noting it is not really just for a mad man. There is great economic incentive to try and reclaim the pipes they lost in Ukraine. I'm not even mentioning the long term fear Russia has of Ukraine joining western powers.
"I know, right? Zelensky needs to go."
"This video is very informative unfortunately, the Russian military will learn just as much from this as everyone else."
This aged well
Losers study tactics. Winners study logistics.
"Russian military folks have zero combat exp., and it shows.
A common mistake made by military planners world over, is fighting the war based on
what they learned in the last one."
USA PAPA!!!
"The video was decent, but the title is PROPAGANDA!

You don't need such great logistics to invade a militarily weaker nation. Countries have been invaded since time immemorial even with much worse logistics. You break their spirit by killing bunch of them and they'll gladly welcome you in the deeper parts of the country. Russia's got the capital already and the Ukraine's comedian joke of a President who lacked any diplomatic skills, which is why they're now in a full blown war under him and why he's wearing a hoodie and not looking very Presidential hah."
"If VP's secret personal diary was captured:  

Mass. Push! Seize!! Consolidate. Don't forget to take your time for building your ### railroad infrastructure ### Pretend that nothing had happened and repeat this military exercise onwards."
Заебись пропагандируете одну точку зрения. Научпоп должен быть про другое
I want to see the logistics of producing a Wendover video
"Russia does not have the economics or private sector resources that a government can redirect , Russia is doomed, and that is why they are dangerous, they have nuclear weapons', tactical nuclear weapons'.!"
except it didnt really fail
"youtubers trying to ""cancel"" russia"
"What better evidence do we need that Russia's military is overwhelming defensive, not offensive, and that the security threat that Russia supposedly poses to Europe is a massive NATO-sustaining fraud?  If Russia cannot handily beat Ukraine what hope could it possibly have invading a NATO country?"
"Obama and Biden, both limpwristic Democrat presidents, when Putin invaded twice."
The United States allow it to supply a conflict truly anywhere on Earth. Yes I agree like in Vietnam Korea and Afghanistan
This video didn't age well if you're paying attention to neutral sources and not biased ones. Unfortunately we get all our information from twitter and russian OPSEC is in full force. Entire Eastern army is collapsing.
Hello
I only hope nato is able to intercept nuclear missiles
"Failed logistics? How far does the arrogance and lack of self-awareness stretches in the West? I can say some arguments are valid, some. But mostly by accident since your perspective is skewed exactly by above mentioned reasons. You could have used more appropriate set of words for the title. I doubt you have direct insights, information and reasons behind the logistics and exact difficulties that they have on the ground, except guessing."
"Another bullshit narrative. You obviously don't read Von Clausewitz. In 18 hours, the Ukes lost their air force, air defense, navy and now their eastern army units (Nazi Azov units) are double pincer surrounded. Tell us more about how bad the war is for Russia."
Putin =Hitler =caput
This will be compared to Napoleon's defeat at Moscow.  They'll have to retreat on foot by the time this is over.
That was 7 days ago.what have you got to say today.
"Things are going to get really dicey very shortly as the spring Rasputitsa  is coming, Let's go VVP,"
"Hopefully, russia will never be able to come back from this and hopefully go trough some major changes. Butt that's best case scenario..."

PUTIN'S war
People are so stupid... wait untill you sit in a could house... day in day out !
"The top 10 cities and nearly all the top twenty cities of Ukraine are Russian speaking cities. so the attacks are muted. No machine guns will be used to mow down the city dwellers of Ukraine. The military forces of the Russian Federation cannot use modern military tactics in attacking the Russian speaking cities of Ukraine. This way, the number of deaths may come down."
Lets not forget this monster has thousands of nuclear weapons!!!
How many days it took to capture Fallujah? 41 days
"It's clear your bias is towards Ukraine, but regardless this still paints a better picture than the legacy media which literally tries to keep everyone blind."
Who knew that kleptomaniacs are not that good at planning.
"""Dilettantes study tactics, amateurs study strategy, professionals study logistics."""
A blitzkrieg only works when the world has not seen one before.
"LOL -  you act like the last 8 years of combat and killing hasn't even happened ?  Like Putin just woke up one day and said, ''Hmm, I'll have Ukraine for Lunch!""
  You kinda skipped over all the bad blood between  Ukraine's Not-Zees,  the Holocaust of Bullets extermination of 1.5 million Jewish people, and the more than 11 million Russian and Soviet forces killed in World War 2  . . .  Russia Remembers.   Never Forget. Never Again.  PEACE TALKS and stop WW-3 NOW !"
Clown nation of usa is a joke:)
A Russian sure would know what a joke looks like.
Derail those trains.
You really can't make this up Suddenly the liberal-left in America wholeheartedly wants to go to war in defense of an openly racist anti-semitic Nation known for human trafficking
so... the nation you're talking about is russia?

PUTIN'S war
Shiiii we need a Russian donation for my boi
"MUGA,,,,,,, MAKE UKRAIN E GREAT AGAIN  MAGA  KAG"
Why don’t they fire missiles at Moscow?
"You really believe Russia annexed Donbass as well as Crimea? It is true that they annexed Crimea. Not so for Donbass. When Donbass people got the news from Kyiv Euromaidan aka Orange Revolution succeeded, the local ministry decided to make a referandum, which resulted in 90% of seperation. That's why they're called seperatists. I lived there. My university got shelled, hospital I once treated, I lost a Nigerian friend there, my Polish girlfriend went there for blood donation. My dentist got shelled, Administratsiya got bombed, my ex-gf's house got shelled, Aeroport was destructed all with Ukrainian armies.
Ukraine refused to open borders most of this time, leaving the sector without any humanitarian help. All Ukrainian friends had to travel through Rostov->Minsk->Kiev, or through Rostov->Istanbul->Kiev, you couldn't even travel to your own capital city through Ukrainian blockposts. They treated ""everyone"" as seperatists. There was no ""peaceful citizens"" from their point of view, which is something I want to reveal. I'm not pro-russian. But if Russia didn't keep humanitarian corridors and helps, Donbass people would have suffered a lot. Now West Ukrainians blame them for asking Russia's help, but it's all natural from their point of view, since they lost big lands. 
With that said, not only Russia, but also bad Ukrainian politics have lead into that. To abandon an old ally and make customs affairs harder would have make Eastern people even poorer though they were already poorer than the West.
Then when I traveled into Odessa, I've seen that nobody knew about the big conflicts that were going in Donetsk in 2014 July.
Problem here is that Russia (as well as Ukraine) are manipulating news on their sides, which makes people filled with hatred.
You can see this if an harassing comment will be dropped under this reveal, blaming me to be pro-putin or something. I'm reading news from both sides. Not only Russian, or Ukrainian, but both sides. I know both languages pretty well. This is what one requires to understand what's really going."
@DeepBlue I bet the girls in elementary school love your funny jokes.
"Russia never been strong military, they lack strategy, clown army"
"did he say ""vorboting""?"
"The idea that Russia failed to take logistics and/or Ukrainian responses like destroying rail connections into account, is laughable rose-tinted propaganda. It may be that Russia underestimated the effort required to invade Ukraine, but you show no meaningful evidence to support this assertion. As you mention at the outset: this action was an escalation of a pre-existing hot conflict in the separatist regions in the East. Russia therefore trivially knew Ukraine (read: US/NATO/The West) would not give-up without a fight (ie an actual fight). Read the accounts from the initial push of the US Army into Iraq in 2003. The first contact was an ACCIDENT, when a convoy (which was lost) drove straight into the middle of a provincial town, and then had to fight their way out. In any military action there will be embarrassing screw-ups and anomalies."

Red dawn wasn't a fiction then? Ha ha hahha
"Alexander Nevzorov released in April 2021:
""The most important thing is, of course, clearly, the inevitable war with Ukraine.

      Victorious cartoons and videos of the military training exercises from the Russian Ministry of Defense did their work. Everyone now believes in the Russian military power. But, all these exercises are a performance on the imaginary piano. You can make faces like the famous pianist Van Cliburn used to make. You can roll your eyes portraying incredible inspiration, impressively fast fingers - you can pretend to do all that right until some bastard shoves a real piano under your hands. Here begins the embarrassment. It will turn out, the great theoretical pianist can't even play ""twinkle twinkle"" with one finger. What will happen at this war, and how? Whatever happens, in any case, will end in horrible defeat and tragedy for Russia. To add to the Afghan, Vietnam, Chechen, the poor country will grow another hump of embarrassment. 
       Why, with such seeming inequality in power, I assume the victory will be Ukraine's. Just because for Ukraine, any outcome of the war is victory. Because there are only two options, and both of them are fatal for the Russian Federation. In one case, the giant, angry, bloody monster Russia tramples the small, proud, defenseless neighbor. In the second case, the small neighbor tramples the giant bloody monster. For Russia, both options are equally tragic. 
      Who less of all understands war? Who you should never listen to? I can tell you: the so-called military analysts. Who will feed everyone the terminologized BS about how their Hurricanes, Grads, Poseidons, Pinnochios will burn the strategic corridors for the tank divisions and after them, infantry heading for Kiev. That is complete nonsense. You can do that during the exercises. With preagreement and a big paycheck the Ukrainian side will considerately lay down before the Russian tank tracks and accept some of the missiles. All of the military analytics is made predominantly by fools who either lost touch with reality or never touched it in the first place. None of them considers the fact of the beyond furious resistance of Ukraine and the Russian army's complete lack of skill. 
    Ukrainian divisions, I suspect will be more enraged than Chechens. Chechen war was lost by that old, Soviet army, which still had some traditions, generals and experience. Now there's none of that, no Rokhlin, no Lebed', nobody. How will this Russian-Ukrainian war will look like? 
     What is war for Russia? First and foremost, it's the possibility to rob your own army with impunity. Since you can write-off everything. The magical ability of war to write-off things is well known. All the best deals are made on the frontlines. There are already smart missiles that change trajectory on purchase. And as the experience of the First Chechen war has shown, Russia has long learnt to sell its own tanks to the enemy right with the crew. 
      Everything will begin with a few divisions getting lost, you can't go without that. Those divisions will necessarily be carpeted by the Russian Air Force, which in Chechnya has gained an incredible ability to bomb its own units, eliminating at least a quarter of their own forces. I don't think they've lost that skill and they will be able to practice it again. The Russian Navy will also have the opportunity to try their talents. With some artillery, binoculars and port wine they will obligatorily strike a few beaches with sunbathing Russian tourists. As pieces of the tourists will be sorted into bags, sweaty admirals will be ending themselves. Not because of the tourists, but when they find out that the hulls of their warships are held together only by a thick layer of paint. Of course, when it will come to the whole ""dying"" part, it will turn out that the patriotic cartoons cannot wage war or die themselves. The frontlines, traditionally, will be presented with conscripts only having the experience of shooting from mops and shovels, running to get the beer and making beds. Those chicks in camo will be choked by thousands by the desperately angry, experienced and highly motivated Yarosh battalions. About 5000 in the first week.

Russia will be showered with zinc coffins. Not a single soldier or officer will have the slightest idea of why the hell they are here and for whose yachts and palaces they are fighting. You think there isn't going to be another Grozny rail terminal? There surely will be. There will be the same alcohol-soaked idiots in Lampasas poking pencils in their maps. 
      Russia manages to find embarrassment everywhere. It finds it, swallows it, somehow digests it and for a few years explodes with a horrible diarrhea in the media. But here it will bite off embarrassment in indigestible amounts. After a week, the zinc-coffin rainfall will get stronger. 
What was the Chechen war for, which decorated Russia's landscapes with 18 000 tombs?
 Now it's more or less clear. To build in Grozny some diamond palaces, mosques, to bow to Chechnya and to transfer it a few billion rubles every day. That is to pay tributes appropriate for the victor.
         That's what for the Russian government has turned thousands of its boys into burning meat. And about as many turned into disabled people. And that's considering that in Chechnya they didn't wage war with an army, but with a few bands of volunteers who weren't really soldiers. Why were the piles of corpses necessary? You could just pay Chechnya straight away.

Those Russian officers who still have their memory not washed away with alcohol completely will most likely remember all the imprisoned heroes of the First and Second Chechen wars, starting with colonel Budanov, will remember all the bullying by the tribunals and betrayal by the government. Officers are observant, they took notice that the Motherland doesn't forgive brave deeds.
Bloodbath, coffins, terror, chaos, outcry of the press, Soldiers' Mothers Union - all of this will increase tenfold every day. Worldwide informational background consisting entirely of cursing, exposing and defaming Russia will be getting heavier and weighing down the already barely standing army.
      Consider that it's not only Russian propaganda can make up ""crucified russianspeaking boys"", but here you won't need to make up anything. Any war gives enough bloody and heart-wrenching precedents. Besides everything else, this isn't only a war with Ukraine. It's also a war with Odessa. The best way to cheaply and forever become a joke to everyone. The powerful anti-war movement in Russia itself will become the core which will finally unite everyone who hates the regime.
      There is another unpleasant nuance. Right now the magical power of art is at work. Cartoons, videos, parades - but it's best to not familiarize anyone with the real capabilities of the Russian army. After seeing the Russian army in practice, the Japanese will immediately remember about the Kuril Islands. Germans will smile about Konigsberg, Moldova about the Transnistria and so on.
And also. You have to remember, the military environment hides complex and quick surprises for the government. War is also dangerous in quickly forging heroes, authorities, legions' favorites who will quickly realize they have aces at hands. And those who will be the first to fraternize with the Ukrainians will become the coolest and most renowned. It's possible, some of the commanders may be actually burning with desire to save the Russians from oppression, poverty, humiliation and robbery. But to fulfill that desire to save your people, you may head to Kiyv, but you may also head to Moscow. Both directions are equal in this case. But on your way to Kiyv are the desperate Yarosh battalions, Ukrainian Forces, partisans, ambushes, landmines, snipers, embarrassment and death. But the road to Moscow is free from those obstacles. And the result is about the same.
 
    Well, Zolotov and The National Guard will quickly join NATO. And Putin will only have left a call to his friend Biden, asking to send the US Marines to protect Moscow from the gone-crazy Russian commanders. The end."""
"Sir, this is the drive-thru lane at Wendy's."
Russia realy don`t have time because of sanctions and social demand of quik victory.
"Wtf is this biased bullshit? Unleash death and destruction? You guys in the west are clearly don't want to aknowlege the truth about this conflict, you did this, and now we have to act. UA is purely NATO and US fault."
"Lack of logistics is part of the plan, American Generals commented being surprised how this war is being waged by Russia, because in Syria Russia performed great operations ground air combined with special units, what we see now is nothing in terms of war and innocent people die and struggle of course, Putin is a dickhead anyway ;)"
"I will admit there's a lot of good information in this video, there is information that I have been having trouble finding,  now here's the real problem: IF YOU THINK RUSSIA IS FAILING BECAUSE OF FLAWED LOGISTICS YOU MAY BE MISLED.   After the United states Russia is the most logistically capable military in the world,  the video points the differences between US and Russia,  the video also gives information that should make you think that they're creating failure on purpose.   Points to look at, first General George Washington led victory through defeat, his goal was to bankrupt the British empire,  it worked,  it took years, the British intentionally allowed US citizens on the Lusitania to create American outrage to pull the US into war against Germany and it's allies.  Doolittle's raid although practically meaningless forced Japan to bring more troops back to the homeland for defense(which leads to how many troops are still in Russia) creating a bit of ease on US forces, although still difficult.   Look up how many troops General Marshall expected to lose on D-Day, it was huge but because of eloquent and detailed training was actually more effective than expected.   With all this said propaganda is a huge factor in warfare.   Changing tactics to allow the opposition believe their is a weakness is exposing their weaknesses.   Wars are won with logistical superiority,  this takes time to properly secure and creating a false perception that it's failing might be intentional.  ARROGANCE IS A WEAKNESS.   Additionally free Men will fight more effectively than conscripts,  Russian leaders know this, so you have to make certain sacrifices to train your men to fight more effectively,  with means forcing them to fail by putting the in situations that are life and death, and do it early because it's going to happen eventually.   There's a reason only a fraction of troops are being used, don't think the Russians are failing when that's probably what they want you to believe.   There's too much information for anyone person to even comprehend,  understanding logistics is key, understanding your opponents perception of your logistical capabilities is more effective.   Everything should be taken with a grain of salt and prepare for your own safety"

"American soldiers murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians during the Vietnam war, through the use of Napalm, traditional bombing & close contact fire with machine guns. During the My Lai massacre, the American invaders resorted to vicious tactics comparable to those perpetuated by the reatreating Nazis during their failed attempt to conquer the Soviet Union in WW2. Women & girls were raped, bayoneted & tortured to death. As bad as this conflict is, it cannot even begin to compare to the atrocities commited by the US during the Vietnam war."
This is the same shit with every modern army attacking guerrilla defenders scenario
Nothing has made me want to join the military more.. i feel horrible for the Russian soldiers that are just doing what they're told. Imagine dying for a cause that everyone hates you for. Puttin needs to be assassinated & NATO needs to take control. God bless these people defending their home.
The big question now is how far Putin will go into mainland Europe before he runs out of equipment?

"@Vitalijs Ļebedevs Hey brother! Did you manage to get in? I couldn't get permission from my government in Poland because of charges against me when i was 18 and spray painted some post Soviet street names, jokes on them petition to change those names went through after my act but now i technically have a criminal record for 1 year more... I managed to sneak in Ukraine with humanitarian aid and tried to get in territorial defense but they couldn't allow it despite my ""high enthusiasm"" as recruiter said, having me there illegally could strain relationships with Poland, i hope that this war will be long over year from now but if not I'm going right back in."
"@Vitalijs Ļebedevs I can say some words about Azov battalion. In begining 2014 it's was group of real nazis and ultra right people. They created Azov, Aidar, Tornado volunteer military groups for fight against russians and separatists on east of Ukraine. Reason is simple, we have no any army at all. Just some generals and political faces who corrupted armed forces in decades, and little part of real military forces who actually want to fight for their country. Cause of rised nationalistic mood in mass after revolution many people realised that we need protect our country and its sovereignty. So more radical part of people start these military groups. In 2014-2015 more people come in their lines for protection of our state. That's was real patriots who saw inpotention of our new government in such questions. Original stuff of this group actually do war crimes, which UN admit, and our government too. And fight between original stuff and later joined started in lines of this groups. Cause of original staff's crimes on donbass. After that more of radical part of founders was banished by  government's rebuild, apolitisation was taken and put Azov under police command. Tornado was dissolved. Aidar, don't know what actually happened with them. Also there was lot of jailed people from this groups, so like justice escapers. Corruption... So Azov have hard way from nazi uncontrolled group to group consisting mostly from patriots, internal fight and reformation in apolitical police structure under government wits nationalistic ideas. I hope you know difference between nazi and nationalist, on russia it's very similar words (нацизм/национализм). Russian propaganda deleted borders from this two words and forgot about that nationalist synonym patriot and appeal to its citizens like patriots. Actually I'm from Mariupol, and I have lots of friends in military, Azov including. Some of my professors served there. And I saw all process in my eyes from outside, have inside information and its explanation from Azov military. In fact OSCE doesn't confirmed systematic in crimes neither genocide or deliberate elimination of civilians on donbass from this groups. Moreover there was no further escalation on east of Ukraine after 2015, some casualties in 10-20 people last year's. Like a person who spoke russian and lived in Mariupol no one try to kill me for my language and no one pressed my rights, even in western Ukraine bandestats like Lviv, Ivanofrankovsk or Ternopil. ""Motherland of all nazis"" in Ukraine. Actually in western russian spoked part of country we have more nationalistic mood than there. In Azov most part speak russian, most of then from donbass region. Under ukranian gowerment and decentralisation policy, which was one of main part of separatists goals, city have developed from depression soviet style town to european like city, with new roads, building restoration, modern transport logistic, new large green parks, squares, convenient provision of public services, and more and more. Yeah, prices were hight, there was some large external credits, salaries not high (but 15k hryvnias per month was medial salary and that's was more than enough for one person). It was one of the most beautiful cities in country. Western Ukraine can boast european architecture, central Ukraine can boast their large green parks and squares from soviet legacy. But this city have half of them plus modern structure. In two words, nazis don't deweloped cities, they destroy them."

First few days in war/ Vs over 250 years of failed communism and fascism that  attacked and enslaved Russian lands. My response. Logistics will probably be corrected. Sooner or later boarder will return back on maps where it once was. I just hope minus all  comi/nazi. Truth always wins. Other wise might as well kill all crisians and get read of bible. Lenin and Stalin and Hitler was out of same source. And getting 23 train wagons of gold when Gorbachev ran didn't help ES too much either. At least from looks of it. But what you know about some thing you never learned in history class. I think everyone is waking up to fact that European alliance is not so democratic after all. And if they get all Russian land there is no stop. With all of the natural resources. I don't think that there is going to be America or Canada or Egypt or Turkey. We truly live in prophetic times. I do pray for God's will on earth as it is in heaven.

Can you imagine if we invaded Mexico? It would be DONE by now. Putin….. you deserve everything that is coming to you

great video. I'm from Russia. And I still can't believe it...
a parallel can be drawn to the disorganized Russian troops . . . the Iraqi Army during Desert Storm in 1991 when U.S. & NATO invaded Iraq to drive Iraq out of Kuwait . . .

"Set your mind on Jesus Christ with a repentant heart and leave Him, to decide what you'll leave behind.

The reason I say this, is because it is by grace through faith, that we are saved and that is not of ourself. So it isn't by works or anything we do, or don't do, but by faith alone, having believed that Jesus died for our sins once for all, and that God raised Him from the dead.
The bible says we are to believe this in our heart and confess it with our mouth, unto salvation.

So, does doing this, make it a works based salvation? Not at all, it is an act of obedience to God, the Holy Spirit, Whom, has indwelt the believer, causing regeneration of our spirit that was dead in Adam. Just like He did in the one thief on the cross next to Jesus.

We have been given a new spirit and a new heart that is not hardened toward righteousness and a renewing of the mind, which completely changes our volition. This is why a sinner would be willing to walk away from sin and follow Jesus as Lord of their life. Just like you are thinking, you may wanna do.

Judging by the comments, it sounds to me as though you are doing exactly what you said in your heart, you would be willing to do. The Lord is the One that will see the work He has begun in you, through unto completion. Which of course, will be when we meet Him face to face in our new glorified digs. Our new glorified body, I was just trying to sound cool by saying, ""digs"". Lol..

I purposely said it that way, to show you that we Christians are just like everyone else, in that we like to have fun, still wanna come across as cool, unique and individual or whatever our thing is, just not prideful or immoral, or anything sinful.

We live a new more abundant life inside these vessels, that is pleasing to God and brings glory to Him. This is the fruit of the Spirit. His Spirit, the Paraclete, Who is working in us, doing all of the heavy lifting and comforting us, and rooting us onward to the finish line, by encouraging and enabling us. He is also sanctifying us, which of course is setting us apart from the world around us. Making us a peculiar people, something like God's chosen people, the Jews. Only for them it was in the physical sense as they were commanded to live in a way that was so different than anyone else, that they remained separate from everyone, thus ensuring a pure bloodline to the throne of David, and our Lord and King, the long awaited Messiah or Christ Jesus, Who will reign on David's throne forever. 

But, in us the elect, it is spiritual, and yes we too, are a peculiar people, in the sense that we are merely sojournors in a land that is not our own, as we are just passing through, to reach the destination that God has placed the desire for, in our hearts. 

Here is the tough part, and I can tell you this without concern of you turning and running the other way, because if indeed you are elect, then you, like myself and all of the brethren will be cast, in the furnace of affliction. Notice that I didn't say ""cast into"", like Daniel's three buddies, who were cast into a furnace in an effort to destroy them. Rather, I said ""cast in"" and the reason for this, is because for us, it is not for punishment and destruction, but discipline and admonishment and through affliction, we are being perfected in Christ or you could say, being made into the image or likeness of Christ. This is achieved by our suffering, as He did. This I believe is only one of the reasons behind what Paul meant when he said, to take up our cross and follow Him, and also, work out your salvation with fear an trembling.

When we are following Christ, we are the light of Christ, to the world around us. I am not saying we are Christ. But, when people see and hear a true blue born of God Christian soldier, there is such a vast difference between them and us, that those that remain rebellious against the Lord become uncomfortable because they love darkness and all the sinfulness that goes with it. They hate the light and shun it because it reveals the truth about their wickedness and the dark sinful condition of their heart,

We need to be on our guard from attacks by the evil one, who works his craft in and through those that remain spiritually dead in Adam, as they are lost and deceived. We will be persecuted for Christ's name sake. That is one of the marks of a godly man. Just look at all that our Lord allowed, for Paul to suffer for Christ's name sake. Also let us not forget that there is a spiritual battle for the mind, taking place, and the reading of the word and prayer are where we will find some of our best defense against any accusations from the evil one, not to mention, both the word and prayer can be a quiet place of refuge, to shelter us from any of the storms we must go through in our trials.

I am confident, that the Lord has already begun a great work in you. Tonight when I head down to the lake, to spend time with the Lord. I will include all of you in my prayer.

Anyhow brothers and sisters, I love you, as do all of the brethren, as does our gracious Lord and Savior..."

Hey, I know, they can ask the US for trucks like they did in WW2. Oh, wait...☺"
"Again... you say ""failed"" ... It betrays a total misunderstanding of the nature of the conflict... and you forget that in the south, Russia has achieved a maximum calculable extent for armored columns, reaching 250 miles in two weeks. That already puts major holes in your argument. Then there is the glaring fact that Russia is still using a relatively small portion of its military forces and if they NEEDED to, they could have expanded their supply capabilities for such a relatively small force."
Making little progress is not the same as trying to minimize losses among combatants and civilians... They're stalling and waiting until the eastern contingent of Ukrainian forces is surrounded and eliminated. Your analysis is very biased.
It's not a belief... Eastern Ukraine has been a part of Russia (was Russia) for a thousand years with minor exceptions when the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth took them over for a while. A very large proportion of eastern Ukraine are Russians or Russian speakers of various descents.

"This video is full of subjective conclusions and utter bullshit in the end.
First off - there's no single example of better operation of similar size in recent history. ""Advanced"" USA tacticians just carpet-bomb everything with civilians, hospitals and cities, and only after moves in, author is clearly a propagandist and nothing more.

The operation started slowly because Russia was not only avoiding fire on Civilian structures, but also tried to harm as little soldiers as possible, focusing mostly on military storage facilities and machinery.

After a few days, when they saw that not too many soldiers decide to give up, they started to do proper attacks on all military infrastructure and command posts.

Even now, Russian army avoids attacking civilian areas, but the problem is that Ukrainian army, and especially the Nazi battalions like Azov are hiding in the civil infrastructure, there are numerous of videos filmed by themselves where they base inside schools, kinder-gardens, hospitals, they shoot their rocket volley systems out of the cities between civilian houses. This is all documented on videos, unlike the empty-worded blatant propaganda piece you hear in this crappy video."

"Yeah. Whatever you say. Since the Russians are likely to reach their objective, media showing it have to be censored and only disinformation propaganda will be allowed.  Proof if ever there was."
"Lets be honest, Russia has already lost."
Ukraine is showing just how incompetent Russia's military is... once again.
"The video's title doesn't seem to line up with the conclusions made in the video.
The conclusion made is not that the operation has already ""failed"" due to inadequate logistics but that it's currently stalling due to it while support units are building extended supply infrastructure that would allow the troops to push further into Ukrainian territory."

Russian logistical failures are not surprising. What is surprising is the failure to achieve air superiority. The Russian air force seems incapable of taking their own SAMs which Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union. Their inability to stop strikes from non-stealthy subsonic drones. Their inability to takedown Ukrainian airfields. Downright. shocking.
apparently it is a war doctrine issue.

Since the day #1 I helped my Ukranian partners (UX design studio located in Cherkassy) with contracts, money, made intro to people that might help, I also helped people I just know they're Ukranians live in Ukraine with everything I could (donated, basically, until I got cut-off the MasterCard and VISA, so now I can't even donate to the RedCross of Ukraine...)

I personally lost half of what I and my spouse earned for our 15 years careers (worth $0.5M, it's quite a lot for us). My business also got plenty of collateral financial damage, and I used to work literally 24/7 for the past 3rd week just managing the disasters falling on my people's and my heads. Finally, my family and I fled from the country, sold most of the property for cheap etc

I do recognise the price of the fact that Russians couldn't do anything with Putin but believe me - there are millions of Russians who wasn't silent or approving that at all, it's more than 6 years now when you can be beaten by police without a reason or you can eventually die in a jail (there are tens of cases reported) and surely your life will be spoiled once and forever, so you can say goodbye to the Youtube comments lol. If you think you can simply express your opinion anywhere - it's not a case for more than 6 years now (there are hundreds and thousands of cases reported when people got 5-15 years for pictures and reposts in social networks)

We help our people - both Ukranians and Russians and 80% of us have relatives on both sides, so this is an absolute disaster

My message here is please do not lead this to more bloodshed, racism or any stuff like that. Please always find ways to help good people whoever they are"

"Putin has instructed the Russian military to not retrieve their dead soldiers.  If those 18, 19, 20 yr old kids start coming home in body bags, it would be a propaganda nightmare for Putin. Their soldiers are are being eaten by animals in some places.  These young soldiers who are being captured keep saying they are being used as ""cannon fodder"" .  That's because they along with the Chechnya military were considered expendable. Putin sent them in to draw and and expend the bulk of the Ukrainian militaries ordinance.  That is why you seen T-72 tanks along with other 80's Russian equipment.  Same thing in the air. All the helicopter gun ships and MIG fighter jets are Afghanistan era equipment.  Once the Russian military feels Ukrainians have used the bulk of their stinger missiles and javelin missiles, they will bring in more sophisticated equipment."

"Whilst there is no excuse for the Russian invasion,  the Ukrainians have certainly antagonised them. They stole vast amounts of gas from the Russian pipeline that passed through their country.  When their independence was declared the ultra nationalist's attacked and provoked Russians living in Ukraine. The Ukrainians invited NATO into the country to place an immediate threat at the Russian front door. They want to join the European union to exploit the millions in Aid and loans. They have stopped the flow of fresh water to the Crimea making life very hard for the people living there. In any war the worst possible publicity  is when innocent civilians are killed,  every  massacre or tragedy benefits the Ukrainians so remember this when it occurs."

"I suggest you wait a while longer before declaring the failure of the Russian invasion, it’s nice to have those thoughts but unfortunately a little premature."
美在乌建15个生物实验室被曝光，俄国防部称拿到相关证据：环球时报 2022-03-08 09:59 俄罗斯国防部发言人6日对外宣布，美国在乌克兰研发生物武器。俄媒称，美国在乌克兰境内共建立15个生物实验室，分布在乌克兰的多个重要城市。7日俄国防部发言人伊戈尔·科纳申科夫少将6日表示，为防止美国和乌克兰违反联合国《禁止生物武器公约》的事实泄露，乌克兰卫生部向所有生物实验室发出指令，要求其紧急清除储存的危险品，从而掩盖五角大楼资助乌克兰进行军事生物项目的痕迹。科纳申科夫说：“我们收到乌克兰生物实验室工作人员关于2月24日紧急销毁鼠疫、炭疽、兔热病、霍乱和其他致命疾病等特别危险疾病病原体的相关文件。乌克兰卫生部要求用消毒剂或煮沸销毁高压灭菌器中的生物病原体。哈尔科夫地区疾病控制和预防中心向乌卫生部报告称，他们用生物材料销毁大约40个试管。波尔塔瓦地区疾病控制和预防中心也报告用12种生物材料销毁24个容器。俄收到的文件证实，生物武器的开发是在俄罗斯领土附近的乌克兰生物实验室进行的。很明显，在过去20年里，美国花费大约1000亿美元来研发生物武器。为了掩盖违反美国法律的行美国在乌克兰建立的生物实验室最多，至少有15个，分别位于利沃夫（3个）、基辅（3个）、敖德萨、文尼察、乌日哥罗德、赫尔松、捷尔诺波尔、哈尔科夫、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克以及卢甘斯克附近和克里米亚地区，另外还有在基辅和敖德萨新建的两个实验室准备启用。生物实验室对鼠疫、炭疽和布鲁氏菌病病原体进行研究，哈尔科夫和波尔塔瓦实验室对白喉病原体、沙门氏菌病和痢疾的研究，现在美国使馆心虚了？紧急删除文件。
"What if Russia have purposely been ""failing"" in order to tempt NATO to slip up and get involved to then, most likely, triggering World War III?

Also, about Russia already having been in Ukraine since 2014; yes, that is so, but that part of the country doesn't want to be alied with Europe but Russia. Trying to force the people against their will is exactly why the war has been ongoing for so long. You cannot make a peoples belong to an ideology they don't wish to be part of, yet Western Ukraine keep insisting instead of recognising Easter Ukraine as independent."
"Lol. Russia is refraining, obviously. They are not going full force And even, 1/3 of the country has fallen in 2 weeks. Logistics fallen, I guess not."
A lot of the Country has fallen since the separatists so Russia has not been making as much progress as you think.
Europe is a cursed continent
The Failed Logistics is that they underestimated how much vodka that where needed to keep the Russian soldier going.
The russians are a laughing stock across the world. Dictator putin will ne defeated. Murdering children is cowardice. Up Ukraine
"I find it disgusting that he calls it a ""special military operation"" when we can all see that it's nothing short or war crimes."
@Game Dev YouTube 3.0 yes?
@Tilted BROOOOO
"@Raymond Sullivan Exactly, and that will be Russia this time."
Please keep making these. Fantastic source of information
Extremely well done.  This and other non-traditional information sources are putting out a much better picture of what is going on and why than that being put out by traditional television or cable entities.
@Sergiy Tokio Glory glory glory I see you on the other side.
@Sergiy Tokio so then what are Russias goals and motivations?
@Arthas Menethil What you write is complete nonsense.
@Aachoo Crony Glory To Ukraine! Glory to the heroes! From Israel to support Ukraine!
@Sergiy Tokio Russia's winning the war is inevitable vs Russia's defeat is inevitable? What's the difference? Another question:are you a bot?
The strongest army of the world
"I wish the U.S. would give Ukraine a few dozen long range drones with precision guided missiles. They should target Russia’s  forward located military bases (within Russian borders) … Russian soldiers need to fear for their lives not only where they trespass, but also where they call home."
"Russians who oppose the war should organize resistance in the motherland.  Start by bombing every critical railroad leading toward Russia’s rear staging areas…Putin won’t be expecting a coordinated attack in their home turf, by pro-freedom Russians. Also ambush the response forces and strike multiple locations at the same time. Guerrilla warfare could help bring this monstrous government to its knees."
Quickly ??? Seriously ?

"Great video, their logistics sucks
12 000 тисяч соняшників, тримаємся!"
Goes back to the Russian loss in Russo Japanese war; Russian Generals and Admirals are corrupt and inept.
My biggest problem trying to understand what's fact from fiction in Ukraine is the west have a monopoly on the world's main stream news and not all but most of them have clearly shown to be propaganda outlets
This is just your opinion based on what info you get from western media. Generally will be biased on most parts and skewed in ways to spread propaganda for western interests. Also most wars have logistical issues on both sides so this videos is irrelevant 😴 🙄
"The US and European governments are lying about Russia trying to hide their guilt in what is happening. Having leverage, they block Russian users and the media. A photo of Ukrainian female soldiers with the symbol of fascists on their uniforms was removed from a Canadian news site yesterday. Today they decided to destroy the Russians, and tomorrow they will come for you. 

Russians and Ukrainians are one, many Russians have families in Ukraine, that's why it's important for Russians. They are not killing civilians, they are trying to save them from the National security guards who are holding them hostage in residential areas. 

If you don't believe the Russians, look at the news of those countries that have nothing to do with the conflict. There are websites that expose all the fakes of the Ukrainian government. 

For example, a lie about a maternity hospital, everyone was taken out of this surrender on 28.02.22. There was the headquarters of the fascist battalions. 

Films that tell the truth about Donbass are banned in European countries and USA. These are the films of Paul Moreira ""The Mask of the Ukrainian ""revolution"".
Or the film of the French journalist Bonnelle, who shot in 2015, shot an almost hour-long documentary in the Donbas and about the atrocities of the fascists there. 

Think about why Russian news channels about the situation in Ukraine were removed from YouTube today. 

By the way, my comments are deleted every time. How uncomfortable it is to hear the truth."
Logistics in did. Great video.
"there is no conscripts in the russian operation but only professional soldiers .  The only things who shows than russian army would have a logistic problem is some random vidées from internet where it is not really possible to identify what who is doing what  .  A lots of lootings are made in the ukrainian side too , by bandits with weapons , citizens or even ukrainian soldier . We are very far from the usual professional quality of that channel ."
Russia fight Ukrainian neo naZi alone again. All prayers for Russia 🇷🇺
Hasbulla will come 😉
这是关于俄罗斯后勤很好的一个总结视频。
"I am writing for those who do not understand the reasons for Russia's attack on Ukraine. After 2014, Ukraine grew in anti-Russian sentiments, the people of Ukraine insulted Russia, exerted aggression on the Russians, while the Russians continued to call Ukraine a brotherly country. During the Second World War, most of Ukraine, called the UPA, fought for Nazi Germany. their ancestors today after 2014, after the coup d'état, celebrate the day of the fascist SS, walk with torchlight fascist processions, the national hero after 2014 in Ukraine Stepan Bandera, the one who fought on the side of Nazi Germany. attack the old people celebrating the victory of the USSR over fascism. After such behavior, Ukraine asks to join NATO, and this should have come to an end. Since 2014, Ukraine has attacked people who spoke Russian and felt like Russians, they live in the Donbass. Look it up on google. Ukraine bombed peaceful cities for 8 years and no one in the UN tried to stop it. Massacres, torture, Ukrainian Nazis worked for 8 years in the Donbass. Russia's patience has run out!!!"
"*after US/NATO sponsored coup in 2014 
Since then many Ukrainian unarmed innocent people died for nothing while official gov of Ukraine did nothing to stip psychos bombing women and childre, burning people alive, shooting them on streets or on the road just for fun..
Also ironic, in 90's Ukraine helped Chechnya to go independent from Russia, Now, today they cry horror when Chechen fighters coming after them. What goes around comes around."
told y'all this is just another CIA / State Dept mouthpiece.
"@wind k ah, the typical right winger who thinks anyone not agreeing with his anti-american and anti-nato idiocy is a ""lib""."
"I am not sure that Russia has a ""logistic problem"". War is extremely complicated and the progress they have made so far could be normal.

There are always ""experts"" who proclaim that a war will be very short and over in just a few days. Then, when reality turns out different, they dont want to admit that they were wrong. Instead, something extraordinary must have happen... like Ukraine provided more resistance than no one could have predicted. The new story is now that Russia is surprised. The ""experts"" are never wrong."
"Of course a lot of vehicles are being left by both sides (Russia can easily afford that by the way) due to the issues with fuel supply and repairs, but that's not the reason why the Russian advance got much slower. Besides, any logistics issues could've been solved already, with the guarded MSR & local supply storages on the taken territories. In fact, the reason is rather obvious, as long as you know both Russians & Ukrainians."
"8 years to plan and prepare for a final phase to take Ukraine and Putin still fucked it up! I dont think NATO has a great deal to worry about. No Armata tanks seem to have been deployed in great numbers, if any!;  the vast majority of the infantry vehicles are old BMP or BRDM derivitative models, hardly new or state of the art."
"What worries me is the extremely optimistic reaction of people in the West. Russia is moving faster than the German Blitzkrieg, faster than Desert Storm. Ukraine is a giant country, the size of a third of western Europe. You don't understand at all what's going on."
"@Samurai Jack As a matter of fact, some of the coverage on the internet has been superb, especially interesting was the piece about the cheap chinese tyres that the Russians are using on their wheeled vehicles, which have been failing with great frequency."
"Not to mention Russian Army carefully going through, instead of cutting all water and food supplies from cities and THEN invade plowing through through any resistance, armed combatant or unarmed civillian"
"Indeed, people keep saying blitzkrieg has failed, but it took Hitler 6 weeks to blitzkrieg France with their troops out in the field and surrendering the capital with no fight, once the troops reached Paris. Here we have the Russian troops reaching the capital first day, lol. The only thing that stops them from advancing (apart from the fact that they have less troops than Ukraine) is that they can't leave big cities with strong Ukrainian garrisons behind, and at the same time they can't really take these cities without ruining them to the ground, which they are still trying to avoid (that's changing though)."
@Daniel Wall How do you know that? Did they tell you that on TV? Did you see it on the Internet? That's what worries me - overconfidence.
"No, it isn’t. Its become bogged down and lost any impetus it may have had at the start."
Putin killed many of his countries defenders and gave his neighbors free hardware and battle hardened soldiers. Lol. Putin is the NAZI.
Okay weed smoker
"While the rest of the world chokes russia financially and economically, ukraine is choking the russian military logistically. Madimir putin: ""Choke me daddy."""
Amazing video. I have learned more in 19 minutes than I have since the invasion began.
What a pile of garbage. Bravo!
you perfectly  described yourself
Russia needs to go back to being a defensive country.  Let the weather do the work… because their army sucks ass!!
Take out Moscow completely in one fail swoop that's the end of Lenin and His influence a few tridents should do it
Putin forgot that Rush B doesn't work in real life
Firepower doesn't mean jack if you can't move stuff to where it needs to go.
No it wasn't always like that the advertisements he's not mind what they were on and honestly it was better that way allowed way more content to exist

Gotta feel for those forced into war no choice just go and die or turn and get locked up for ever.
"Russia tried to conduct a blitzkrieg equivalent to what the Nazis did at the beginning of ww2, obviously some countries learned from history while others obviously didn't."
Who said? The Us took 2 month to take Mosul in a much smaller country
were is that accent from
"American lies never changes.
Europe politicians are US puppets, they dont care about their citizens they dont care about prices. They lying to people that dont need fear of war vs Russia when blindly building up tension with hostile anti-russian behaviour.
Russia already won vs entire united Europe 2 times in past. Dont think lies will help you in third time if you not stop your madness. In ukraine russian army minimizing civilian casulties that why it doing so slow and careful.
But we will dont if you force us to come to you. You not our brothers like ukraine people occupied by pro-american nazi. You will regret for everything you do."
"Russia and Target… big, red, and bad at logistics."
Bumm. Russian logistics failed. Is that in the advantage of US? That's the question. Hope it is.
12/03/22 Нам отключили новостные каналы спонсируемые государством. И Скорее всего в комменты придем мы.
You don't have a clue. Prayers for the Ukraine people. It is going to get a lot bloodier as Russia turns up the assault.
anyhow i still hope the russians love their children too!
I’m kinda surprised that the comments still open
Pssst... China... This might be a great time to invade russia.
"This is explained like your typical belic history documentary, but started 2 weeks ago."
Sounds like a European problem
I bet putin didn't read sun Tzu Art of War anyway great video
Outstanding!
"West is just too hypocryte . Created quarrel between Russia and Ukrain, ignored it for 8 fucking years, escalated it to the point of war and left UKRAIN TO ITS DEMISE JUST LIKE POLAND. THANK YOU"
"@Диас Исаев hitler acted differently when taking different areas. putin is treating this like hitler treated ares like the sudetenland, and not like how hitler treated say, poland or russia."
"Damn how much Antirussian propaganda. If Usa and Nato hates Russia, that just makes russian more sympathetic"
@Диас Исаев And who invaded the Donbass to start with?
"@Диас Исаев I dunno about the hate speach thing, shitting on Russian military action isn't the same as shitting on Russian people in general. To call this video anti Russian propaganda is a little disingenuous since it's a statement about their military seemingly struggling against a much smaller weaker opponent. The economic sanctions aren't just affecting your region, I live in Canada and we are having plenty of issues caused by way countries are economically trying to punish Russia. It is a shame people are lumped into the same pile even though they are a from a completely different country. I could have the same complaint when people refer to the ""west"" but they really mean the USA. Don't get me wrong, in this situation, the US is not the bad guys."
whats the bet putin is watching this rn and using ur information
Quando vinceranno e speriamo che vincano altrimenti ci sarà una guerra atomica cosa direte ...farete finta di niente?
I dont see them failing in logistics. I do see a lot of histerical propaganda about it.
"I think Putin was enormously emboldened by the disgraceful way western nations exited Afghanistan last summer. He probably figured the west was tired of war and wouldn't do much to counter a Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

As for Finland, Finns do not like Russians, period. Don't forget, as soon as the Germans invaded Russia, the Finns joined the Germans.  One of the reasons the Finns never got back the territory they lost in the 1939 Winter War, post-WWII, was that the Russians were on the winning side in WWII and not the Finns. Interestingly, despite the long border they share with Russia, only a small number of Finns even speak Russian."
Logistics is King. Kill the King. Win the war. Thousands of hungry Russian soldiers may end up walking home.
"Russia's mistake was being too kind, to minimise civilian casualties. They should have used the shock and awe method and bombed Kyiv back to the Stone Age. The method used by the Great Satan and its allies on Iraq. Wake up Putin, it does not pay to be nice in war. Pray to God, like Bush did and then rain missiles and bombs on them."
How civilized. Civilization is the grand art of getting along with others). Seems you skipped civics class.
"Brilliant , as a former street fighter it all makes sense I would never beat up dick heads , and smart mouth alecks further than one or 2 metres from the taverns front door so when I needed the resource of a quick pint I could run in and have a quick scull to tank up for round 2 😁 on a serious note Russias generals and Dictator comrade Putin will probably watch this over and over again to assess why they aren't winning and get some advice lol oh but wait You Tube has been blocked in Russia bummer 🤣"
"I used to like this channel. However, recently, I've noticed their tendency toward woke ""culture."" And this video is a pure fake news. So, please, keep running in the survival mode, but not at the expense of my time."
"Then don't watch, and go away."
Who blame this war nato or usa Ukraine for innocent people died.
"Yes, I see they are not carpet bombing in Iraq or Libian fashion."
well tо ве ноnеst маny оf russiаn trоoрs didn't еvеn knоw that they wеrе sеnt to wаr аnd nоt trаining аnd most of them just started training in the army so most of them 18 years old
"There maybe a more strategic way of beating Putin and Russia. The reason the United States lost the war in Afghanistan is that stupid G.W. Bush spread the American military too thin by opening up another war front in Iraq. The Russian military is not equipped to be spread thin. So we must support the Japanese to take over the Kuril Islands now. We must also support the Chenians, Georgians, and those in Belarus that are not pro Russian. Open up new channels of freedom fighting in these other regions to force the Russians to spread their military thin. This is the best strategy to win the war against Putin and the Russians."
This is the world leader equivalent of being a bad loser. Civilian lives... Pretty disgusting
"Idk man, did they really fail? We've been hearing for almost 2 weeks that it's going bad for them and then one of the talking heads says they still have 90% of their troops. The reports of unprepared Russians are greatly exaggerated"
"@Nightmare Potato true dat, but as time went on we started getting less and less accurate information.. so that's a change. Honestly I expected a big part of the country to look like Mariupol already, but that didn't happen so I must admit that I don't understand this war"
"Well, it's been a month since your comment and hardly anything has changed... Kiev hasn't fallen"
yes for now but those troops don't seem to be getting anywhere do they? they're running out of fuel and time
"In the West , you destroy completly the countries , then you walk on a pack of corpse 

I m not a bot , and i have a memory 

Try to explain to me the strategy in Irak, Libya , Yugoslavia etc etc , 

You can try i don t bite"
I disagree with what your saying as a whole because your really not putting everything into context. Even if what you say is 100% true without nuance. Does the west's wrongs make what Russia is doing ok? Isn't Russia just sinking to the evil west's lows?
"You totally overlooked 30 years of provocative broken promises and treaties on the part of the U.S. deep state, starting with Reagan's promise to Gorbachev that we will not advance an inch east of Berlin if you ""tear down that wall.""  You also ignored George Soros spending $5 billion to overthrow the Ukraine elected President in 2014.  You also  ignore the fact that Putin did not start rearming until the U.S. deep state unilaterally broke Reagan's nuclear disarmament treaty.  You also somehow overlooked Zelensky's oppression & bombing of Russians in East Ukraine for the past 8 years.

You project onto Putin all the aggression the U.S. deep state has been inflicting around the world for the past 30 years or more.  Which country has 750+ military bases scattered all over the world, U.S or Russia?  Which country is the only one to cavalierly  drop a nuclear bomb on a civilian city, U.S. deep state or Russia?   Which country insists on the Monroe Doctrine in its own backyard, but doesn't give a rip about anybody else's backyard, U.S. deep state or Russia?  Which country indiscriminately slaughtered tens of thousands of civilians in the Middle-East, U.S. deep state or Russia?  Which country has unprovoked bombed an average of one other country a year for the past 30 years or more, U.S. Deep State, or Russia?  

How do you spell hypocrisy?  Your assessment of incompetence, is reluctance on Putin's part to bomb civilians.  He's offered safe passage of civilians out of the cities, but Zelensky doesn't want to give up his human shields."
Do not mention Afghanistan to the American's and yes the USA are much better at indiscriminate killing of innocent people and we have the history to prove that.
"Afghanistan was a mess for Russians and Americans, that is true. What is happening now, Fluffy, is the Russians making a mess again."
"Ya ya ya...and still, they are winning while ""losing""...Like some one once said to me ""It is better to BE and NOT seem like you are, than to seem like you are who you cannot be""...Look poor, be rich. Look not so smart, be more intelligent then all...""Lose...and Win""...🤓
No one wants to take from the ones they do not know have...
So many ways to look at it, and still...come ahead of all...😎"
"Wait… isn’t using civilians to kill military personnel a war crime? Technically not, but it’s just murder, but in that case they are no longer covered under the Geneva convention, just a thought."
Great information! Nicely done!
haha ... fake news is what you are
How come Russia didn't bomb Ukrainian cities into dust?
Wow??1 This is a very one-sided propaganda hit piece riddled with some abject lies. Get your facts straight you liars-
"Can you lay out some ""facts"" for us? I'm truly curious your point of view."
Please keep in mind that this comments section is very likely to have disinformation actors/trolls due to the nature of this conflict. It's likely not representative of actual opinions.
"RUSSIAN TRANSLATION ::Из Канады: Если ваши информационные агентства смогут передать эту идею тем журналистам, которые уезжают из России, я твердо верю, что журналист может оказать огромное влияние на российских граждан, получая точные новости о том, что происходит в Украине, а не фальшивые российские новости. . Я предлагаю следующее.
Эту идею может сделать любой авторитетный источник из любой страны на границе с Россией. Самое приятное, что эти [флешки] прибудут на московскую землю без следа отправителя. Группа может отправлять миллионы флешек с новостными данными с гелиевых шаров и дронов, которые могут выпускать флешки в воздушное пространство над Москвой. Я убежден, что это был бы отличный способ достучаться до русского народа. 
Iz Kanady: Yesli vashi informatsionnyye agentstva smogut peredat' etu ideyu tem zhurnalistam, kotoryye uyezzhayut iz Rossii, ya tverdo veryu, chto zhurnalist mozhet okazat' ogromnoye vliyaniye na rossiyskikh grazhdan, poluchaya tochnyye novosti o tom, chto proiskhodit v Ukraine, a ne fal'shivyye rossiyskiye novosti. . YA predlagayu sleduyushcheye.
Etu ideyu mozhet sdelat' lyuboy avtoritetnyy istochnik iz lyuboy strany na granitse s Rossiyey. Samoye priyatnoye, chto eti [fleshki] pribudut na moskovskuyu zemlyu bez sleda otpravitelya. Gruppa mozhet otpravlyat' milliony fleshek s novostnymi dannymi s geliyevykh sharov i dronov, kotoryye mogut vypuskat' fleshki v vozdushnoye prostranstvo nad Moskvoy. YA ubezhden, chto eto byl by otlichnyy sposob dostuchat'sya do russkogo naroda."
"From Canada: If your news agencies can get this idea into the hands of those journalists leaving Russia, I strongly believe that the journalist can make a huge impact upon Russian civilians in getting accurate news about what is going on in Ukraine instead of fake Russian news. I propose the following. 
This idea can be done by any reputable source from any country on the Russian border. The best part is that these [flash drives] would arrive on Moscow soil with no trace back to the senders. A group can send millions of flash drives full of news data from helium balloons and drones which can release the flash drives in the air space over Moscow. I am convinced that this would be an excellent way to reach the Russian people."
Great job documenting!
"The cautious city philly fool because disgust surely frame along a boring club. even excellent excited, shaky beam"
"Hey Wendover I love your work. It’s really been a staple of my feed and I appreciate it a lot. I feel it’s important to bring up feedback because I want you to grow and do well long term. I’ve noticed over the years that’s your accent or YT video essay voice has seemed to have intensified significantly. I suggest toning it down by 50%, because there is such a thing as over performance to the point where it affects the listener as a distraction (and I’m sure many new unfamiliar listeners). I say this because your videos and research are really great but are increasingly difficult to listen to in the background. It’s a sort of droning pattern and it disconnects the listener from you. You seem less human and the content is chopped up quite a lot in the course of a single sentence. I think before I could listen to you as I drive but I found myself falling asleep lately so I can’t listen to your content on the road now. But more importantly, I think you should feel free to express yourself more naturally. Viewers will like you for your genuine speech, so you don’t have to worry about emphasizing and communicating to have a certain effect. I come here for the content, and your interest and work will make it self evident how interesting both the material and you are as a content creator. Hope I haven’t offended you. I’m sure you hear this a lot, but as a longtime listener it just has started to become a undeniable issue personally."
"I hope that the people in Russia who can sabotage this effort are doing so. This is why information is so important.  I doubt the people would support this war if they had all the information.. much like USAs last few decades of war, but that's not out problem today. I genuinely believe spreading information, and teaching people to think critically about information, is today's greatest challenge"
"@Myroslava Jacklitsch well, to be fair, when USA sent troops to Afghanistan 70%-90% of americans supported that war, so I guess it's not surprising that people have been convinced in the country that this is necessary. Doesn't make it any less disappointing.  I know it's a bit Doomer of me, but sometimes it feels like the worst thing about the information age is that we get to really see just how flawed we are as a species."
"Always to glad to see how some Angles and their servers treat people in Yemen, Somali, Tasmania, Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, eastern Ukraine...  (the list goes on, let alone the ""Good Indians"" in North America).  And suddenly, they all became peace lovers and cant wait to join their peaceful neo-Nazi friends in Ukraine."
"All sides of this conflict dont understand the reality of the world and situations. They don't study it in college, they don't teach what I know. I know it to be true without any doubt. You reap what you sow. Even if you silence and kill billions. Eternity has been around way much much longer than you. You will get what you sow."
"If Russia didn't have nukes, NATO would shit all over them for their little Ukrainian stunt. Russia's military is still stuck in Soviet times and look what happened to that shitty empire."
Fake news!
Russian bot
fking propaganga
Russian bot
so russia doesnt have propaganda?hahaha
"I have no doubt in my mind now that without WOMD the United States would destroy Russia, Ukraine is putting up a massive fight. I hope they can hold them off"
"Interesting bs, but no one knows exactly the full strength of their army at all. At the end of the day any country that thinks Russia’s army is weak should go and defeat them period otherwise they should shut up. You don’t help a country at war with talk and sanctions 5000 miles away. If you could fight Russia if they attack a Nato country then you can attack Russia now as well so why wait then? Why not sending any American soldier there? So far not a single country is helping Ukraine at all which is a clear sign of weakness from the west. If you cannot fight them then you should only prioritize peace and talks without threats and ridiculous sanctions. The west is weak since they’re afraid to fight cuz scared of nuclear which they have also. Btw What is the only country that used nuclear weapon against another? America!!! I trust Putin’s maturity on not using nuclear weapons more than I trust Biden’s."
I truly hope that for once evil looses and the russian government collapses before more people get killed for nothing. Its time for wars to go extinct once and for all.
"Although neglected in the media, the terror against Russians in Ukraine by pro-Western elites is being carried out continuously, systematically and pre-planned, in a somewhat milder form in the period 2004-2010. and escalates after the ""Maidan"" coup in 2014. Ukrainian political elites believe that the principle of territorial integrity, guaranteed by international law, gives them the opportunity to do whatever they want on the territory of their country.

Ideological followers of Nazism
However, modern international law, whose central document is the Charter of the United Nations, was built with the idea of ​​preventing the possibility of some ideological successors of Adolf Hitler being able to continue the work of their ideological predecessor. And they do not hide the fact that ideological followers of Nazism are in power in Ukraine: monuments to Nazi World War II collaborationist Stepan Bandera are being erected all over Ukraine, members of neo-Nazi organizations such as the Right Sector, etc. have an important position in power. neo-Nazi armed formations (like the infamous Azov unit) carrying swastikas and similar Nazi symbols. But the point is not on symbols: everything Russian in Ukraine is being suppressed, from language to all other elements of Russian identity, and in parts of the country where there is a greater concentration of Russian population, citizens' refusal to obey such authority has been punished by armed attacks by the Ukrainian army, most often to the civilian population, in which the aforementioned declared neo-Nazis play the main and most cruel role. It is estimated that about 15,000 people died in those attacks, primarily civilians. Attempts to peacefully resolve the status of the eastern parts of Ukraine, within the Ukrainian state, whose population self-organised into the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, did not bear fruit, due to the persistent refusal of the Ukrainian authorities to implement the 2014 and 2015 Minsk Agreements. In the end, when the offensive of the Ukrainian neo-Nazis against the Russian regions in the east began to escalate, the Russian Federation came to the aid of its compatriots, which until then had persistently but in vain supported the realisation of the Minsk Agreement. It recognised the two newly created republics and provided them with armed assistance, as the last resort, when no other was working.
After these events, the leading great powers of the West suddenly remembered the principles of respecting the territorial integrity of states, and a significant number of countries in the world, including Serbia, followed them to UN and abroad.

What does international law say?
What does international law really say? Does it protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states even at the cost of persistent, drastic and mass terror against parts of their population? Ie. hasn't it moved away from international law in the 1930s in this area? Of course not!
The fact is that modern international law protects territorial integrity in interstate relations, ie. prohibits one state from violating the territorial integrity of other states. Article 2, item 4 of the UN Charter proclaims the principle according to which ""all members (UN) in their international relations refrain from threatening or using force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state ..."". The CSCE Helsinki Final Act of 1 August 1975, an act of great authority but without binding effect, proclaims the principle of the territorial integrity of States and calls on participating States to respect the territorial integrity of each of the participating States. This principle is confirmed by a number of other acts.
However, the principle of territorial integrity is applied in a systematic way, together with other applicable principles of international law, including the principle of self-determination of peoples. This principle, which began to receive its special affirmation during the First World War, both in the USSR and in the USA (serving as a basis for the South Slavic peoples to leave Austro-Hungary and for their unification with the Kingdom of Serbia), was proclaimed in Article 1. paragraph 2 of the UN Charter, which states that one of the goals of the UN is ""to develop friendly relations between nations based on respect for the principles of equality and self-determination of the people ..."". About this principle, ie. the right of peoples to self-determination is also stated in Articles 55 and 56 of the UN Charter, as well as in other acts (including the International Covenants on Human Rights of 1966, and again the CSCE Helsinki Final Act, etc.). Interpretation of the content of this principle, as well as other principles of international law from the UN Charter, is given in the Declaration of Principles of International Law on Friendly Relations and Cooperation of States in Accordance with the UN Charter of Resolution 2625 (XXV). UN GA from 10/24/70. According to this act, the right to self-determination includes primarily internal self-determination, which means the right of the people to ""freely, without foreign interference, determine their political position and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development"", ie as a kind of right to democracy. But the self-determination of the people can also be external, which means the right to ""establish a sovereign and independent state, freely associate or integrate with an independent state or establish any other political position freely determined by a people.""

1970 Declaration
Of course, as this right is in conflict with the principle of preserving the territorial integrity of states, it must be interpreted restrictively and, according to the 1970 Declaration, is limited to only three cases. The first case is liberation by occupation. The second is the case of decolonisation. The third case, which is interesting to us here, is expressed by the statement that the principle of self-determination of the people must not be understood ""as approving or encouraging any activity that would violate or threaten, fully or partially, territorial integrity or political unity of any sovereign and independent a state which respects the principle of equality and self-determination of the people and which therefore has a government which represents the whole population of its territory without distinction as to race, religion or color. "" The word ""race"" (a term largely obsolete in modern science) should be understood here as defined by the 1965 International Convention for the Prevention of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which prohibits (ie, racial discrimination implies) discrimination based on on ""race, color, ancestry, national or ethnic origin"". Therefore, the people who have been denied the right to internal self-determination, according to the Declaration of 1970, have the right to external self-determination, that is. to secession. As this is the last medicine available to the people who found themselves in such a situation, this type of secession was called ""remedial secession"".
An almost identical provision to that of the 1970 Declaration is contained in the Vienna Declaration of the World Conference on Human Rights of 25 June 1993 and in the Declaration of UN General Assembly Resolution 50/6 adopted on 24 October 1995. on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the UN. The only difference is that in the two later documents mentioned, the words ""without distinction as to race, religion or color"" were replaced by the words ""without distinction of any kind""."

AMAZING analysis.
"I am not pro Russian by any means, but I have a need to comment, that this is such crap that it is laughable. 
First of all, because of tons of ""volunteers"" that this guy says are ""joining"" the Ukrainian army. 
In the first 3 days of the war, news were full of reports that Ukrainian army was stopping refugees on Ukrainian borders with Romania and Slovakia, and was forcing them to go back to Ukraine. And that men between 18 and 60 were being forced to join the army. That doesn't sound like volunteering to me. 
Those news magically stopped, about the same time that all Russian media were banned in all of Europe. In other words, the media filtering began 3 days after the war started.
Russian troops relied solely on paper maps, and entirely on analogue unsecured radio communications?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? 
I mean really? 
I am sorry but only an idiot can believe that. 
As i said, this video is such crap it is laughable."
"“In our minds we understand and strongly support your actions. But as women we worry about our families and loved ones who live in Ukraine. Why did this special operation begin? Could it not have been avoided? We are aware that civilians are not impacted. But still we would like you to reassure us, what is in store for us at the end of this road? What is the military operation in Ukraine supposed to end with? Thank you,” asked a Russian woman, 3.10.22 ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
“After the unconstitutional coup in Ukraine, Western countries spent US$5 billion supporting it, instead of bringing the situation back on track. They carried out a coup d’etat and the West supported the perpetrators. Crimea voted to once again become a part of the Russian Federation. We supported this..  In Donbass, people who began to resist these developments were persecuted. The Kiev authorities started conducting military operations on that territory. They attacked Donetsk with tanks and bombed its squares from aircrafts.. This was followed by the emergence of the Minsk Agreements. They showed the way to a peaceful settlement of this conflict.. They demanded the right to speak their mother tongue – Russian – and follow their traditions and culture. These territories were put under siege. From 13,000 to 14,000 people have been killed over these years. Over 500 children were killed or mutilated. The civilized West preferred to turn a blind eye… over eight years…,” said President Putin, 3.10.22 .……………………………………………………………………………………………….
Contradictions: (1) In 2014 Russia invaded independent Ukraine and stole Crimea. (2) Ukraine policed Donbass’ protesters. (3) “Of the alleged 13,000 to 14,000 people killed:  3,300 are civilian deaths, 4,000 are members of Ukrainian forces, and 5,500 are members of the ""armed groups/Russia-backed separatists,"" according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR. ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………"

“Lately, there has been talk about admitting Ukraine to NATO. If Ukraine is a NATO country, then in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty, all other members must support that country in the event of a military conflict. They carry out military operations in Donbass, and they will also move into Crimea, and we will have to fight with the entire NATO organization. Are the consequences clear enough? I think everyone here understands.” President Putin said.
“Now they are talking about acquiring nuclear weapons. We cannot ignore such things; esp. since we know how the West acts towards Russia. First, Ukraine has had nuclear competencies since the Soviet times. They are capable of launching such projects. They have missile competencies… And from that moment, Russia’s future will change dramatically. Our adversaries would not even need to have intercontinental ballistic missiles. They would be able to keep us at nuclear gunpoint and that would be it. These are absolutely real threats. And our young men who are fighting there are giving their lives; for our future, for the future of our children. This is a completely obvious thing. People who do not want to understand this, must understand that if they continue what they are doing, they will call into question the very future of Ukraine’s statehood. And if this happens it will be entirely on them…,”  President Putin continues, 3.10.22………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….
Contradictions: (4) Kiev regime wanted to be a part of NATO because of a threat of a Russian invasion; and to defend/re-claim their territory, including Crimea. [ Are the consequences clear enough? I think everyone here understands.] (5) Ukraine has no nuclear competencies. Ukraine, as a show of good faith and to avoid any Russian aggression, had surrendered its nuclear warheads to Russia. (6) Putin has threatened NATO of nuclear warfare if NATO helps Ukraine. Putin is the one holding NATO at nuclear gunpoint. [Putin’s fears are either LIES or absolutely real threats in HIS mind.] (7) Russian troops are invading an independent and sovereign state, Ukraine, for Putin. [This is a completely obvious thing. People who do not want to understand this, must understand that] (8) If they DO NOT continue what they are doing.., they risk losing their statehood…………………………………………………………………………………………………
We’ve been played. Europe, NATO, the Russian Federation, Russia, and the world… we are suckers…
And Ukraine paid the ultimate price…
On the other hand, he is an evil genius. There’s a little bit of Putin in all of us – in Ukraine’s Leaders, in NATO, in me…
He did what he had to do…  Now we must do what we have to do… Invasion of a nation of 44 million humans?..  Shooting non-military buildings?..  Game on..."
"At this point I no longer care about Russia, be it its leaders, owners, oligarchs or the useless citizens behind it, I just know Russia is already considered a stain upon this world and every sane nation considers wiping it clean, as it should be. There is absolutely no other way, diplomacy can only go this far and I tell you this, all russians supporting Putin, you'll go where you deserve very soon, and I mean hell. Russia is a tumour, its entire dogma embraces disinformation, propaganda and brainwash, after all this is nothing new, this is something THEY invented.
Meanwhile, we the people, just watch a LIVE war, we watch people's lives being destroyed and we literally do NOTHING about it, because some OLD FARTS singed a piece of paper some time ago, but we're not only watching the war crimes of Russia, we're letting it commit those crimes, f*cked up world  ain't it?"

2 years through alot of pain...
"While I highly appreciate this video, I'm a bit uncomfortable with the constant use of footage from the Russion ministry of defense. I mean, this is all propaganda footage, and more to the point, it is shot to show how shiny and well-organized their military is, thereby creating constant dissonance with the narration that emphasizes a lack of organization. I realize it's not easy to find appropriate footage for this kind of video, especially concerning its length, but this bothered me throughout the video, so I thought I'd share it as well-intended feedback."
"This is not a war so quit comparing it to America's wars. This is a special military operation and Russia is not using its full force because it wants to minimise civilian casualties. Remember this is Ukraine not a far away country, this is their neighbour and cousins. The goal is to surround the neonazi Azov battalion and other such battalions and once they disintegrate, the road to Kiev will be clear and the political establishment in Ukraine will negotiate. This is not one of America's regime change wars. And with all of America's capabilities, how come they were ran out of Afghanistan? A country with no army looool. The Ukrainian army is standing on its last leg and looking for a new provocation in order to get a no fly zone. It is when a no fly zone is imposed that you'll see what Putin has in plan for the hypocritical west. Why don't America spend this much energy analysing the American wars? maybe America will finally quit losing to barefoot dessert warriors if you ''experts'' start analysing the U.S. military strategy"

Propaganda at its best.  Maybe tell the truth about how Russia has acquired an enormous amount of US weapons  from the Ukrainians or that over 16k people around the world want to fight for Russia
"Good video, but you inadvertently spread some fake news: Russia has not yet used thermobaric weapons (which themselves are not illegal and Ukraine and US has them too). The ""increasingly destructive weaponry"" you showed at 16:58 is an ammo dump exploding. Russian doctrine doesn't use them for surgical strikes; they're area denial systems, which means they fire in unison to flatten an area of like 100x500m or so. Point being: if Russia uses them, we'll know because it would flatten entire suburbs or small towns."
"@RongSpeling I guess you have to prove they targeted civilians which is not easy since fighting is going through cities. Thermobarics and cluster munitions aren't illegal, only the latter falls under a geneva convention and Russia, usa and france didn't sign.
If Russia wanted civilian death,  we'd be seeing a much different picture from Ukraine right now. I'm actually impressed at their restraint, this is the country that carpet bombed Aleppo."

Unless you are a russian or ukrainian official, soldier, minister, goverment agent, you cant telll me anything. I am on no one's side. BUT NEVER BET AGAINST RUSSIA, seriously they won almost every war. Even a wars against japan, also when the US couldn' t defeat japan/force them to capitulate, they had to use nukes!? DID PEOPLE FORGET THE FUCKING FUCKING ON INOCENT CTIES. HALF OF JAPAN IN ASHES AND RUBBLE + two NUCLEAR ATTACKS, no i'd say the west is pure evil especially because they think their propaganda is fact and truth and you puople buy into it, unlike russia they just do what they do. We shoudl learn from them. And the US, with the Ukrainian Proffesor DIMITRI KHALEZOVS Submerge Nuclear Demolisio he designed FOR THE WTC incase HIGHER SKYRISES were build around the WTC the tower needed a perfect downwards freefall collapse, as they wer eextremely sturdy only a 12 second eggshaped cavity 78meter undergrounds 50meters below the foundations of the twin towers, and wtc 7 is destroyed because thats were the cintrol or delivery system was, no ASK ANY ENGINEER those towers cold never collapse in freefall like that from a fire, the reason you see the top f the building is because the Pulveerzization zone reaches only about 275 meters and the damaged zone reaches only about 320meters leaving the top oif the building kinda intact, so it looked like a collapse from the fire and explosiomn zones so it would look like that was the cause but in that case it should fall to the side and half of the building remain ask any fucking structural engineer, and watch Dimitri Khalezovs Submerged Nuclear demolision of the WTC
HE IS UKRAINIAN, and worked for the Soviets but Fled russia waaay earlier for good reasons. 9/11 was an inside job, and this war is proganda from both side to distract us from the truth of what is about to come"

"Russia is the first major military that is going of tanks and cannons warfare so what a fantastic moment to dispose all their outdated equipment with a bang. There is a pause only to see the worlds reaction and to see who and which country is playing this game and who falls out.

The main reason is to allow the evacuation on a humanitarian ground also two weeks are very short to make the common man worldwide to reach flashpoint due to fuel and daily consumables costs.

The issue will not be the remains of the Ukraine solders who surrender but of the foreign fighters who will be slaughtered due to the not POW status.
All the little toys that are being provided by the west and EU will be of no use against the new weaponry that Russian will now use.

No now i actually believe there's something to russia's attack and this video is just western propaganda.
I dont choose any side on this war, but anti-facism and anti-nazism, extreme left. Yes, that is me. But russia has some valid points atleast hey make it obvious that they propagandize whilst the westerners believe everything for example YOU are saying, fact based, bend over to your side. Russia went slower, not because of logistacal problem how can they have them when all their logistics are FULLY MOBILIZED JUST OUTSIDE THE border, they haven't even starrted yet. and you guys especially in europe, and i hope russia invades the netherlands and puts mark OPruttes heads on a stick which is also an Autocrat, rigging elections for 16years now, lobbying with the industry and the higher point of the pyramid the cabal, No this is just horrible. 3rd world war is about to begin FINALLY and i hope Leeuwardens airbase gets hit by a small russian cruise missile BYEBYE F35' s that netherlands spent trillions developing it, rather than getting eurofighters and actually make the country saver, the rimjobbed the US for support, but not financial support for the poor, yes there is poverty in the netherlands too but at a such extreme scale, yet their propaganda reaches into the minds of people, probably because they #2 jew exporters, !# vaccine enjection into children.

""" Tactics is for Captains, Logistics is for commanders (Generals) "" - Hernan Cortes

Soviets seem to have logistics. appearing out of nowhere within days in Egypt, Vietnam,Cuba and African countries like Congo.
provided the locals supports them they have sustained these operations.
I guess this time they need observers and advisers now. To point out things.
 unlike in the old Soviet days they were the advicers and observers.

sad for the Ukrainian since even with terrible logistics theyll be defeated by brute force. but brute force translate to destruction and civilian casualties."

"Doesn't even pronounce half the places right; and I don't just mean three-week old 'Keev' or rival dialects. 

Serious topic requires serious detail, Wendover. Failing it betrays lack of study immediately and reveals your ignorance. I may as well say America buys its gas in litres and profess myself an expert on the USAF."
shallow leadership and the fact that soldiers are puppets not warriors turned this war into a bloody pile of corpses Vladimir putting will have to carry for the rest of life
"Putin is almost 70 years old, that old dictator wants to do something to be remembered before dying. This war, no matter how it ends, will cripple russia's economy for the next decade.
so basically Putin is making the ucranian people suffer and the russian people. What a great leader"
"you youtubers sit in comfortable armchairs and believe everything you read on the internet. Russia is achieving its goal slowly but gradually....Ukrainian media take fake photos of the war every day. Fake attackers, fake photos from the Serbian war, fake personalities participating in the war, fake number of victims, etc....there are youtubers from ukraine who tell a completely different truth about all this !!!!!!!!!"
Why cant USA and Russia go head to head for war and no other small countries be affected! Anyways they are the ones making all frictions!
You think a full scale nuclear war between Russia and the USA won't affect all the other countries of the world?
Autocrat? Surely you guys meant to say Kleptocrat
"dude, your best video yet."
"Russia takes over Ukraine at a faster pace than Germany took over France in WW2.
Wendover: Let me tell you how Russia failed."
"incomparable. germany was facing a similarly equipped defense, a similarly sized opponent and had to go MANY MANY MANY times farther, through TWO MORE COUNTRIES to even get to france, while russia was already sitting with troops on the border a very short distance from Kyiv."
"This video is Western propaganda.
I expected unbiased videos, but guess I was wrong. Hopefully, there are still true historians left on Youtube who don't look at history in black in white like this channel does."
"@lifes40123 However, it has failed. He overestimated his own logistics and it is actively hurting his forces movements.

That 40 mile convoy going to Kyiv is mostly gone now, blown up or forced to disperse because they kept getting stuck. 

NATO is only stronger and more unified. Putin has now given memory for why NATO exists and is pushing Finland and Sweden to join as apporval polls go up. 

NATO's logistics are also much better, as they have been able to get all these supplies to Ukraine. 

So no, NATO is not at their weakest. Putin is just an idiot."
"""I don't like it when my biases are torn asunder. that's so unfair""."
"@lifes40123 He's talking mainly about the logistics though? Did you miss the title of the video? 

Russia's logsitics are currently terrible, Putin chose to invade during a global supply crisis and during mud season. Logistically this is a nightmare 2.0."
"@Rik Spring What Wendover doesn't even mention is how the Ukraine actually has a conventional military with well trained troops and modern equipment. That's the real reason why Russia is suffering severe casualties and setbacks. This isn't a 3rd world country that we're used to seeing Russia or the US invade. 
 I'm disappointed at how Wendover is just bashing the Russians instead of looking at who Russia is actually fighting.  That's why I call this propaganda."
Better than any news channel!
You make it sound like this is a failed Invasion when 190k Russian troops have nearly encircled the entire bulk force of the Ukrainian military on the eastern front.  This video will not age well.  Egging on resistance in the face of pure slaughter will be on your conscience.
"Putin going to  be ended up like Mussolini ,  Hitler....."
Ukraine is NOT A DEMOCRACY  !!
"yes it is, however russia is not."

"The war has changed since this video was posted, please continue to analyze and report as the conflict develops."
slava ukraini
you cant say that it took Russia more than 1 week to take over a country so its logistics failed. even the fastest invasion which was the blitzkrieg took 2 months.
Very well described.  Thank you for the clarity.

lmao this propaganda
"not trolling. This is a well considered analysis, but it ignores the elephant in the room. Logistics are always critical for successful ground operations, but two factors are at play which have been overlooked. Firstly, Putin has air supremacy as the airspace over the Ukraine has not been relegated a no flyzone; that is absolutely critical in the reluctance of the west to escalate Russian aggression. The second issue is Putin's willingness to not only target non-combatants, but also the use of thermobaric weapons and the potential use of nuclear weapons which would instantly invoke a western response in kind. The failure of ground logistics by Putin merely prolongs the invasion, but the video fails to mention how Putin intends on occupying and incorporating the Ukraine wholly into Russian territory. He will do that at all costs. If he determines the occupation of the Ukraine is taking too long he will end up resorting to the nuclear option after he has exhausted other means of conquest. Putin cannot afford to fail in his conquest of the Ukraine. His inner circle of cronies are just as adamant as he, and if he fails in the Ukraine, he will lose favour with the military who would stage a coup de tat. The U.N. or NATO or whatever the European combined military organisation is, has already made it blatantly clear that if Russia even impinges on 1 cm of European soil it will be met with lethal force. Just the slightest miscalculation by Putin or a wayward missile from Russia landing in Poland will result in far more horrendous action. Ukrainians are absolute champs, they're fighting with exemplary courage, stoicism and fortitude,  I doubt they'll employ a scorched Earth strategy. In that vein, the issue of logistics won't be such a big issue for Putin. The Russian military will just take everything they need as they progress through the Ukraine. But I admit I am unaware of how much supplies the Russians have at their disposal but I do know their weaponry surpasses that of the Ukraine. But if the Russians at least have enough fuel to advance far enough into the Ukraine to capture Ukrainian fuel supplies/depots/deposits, plus acquire Ukrainian transport, then that will alleviate much of their logistics issues. All the Russians need do is surround Ukrainian forces and lay siege to them. It took a while, but the nazis still managed to capture Stalingrad while woefully under provisioned; and with a vastly over stretched supply line. Of course I'm with the poor Ukrainians, only the most gruesome of sadists wouldn't be, but the reality is without western ground and airforces intervening, the Ukraine is lost. But by fuck I hope I'm wrong. But as I said, should Putin grow too impatient and infuriated by the failure of the Russian military, nothing is off the table. We may well be on the threshold of a nuclear apocalypse. Intelligence operatives in the know, know my comment is valid. Your argument isn't"
All youtube in this propagandonic videos))) Fakes factory))
If russia is getting crushed why are we wasting 65 billion to help ukraine secure their border...?

"putinoid mind too poor to organize logistics, Putkin's fingers too long to not steal from the army"
"Now the Ukrainians need to begin setting up IED's along the Soviet route, preferably command-detonated and targeted at groups of Russian soldiers, or fuel, ammunition, and food supply trucks. They should also set up huge broadcast speakers to keep soldiers guessing while spreading the truth about Russia's invasion. Leaving literature for Russian soldiers to read and think about might have some advantages too!"
This is all propaganda!!!
Usa welcomed Russians to Ukraine .Now Ukrainians pay the price.Sad
"Yeah, this is wrong. The U.S. is just using Ukraine as their puppet to engage in a proxy war. Even Trump was impeached for not wanting it. They wanted war since 2017 both democrats and republicans. We are not only fighting against Russia, but also fighting against democracy here at home."
all russia failed like a state by Putkin
You sound like that guy from half as interesting

The US seemed to forget...the Russian don't take a dump without a plan...paraphrased from The Hunt for Red October



The Senior Editor

The following information comes from a Russian intelligence briefing given at my request in Damascus as the entire US is under a 100% censorship blackout.

Note: Please email the text of this report to all contacts.  In the UK and elsewhere, the text is being scrambled by NATO hackers.

VT: Read the whole thing as it rambles a bit.  There are things in here that won’t be found anywhere else and of course this is direct from Russian intelligence.  This is what journalism is supposed to be.  Thus…we can’t attribute that everything here is true just that “they” said it.

Trump was our guy all along…just like the FBI told you….
Biden is heading to Saudi to meet with Bin Salman
He is afraid that Bin Salman will join Russia
Also Mohammad bin Naif might be dead check this intel
the Arabs categorically denied Biden an increase in oil supplies.
He was also denied by Venezuela!
The US and its allies were very wrong in their sanctions and real opportunities to exclude Russia from their technological and raw material supplies! After that. what the US did to Venezuela, they won’t even talk to Biden there!
Russian gas and oil are still flowers!!!! Berries will be ahead!
Russia supplies 90% of palladium for world electronics!
Russia supplies 80% of sapphire unique substrates for microcircuits – this is a unique Russian technology!
Russia has more than half of the patents in the Airbus project and half of the supplies of materials!
Russian steel is the main material for Europe, which cannot replace it with anything! Etc…….
Arabs will support only their own interests! At the moment they are very satisfied with the price of oil! They will not refuse such a golden rain! The United States has nothing to offer in return for such a gift of fate!
China is ready to buy all Russian oil and gas! So buyers in Europe are no longer interested in us in principle!
This military operation will allow Putin to solve a whole range of internal problems!
The issue with the Central Bank of Russia, which was under the complete control of the US Federal Reserve, will be finally resolved!
All comprador structures in Russian business will be rendered harmless! Russia will really begin to develop! You can’t even imagine what technologies Russia has that can be developed! The West does not even know how it has moved away from us! They don’t even know how to do it! A completely different technological and scientific paradigm is embedded in most Russian future technologies. The pro-Western policy of our oligarchs will be over!Russia got a real chance to start its rapid and active development!
The US has officially made it clear that they have a plan to replace Zelensky! He remains with them as a possible sacred sacrifice! They no longer need him – this impotent and clown. who only knows how to play the piano with his penis (there is a video with his number on the stage!)
A real modern war is a war of TOTAL and lightning-fast destruction and cleansing of the territory! Russia does not set such goals. This is a unique situation when the alleged aggressor considers the civilian population of the country to be his people and tries to protect them as much as possible! Nazi geeks do otherwise – they destroy their own people!
The US and the West need a new political paradigm and new goals and objectives for the 21st century! Otherwise, they will face complete extinction and degradation. Trump is not one of those politicians. He lives in the 20th century! He has no new ideas and understanding of the real future of the USA and the whole world! It is sad!
The general partner of financial boutique Matrix Capital Pavel Teplukhin believes that the Russian industry is waiting for even greater prosperity. He comments on the situation this way:
“The high-tech bubble must burst. […] And companies that represent the manufacturing sector should outpace the hype segments in terms of growth. In this sense, having the current structure of the economy, we should also generally be ahead of the developed countries in terms of growth rates, which largely climbed out on a high-tech hype. So Russia will have several years of good economic prospects ahead.”

The United States imposes a ban on the supply to Russia of electronics produced in any country in the world using American technology. According to preliminary estimates, the largest brands (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi) will lose about $10 billion a year.
In response, the Russian government is considering stopping the sale of neon to the West. On the one hand, this gas is just a by-product of the metallurgical industry. But it is needed for lasers in lithographic scanners that produce electronic chips.
90% of neon comes to the USA from Ukraine. But there it was only being cleaned. And they “mine” it in Russia.
The Techcet research group has released a report stating that semiconductor manufacturers are heavily dependent on Russian raw materials.
Against the background of the current geopolitical situation, the White House urged companies to look for alternative suppliers of materials, including neon. This is reported by Reuters. However, finding them will not be easy. The lines have already lined up for years to come. In addition, many are in China, which is also subject to sanctions.
The Voronezh plant “TyazhMekhPress” is a leader in the production of heavy presses for the automotive industry. TMP presses – with a force of 4 thousand tons. Their share in the world market is 50-60%.
In 2013, TyazhMekhPress manufactured the world’s first hot forging press with a force of 16.5 thousand tons. There are only 2 analogues – in Germany and Japan.
The Forges DE Courcelles plant near Paris purchased 7 TMP presses for stamping crankshafts for Audi, VW, Mercedes engines.
TMP machines also work at the factories of Renault and Peugeot, Toyota and Mitsubishi, Samsung, Tata Motors.
Another explosive topic is the fact that a military biological program is being implemented in Ukraine, funded by the Pentagon. As Igor Konashenkov recently reported, the Ministry of Defense received documentation from employees of biolaboratories about the emergency destruction on February 24 of pathogens that cause various diseases – cholera, anthrax, plague, tularemia and others. This was done in order to prevent disclosure of the facts of violations by Ukraine and the United States of the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons (BTWC).
The Russian media have long been sounding the alarm about the numerous biological laboratories in Ukraine (there are about 30 of them) supervised by the American Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).
In connection with their uncontrolled activities in different years in different regions of Ukraine there were outbreaks of atypical diseases, often with fatal outcomes.
According to a former member of the UN commission on biological weapons, microbiologist Igor Nikulin, the Americans are studying the characteristics of the immunity of the Eastern Slavs and creating new pathogens that are resistant to antibiotics.
US State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, speaking at hearings in the US Senate, admitted to joint efforts with the Ukrainian side to “prevent any materials related to these studies from falling into the hands of Russian troops.”
Meanwhile, officials from both Russia and China are demanding an explanation from the United States about the activities of 336 biolabs deployed by the Pentagon in 30 countries. In connection with the suspicion of a clear violation of international norms and the risk of biological threats to the population, Moscow does not exclude the use of the BTWC articles on consultations on these issues.
The Americans have obviously played too hard, imposing their own unacceptable rules for the free world on others, believing that the law is not written for the “hegemon”.
Deputy Chairman of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev predicts that the hour will not be long when evidence of Western support for neo-Nazi structures in Ukraine will be established.
This will not be the notorious “tube with powder” (translated from Russian), but facts that can radically affect public opinion and the assessments of what is happening by those in power in the West. To do this, it is necessary to carefully prepare the evidence base and ensure its delivery to the addressees.
As the special operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine advances, the Russian military gets documents that shed light on the far-reaching plans of the Kiev regime, which is closely guarded by Western curators.
Thus, the Russian Ministry of Defense publicized a document containing a combat order of the National Guard of Ukraine on preparations for an offensive in the Donbass in early March 2022.
Now it becomes clear why politicians in the West raised all the fuss about the impending Russian “invasion”: they demanded from Russia “to return the troops to the barracks” in order to untie the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the national battalions in Donbass.
According to the official representative of the Ministry of Defense, Major General Igor Konashenkov, the special operation of the Russian armed forces launched on February 24 thwarted a large-scale offensive by strike groups of Ukrainian troops on the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, which are not controlled by Kiev, in March.
Now it remains to be seen how much the US leadership and its NATO allies, who verbally care about peace in Ukraine, were involved in the planning and preparation of the offensive operation in Donbass.
The secret has become clear in regard to Ukraine’s plans to create its own nuclear weapons. The Interfax news"
So where is your video on why US failed in Afghanistan😂

"Putin helped Trump get elected in 2016. Trump returned the favor by withholding military aide to Ukraine (His first Impeachment).   After back stabbing our Allies the Kurds in Syria to Russia in his first term, Trump would not have resisted Putin’s war crime invasion of Ukraine like president Biden has (Go Joe Go!).  After victory in Ukraine, Putin would have had Russia pay off or refinance Trumps hundreds of millions of dollars in loans that are coming due this September (2022). Both Trump and Putin are traitors to their countries and are sadistic criminals! If you support Trump, you support Putin. Fox Entertainment is their Anti American mouthpiece."

Jesus came from heaven to earth to die on the cross and rise from the grave to forgive our sins. Jesus said to turn from sin and believe the Gospel for forgiveness !!! Only Jesus righteousness met the perfect standard of God. Because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. All have lied and stolen and looked with lust. The wages of sin is ( eternal ) death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Goodness existed before I was born. All goodness IS GOD.

does it look lke Russia is losing this war?
The russians ran out of toilet paper
russia coward heavy weapons Putin murdered
"It feels like an insane oversight that they would prioritize stuff like ammo and weapons over fuel and food. They are invading a place that uses the same ammo types and weapons as they do, so it's not like they are invading a place that uses NATO logistics that is mostly incompatible with their systems.

Everything about how they've conducted themselves in this war is just a comedy of errors. Initially I thought they were just trying to bait NATO into some prolonged conflict, with how intentionally provocative they were being with their strikes on civilians and all these other extreme violations of the most basic international laws, but now I just think they have made fools of themselves and crippled their economy, and not even achieved anything but uniting the exact alliance he sought to divide"
"Putin might have bitten off more than he can chew by trying to conquer the whole of Ukraine.
Maybe he should simply have occupied the Donbas region in the east where the people are very pro-Russian and would have welcomed him in."
Americans literally need to fly across the world to fight wars and I knew that logistics played a key role in it. This makes me appreciate how complicated logistics can get.
mostly by sea they have alot of large carriers
Huh....so the very same propaganda that convinced Russian soldiers that Ukraine was run by a hated government repressing its people also gave the average Ukrainian a very sneaky advantage in their resistance.
"Boycott of goods from China!!! Boycott of gas and oil from Russia? Who is feeding the Russian War and Army?

Boycott of goods from China!!!"
Corruption corruption corruption.
"I find it strange that in preparation for the war, they haven't built or bought a gas station supplier in Ukraine. That could be now serve as their backbone in the country."
"I honestly do not understand why western analysts thinks Russian invasion has failed. Ukraine is the second largest country in europe with about 45 million population and army of 200K solders with plenty of tanks, APCs rocket launchers and all kinds of tech, plus stingers and javelins provided by US and UK, alongside with other guns provided by other countries. US has Conquered Irak in 41 days, the county that is much smaller and was way less prepared for a war then Ukraine right now. On which grounds have you decided that Russia planned to take Ukraine it 3 days and then when it has not managed that, you think it has “failed”. It was never a plan."
"And I still wonder why everyone calls it ""invasion"". I'm neither pro-Russian nor anti-Russian, but Ukrainian Neo-Nazi (not Ukrainian army) shot first at civil Ukrainians back in 2014, so not Ukrainian civils but government (especially Zelensky) made a hell from land. Nobody even tried to do anything with that, and now this, forgive me for my English, shite our Russian army should dig out as like as Soviet army did in 1941-45...

I know that for someone (mostly – Ukrainians or wehraboo or both of them) it will sound monstrously, but I appreciate Russian army as like as American or other country's army and I somehow agree with president, although there are several questions in different spheres like entertainment or employment.

And I agree with you, that Ukraine had substantially large army in Europe, but there's difference in strategies. Russian Forces made a quick strike in first hours of ""special military operation"", taking out several military facilities, which made a little shock effect on Neo-Nazi and Ukrainian army too, and they have changed strategy – they use civilians as human shield. Russians act then carefully, unlike US or UK (I'm not sure if UK uses ""Scorched Earth"" strategy or not, but I can consider more like at 55%): they do not, in common words, kill civilians, but Nazi. 

So, the morale here is not weapons bring outcome of conflict, but the knowledge how to use it."
"Putin should have invaded American style, right? Flatten the country with never ending bombing runs, right? Why didn't Putin do that?"
because putin still haven't been able to establish air superiority
"Because American style is thirst of blood. No offense, it's true."

Well the USSR invaded Afghanistan so according to your logic the Afghan invasion by the US was acceptable right? Or does your logic only work one way?
So countries with an imperialist past should never be able to criticise or object to war crimes being committed? That’s really stupid.
"As a former Czech army logistics officer who served (exercised) with UK's Royal logistics school, US marines, AUT and HUN officers (2003-2013) I do appreciate this highly informative and well-made video. It clearly covered almost all important aspects of field logistics and precisely revealed the massive difference between contemporary and post-soviet logistics. Honestly we did not even put into consideration Russia into any of our scenarios. Everything was focused on expeditionary logistics, rapid staging and onward movement based operations on distant territories. Who would have thought... Former eastern-block countries, Ukraine included, have a deep understanding of post-soviet technique, its strengths and weaknesses. This war clearly shows that Russia's Achille's heel is not just logistics but the people part as well. Confused and incompetent commanders, weak tactics and absence of common sense... then committing war crimes and atrocities when hungry and frustrated. This war is a complete misery at its worst."
"@nilloc93; Sir, Russia has never followed ""The Geneva Convention"" or the International rules of war, never had, never do and never will. Their doctrine is based on causing the most damage posible,(leveling the enemy's Country literally), to Military and Civilian Infrastructure including Innocent Civilians and then try to force them to surrender. A ""Special Operation"" that was going to be over in 48 hrs has put Russia to shame, it's been 4+ months and they're not even close to complete, Russia has been underestimated for 70+ yrs, they're just a Country that is guided by a thug with nuclear weapons. Guess what?, the Ukranian people know too well that is better  to die fighting than to live on their knees. Ukraine will be to Russia what Stalingrad was for Germany in WW2. When Your soldiers loose ""the will to fight"" Your Army will be ""combat innefective"", Mr. Putin should've cut his losses and go back to his Country long time ago so he could save himself and Russia the shame of his actions and crimes committed against humanity just like Milosevich in the former Yugoslavia. Let's hope that he's not stupid enough to use ""nuclear weapons"" just because he thinks that he's the only one that has them unless he's suicidal. Let's hope that he has a moment of reason and stop this madness.
To the Ukranian people:
Keep hitting the invaders back to their Country. Keep up the good work. 
Surrender is not an option!."

Time for the ignorant world to realize a higher power, much higher God Almighty is at work due to all the christians praying for Ukrainians.  Praise God."
"Life and war are like a game of chess, how you play it determines if you win or lose! It's time we use checkmate moves on Putin and Russia that will result in the ending of the war in Ukraine! Join the plan that will immediately end the war in Ukraine! It's time the world unite and force Putin and China to end Putin's destructive rampage across Europe. Everybody in the world needs to unite and not buy anything at all from Russia and it's partner in actions China! We will also boycott Walmart which is China's sales partner in the world, especially here in America! Walmart to me is just Walley's Junk Mart or Little China Mart for most of the stuff sold there seems to be made in China. 
   So along with boycotting Walmart until Walmart stops selling products that are made in China we ALL are going to Walmart by the THOUSANDS at every Walmart store in the world and fill their parking spaces and wander for hours throughout Walmart stores looking for products to buy that are not made in China! Perhaps then we will fill up your lines at registers and ask a bunch of questions about everything in your store and perhaps buy a very inexpensive food item to munch on as we stroll on out of your China sales outlet! 
   Once China and Wally's Little China Junk Mart start seeing their sales and profits disappear before their eyes then they both will bark at Putin and force Putin to stop his war in Ukraine! Are you with me everybody! Head to Walmart and shut it down and shut down China's exports to the world!     
   Putin and China think that just because they have bigger  and or more weapons than those they oppose in disputes and conflicts of war as in the wars in Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam and elsewhere that Russia or China     has started but the world has bigger weapons than Putin and the world's weapons aren't the explosive kinds that Putin brags about and uses as he bullies his way wherever he wants to go. Kick Russia and China out of the World Trade Organization and the war would END!!!!!!!!!"
Great video. I wonder if the Russians will learn from your observations and be more effective in the next waves of attacks. I just hope they won't actually watch this.

"The title of the video should have been ""How Not To Launch Invasion Of Ukraine With Crappy Logistics""."
"Sure. Logistics.. Not the fact that Putin's holding back and only using 10% of their firepower in order to minimize casualties... This is propaganda and the most stupid kind, implying the russian army hasn't evolved since the soviet union... Who believes this shit?"

I don't support this war but I don't like propagandist hypocrisy either."
"@DE J I addressed logistics in another comment. There’s in fact little to discuss.The fact that it’s important is as old as war itself. Besides, what’s presented in the video has not been independently verified by a neutral party so it’s futile to say anything about it. Suffice is to say that war is messy; things can and will go wrong. Nice try moving the goalpost."
@DE J What is rubels? lol
"@Dee Vee just to point at another reason why all you have is whataboutism, you didn't even in the slightest try to address the actual arguments about logistics that the video put forward. ALL you did was go ""but but USA did something bad"""

"@Stubie I am not sure if you are serious or not. Do you know about the war in Ukraine? The Russians invaded 2 weeks ago. They have captured about 40% of the country. They have surrounded a very large Ukrainian army group in Donbass. They have taken a number of port towns along the Black Sea coast, and surrounded others. The Ukrainian air force and navy has ceased to exist. They have done all this without inflicting or suffering particularly high casualties. They have also been able to avoid destroying the infrastructure; Ukrainians still have water, electricity, gas, cellphones, etc. (that must really piss off American military planners who like to bomb the beejeezus out of everything until the rubble bounces...). Does this sound like the Russians are losing?"
@Stubie well obviously not the propaganda war.
Winning what?
"Hello. I'm from Russia. Sorry for my English. I want to say that not everyone supports this war. We are trying to do something, but people are very intimidated. We are even forbidden to call it a war (it should be called a ""military operation""), and there are prison terms (up to 15 years) for speaking out against the war. And I still go to protests. A lot of people are suffering because of the war unleashed by Putin. I hardly sleep, hardly eat, and cry all the time. I often think about ending my life. There are more and more bans on freedoms... I hope we get out, and I hope the Ukrainians will defeat Russia. And what will happen to us is no longer so important ... FUCK WAR! ХУЙ ВОЙНЕ!

how do the eastern european collectivist values influence their wartime actions
"Not only the logistic or strategy, but some Russian soldiers don't even know they're invading Ukraine at the begining, lack of fighting spirit and feel of guilt.
On the other hand, all Ukrainian have the same goal, purely want to protect their home!
Mentality can always bring a human being's power to another level"
Amazing work thank you for helping us stay informed.
As a swedish citizen I am off the mind that Europe as a whole has no stake or need to be part of this war and nato is an American puppet so even less of a reason for Europe to join  EUROPE has been in over 200 wars I think Europe should just pull out say no to nato and ukraine say no to Russia and america when they ask for any military or weaponized support or any military presence to many times before have Europe payed in fire and blood basicly Americans and nato can take the there article 5 and shove it any true or bonafide European would share the sentiment that we are sick of war when it has not even been a decade since we earned our watch full peace
@Yoga Jedi do not be so cynical there is always hope
@Stubie wrong we would not need to fear if we in Europe made it a point to militarily stay out off nato and stay out of wars or conflicts that are on going in some parts in our world
"That is why everyone wants to join NATO, including most Swedes, so that they do not end up attacked by despots."

"Very interesting. But you forget something, in Ukraine there was already a puppet government (de facto completely dependent upon and subject to orders from US and EU). Of course, from your point of view the US and EU can have puppet states, but Russia cannot. Secondly, the war started 8 years ago, by the Ukrainian (pro-fascist government) against the Donbass ukrainian people. So, 8 years later and after +15 thousand killed residents of the region, Russia decided to intervene. 8 years trying to find a peaceful solution, with the help of the Minsk agreements. 8 years watching how the US and EU do nothing more, than sending weapons and military aid to Ukraine. Sorry, but Russia didn't start this war, will finish it."

“America... goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all.”
— John Quincy Adams, 1821 
Dear Americans! Your Russian enemy is here, and now I am going to tell you everything you need to know about the war in Ukraine.
Once upon a time, seven centuries before America had been discovered, a nation called Rus’ was formed on the Russian plains with its capital in Kiev. As time went on, this nation-state entered a period of feudal fragmentation (go ask your European friends  what does it mean). After reuniting the country the seat of power moved to Moscow (as sometimes happens, to which your German friends can attest), and then to Saint Petersburg. NB: the people of Russia were united throughout this entire period, and neither Ukrainians nor a Ukrainian government existed until the Communist Revolution of 1917. There were only Russians, a people consisting of three subethnic communities: Great Russians, Little Russians, and Belarussians.
In 1917, Vladimir Lenin seized power and declared that the peoples of Russia have the right to self-determination, going as far as allowing them to separate from the state. The sub-ethnos of Russians that were known as Little Russians suddenly became independent Ukrainians. A noble cause, you say? Keep in mind that Lenin didn’t ask any of these nations whether they wanted this principle to be realized; not a single referendum was held, nor were there basic surveys conducted. Thus, in this unilateral manner, driven by the whims of a single man, Ukraine was created as one of the Republic of the Soviet Union. In this republic the people were forced to study the Ukrainian dialect and had to call themselves Ukrainians. Those who refused lost their jobs and those who continued to refuse were murdered. Half of Lenin’s Ukraine consisted of purely Russian regions – the entirety of the eastern and southern parts of the newly-formed republic. 
The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and independent Ukraine appeared (for the first time in history). A state cult of Nazi collaborationists emerged immediately in this newly formed Ukraine. Ukrainian guerillas joined up with radical Muslim terrorists, who later launched several terrorist attacks on our Russian metro. At this point a third of the Ukrainian population was still ethnically Russian and the majority of the population of Ukraine considered Russian to be their native language.
However, the Ukrainian government did not give up. They set on eradicating education conducted in Russian. Why? Well if the majority of the country was Russian, then what could possibly justify Ukraine’s existence? This question fermented in the minds of all Russians and Ukrainians throughout the state’s history. Meanwhile, corrupt oligarchs and the government knew the true answer — to freely rob the Russian/Ukrainian people. Both the elder and the younger Bidens clearly understood it and the latter found himself comfortably employed in a cushy position at the Burisma Holdings.
And just like that 42 people were executed and burned alive in Odessa. All across Ukraine  Russian activists were beaten, thrown in Ukraine Security Service’s torture chambers, massacred in the streets. We are not complaining to you because this is not your war, Americans, but you have to understand exactly whom you are defending.
Russians of Donbass region took to the streets to rally peacefully. Ukrainians crushed these rallies with APCs, quelled them with gunfire. Peaceful rallies turned into an armed uprising lasting eight years. All those years the Ukrainian government constantly shelled Donbass, killing Russian civilians en masse and murdering children. Just ponder on this for a moment: Ukraine killed 13,000 people prior to the start of the Russian operation.
Diplomacy failed. Every agreement regarding Donbass was thwarted by the Ukrainian side. Ukraine was not prepared to give the Russians of Donbass neither the right to speak their native language, nor to bear the name of their nation, nor even the basic right to express their views. The only thing that Ukraine wanted to do in relation to Donbass was to take it over by force, to murder all dissenters, and to secure its resources. 
In fact, you already are and you will continue to pay. You will pay for it at your gas stations and at grocery stores, at your homes and yes, even in space. But what exactly are you paying for? You pay for the right of Ukrainians to murder people for their ‘unpleasant’ nationality. You will freeze at home because you have traded comfort for the flames of death camps for Russians. You will drive less and at a greater expense so that the Ukrainian Nazis may murder more children. You will eat less and spend more so that your corrupt President may supply arms to people who cower behind human shields. Your dreams of colonizing space will fade away so that the fighters of Nazi battalions may continue to commit war crimes. Right now they are shooting civilians in the back for attempting to flee beseiged cities. They kill, torture, and skin prisoners-of-war alive. They bomb residential areas. You will pay an enormous price for taking sides with injustice and lies.

Stellar work brother
"I think you're very premature on this topic.  And, I'm far from certain that the message being circulated through Western media outlets that Russia's invasion plan has failed is not itself a touch of propaganda.  If Russia has indeed found itself in a quagmire in Ukraine, then this is something that will need far more information to explain fully - the kind of information that will not emerge immediately, but, rather, afterwards when the stakes of releasing such information to the general public are not so high. For instance, do you really know that the EU/NATO/Western allies are not quietly turning Ukraine into a proxy war?  They would not be able to do so openly without risking provoking direct conflict with Russia, but it urgently in their interest to do so - to implement a new policy of containment."
"The nuclear power sites in Ukraine Netishyn Pripyat just like every nuclear power plant in the world has a Railhead that would service those Nuclear Plant. Bringing in and taking out material what is that would be fuel rods spent nuclear material or anything else that plant would need. In my opinion why the Russian forces were taking the nuclear sites at Netishyn Pripyat it's true they have a Railhead in which they could use for their movement of equipment because those would be very well equipped Rail Yards that you put off load and have a Depo for your equipment and the ability to turn their locomotives around to hook back up to the other end of all the train cars to head back out and resupply. You mentioned that the Russian forces have a very large presence in the railroad industry. You mentioned 20,000 of the 21,000 locomotive engines in Russia are owned by the government unless the Ukraine is willing to take out railroad Bridges taking out tracks will only be a temporary setback because the Russian military has been means to fix repair and put back into service any rail line that has been disabled. Taking a bridge down is the only real way to ensure that the Russian military will not be able to use that Railroad and I don't know how many bridges they have or how willing they are to blow them up at this point. The significance of taking the nuclear site whether that be decommissioned for the largest nuclear power plant in Europe is not for the power plant itself nor the material. The ability and capacity of the railyard and Railhead at those sites is the Strategic and Tactical objectives in trying to secure those and the other nuclear sites in the Ukraine because it gives them the ability to get their tanks and heavy equipment into the Ukraine without going through an enormous amount of fuel and being exposed to the Ukrainian military and National Defense Force who seems to be very well equipped with anti-tank weapons that would not be such an issue on a train that's just my opinion because Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. Having that stockpile means you have the largest stockpile of nuclear material that is weapons-grade power plant grade nuclear material will be refined to 20% maybe 30% depending on that plant. If you want weapons-grade nuclear material for putting into a nuclear bomb it needs to be refined to a 90% purity and that takes an enormous amount of energy time and centrifuges which does not make any strategic sense for Russia to be going after that material when they already have the largest amount of weapons-grade nuclear material what they don't have is the railroad and Railhead capacity in Ukraine. In case anybody doesn't know what are Railhead is it is somewhere that has the ability to take the locomotive 180° so it is now facing the other way which is vital especially in a conflict like this to be able to turn your locomotives around hook back up to the other end of the rail cars so they can repeat the cycle"

"Well, another piece of propaganda working hard to make russians look like dumbasses...  Didn't expect coming from this channel"
"@Roita Barrett Wow, this conversation is surprisingly calm. And polite. Am I still in the YouTube comments?"
"@Alexander Stavroulakis no offense taken. Of course, you can always have a last suspicion, its legit. It would be long a tedious to discuss in a proper why It is propaganda. Shortly, the game with images and narratives, the inperialistic presumption (no one knows which is the final goal) to work in the ""evil"" image of Putin (of course Putin its a evil character, but the geopolitics are far broader), the protrait of ukranians battlefronts as normal brave inocent people (nazis exist. Of coure, there is not the only thing that exists). The repeat and repeat of the word ""logístics"" and only a few facts (the truck number and the... ""Logistics leads strategic""? That was strange and subtle way of saying that the russians dont know how to adapt to ""real world situation"". This last sounds even as an indirect insult.) I dont know, doesnt look like good research work.

Of course, you are free of considering me propaganda. But I think I made clear points that u can just check."
"@Roita Barrett No offense, but ""efficient"" is not the word I would use to describe most of the Russian army's decisions/logistics/strategy.

Also, how do I know what you're writing is the truth while this video is propaganda, and not the other way around?"
"@Alexander Stavroulakisas far as I am concerned, the truth is that they get some humiliating defeats in puntual cases. Then, they slowly but efficiently are advancing while cutting strategic railroads (now they are getting close to Kiev from the east). In urban territory are going to wait until the civil evacuation (which is not some ukranians groups want as they work as human shield). All of this, without using all the militar capacity that they had in the frontier.

While this is happening, the propaganda is: 1) oh the imperialist russians didn't see coming the bravenes of the ukranians (and, like in the video, they will put images of ""normal"" people and not soldiers; 2) Putin is a very irrational narcisistic psycopath with a red button, 3) russia is going to internally colapse. All this 3 points (mainly, the 3 one) are, in the current, situation very very cuestionable. Don't forget that there is absolutely no alternative to russian gas for europe (for usa its easier: now Venezuela its not a bloody dictatorship)."

"It still seems to me that Ukraine is doomed. The Russians logistical capabilities will catch up with strategic requirements while ground forces hold on to the existing gains made and the airforce continues to exercise full superiority over Ukrainian airspace. Engineers will repair rail connections and logistical chokepoints will become a top priority for the invading forces. Once the Russian war machine comes into full swing I'm afraid there will be no stopping it. This will probably last till the summer and end in complete Ukrainian capitulation. But we shall have to wait and see, maybe the Ukrainians will come up with something. I pray the conflict won't spread further and turn into a hot conflict with NATO, in this event the entire world is doomed as there can be no winner there. God help us all."
This is why the US military is so powerful. They focus on logistics first.
Now do one on US funded bio pathogen labs in Ukraine.
You got any sources on that?
"Imagine invading a country with the intention of expanding your borders, then wondered why nobody likes you."
"Because Putin is absolutely terrified that his people will look next door to Ukraine and say.. ""Hey, we'd like some of that freedom and prosperity"".   I hope Russia gets its ass handed to it."
"Well, USA, UK, NATO is doing same thing, murders EVERY DAY in the name of democracy( OIL), i dont approve killing of innocent people, but open your eyes!"
"Ok, so why does Putin get the right to start a war?"
a lot of propaganda to discredit Russia when in reality we know Russia is fxckin up Ukraine
Uhhhhhhhh there’s a war????????
"this butthead doesn't talk about why people revolted against the autocrats in Kiev... the CIA overthrew an elected government and installed their own junta.   Think you can alienate 50 percent of the population and not have repercussions, huh... they are a small junta, comprised of oligarchs and wanna-be oligarchs that are paying Hunter Biden to do a job he isn't qualified for even when he is stone-cold sober"

This is fake news. Compare supply truck mileage against the rate of advance. The invasion is on schedule.

"If you think about it Russia's biggest threat in this conflict is not Ukraine after all if everything fails they can just nuke the nation and be done with it, the biggest threat is the fact that now everybody knows that you just need to hold on for some 5 days after which you can take a breather and properly think about what to do."

"Важная информация! Из заявлений народа:
Гнусные поработители преступного руководства в России терроризировали украинский народ с начала 2000-ых годов, Украина не собиралась вступать в НАТО.
Во время российско-украинских учений 2001 года преступное руководство России подстроило перепад электро-напряжения некими спецсредствами, по этой причине перенаправили ракету и сбили пассажирский самолет.
В России есть свидетели в отношении которых в это же время психологически воздействовали такими же перепадами электро-напряжения, после разоблачения коррупции в ФСБ.
Путин В. в начале 2000-ых не раз заявлял: Они пустили к себе в дом сотрудника внешней разведки.
В Тюменской области (в нефтяном регионе) погиб начальник УМВД генерал Недоростов П.М., его убили током, во время расследования коррупции связанной с Москвой.
Преступное руководство России отравили Президента Украины Ющенко, об этом не раз говорили все средства массовой информации. В России не мало отравили депутатов и других деятелей…
Умышленно воздействовали на украинскую экономику с начала 2000-ых годов, создавая им сложности жизнедеятельности.
Также умышленно терроризировали Украину непомерной ценой на газ и требовали немедленно оплатить.
В России нет законных выборов, по центральному ТВ ложная пропаганда, политика, как у ИГИЛ или фашистов…
--
Противоправное руководство России, нарушив договор аренды и угрожая оружием, захватило Крым на территории Украины, вооружают и поощряют терроризм на украинской территории.
Преступные лица в руководстве России запретили миротворцев ООН на захваченной бандитами территории Украины.
Сегодня преступное руководство России цинично напало на Украину.  
Народы требуют рассмотреть преступное руководство России в Международном трибунале, привлечь негодяев к ответственности, это и будет безопасность. Данные злоумышленники терроризируют другие страны, вооружают террористов, убивают сотрудников правоохранительных органов, убивают политиков, не уважают народы, они против законных выборов, преступно обогащаются, грабят народ, несут порабощение…
- В настоящее время выявлены новые преступления Путина В. в России и в других странах, теперь этот злоумышленник, боясь ответственности, идет на всё, чтобы продлить свое преступное правление…
Из заявлений народа:
Стыдно за Россию, продажные фашисты или террористы на российском телевидении, чем ближе разоблачение этих негодяев: Соловьева, Скабеевой, Михеева и подобных, тем громче эти мерзавцы кричат...
Преступники обманывают народ, как малограмотных. Народ в России страдает от преступного правления, а эти продажные негодяи, как полицаи у фашистов.
Украина защищает свою страну и народ от порабощения.
Из заявления:
Все народы объединяйтесь, т.к. в России банда преступников захватила власть и несет порабощение другим странам…
Московское бюро по правам человека обоснованно заявляет о разгуле нацизма в России. «Как оказалось, именно Россия – абсолютный лидер в мире по численности неонацистских организаций и ее членов. 
Фашизму дано такое определение: идеология воинствующего расизма, антисемитизма и шовинизма, опирающиеся на не политические течения, а также открытая террористическая диктатура одной господствующей партии, созданный ею репрессивный режим, направленный на подавление прогрессивных общественных движений, на уничтожение демократии и развязывание войны. Следует отметить в России насчитывается 53 националистических организации из них 22 радикальные и 8 запрещённых, согласно последним данным неонацистские движения России насчитывают до 70 тысяч человек, а это более половины всех неонацистов мира. 
При этом националистическая (шовинистическая) идеология исповедуется и насаждается в России не только бритоголовыми маргиналам, но и людьми во власти или при власти, с весьма высоким общественным статусом, такими (навскидку), как Д. Рогозин, А. Дугин и Д. Киселев… 
Из заявления: Руководство России и подкупленные прислужники ведут себя цинично, не уважают народы и права человека. 
Когда на Россию напали фашисты, то США, Франция, Великобритания и другие страны помогали России всем в борьбе с оккупантом-поработителем, сегодня они помогают Украине, которая защищает свою страну и народ от порабощения. 
В России ложная пропаганда, заявления Прохоровой А., Соловьева В. и подобных близкие к тем, что когда-то фашисты Германии говорили о России… 
Украину защищает все мировое сообщество, если преступное руководство России нападет на Украину, то санкции введут на уровне ООН, а это очень негативные последствия, т.к. с Россией не будут иметь отношений ни одна страна в мире, пока не освободят все оккупированные территории.

Мнение народа и мирового сообщества:
   Россия по договору арендовала территорию Украины на Крымском полуострове, но власть в Российской Федерации была захвачена бандой преступников, которые, нарушив договор и угрожая оружием, захватили данную территорию. 
В Крыму большое количество жителей невинно содержится в тюрьмах и в концентрационных лагерях…

Reemember that USA lost all wars they fought"
USA lost WWI? WWII? Lost Iraq?.. reality is the US hasn't militarily lost a single war since the 1800s. and as this video is about logistics.. US logistics saved the USSR during WWII.
For me this video is the first detailed report of Ukrainian resourcefulness in the face of this invasion as well as some indication of indoctrination of Russian troops.

please can someone update me with the news ( in replies )"
Looks like russians are bad speedruners lol

"It does not matter if Russia fail to deliver the ultimate punch, what matter is why Zelenskky brought demise to the Ukrainian by accepting President Biden and Nato promise of membership when Putin have warned to stay neutral. How did President Biden and Nato response? Nothing, in fact they turn to the other cheek."
"@Lykos Lt its probably multiple factors which at this point make it very difficult to tell what anyones true intentions are. To focus on one, especially one that relies on assuming putin is out for himself doesn't make sense when considering he has damaged economic and political relations with other nations. Is he insane? That wouldn't be fair to label someone insane just because we dont understand why they do something.

He obviously knew he could do this invasion regardless of who intervenes directly or indirectly. He knew germany cant live without buying russian natutal gas (they still are right now). You can see the effect right now on your local gas station. And when gas goes up: everything goes up in price, they even control nickel, a valuable resource for making batteries in electric cars. Look at the countries the U.S. is now having to negotiate with to secure a new source of oil from (i was actually suprised we were using ruskie oil): we have the saudis who told us to buzz off, venezuela is rubbing its hands and ready to gouge the us in prices, and the iranians who we may or may not be lifting sanctions on their nuclear deal in order to access their oil, and its neighbors china and india dont seem to hate them with india getting military tech from the ruskies and getting their citizens out of besieged cities in ukraine. All of these nations more likely to side with russia due to recent history.

We see mostly the western worlds perspective on these issues, but the rest of the world sees something completely different and frankly we look like a joke, and its going to get worse

We obviously mostly see the w"
"@Lykos Lt theyre a buffer state for both sides, if it starts siding with either then the other will have reason to feel threatened and would attack. If ukraine sided with russia, hypothetically, would you feel the same about a NATO country invading ukraine since part of the motivation of the invasion is to stop a buffer country from siding with their opponent.

Im not going to try to use the cuba argument since people seem so adamant that its not the same or something, and all im going to say is that ukraine is MORE urgent for russia since its a land connection allowing for forces to come in via land rather than having to cross a body of water to do so.

And to sort of top it off: talking about these topics fails to account for a common factor for any operation/war : not everything goes to plan, but having a better reaction to such problems is better than simple words"

"Stolen by Russia

My name is Ivan Semesiuk. I’m a Ukrainian artist, writer, musician, author, and host of the worldview project InstructionUA. I address the people of the Democratic World so Russians can never deceive you again.

Russia is an empty entity. It has no core of its own. All of its essences are stolen. The Ukrainian nation is the victim and the witness of this epochal robbery that you didn’t even know about.
 
After all, it is from Ukraine that Russia stole its most cherished essence, which is now used to justify its bloody existence on the European continent. Russia stole our Middle Ages, our Golden Age. Russia appropriated that history and presented it to the world as its own. Russia stole our Middle Ages so that the old European nations would perceive Russia not as a foreign stranger, but as something worthy of attention and respect.

This war is far from the first attempt to eliminate the witnesses of that theft. This war was meant to be the complete destruction of Ukraine not only as a state, as a nation, as people, but as an enormous historical tradition in space and time. Russians are eager to erase the very memory of us so that no one is left to hold Russia accountable. But us, Ukrainians, will settle this account.

Russia presents itself as a millennial project, calling itself historical Rus’ despite never having held that title even for a moment. The real name of the monster you know as “Russia” is Moskovia. Russia is just the Greek form of our medieval name Rus’ (or Kyivan Rus'). In the early 18th century, under the guise of the name Russian Empire, Muscovites entered the European historical arena having forcibly annexed Ukrainian ethnic lands on the left bank of the Dnipro river, as well as Kyiv. They entered brazenly, as if they had always been in the arena.

Here's what you need to know. Ruthenia is the Latin spelling of the name of the medieval European state of Rus’. Precisely under this name, our country became one of the most important, and, at one time, one of the largest, most powerful subjects of the European historical civilizing process.

In Moscow stands a pretentious monument, erected at Putin’s request, to our Kniaz (what you’d call a King) Volodymyr (who Russians call Vladimir). Kniaz Volodymyr baptized the first state of the Ukrainian tradition — Rus’ (Kyivan Rus'), with its capital in Kyiv. A city, which these pretenders consider their own, while at the same time they shell it with artillery, missiles and aerial bombs. Just to be clear here: who does that with one's own historical memory?

Russian history, written by generations of propagandists, is full of a multitude of figures, personas and names which were stolen from us. Modern Russian museums are full of priceless historical artifacts ​​taken out of Ukraine and marked as “Russian.”

Russia is misinformation. Russia is a manipulation. Russia is fake. Russia is a special operation. Russia is a thief, a rapist and a mass murderer."

Propaganda. Russia not even using the full military force. This is not a full scale war they are just trying to defend the people of Donbas and Luhansk. They are trying to demilitarize the rebels that been killing the people since 2014. This war will be over in the next weeks.

I don’t know how you call this a disaster. Russia has encircled half of the Obama/NATO puppet government of Ukraine in less than two weeks.
Funny enough problems with logistics historically was what saved russia from being conquered first by Napoleon and then by Hitler. You'd think they'd learn from the mistakes of their enemies.
too bad too sad russia must be PUNISHED for their crimes agaisnt humanity
Excellent explanation of the situation.
"About Ukraine: The people created during the Lenin era (the history of Kiev and the Rurik dynasty led by Prince Rurik of Novgorod should not be confused with Kievan Rus; Novgorod is an ancient Russian city, the cradle of everything.), But only theoretically / administratively, Russia during the Soviet era  because it remained under its control, today its territory consists mainly of territories historically belonging to the Russians (from the center to the east and south).  and the west historically belonged to Poland

 An important issue concerning Poland: the hatred of the Poles towards the Russians is very great, and it is they who have partially affected the western part of Ukraine, a hatred that is historical because Poland and Russia have had many wars over the centuries.  including the invasion of the Poles.  It was once heroically expelled by Moscow and the Russians (look for the monument to Minin and Pozharsky in Moscow’s Red Square).  Now, if you add to the historical hatred of Russia the neo-Nazi elements that exist in western Ukraine, they by default associate Russia with the greatest enemy of the fascists, the Soviets, who are truly doomed.  Their favorite Hitler, you will be unprecedented anti-Russian nationalism.  The United States has managed to use this sentiment as a geopolitical tool against the Russians for decades.

 About the current crisis: Donbass residents are ethnic Russians and they did not support the 2014 coup because those who took control of Kiev (with U.S. support) were openly xenophobic against the Russians, they took a lot of action against the Russians  .  Since 2014, they have even banned Russian throughout Ukraine, the mother tongue of people living in Donbass, Crimea and many other places.  Ethnic Russians have lived in the Donbass for centuries, so they have always protected their families and the lands they have lived in for many generations.  After the 2014 coup, people in Donbass voted in a referendum to gain more autonomy and remain part of Ukraine, the latter is important because the Western legend that the Donbass conflict was started by “pro-Ukrainian separatist Russians” is not so much.  rsatadi.  True, and it was part of the usual Western propaganda to distract the world about reality and to adapt everything to the Western myth of ""it's Russia's fault,"" I repeat, ""The people of Donbass are committed to Ukraine's independence and / or accession.""  Russia did not vote. They voted for more autonomy within Ukraine, ""in fact, this is the basis of the famous Minsk agreements that Kiev and the West refused to implement (accusing Russia of non-compliance, Russia has no obligation in the treaty) and  It should be reiterated that the people of Donbass wanted this because they never accepted the 2014 coup, which brought to power people who hated ethnic Russians.

 The Ukrainian army attacked these areas in 2014 and focused all its weapons on the civilian population of Donbass, an issue that is important because the war is taking place in the Donbass lands, so the victims of civilian casualties are always the civilians they live in  .  Donbass.  (Usually the Western media always interviews Ukrainian citizens living in areas that have not suffered from the real consequences of these wars), Donbass residents have won almost all battles, there was a lot of material on YouTube about these battles, where they ko  'rsatgan.  Civilians fighting the Ukrainian army, but youtube censored almost everything.  These victories should not come as much of a surprise to us, for the people of Donbass had defended their homes from people who hated the Russians (ethnic origin), and each of us will fight with all our might if we see that our family is threatened by insane racists.  they hate your friends and family, after all the attacks they have received from Kiev today, if they hold a new referendum, it is clear that they will vote to join Russia because they have seen the true face of the West and them  .  He took control of Kiev.

 Interestingly, Western autonomy is always supported when it begins within hostile states: Hong Kong in China, the Kurds in Syria, Kosovo in Serbia, Chechnya in Russia, and others.  True, Russia supports the Russians living in the Donbass, in fact it is based on the illegal military presence of gringo and NATO in northern Syria (""supporting"" the Kurds and stealing Syrian oil on the way).  is more justified.  Residents of Donbass are of Russian descent, they live near the Russian border (security problem), they have a clear connection with Russian culture and, first of all, have many relatives with Russians, so since 2014 many citizens.  Donbass received a Russian passport (Russian citizenship).

 Possible war: If a war breaks out between Russia and Ukraine, it will happen when Kiev attacks Russians living in Donbass, as Russia has said over the years that it will intervene with the Russian military to protect its citizens anywhere in the world, including the region.  Some believe that Russia will solve the problem in Donbass and even go as far as Kiev to clean up the U.S.-controlled government house.  The American legend of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine is based on this last point, because the Yankees are well aware that Kiev’s provocation is enough for Russian intervention and that there will be “evidence” of alleged aggression against Kiev in the Western media.  Western legend has always been based on lies, they are the heirs of the British Empire, the experts of this strategy: lies, division and victory.

 United States Objectives: All of the above explains some of the symptoms, but is not the real cause and primary goal of the conflict.  It is well known that when Europe was completely destroyed in World War II, the United States became a hegemonic world power, devastation spread to Asia as well, and China became the second country after the Soviet Union to suffer more human losses.  That is why today in a world where China has managed to overtake the United States in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and has become the first economically undisputed world power, the United States has no choice but to resort to war to regain its hegemony.  q.  if defeated, a new cold war is needed (economically and politically) to destroy Russia economically and take full control of Western Europe, which will help counter China (Western media)  tools already mention China in this European conflict).  Do you have any doubts?  See Lord Ismail, NATO's first Secretary General, explaining NATO's goal: ""Put the United States inside, the Russians outside, and the Germans down.""  America needs this war, so the western media, led by the western elite, is encouraging this war, the Ukrainians are just a cheap tool for the Westerners."
TL;DR: Pro-Russian propaganda.

Our propagana is so much better that thier propaganda!! USA!! USA!!! USA!!!
今回のロシアのウクライナへの侵略をNATOへの挑戦と捉え完璧にロシアを壊滅しろ。世界はNATOを助ける。もちろん日本も一緒だ。全面的にNATOを助ける。
That all sounds nice until the nuclear warheads start flying.
And the ukrainian farmers that have been stealing putins tanks with a tractor for 12 days are now the 5th military force in the world
This is the exact reason why a war between NATO and Russia would end in nuclear warfare
I wonder how China will do when its their turn to invade their neighbors
"Lindsey Graham and the rest of America’s warmongers plan to turn Ukraine into another Afghanistan, a bloody decade-long quagmire to distract and drain Russia.
It’s hard to believe that’s what the Ukrainian people want."
“Lauded leader Zelensky” nice objective reporting lol
"@Diogenes' Lamp He's also hated by half his country and called a ""puppet"" by many analysts—hardly laudits. My point wasn't about Zelensky, it was about the piece's objectivity. You can tell which side of the fence Wendover is on."
Zelenskyy has received standing ovations from the EU parliament and the UK’s House of Commons. He’s generally considered to have risen to the occasion magnificently given his previous job. “Lauded leader” is precisely objective.
"I keep subbed to your channel for your usually-balanced approach. Right off the bat, one can see that will not be the case here. We’ll see how well this video ages. Don’t see Ukraine beating Russia any time in this realm. Most tales of Ukrainian victories have turned out to be BS."
"where does he say that ukraine would win this over time? he merely pointed at the shortcommings of russias logistics. something tells me you didn't watch this video, never were subbed and is just yet another generic proputin bot"
@YourLeftNostrilWe'll see.
Cope
Excellent analysis.
"An essential feature of all authoritarian governments is extreme lack of balance, because NO top-down system can possibly achieve balance, when balance depends fundamentally on the lowest foundation upon which everything rests."
Generals need to play more games like Squad and Hell let loose.
"Russian armies have never really fought far from their land. The US, GB, Germans, Australians, Japanese and others have fought in huge wars half-way around the world. Russia's entire military is geared toward a massive land war on flat ground with the enemy directly in front of you, and nuclear weapons. All or nothing. Slow, awkward centralized control. Logistics is everything. Russian troops are demoralized by nature. Russian people are mediocre by design, not nature. And to the point of a long war, yes Russia has time, but stagnation always favors the occupied country.......I expect mass defections from the Russian army. This isn't 1960 anymore."
Good thing they not fighting the US
human race kills themselves
"just replace Ukraine with Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya. what surprises me though is the fact that this is only getting more press coverage bc it's in Europe."
Russia troops only good for goose stepping on red Square.
"Everyone walks on the tips of their toes around the horror that is happening. It is called ""ethnic cleansing,"" which is a word that everyone avoids saying. Like Hitler murdered millions of Jewish, gay, disabled, dark skinned, Slavic, and other people and Stalin murdered Ukrainians and landowners, Putin is murdering Ukrainians en masse to either terrorize them into giving in or getting their numbers so reduced (by murdering millions) that they will not have the numbers to push him out of Ukraine. This is another Holocaust because it is intentional, like Mao's or Pol Pot's mass murders of over fifty million of their own countrymen. If you want to read about another sociopath, who caused this genocide with the alleged “Saint” Merkel’s able assistance, read ""Ex-Trump national security advisor John Bolton says 'Putin saw Trump doing a lot of his work for him,' so he chose not to invade Ukraine"" in msnbc. Sadly, based on Trump's prior, consistent pro-Putin conduct and secret meetings with just him and the Russians, and no Americans from his administration present, I absolutely believe Mr. Bolton. If Trump and Merkel were not secretly competitors for best FSB agent of the year for many years, they were utter incompetents."
"This actually one of the most intelligent comments I've seen that isn't 100% brain dead.  I say he was just incompetent. Personally I think Trump did love America in his own way, he's just a pompous ass-talker that couldn't stop putting ego first. Maybe one day the US will stop electing media personalities to lead their country."
Russia has 60 percent of the country within the first 10 days. U.s bombed Iraq 45 days before ground forces. Plus the strategy is not take over the country. It is to submit to what they need.  When you white westerners are so good then why not fight
This video makes great points but a Thor great perspective is task and purpose
"Great analysis, and I can only hope an optimistic follow-through video appears in a few weeks. Germany and I believe others are sending Ukraine weapons, and there's surely a lot to unpack on the logistics front there."
"Desperate western war propaganda facing the mass media war machine being dismantled like never before, day by day from down-up on social networks. This is so funny cause it's like in some invented reality. Like, who the fuck believes into US propaganda anymore? It didn't hold even 2 days this time. :D"
"@Alvar Actually, no. I live in a country colonized from USA and NATO. The majority of people here are against western imperialism, but they colonized the country with installing a puppet governments and then conducted agreement with NATO without referendum. Do some research. The country is Macedonia."
Putin troll
"This will lead to nuclear fallout globally, unfortunately.  And all caused by one possessed maniac who wanted one more Russian fleet port. Such unnecessary waste."

"How to Play the Game of Life
Why do children wake up with their eyes wide open and jump out of bed while we open them just wide enough to see the phone so we can set it to snooze? Why are young people energetic and ready to “conquer the world” while older people are cautious and hesitant? Can we stay young-spirited forever? After all, if life is not a game, there is no excitement in it. And if there is no excitement in life, what is the point of living?
If we want to keep enjoying, we need to make life a lifelong game. This game is very different from anything we know. It is not about what we can receive, but about what we can discover! By connecting to other people, we discover new worlds, other people’s worlds!
How do we achieve this? Quite simply, we need to focus on others rather than on ourselves. This may sound simple, but if you try it, you will realize how self-absorbed you are.
We are all like that. Even those who feel that they are generous and giving are absorbed in their giving and do not see how much they do it for their own interest, and how they are focused on their own benefit when they give. Giving is fine, but the focus is the point here. Had the focus been on the receiver, the giver would have discovered countless revelations that are hidden from a self-centered eye.
For the game to succeed, you need partners. It is impossible to play the game of giving without people to whom you can give and from whom you can receive. Therefore, there must be a group of people, up to ten or so, who play the game together.
In order to succeed in discovering the other players’ worlds, we need to think good thoughts about them. Otherwise, we will have no incentive to approach them, no desire to discover their world. We can think good thoughts about each other if we do good things for one another. These can be the simplest things, but they must make us feel good about each other. Positive thoughts about each other bring us closer, and closeness opens our minds and hearts to others, so we can see the world through their eyes.
As with any game, the more we practice, the better we get, and the harder, yet more rewarding the game becomes. But unlike any other game, as we improve in it, we will find that our entire perspective on life changes and expands, and we become wiser and more competent.
The game of life, unlike any other game, reveals to us the secrets of life, the secrets of reality, because when you can look at something from all angles, nothing remains hidden from you."
They clearly didn’t fail .. lol.. are you incompetent in propaganda? Lol
"this would have all happened during trumps time in office, he goes on about how he was strong on putin but he did nothing about this issue."
"The video misses an important point. The Russians don't need great logistics. The need logistics better than the Ukrainians. Their plan now is to encircle the major cities and starve out the Ukrainian forces or create a humanitarian crisis in those cities putting pressure of their leadership to surrender. Most military analysts agree that the Russians are holding back and their artillery based forces could level any city with ease. They're not running out of shells they aren't using. This isn't a conventional fight with massive distances traveled or large amounts of ordinances dropped. It's a battle of political will, not a Wendover Production. Don't get sucked into the social media propaganda."
1:50 does that flag have any relevance to the regime or are they drawing from America?
lol
Russia's invasion is justified
How?
I pray for the safety of people on both sides of the conflict. Why can't we all just be humans together?
Why are you talking like wendover productions i want to punch my computer screen.
"Ultimately, one should want peace and good relations between Russia, Ukraine, and the West. If we have peace and good relations, we can have good economies and solve world problems. In the opposite case, all our economies are ruined and Russia and Ukraine lose tons of people. It's a sad situation. Blessed Be the Peacemakers. For Peacemaking, you are supposed to look at the most urgent needs of both sides in conflicts. The Russians' main concern seems to be the threat of NATO nukes pointed at them from Ukraine, and Ukrainians' biggest concern is getting invaded. I don't see how this conflict serves any actual US or EU need."
This video is a stupid Russian propaganda
Attempting a ground invasion of the Ukraine at this time of year is not a good plan.
Russian made the mistake that's ended empires. They invaded Russia in the winter.
The US seems very capable of moving military equipment half way around the world. I just wish they’d bring that very expensive stuff back.
"We should all thank Ukraine today. They did more than the US, the EU, NATO and the UN combined. What a pathetic lot"
Propaganda flick.
"So, do you want us a belief that the Russian ran out of fuel 100 miles Beloruss border? Seriusly?"
"Amazing video, thanks"
"Now that the Russians have been in Ukraine for 2 weeks, I think it would be sound tactics for the Ukrainian air force to strike railheads inside Russia. There are two reasons. 1.- To show Putin that his own country is not immune to death and destruction, much like the Doolittle raid in Japan in 1942, and 2.- The Russian military has an extensive railway network which its military depends on, so crippling it would certainly have a negative effect on its already deficient losistics system. It must be embarassing to Putin to realize that the whole world is watching what should've been a walk-over, turning into a bloodbath, and also showing the US, NATO, and European Union forces that maybe the Russian military can't sustain a large military operation outside Russia."
Yeah but from the moral side it will be horrible decision.

Ukraine: **fights back**

Putin is delusional.   Russian has 11 times zones.  He is worried  about little country.   Nato has been enjoying life.  Putin just saw the US leaving Afghanistan.   Christsakes  Putin Knock it off.  Make Russian rebuild everything  they destroyed.
Oh like the death and destruction that you all support with your abortions and uterus destruction huh. God hates you all worse than you all hate him

"There’s a difference between Material and Materiel.  Just because the translator or your source misspelled it, doesn’t mean you have to continue on the mistake."
"Yes, of course. The Russians shamefully retreated and encircled all Ukrainian cities, logistics failed with the old ""Armata"" from the time of Budyonny and the ""x 101"" missiles from the time of Khrushchev ..."
Good video man. Well done
"If your media were free, you would know the truth in Ukraine... 
Ukraine needs humanitarian aid like food, water, and antibiotics (Mariupol has not any water, food, gas, heating, and power supplies for the last 10 days). They need safe passage (for at least 5 days) to EVACUATE child/old/wounded CIVILIANS. Please Help... The mothers and children need your help. You have mothers and children too, right?.. The soldiers shoot even during ceasefire...
Please ask your Leader if this is his dream;  his legacy to Russia and to Europe... if not, please allow planes to drop humanitarian aid in villages esp. Mariupol, Kherson, and Kharkiv, etc. Allow safe passage; allow planes to EVACUATE child/old/wounded CIVILIANS (for at least 5 days). Ukraine and Russia are brothers. And a bear need not be afraid of a cub..."
"It's funny how when Palestiniens defend themselves with rocks and molotov cocktails they're called terrorists, yet they're heroes. Hypocrisy."

"Now that the majority of the Russian military is in the west around the Ukraine, it is an ideal time for China to attack Russia in the east and claim back Outer Manchuria as Chinese territory. If China reclaims Outer Manchuria it will once again have a coastline on the Sea of Japan as a base for the Chinese Navy. If China ever gets Outer Manchuria back it's next move will be to invade Taiwan and reclaim the island as part of the People's Republic of China."
Centralized control doesn't work in practice just theory and think tanks.
Nice propaganda.
The Ukrainians were sacrificed by the west. Russia is going to wreck the country and leave it in a state where the west will no longer be able to stage anything there. What a waste.
"Be warned there are a lot of Russian Bots, ""West Bad"" absolutists, and misinformed Babushka's in comments, so I wanted to do my civic duty and provide those curious about the most common arguments you'll see them post and why they have no actual standing in justifying Russia's actions.

*- ""This is purely Western Propaganda!""* A purely subjective argument. No one can deny it's hard to avoid echo chambers, but it is possible to be even slightly objective and when you look at the evidence about this conflict as objectively as possible... it still doesn't look good for Russia. Vladimir Putin has been caught lying to not only to the international community about his intentions with Ukraine, but also his own people. For instance, Russians are prohibited by law from calling this a war and can only call it a ""special military operation."" Ukraine and the world (except China) are allowed to share images and videos regarding the conflict to their hearts content, but Russians are only permitted to view what the state watchdog, Roskomnadzor, approves them to… which is nothing. Russians who desire to have an open dialogue in their country regarding the conflict through protest are jailed, two of the biggest social media platforms Twitter & Facebook have been banned, and recently the Kremlin passed a law that any person or organization that spreads information that only the authorities are allowed to deem as ""fake news"" can be imprisoned to up to 15 years. Objectivity is fine, but how can any objective dialogue take place when the other side actively crushes any semblance of opposing views? Russia, though namely Putin, has no one to blame but themselves for the world having the narrative that they do, the one where Russia invaded a sovereign country for no other reason than their leader had an irredentist perspective of Slavic history and wanted to create a new Russian Empire.

*- ""Look up the Azov Battalion.""* I'll save you the time. The Azov Battalion is a Far-Right, Neo-Nazi paramilitary that cropped up in 2014 as a response to the annexation of Crimea in order to fight separatists in the Donbas and yes, they are indeed awful people. However, they don't run the country with even a single seat in the Ukrainian Parliament, they're not popular amongst the masses in Ukraine with only a membership of 2,500 in a country of 44 Million, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a Jewish man who had some family members die in the Holocaust while others fought for the Red Army against the Nazi's, so either he's the most puzzlingly self-hating Nazi of all time or he's not a Nazi. If the whole argument the bots are making is ""Ukraine has a fringe Nazi paramilitary therefore the government should be toppled because they are by association Nazi's themselves"" then that logic should also apply to Russia. Look up the Far-Right, Ultranationalist, White Supremacist paramilitary operating in St. Petersburg known as ""Русское Имперское Движениe (Russian Imperial Movement)"" which is also designated as terrorist organization abroad. So, would the bots consider Vladimir Putin a Far-Right, Ultranationalist, White Supremacist terrorist by association that needs to be forcibly removed as well? I doubt they'll answer.

*- ""Where was this coverage when the US Invaded Iraq & Afghanistan?""* It was on TV… for decades? Whataboutism is a common tactic you'll see bots used which should be expected because whataboutism originated and was one of the favorite tactics used by the Soviet Union. Maybe the biggest debates in the western world for the past twenty years has been the moral motivations and overall effect of the US’ (and by extension NATO's) War on Terror as a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks... something that Russia claims to even participated in with the Second Chechen War, but I digress. Even people who supported the interventions will certainly admit to a range of faults on how those were handled, but there is a difference. Saddam Hussein and his sons were some of the vilest despots of the 21st Century and for decades terrorized their own people (Halabja Massacre) as well as their neighbors (Iran-Iraq War & Gulf War). The Taliban was... and unfortunately still is... a slaughterhouse of individual liberties to its own people and credible info existed that they provided safe harbor to Osama bin Laden and his murderous cronies, al-Qaeda. There is a fair conversation to be had about the US's prolonged involvement in those conflicts, but if there's a case to be made of anyone who were evil enough to be removed from power, it was them. Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the other hand is a former comedian who was elected by his people in a free and fair election, the same people who rose up and overthrew Viktor Yanukovych, the pro Putin president who deliberately worked against the will of his own people for personal gain and admiration from the Kremlin. Volodymyr Zelenskyy =/= Saddam Hussein. 

*- ""This is about NATO expansion eastward! They broke their promise and they started the war!""* The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is purely a defense alliance with an open-door policy for any nation who wishes to join. When the Soviet Union collapsed, numerous former Soviet Republics who grew to resent Moscow over their lifetimes willingly flocked to the organization such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary etc and as per said open door policy, they took them in. There was indeed a 1990's non committal verbal agreement, NOT A BINDING TREATY, between NATO and the Soviet Union which was about not expanding the organization into East Germany, not Eastern Europe. There was also a non committal, non-spoken understanding in 1997 between Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin that Central Europe could theoretically act as a buffer zone as a budding peace was built. But what the bots fail to disclose is that Russia broke any form of agreement first when they attacked Georgia in 2008 to give Abkhazia and South Ossetia ""independence."" They also showed blatant disregard for any potential agreement when they annexed Crimea and supported the Russian backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. Every time NATO has expanded in the 2000’s, it has mostly expanded more west of Ukraine with countries in the Balkans as well as offered partnership status to various European powers which is more of a political olive branch to ensure peace on the continent rather than flat out membership, including Russia. Remember, NATO didn't spend months building up their forces around the border of Ukraine, NATO didn't tell the world that they wouldn't invade only to do just that in the middle of the night after giving an hour-long warped history lesson on why Ukraine never had the right to exist as an independent country... that was Russia.

*- ""If Putin doesn't do this, NATO will put nukes on Ukraine! How would the US like it if Mexico or Canada joined an alliance with China and pointed nukes at them?""* The first point against this is that NATO already was against the idea. There was a little incident in 1962 you might remember called the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was kinda the closest time humanity ever came to World War III and this was in direct response of the USSR trying to install medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles off the coast of Florida. The two nations were finally able to deescalate when John F. Kennedy agreed to Nikita Khrushchev that they'd remove Jupiter Missiles from Turkey. Since then, NATO nukes have been stationed in what even Russia would agree as Western European nations like the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, and Belgium. Second point, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine had one of the largest collections of USSR nukes out of any former republic. They could have kept them but they didn't. In 1997, the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances was ratified by both Ukraine (alongside Belarus & Kazakhstan) and Russia that agreed the former would give all their nuclear weapons back to Moscow in exchange that the latter would respect their sovereignty and agree to not initiate hostilities... which Russia violated... twice now... There was no indication that Ukraine ever wanted Nuclear Missiles on their soil, NATO is not interested in placing nukes outside of Western Europe because if they did, there'd be nukes in the Baltics by now, and even if Ukraine did join NATO they would have full say on what extent of a presence the organization would have."
"@Cyber Dragon Zekrom Thanks for proving me right, товарищ!"
This is purely Western Propaganda.
"Russia is winning, except you guys in the West do not understand the thinking of the Russian people, they have beaten Napoleon and the NAZI Germans, with the Russian armements the Vietnameses had beaten the Mighty Americans, and the Russian will crush the NAZI Ukrainians as well with their Russian Cauldron strategy and tactic , you will see !"

"I remember when the USA invaded iraq in 2004. Back then it was considered madness that U.S. infantry was riding on unarmored Humvees.  5-thousand-something American deaths, and tens of thousands of casualties.

(and Iraq was not getting help from rich neighbors)"

The US lost around 300 in the actual invasion those first couple of weeks.
WTF. There wasn't 5k deaths in two weeks.
"Except the US casualties were in the low hundreds, and the inflicted loss on Iraqi combatants was up to 30000. 

7000 casualties between Afghanistan and Iraq over 20 years, some of it from IEDs, but more often than not it was small skirmishes, small ambushes, vehicle suicide bombing, and the occasional lucky mortar hit on a FOB because they did not have the knowledge of how to operate their weapons."
"I watched this carefully, and there's a lack of historical context, causality, as to why this conflict began. No mention of the various diplomatic attempts by the Russians to get their security concerns considered."
"Over the last week Russia has probably murdered 15,000 civilians alone in Ukraine, the UN should be charging Russia with active and ongoing War Crimes, we all need to stop Russia ASAP, either they withdraw or be burned!"

"Thank you for an objective look at this conflict! Good logistics would save many lives on both sides. The fact that Russia did not predict logistical problems is a f. shame.
Please take your look at the possible scenarios of the Third World War."
"I am most decidedly NOT a robot nor am I spreading misinformation. I would however, like to address a couple of Wendover's points and fill in some  background information about WHY Russia may have invaded in the first place.
First pointing out Russia's failures in Afghanistan and not recognizing our own failure is less than full disclosure. 
Secondly, the reason WHY this has happened is not even mentioned. For some background, in 2014-2015 the US  and Europe helped overthrow a democratically elected president who held some sympathies for mother Russia as Ukraine was a former USSR member. We of course installed a person of our choosing who would be more connected with the west rather than Russia. Now in the Eastern part of Ukraine there is an area referred to as the Donbas region. Here, ethnic Russians and Russian speaking peoples did not want to be a part of the coup that the US helped orchestrate. To this day they identify as Ukrainian and Russian. Zelensky, our guy, was not pleased with the Donbas and he has had a battalion bombing them since 2015. Over 14,000 of these folks have died as a result. 
Put in has been trying to save these people from this shelling since the coup. In fact, the Minsk Agreement was meant to protect these people and Ukraine agreed to it. 
So Russia appears to want to install a Russian as president once again.
Now, I am 100% against war and the death and destruction and displacement of refugees that always follows. This situation is NO different. 
While the inadequacies of the Russia military appears to be of some relief to the people of Ukraine, the people of the Donbas region have no such luck.
They continue to get bombarded by the Ukrainian military. 
My point is simply ALLthe facts of the situation should be covered in any discussion of the current situation.
Further it appears we the US and the current administration might have helped prevent the attack in the first place if we would have only uttered the words ""Ukraine will never be a member of NATO.""
Imagine that Russia installed a russion president in both Canada and Mexico. What do you think the US would do?
I pray for peace in the region. I want Russian troops to leave and for heavens sake Ukraine, stop killing your own countrymen and women."
"@Tony James mea culpa. Porosshenko was in fact elected in 2014. 
The ""insurgents"" were and are politically and by heritage more closely aligned with Russia and Russia supplies them with arms and material.
These ""insurgents"" were understandably upset when the president who was in alignment with their views was rejected by a large faction of the country during the Maidan riots. But having an entire Neo-Nazi battalion fighting you with sophisticated weapons is not the answer either.
If you fail to see that the CIA and the EU's intelligence arms backed Ukraine's attempt to join a trade alliance or outright become a NATO country, you are foolish.
I do not know from which country you come but YES I am an American. 
Further, if you fail to understand the ramifications of having your enemies taking up residence on a significant portion of your border, you are not thinking clearly."

"The claims that the convoy is a failure may be overblown and it seems the slow movement may be interpreted as the staging for a concentrated methodical attack with the logistic support positioned closer to the front. 
But it also appears that Putin started to believe in his own propaganda and really believed that the Ukrainian gov and state would collapse and the Russian forces just roll into the capital and police the transition. This has not happened so what follows is the standard Russian Plan-B: massive attack on the civilian population to frighten it into submission (see Chechnya, Ukraine in 1945 etc.). 
This requires lots of artillery, those mid-range rockets and cruise missiles are expensive and soon will stop flying because of lack of western-made components. 
How all this bloodbath would end up in the incoming Russian-Ukrainian harmony and why so many Russian people believe in this ... I only wonder."

Kiev  not Kiv

Aloha from Hawaii very informative be safe be happy try not to get yourself hurt may God bless you and may God bless the world you might want to consider putting Jesus in the mix
Lmao I knew this clown channel was propoganda over a year ago. Cute this lame has to cry about disinformation on his pinned comment.
"This is another of the many fakes published in the West. Fakes, this is the only thing Ukraine has succeeded in. The situation for creating fakes is facilitated by the fact that the Russian and Ukrainian armies have almost the same military equipment. Thus, simply applying the letter Z to the destroyed equipment, you can already pass it off as Russian. Sometimes this letter is applied directly to the burnt paint. lol! 
The fake that the Russian army is guided by a road sign or paper maps is also ridiculous. I don't even know how anybody can believe that? Only ignorant Westerners who live by the opinion of Russia as a country from the WWII can believe in such nonsense.  Any smartphone has maps that, without any military miracles, will show where you are and in which direction you need to go. You can even use offline maps. Just try it!
The fake that Ukrainians destroyed roads to Russia is also fake. The Ukrainian army was stunned by the invasion and had no plan of action. At first there was no resistance. They simply no longer have such an opportunity, and new military equipment enters these roads and refugees leave for Russia. 
Ukrainians have several strong points in large cities, where they hide among residential buildings and equip positions directly among the civilian population. There are frames with confirmation of this. That's what stopped the Russians from entering the cities. Oddly enough, the ""aggressors"" care more about the peaceful population than the ""defenders"".
While the Ukrainians are retreating, they are not selectively shelling their abandoned cities, which the Russian army is entering. But the Russians, faced with this meanness, change tactics.
The Russians are not entering the cities now, so as not to arrange bloody street battles. They bypass them. And either they encircle Ukrainian units that are hiding in cities or give them an exit in the desired direction so that they voluntarily leave the city. As in Kiev.
To talk about problems with logistics when Russian troops are 200km from Russia is an attempt to give wishful thinking. For several months, the Russian troops moved thousands of km away had all the supplies and suddenly in a week it was gone. Idk where and under what circumstances the footage of the ""robbery"" of shops by Russian soldiers was taken, which is being issued as proof. But I know that the Russian army is strictly prohibited from using goods on the local because of unknown quality.
After the entire Ukrainian army is scattered in separate cities, and the entire territory of Ukraine is in the hands of the Russians, they will begin the second stage. The Ukrainian army will be surrounded in the cities, without supplies. Very soon the Ukrainians will not have tanks and artillery, possibly cartridges. 
For Ukrainians, there is no hope and no reason for optimism. Their resistance will simply increase civilian casualties. But some cities, like Konotop, agree to surrender to the Russian army and there are no victims there.
And of course there is no mention that there was not just a shootout between combatants in the eastern republics since 2014. There were 8 years of shelling of cities by the Ukrainian army and about 14,000 victims. Among them are 500 children killed by Ukrainian shells."
This did not age well
"Did you know Ukraine is the 2nd largest nation in Europe? Russia is the largest in Europe and the world. I remember reading history books about our own forces having logistic issues in every single war. Patrons tanks ran out of gas racing across Europe and they had to beg, borrow and steal to keep them going. We are only hearing a very very one sided view of this invasion. Of course there's going to be logistic issues when you're racing across a vast country. This isn't tiny Serbia. When the US/NATO bombed and destroyed Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria we didn't hear about our logistic issues bc the media was doing the govts bidding. 
Wanna hear of a logistic issue that's not getting attention? Saudi Arabia and the US have been bombing and starving the people of Yemen for years. They are blockading food shipments and aid to those people. The people of Yemen can't get food or supplies bc 2 of the richest nations in earth are waging war in them. There's a logistics problem wrapped up in a morality problem."
"The further an army advances the longer your supply lines.  This was the main reason the allies had to prioritise the opening of Antwerp during the advance into Europe during WW2.  Without the port of Antwerp the armies supply lines could not maintain their advance due to having to transport fuel, ammunition, food etc all the way from Normandy. Going too far will inevitability result in failure."
"@Captian Cholera Actually, Russian troops aren’t driving to Kyiv."
It was just easier.
"In WW II, in North Africa, the Axis (Germany and Italy) Powers fought the Brits and their Allies (India, Australia, etc) for over two years, before one side, the Brits won the battle of El-Alamaine on Nov 5th, 1942.

One reason was both sides were fighting in a freakin' DESERT!
And the Temp in the Sahara would go as high as 130 Degrees Fahrenheit!
EVERYTHING - Food, Water, Ammo, had to be transported 100s of miles.
Each time one side advanced, its supply lines got longer.

Three days after losing at El-Alamaine, German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel (the ""Desert Fox"") is told that Americans and Brits have landed in Northwest Africa, (Morocco and Algeria).  

Rommel never survived the War, but in one book ""Knight's Cross"" an aide said that when Rommel, in Northeast Africa, is told the Allies are in his Rear, in NorthWEST Africa, that ""Rommel knew, at that point, that Germany would lose the War."""
"@Shadow Failed to take Rome?  When? 

General Mark Clark entered Rome unopposed on June 5,  1944, riding in an open jeep at the head of a lone infantry battalion.  Clark has been criticized (fairly, I think) for delaying the destruction of the main German army in the area in favor of this silly gesture.  But he surely did not fail to take the city."
"There’s a reason why the US maintains such an extensive network of military bases around the world. They’ve learnt from past wars that having stuff already at or near the theater is infinitely better than trying to get stuff there even with heavylifters like the C5. While i don’t agree with such an offensive approach, you can’t deny that Uncle Sam’s global reach and force projection with those military bases and supercarriers is second to none"
BRAVO
well done. I've learned a lot.
"Optimistic, but don't forget that this war *literally isn't over yet.*"
"@Wendover Productions Ah I see you are a devout student of Herr H. Automatically ignore ANYONE OR ANYTHING that is contrary to what you are telling us.

"Kind of ironic with the whole Cuban missile crisis being about a safe buffer zone between super powers deploying nukes so close to its borders, yet nato is all about getting Ukraine on board, why? To put nukes in Putins backyard. We are the pot calling the kettle black, and these dumb a people don't help. I support the civilians of both Russia AND Ukraine, NOT THE GOVERNMENTS"
Sounds logical except Russians have no problem maintaining supply lines in Syria so your theory does not hold.
"That was before Russia became the most sanctioned country on Earth, though."
This will probably not age well..... unfortunately
Idk I think the whole “Russia is disorganized” is just acting Putin is smart and manipulating he would just invade and have a disorganized army something doesn’t look right to me idk if I’m over analyzing things but I think Russia has another plan
Pentagon acknowledged that russia's 95 percent of army is intact.. they have sorrounded kyiv
Hi
Cant beleive putin basiclly just crippled the russian economy for an operation thats pretty much failed. Salva Ukraine
Push vs. Pull logistics sounds a lot like Communism vs. Capitalism to me. It's the difference between expecting the world to bend to your will and bending the world to your will by reacting to it.

"Thats means in long time, Russia will Kabut!! Let's go Ukraine"
They should have employed a good KANBAN board
"Stupid analysis because you are trying to compare with the American army that devastate cities before entering them. The Russian has different strategy  and aren't planning to  destroy Ukraine like the American did in Iraq.Their strategy is to surround cities and exhaust the fighters and resistances inside them before entering ,that is why they aren't in rush to enter Kharkov or Kiev. they can wait another 2 weeks if that will save hundreds of lives. Don't forget it took american army 10 days fight to enter one city Mousol in Irag although the Iraqi army was almost dismantled ."
Is anyone else having a lot of trouble getting this video to load?
Nice Episode man
It seems that the Russian commanders have forgotten the lesson of he Battle of The Bulge. They're operating a battle scenario based on a 'Blitzkreid Attack' that requires way too much in logistics to be continued for long if the first push is unsuccessful! Now guerilla warfare could stop them long enough for the West to supply Ukraine with effective counter measures on the ground and in the air. Putin could soon find himself staring down a table of generals pointing pistols at his head. He wouldn't be the first Soviet/Russian leader to end up in an unmarked grave!
Taiwan will be a tuff nut to bust even more than Ukraine the got some serious fire power.

Russia has been building bases and airfields in Ukraine under the cloud cover the past week.
"Hasn't anyone thought that maybe, is their plan for everyone to ""underestimate"" the Russian army? I think they would never show their Great Power, technologies, etc in a first advance... But yeah, It's confusing why entering a conflict that has so much to take, and drain the country in economic and military ways. But I guess Putin/Russia are far more intelligent than they are showing"

"@Knott Urfrend You misunderstand me. I am not a Russian propagandist. I am simply fed up with all the talk and no trousers from the West and trying to suggest why the West has not already acted to defend & support Ukraine with military force. Sanctions are useless. The EU continues to pay Russia 1 billion euros per day for oil and gas, particularly Germany which would grind to a halt without it. If the West intervenes now while the Russian army is bogged down,  it will hopefully prevent this conflict from escalating further which it will do once the Russian army has conquered Ukraine, rested and regrouped and then proceeds to attack & invade the next country on Putin's list."

They NEVER had the fuel depots and the military hospitals set up and fully operational before. They were CLEARLY preparing for something more."

   I remember when all Youtube Videos had these things called DATES!"
"What's mind boggling is analysts noted almost the exact same logistical difficulties in the 2008 Georgian war. The only reason that didn't turn into a boondoggle also was because of the vast disparity and the fact that Russia was able to secure a quick capitulation. But the deficiencies were there and evident to all, all except seemingly the Russian military who took it as a win and went on. It's beginning to look like the only way this could ever have succeeded without turning into a pyrric victory is if Russia secured a knockout blow in the opening days of the war. Which hints at a MASSIVE intelligence failure. How could they, after all this time, seriously thought they would be greeted as liberators? It makes NO sense. The FSB is a lot of things but I wouldn't say they're incompetent. Indeed, for all the faults of the Soviet and later Russian states they always seemed to possess an effective intelligence apparatus. 

As an aside, reminds me of WW2 where despite the successful German invasion of Poland, the high command actually regarded it as a failure in a number of areas and set about addressing their shortcomings, and it payed off massively in the Battle of France. Then as the war dragged on whether through hubris or the sheer size of the problem and monumental stupidity of Barbarossa they lost this ability and suffered for it."
"Bullies do best when they scare, intimidate, and terrorize effectively; bullies do worse when their victims have the will and the means to kick some azz!"
Georgia is a lot smaller than Ukraine in both land area and population. Also Ukraine is bordered by NATO countries that had been sending aid since the invasion started.
They were aware of some of the shortcomings laid bare in Chechnya and Georgia and were in the process of modernizing to a more western style professional army but entrenched/corrupt interests pushed back to halt and it seems maybe even roll back some of those reforms.

"It took Russians 3 days to secure area size of England and Wales combined. In 5 days they captured the same amount of land as US captured during Iraq campaign in a month. Russians control 40% of Ukraine's total land area, destroyed 75% of Ukraine's military capacity, destroyed or hold almost every critical infrastructure landmark. Further on,  Donbas army isolated 40,000 Ukranian soldiers that are about to surrender and by now they control almost entire Lugansk and Donetsk regions. Ukranian army suffered more than 7x more casualties than Russians. Youtube is really lousy source of information."
"@petar kosovic Ehh I agree that there are propagandas on both sides.... that said, its not really the tech that is the issue, even if argued that they are not outdated, its how the logistics of using those techs that is the issue, which is the point of the video. Military schools and history will tell you that decent logistics is just as equal as great strategy and great technology combined, unless the two are overwhelming enough to not care of any bad logistics. In this case, the two are not. Russia clearly underestimated Ukraine that they think strategy is enough. For sure they will win, but with the military strength and the tech you claimed to be advanced, surely it would have been a decisive win that they would have done last week right? And I'm saying this not to defend any misinformation the video may have, but when a superpower is taking too long to win over a still-developing country. it says enough that their logistics is not really great and this video is right in some sense."

"They said it would take nine days for them to reach the capitol and it took three.

The typical Russian army tactic is to encircle and bombard but that would kill literally tens of thousands in a civilian populated area and it hasn't happened yet. They are deliberately holding back on artillery bombardments to preserve civilian life. But there is still only one Russian soldier dead for every eight Ukrainian Soldiers, so the outcome remains a foregone conclusion.

If they were conserving strength, and unconcerned with future diplomatic relations, they would simply be bombarding and it would be done already. The fact that it isn't says that, barring external actors, this US/Russian proxy war will be confined to the Ukraine regardless of what the corporate media and US Intel are promoting.

It is what it is. I'm not happy about it, but I'm not sure it would be happening if the US hadn't continued to arm neonazis in the Ukraine against the Ukrainian people's wishes, and that even after several massacres by Ukrainian neonazi forces."

you could also cite your evidence?
"Stop with this propaganda about ""failed logistics"".  Ukraine is lost. All you are doing is prolonging the agony. Ukraine is being destroyed piece by piece. USA can end this now by declaring Ukraine will never be a member of NATO.  If it doesn't sign a paper to this effect, Ukraine will be in rubble. Russia won't let up. Ask the Georgians or the the Chechens. 
So far, Russia has refrained from indiscriminate shelling of civilian population by letting a corridor for civilians to escape. But if Ukrainian resistance is in the buildings, then all urban centers are a target.

The main your idea is to small material-technical support brigade is a very interesting."
Lol the only ones that failed are the nato and ukraine. Russia stopped nato from further expansion and now ukraine is giving up on joining nato and giving up on the states that Russia wants. Our oil is so expensive and Russia just made a deal with china and isn’t impacted much. Russia wins

Propaganda. You do not know what is going on in reality.
Sam you researched this way too good. And you are going to leak the information to russian advantage xD
Russia is right next to Ukraine and they can't supply their troops?
It's time to put a bounty on Putin's head dead or alive for war crimes let's make the hunter The hunted
Ukraine is using civilians as human shield (because they're Nazis if you havent heard). When the civilians have finished evacuating you'll see the full force of the Russian army
The USA started this war
Ok
No
"to drug dealers they say ""dont get high on your own supply"" this is also valid for propagandists.

"Ukraine farmers: ""All your tanks are belong to us."""
"Perhaps the clown that is now promoted to HERO OF THE FREE WORLD should have incentivized his own civilians to evacuate from key conflict areas instead of grandstanding and betting on NATO involvement to stop the Russians by keeping these people as possible casuality fodder for the Western press.

By the way, improvising the armament of untrained civilians is very kosher, but keeping a well-armed and minimally militia (as intended by the Founding Fathers) in the US is completely haram."
okay but what about DN? you must admit it’s vital
In the part explaining the troops taking over the airport near Kyiv I got an ad for some flight center saying to “Book your holiday now!” what kind of dystopia is this?

"""The Russians relied on paper maps"", does this mean that the average infantry company or battalion units have no GPS in their vehicles?"
@Yurii Khalaim 💀
Yes. Practically all the tanks and armored vehicles are equipped with outdated Soviet-era radio stations which are broken for the most part. So they really rely on handwritten maps and written instructions (which are also not all that great).

"Nice technocrats propaganda video you have there..   You can tell a propaganda video because whilst it correctly goes back to 2014 as the start of the current crisis, it completely ignores the 2014 coup where the elected Govt. was replaced by a USA/NATO backed one. THAT is what spawned the separatist movements in the east who didn't accept the installed Govt. and the NATO expansion by stealth prompted Russia to move into Russian supporting and strategically significant Crimea region. The Eastern separatist areas have been shelled by Ukraine for 8 years, 14,000 dead.  But the coup is the significant event."

"I don't get why on earth the Russians would design their logistics around trains. In the modern era, that seems insane. A train is supremely vulnerable and inflexible. Just one bomb anywhere along the track, and thats it. Train has to stop. At least off-road vehicles can drive anywhere that isn't in trees or escarpment. Just go around a bomb crater. A train is one gians 'asking for it' target. Trucks in a convoy can scatter into 100s of units. The USA relies on trucks. And thats the correct way to do it. Why wouldn't Russia have wanted the same. I mean, when a supply train arrives at its destination, all the supplies have to be loaded onto trucks anyway, or how else do they reach each individual soldier/vehicle. Russia is an oil producing nation. Not having enough gas, is unacceptable. Their army is a joke."

"oddly useful information, well done"
The best analysis of the war I've seen. Brilliant work.
"Poor piece of propaganda. They're relying on paper maps, lol."
"ive been looking at this  for a while
im confused by several things
1 the russians have not tried to seal the western border off from the west, this should have been job nr 1
2 the russians are obsessed  by taking cities rather than taking the countryside and starving out the cities as is the usual way things are done
3 the tyres on the vehicles appear to be very very poor quality and they are failing often
4 the lack of commitment to use enough air and missile softening up is making the cost of vehicle losses much higher than it should be
5 there appears to be almost no close in air support for ground attacks
bearing this in mind this will turn out to be a chechen style conflict rather than a blitz"
russions have not enought resources and the strength of their army seems to be overestimated. Ukraine is huge and russions skills in PR are much better than their millitary capabilities
There will always be conflict.

The problem is that modern wars are very unpredictable. Not only for Russia but also for USA. The war against Iraq lasted a month even though the U.S bombed everything in their way (including massacring civilians).
"@My Food Doesn't Scream they could give up or run out of fuel. There have been mistakes made already in both the planning and execution of the war. Their numbers advantage could likely overcome this, but I it’s unclear whether they will overcome their mistakes AND the massive influx of allied support."
"@red_array manpower is almost irrelevant here since a lot of Russian soldiers are not eager to fight and not sure why this war is even started, or even just empathize with Ukrainians but afraid to be punished for desertion"
"@My Food Doesn't Scream we shall see I suppose. Russia has a 5 to 1 advantage of manpower and even greater in air support. Ukraine will depend on allied munitions. I think odds are Kharkiv and Kyiv are taken by Russia in the coming weeks unless NATO ups their aide even further, but holding them against a hostile, armed population is another thing that will require long-term military occupation, and the economic cost would be extraordinary."
"@red_array and no, Putin's not gonna take Kyiv. What he probably can do is level it down like what he did with Chechnya 20 years ago, and with Harkiv now."
"@red_array Kremlin's ganda is a one-sided circus, barely having anything to do with reality, and canonically resembling that in ""1984"""
Thanks for making this video. I've known Ukraine is doing well for how much underpowered they are compared to russia but have never really known much of how they managed to do it. This helped me understand their strategy a little better without making the explanation too technical and complicated.

The war has been variously termed a war of production and a war of machines. Whatever else it is, so far as the United States is concerned, it is a war of logistics.
- Fleet ADM Ernest J. King, in a 1946 report to the Secretary of the Navy

Logistics is 2nd to nothing in war. I will tell you in 2022 the American Military is not capable of winning a war against a near peer. Our machinery of war, how quickly can we build and replace it?"

This well before Putin's War and before the COVID pandemic. This is planned as the very term of SOCIAL distancing instead of physicall distancing, is to allow for the subconcious misassumption of meaning becoming hermits and socially isolated from one another. We as human beings REQUIRE contact with other people -- not just with immediate family! We lose so much if we as humans on this planet become so socially isolated that parts of our brains die, and the artistic abilities began to atrophy. We are not meant to become cocooned! This is why Ukraine with the great help from Zalensky UNITING people together are having more than expected success with defeating the Russian onslaught! Now that the whole world is against Putin and this unjust war against Ukraine MUST unite together to try and have force to STOP THIS WAR! Thank Sam"
"Amateurs study war, professionals study logistics. Which is why we can to war 8k miles away, and not our run our supply lines."

"If the fuel and water lines get set up,
those need to be destroyed ASAP."
"It would be interesting to see what happens as this war drags into the 3rd and even 4th week.  Will Russian logistics catch up and allow them to crush Ukraine, or will the their losses together with the sanctions force them to retreat?"
"It seems that Russia having committed about 65% of its standing army to the Ukraine invasion (over 100 battle groups out of 160 total that are battle-ready) and all of that initial commitment now in Ukraine, that there are no sizable reserves left because the remaining 60 battle groups need to remain protecting rest of Russia Federation. Russian forces did not advance noticeably anywhere on Day 11, in fact, Ukraine is counter-attacking and gained back some territory yesterday (Day 10) and today.  And if that 60-mile long stalled convoy totally runs out of fuel and food, expect a WW2 type event like miles long columns of survivors trudging back to reach safety in Belarus."

"I also find it really interesting that as a military historian “well informed on the topic” that you would cite Hannibals invasion of Italy we a success, as he lost 3/4 of his army during the crossing and what was left of his army were close to starvation. Sure it ended up being successful but definitely not because it was a logistical triumph."
Can I see some credentials? Honestly saying your a military historian on a YouTube thread has 0 credibility. I’m not saying your not but I could say I’m A 5 star general and it would not be true.

"Such nonsense, but the soup worked out. the video was compiled from fakes, disinformation, not a word about the Donbass... If it were necessary, then Russia would stupidly bomb the necessary cities from its territory without even invading (and there would be no supply problems as they describe here.). But that's not the point. Russia does not particularly dig in in the captured cities. Look at the map. The point is not to capture and destroy cities, the point is in the Donbass, the point is to create a cauldron that is almost ready. The same cities of Chernihiv, Sumy are Ukrainian at the moment, but they were simply blocked and that's it. they don't carry any value.  It's special operation not war"
Someone needs to write a satire about Putin and his failed attempts.  This is turning out to be none other than a farce!
"This is the most stupid invasion since the Germans invaded the USSR.

So all of the independant consultants agreed about what would happen, and were all wrong. In a way I don't blame them; they're probably not allowed to disagree. Anyone with half a brain could tell that an invaded country will fight back hard! Unfortunately, for both countries, Putin will take the usual soviet era plan and sacrifice more young men."
"When civilians are murdered in such a way, troops on the ground are a moral imperative.  If Putin wishes to start a nuclear apocalypse, that's on him.  We have an obligation, and the only thing we have to fear is fear itself–the fear that has crippled leaders like Biden and Trump.  (Trump talks big, but it's all talk)"

"I was wondering when foraging or looting by troops, to make up for logistics shortfalls would get mentioned. I also wonder to what extent that ""foraging"" can last and how much it can sustain the russian war effort. Once the fighting disrupts transport and infrastructure in the contested areas, you can then only loot supermarkets, shops and petrol stations once before that resource is gone."
>>I was wondering when foraging or looting<< To put it into perspective: Imagine you and your family driving your family car to a Walmart shopping center parking lot and parking it there for a few days - while you try to subsist on raiding the rotting food you find in the trash bins there. Now imagine simultaneously having to fight while doing so.

"The history of russia and Ukraine is very checkered.   A lot of ukrainian leaders have died misteriously, according to american history records.  The more i dig deep into this conflict, the more i see a USSR trying to re-establish there grasp.  Someone should warn them this is a failed path."
"There's two other factors your otherwise fantastic video overlooked.
The tsunami of economic sanctions the West has unleashed on Russia in the opening days of the war, sending the Russian economy and Ruble into a nosedive. The Ruble is now roughly equal to or less than a penny...if soldiers are paid in worthless paper/people at home can't buy bread/pay their rents, Putin is gonna have to deal with an army in Ukraine with low morale furious they're broke. and rumors are suggesting captured Russian soldiers are saying they had no idea they were invading, thought it was a military exercise, etc. And also citizens back home furious Putin dragged them into war, though the ratio of pro to anti-war is impossible to know in Russia with the media blackouts Putin is ramming through all over. 

the second is corruption within the Russian Army itself and Russia as a whole, again this is one of those topics that's hard to break down into easily numbers on a spreadsheet, but the west went after the Russian Oligarchs, and they plundered billions from Russia and hid it overseas. Just google current news about all the places they're finding Oligarchs and their wealth, like Londongrad and all the dirty money in Western Governments/Businesses. Or Russian defense/government officials just pocket the moneys themselves meant for their soldiers and give their soldiers junk.  Not even taking into account the untold mountains of money Putin skimmed off for himself since 1999. And I think that's in part why the Russian forces in Ukraine are struggling the way they are because the decades of rot going all the way back to the USSR meltdown in 1989-1992 has never been properly purged out of the Russian Military.
I can't confirm my sources, but allegedly when the Russians invaded Georgia back in 2008, they were facing similar issues but got bailed out by Sarkozy of France getting a Ceasefire agreement between Russia and Georgia. But it exposed that the Russian military was still dependent on old Soviet tech and tactics, and they couldn't hack it anymore....and now in 2022 it looks like they barely improved from that."
My guess is a lot of it is because of good old fashioned spring mud. Ideally you would have those 40 mile convoys staged up ALONGSIDE the road waiting to move up when needed. Instead you have a huge congested extremely vulnerable mess.
I learn something every day.  I didn't know Ukraine surrendered a huge nuclear stockpile for world favor.  This is a HUGE move to become a neutral integral in world favor.  Now i understand there frustration with EU being hesistant!!!!
"The ultimate irony of any civilaztion would be"" to kill your own ancester's""   Good job, Russia."
Another reason the Russians will fail is that the enemy is 40 million strong.
Certainly no blitzkrieg
"The war may not be going as amazingly as they thought it would, but two weeks is not long for a war. If Russia manages to win anyway, they are likely to learn from it. If and when Russia invades the Baltic states we will be facing a very different Russian army.

The same could happen if Russia loses. If that happens we could have this war again in a few years against a much more effective army. I somewhat doubt that, however. Such a defeat may get Putin deposed, or at least make his military unwilling to launch offensive wars."
I'm happy Russia's logistic failed.  Slava Ukraine!

"This episode completely missed the objectives of almost any battle.

Their objective was to entirely cut off infrastructure. Look at all of the power stations (even dams and hydroelectric) that they are going after. Almost the entire region does not have much power. Then there's water and sewer, also something the entire region has very little of.

So imagine trying to stay there with no power, no water, and no sewer.

Some people that might try to stay might have generators, which... Would also flag them as a possible target."

Logistics is the same thing that failed the afghan governemt that the us propped up. After the overnight withdrawal the afghan government which had relying on the us for its logistics quickly started to crumble
"It wasn't logistics that was the problem. It was the Afghans themselves many of whom were sympathetic to the Taliban and many more who didn't want to fight for their country unlike the Ukrainians are willing to fight for theirs. There's no doubt that if they showed some fight that the outside world would still be sending them support to fight the Taliban.

They showed none not even wanting to defend their own families and land so they deserve what they get for their lack of fight. Ukraine on the otherhand is worth helping when they're actually willing to fight for their own country against a much larger and stronger opponent."
Thank you!

"Russia took control over a territory that is the comparable to the size of the whole UK basically in a matter of 10 days and that's by going step by step since there are millions of Russians living in Eastern Ukraine it's not like they are rushing anything, but this clown talks about ""fail logistics"" LMAO"
How big is Ukraine
Oceanic trade is the fastest and cheapest way to world trade industry.  Putin is a bully that want's his lunch money.
we understand why he took crimea back in 2014..his main goal was to facilitate a future invasion.. by controlling the crimea the southern flank is wide open for russsia to invade..and all under the pretense of liberation ..so dastardous...
There logistics did not fail they are regrouping.
Putin is a war criminal. Lock him up
"Not everything you’re claiming is true! You know nothing in reality other than you’ve been able to find as a research! It’s your bias opinion! Mighty USA took 1month to invade a sovereign country like Iraq although it’s a desert and half the size of Ukraine and Iraqis had no sophisticated weapons to defend self , plus Nato was burning the land killing all civilians as they’re subhumans in the west opinion! So Russia did not invade Ukraine or burn the land with mass destruction to conquer the whole country! They said it many times you ignorant bias western propaganda that Russia had to demilitarize and denazify hostile Ukraine to their own people and especially stop genociding Russian society in the Dombask! Extensional efforts for 10yrs were made to stop the expansion of NATO to the boarders of Russia, also no respect to Russia national security! Smbody in the west successfully pushed for this inevitable war and now sitting wiping hands together like a sick old f**k happily seeing Russia struggle and Russians discriminated all around the world just for being Russian! This military situation in Ukraine as long as hard with the west supplying Ukronazis with latest weapons, as long as taking time is going to end up in one way! As Biden said, he’s going to fight there till the last Ukrainian drop of blood! So common stupid blinded ignorant people support those pretending to be democratic blood suckers more!"
"Might not stop the bully attitude, but it damn sure puts them on pause!!!!"
"Good video, thank you"
"Don't forget this conflict is about world trade (Money).  Putin will throw everything at this that he can.  A starving person will take what they can, HOW EVER THEY CAN!  A possible solution would be to include Russia in bargaining chips, instead of shutting them out.  Tell a bully he can't have your lunch, he'll take it by force.  Bring 2 lunches, the bully sits and eats while listening.  They will ALWAYS, ALWAYS, want to know why you had extra, to see if they can position themselves to do the same."

its funny how Putin havent study on the 6 days war where israel Defated the united arab nations whit Air Strikes against their Airfields and then moved in swiftly whit small tank brigades and infantry squads  to wipe out each nation when they are confused and paralyzed. I might get this wrong in the end they defated 3-4 countrys by them self whit support from america and the western world that supplied them whit modern weapons
Never in history would you be able to see a real war with the technology of today
"Ha-ha, this is funny. Keep thinking such way. Russia captured Crimea in a few days, Russia brought a lot of supplies to Syria and established the base there what was unseen by western intelligence, Russia brought a lot of airborne units to Kazakhstan to stabilize situation just in a few days. Your arguments are so wrong because you do not understand that Ukraine is not so hostile to Russia to make total damage to Ukraine and make a safe advance forward. Russia tries to minimize collateral damage and civilian infrastructure."
4.5K+ want war.
Wow Sam on trending
Think of the US response when Russia put missiles on Cuba. Darn near full out nuclear war. Russia is doing the exact same thing cuz once Ukraine joins NATO the US and all of its allies will have fully operational bases every 10 feet along the Ukraine-Russian border.
"The Russians liberators yeah, With rape, torture, hangings, shooting missiles into maternity wards daycare centers gimme a Break. They're trying to break the ukrainians will the Russians are not trying to win hearts and minds they're trying to achieve capitulation.

"I'm commenting to see if my comment actually goes through, or if the internet coding overlords, right wing radical, left wing terrorists, foreign spies and domestic separatists and Youtube despots don't censor my comment because it has an opinion that upsets them 

My comment: Great work covering this. Wars are lost and won through logistics, and its evident that future countries will be able to view this event and parse out geopolitical lessons from Russia's successes and failures. They will learn from the history made here. One person that apparently hasn't learned from Russia's failures is Putin. I'm thinking Finland, I'm thinking Afghanistan, I'm thinking Chechnya, I'm thinking Georgia. With his time on Earth and his vision of Empire slowly crumbling around him, as well as rapidly changing cultures of the 21st century, he goes throwing a Hail Mary effort in a full blown armed conflict to try to take advantage of a supposed weaker nation during it's turbulent time; Putin desperately hoping to risk Russia's international dignity for blood conquest over a misplaced sense of entitlement from irredentism. 

Ultimately results in a big fat L for him, his Kremlin goons, and the poor innocent people of Russia who've been misinformed by him. Lots of lessons to learn here, a live lesson unfolding in global war history."
"Good Video! Now, I understand the need to have a compelling narrative, however, this operation is still ongoing, there are too many known unknowns and unknown unknowns to contend with at the moment, it is virtually unlikely that anyone other than the Russians who planned this operation knows if logistics have failed."
It sounds like the Russian military was designed for defense or very limited offensive actions. They should have used it as designed because it’s not working. To replace those capabilities in the future will cost much more. They’ve taken most of the oil rich areas. When they take the ports there won’t be reason to continue the advance unless they want the entire country not just the oil.
Putin needs to end this with a nukes

You can call this as invading Ukraine to make them a puppet, and in your stupidity you ignored what NATO and US already did in the past. That base you mentioned, NATO already did that in my country. US armed Rebell forces in Kosovo, and when we startet destroying them, they and NATO  intervene and bomb our country. They made puppet state of Kosovo, and largest base in Balkan and Europe, just to get close to Eastern countries, plus they sized resources down there. Well it's time to stop NATO spreading like a plague all in name of peace."

Been watching The Three Kingdoms series and supplies is an oft neglected aspect of war but of critical importance especially when conflict is prolonged. It was true thousands of years ago and it remains true now
"How is it that Wendover, out of the UK, can provide us (here in the US) with a 19-minute video that has more accurate, comprehensive and meaningful information about this war than the ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN networks combined!  Most of what I see on our TV is shots of crying babies, old women running, and the same building with a hole in the front!"
"Because only old people watch TV anymore, so the news caters to them."
"Aside from the moral problem with firing on civilians there is also a significant logistical problem of wasting ammo. The Nazis made this mistake bombing London instead of British air bases during the battle of Britain. Bombs, trains and money are finite. The US has precision bombs, so 1 bomb = 1 tank. With the Russians it's probably 100 shells/rockets to one vehicle or squad. Does anyone think those huge volleys of rockets the russians are firing are doing any real damage?"
I mean the country who needs liberation its not Ukraine but Russian from Putin
You think so eh
"I didn't make a note of it at the time but that fucker Putin invaded on my birthday. Thanks a lot you bastard!

"Also worth mentioning that Russia's railways use 1524mm gauge, while Europe uses 1435mm gauge. For a country that relies heavily on trains to go to war, having a different gauge from your enemy is going to be a major headache."
@WRTYIO p Anything from Germany westward is 1435mm as far as I know
"Wrong.   The former soviet countries including Ukraine and baltics remain 1520, as changing them would be too costly. It's not like WW2 where Germany had the problem going into Soviet Union."
putin is spreading he's forces  thin same as the ZZ of ww2  that's how they lost  GREED   very little competent  forces  the rest are conscript mentality
Let's hope UKRAINE comes out victorious!
What unbearable stupidity! Just a heap of hypothesis without one single proof. Or almost.
"It just shows how without modern technology , how good the logistics in ww2 were that they could  organize armies of 3 million men and go from Berlin to Crimea or stalingrad.

@Canis Lupus You are correct. The stats I quoted from Wikipedia do indeed indicate that only a SIZABLE CHUNK of Soviet equipment came from the U.S.

"What a joke of an invasion. It looks like the Russian didn’t think this through. Almost as if Putin alone planned the whole thing overnight. I feel sorry for both the Ukrainian and Russian people, all having their fate decided by this lunatic clown"
Look at all of the other countries that Russia has invaded compared to Ukraine Ukraine is the largest. Russia can easily dominate a small country one at a time but to take on a land mass like Ukraine alone let alone any other bordering country would be an even bigger mistake. While Russia is failing in Ukraine every other country that they have attacked should be attacking Russia they can't beat you all at the same time they can barely handle Ukraine lol

"Ukraine had no intention to attack russia. Putin repeats himself - he attacked Georgia and the rebels in Syria the same way. Strange that Georgia didnt want to attack russia and syrians wanted democracy. What is the problem of Putin with democracy? Its clear people live better in a democracy. So come on you really believe in Putins lies? He said we wont attack civlians in syria - 6000 died - 1900 children. We wont attack Ukraine - he did. Its just a manover, troops already go back. thats just a part of mr liar Putin. Proof me wrong he said that ALL. I dont know how a man with the name Marwan can believe him. One of my best friends is syrian and his name is Marwan, he was bombed by russia in syria. And now my ukrainian friends are bombed by Putin in Kyiv. All civilians. Not fanatics but peaceful people. Wake up and stop to support Putin."
"A few days ago an 11 year old kid came to our country alone, with a phone number on his hand. News say they fled syria when he was a kid and now he had to flee from ukraine alone..."
Came to those conclusions via Western Media? .... lolololololol
The US is short on transport ships. Hopefully with this info the US shores up its own weaknesses.
It's ridiculous for people to think the 40 mile convoy is a logistic failure. Why don't you try to attack it and we will see if you will even get close. The convoy should tell you that they are not planning to leave Ukraine anytime soon when the invasion is over. That is why the US keep on talking about establishing a government in exile. The convoy will gradually reduce in size as they conquer land. You just don't understand how they operate. Packing the convoys in Russia and bringing them to patrol Ukraine after the dust settles will be a strategic flaw and would create delays and loopholes. They have aircover for the convoy.
@Usul573 This is just like the ghost of Kiev story. Time would prove that these claims are false.
"@Michael Osei No not really, most of this happened back in Operation Barbarossa where the Soviet forces had 2 MILLION men captured and 500,000 dead in about five months. They lost 20,000 tanks and countless planes destroyed on the ground. Happened in the Winter War too, piss poor issues there as well!"
@Usul573 These stories of logistic failures would appear ridiculous when the invasion is over.
"@Usul573 If it had been stored for that long, wouldn't they didn't know?  Is this their first time going for such operations? Most of the vehicles are well tested and even took part in their drills. Maybe their mode of operation is strange but it is effective and it's has been well tested. These are the same methods they used in Africa and Syria. The progress they have made suggests that they have had little failures eventhough they are  trying as much as possible to avoid civilian casualties. The only major problems they have had is the failing humanitarian corridors in the past 3day which seem to be in the interest of the Ukrainians. The Russian government made a statement that they are almost done with achieving their major goals. 75% of the demilitarization of was completed about 3 days ago. When you have US officials about an evitable government in exile and in the worst case scenario, the death of Zelensky, then you know it's over."
"@Michael Osei Yes, they are crap quality that were stored for too long and were old, under the wrong circumstances they are failing rapidly as we can see, plus supply lines being ambushed. It's just basic science, and confirmed by inspecting all the abandoned vehicles when they go look for food."
"well Russian started the operation a bit soft and humanitarian. They didn't bombed the barracks which is something what USA would do.They ware after the ukrainian Nazi regime and didn't what a lot of casualtys ,hence they gone wrong. That should vanish all barracks and weaken the unkranian army prior to invasion ,like US would do."
🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻🇺🇦🌻
"Wow, Ukraine out here really playing and mastering the No Step Back DLC."
"I would recommend also looking at Task & Purpose's breakdown of the Russian invasion. While there are definitely logistics issues, this should be considered as expected. There are almost always logistics issues when the plan actually takes place. However, Russia also has different doctrine and is more willing to take losses. I could go into more detail, and this is not to be pro-Russian, but the Russians should not be underestimated. Again,  Task and Purpose's breakdown better helps to look at it from the Russian strategic vision."
"ofc, he doesnt care about losses, he outnumbers them greatly ... he should be afraid of russian tanks heading back to moscow."
The US is going to find Putin hiding in dug-out hole-in-the-ground after a six month search to answer for war crimes....
"As much as I hate to say it, videos which tell Russia what it's doing wrong could help them win the war. I can't possibly be the first to come to this conclusion, and I don't know if I'm the first to comment on it, but the less Russia knows, the better. I doubt that anyone in the Kremlin is watching your video and taking it seriously, but one never knows. I'm against the Russian invasion, just to make that crystal clear."
"this video is quite delayed, they already know everything from twitter where everything takes place, from the hacking of radios to the news about tanker vehicles and all that"
"""......actual OPINIONS""? so your disseminating OPINONS as FACTS?
It seems the BANKSTERS have taken over ALL MEDIA!
when Fox and CNN say the same thing you know we are being manipulated into ANOTHER WAR"
"The Russians haven't even achieved tactical air superiority let alone dominating the whole of Ukraine. Until they do their pre-invasion goals will never be realized. The Ukrainians require more sophisticated Western anti-air and anti-armor weapons. In the guts department, they seem to have that well under control.
Long Live Ukraine!"
So just the stereotypical brute: strong but dumb.
amogus!
"There is a factor of motivation that should be included also. Russians have no motivation for this war other than a direct orders, meanwhile Ukrainians are fierce, backed by continuous support of ammo and weapons from the west and defending their home. Also- putin hiding in the bunker in attacking side vs charming Zelensky, who won the world with his reckless determination and patriotism- all that spells doom for russian army and to be honnest- russia itself. Great nit picking on logistics"
"At times I felt like I was reading a reddit thread. Who cares if amateur radio operators's jams look like something special on spectrum analyzers? Talking about the looting as if it was a widespread phenomenon. Every invasion has logistics problems, singular incidents like these don't really matter, they's good for ukrainian propaganda but don't matter in the big picture."
"Using railroads for logistics is very doable defensively, but not offensively. In Ukraine, the Russian army went 250 km deep into enemy territory, without having the human means to control (a little...) anything other than the main roads. Faced with the many heavily armed Ukrainian regular soldiers operating in these territories, behind the Russian armored vanguards, the Russian supply convoys suffered heavy losses. Which stifles the Russian offensive. Not to mention the resistance of Ukrainian armored forces and artillery, from the front. Overall the Ukrainian army avoids concentrating in order to avoid giving the Russian air force or artillery easy targets. (It's a great lesson for all other armies. And it's something the Iraqi army didn't face the US in 1991.) The technique of attacking Soviet supply convoys instead tank groups, highly protected, was used in the summer of 1944, in Belarus, by the Luftwaffe after the outbreak of the great Soviet summer offensive (""Bagration"")."

"What's your take on the situation, then? Make sure to provide proof too, you're the one who cares so much about that"
The determination of the Ukrainian people is all they need
"Failed?
That's hysterical!"
Cope
"Even  if   Russia  somehow  takes Ukraine.     God  forbid.      It   will  take  billions  if not  trillions  of   dollars to  rebuild.              Instead  of       helping  his  own   people  at   home,     Putin   has   spent   the     money  of Mother   Russia   trying   to   enslave,   murder  and demoralize people in another   nation.   His   borders  are  wide   open  for  the   Chinese  or  other  mercenaries  to  waltz  in  at  any  time."
Ukraine is very rich in resources and has great soil for production
"""Please keep in mind that this comments section is very likely to have disinformation actors/trolls due to the nature of this conflict. It's likely not representative of actual opinions.""

Hm.. i am confused. Is this fear of another opinion or is it the hybris to be the only bearer of knowledge ?

Whatever, your video shows nothing then Friend of a friend bullcrap, and nothing actual.
So pllease do not present it., like this is ""the truth"""
"This Russian invasion has shown just how atrociously poor their military forces actually are, even when waging war on their own doorstep!

Their utter ineptitude and serial failings are seen by the world as the reality of their appallingly low levels of readiness and capability, against the Russians false narrative of them being superior forces.

Their degree of failure is so great that putin put into law that any person, group or news outlets and journalists providing truthful, independent reporting will face 15 years in prison.

That is in addition to blocking every independent news outlet from broadcasting to Russia."
"Every dash cam crash video you see is in Russia, no shit they can't do logistics and be coordinated. They can barely fucking drive down the street."
Its because russian insurance only pays if you have the accident on dashcam ... more dashcam=more dashcam footage.
"The Russians are keeping their objective close to their hat and they have the ability to flatten Ukraine , don’t you think it’s strange that their air power is limited and their convoy is jus sitting there !! What you think they don’t have oil and Gas !!!! Please don’t be a fool , you are playing a dumb game , Putin didn’t evade to destroy !!! He is testing the NATO response !!  However China is also taking notes !!!!"
This is more of an opinion and not based on facts
"well, they planned to achieve, what they didnt in a shorter time, so where do you think they failed?"
does anyone believe that russia could not have air superiority .if so they are deluded
They don't.
"Zalynsky is a criminal a corrupt aristocratic Despot, waging war in KIEV to protect himself, and destroying any aristocratic holdings they are prone to lose as criminal sabotage."
"heh, correct me if im wrong, buttt isnt it russia who is destroying kiev?"
"While not a major factor here, the US changed from their previous warfighting doctrine to the Air-Land-Battle version BECAUSE it took advantage of the centralized way the Soviet military did logistics and C&C. Because it didn't matter they had 10 tanks to your one if they didn't have fuel or parts.

I laughed at the fact they were using paper maps. I find this funny because in the old Soviet army, maps were *classified* - Kill that one tank with the VERY prominent antenna and you just killed the one officer with the map. At least in the Ukraine, the Russians can read the signs...at least the ones that are there. Imagine these same soldiers fighting in Western Europe where they can't read the signs. 

It also boggles my mind about the radios. I've been out of the military since 2017 and yet I still catch myself using radio protocols when talking to my companies day patrol over the radio. By this I mean I only talk for a little bit, say ""Break"" wait a second and then continue on. This would make it harder for an enemy to track my location and drop artillery on us.

The fact that the Russians are basically on open freqs is STAGGERING!  Putin better not ever think of matching his troops against US/NATO troops as we'll be able to rain artillery shells with pinpoint accuracy...assuming the Air Force & Navy aviation leaves us anything.

(Fun fact: Back during the Cold War, the US Navy had more fighter planes than the Soviet Air Force!)"
"Also, even back in the Cold War era, the smallest unit that the Soviets could deploy that could mostly feed, fuel and feed itself was a Regiment (Brigade) whereas in the US Army, it is a **Company**

The fact that the Russians still have a separate logistics unit is telling. Sure the US has the same thing, but the separate units are higher echelon ones used to help **supplament** the existing logistics already built into the system.

It's the same way as why higher level US military units like a division has some extra units which supplement what's in the maneuver units. They're there to exploit weaknesses or to help shore up a unit in trouble."
Autocratic?
How can you make a documentary when the conflict is still happening... am I the only one disgusted by wendover?....
Some people want to be informed on current events instead of waiting for the war to end for a nice all-in-one exclusive DVD documentary
"If they really wanted,it was over in 3 days"
"Putin has deemed this video ""Fake Media""  and has issued a warrant for your arrest."
A brilliant video.  It shows why such a big army can't  defeat a small one fast
Hey there great channel and videos. I learn so much just by watching and then researching. But I'd like to see a video on world hunger from a logistical perspective
Tbh they could be making people focus on their economic stand point to distract them from what they are actually doing.
Fu.. them nuke them and build a water land after
"Outstanbding video! Your videos just keep getting better! Thanks. And, yes, I did subscribe to CuriosityStream on your recommendation."
That's why Russia should be kicked out of Syria and Libya. Preventing them from having bases in the ME and north Africa must be the main focus of EU leaders
The buildup have him away. The Ukrainian people are putting up a fight they was unexpected.
Very informative
Every Russian should feel ashamed of themselves.
"@Gergő Gaál lol, sounds like a perfect balance. I’ll try."
@Natalya Navotnaya Be 50% ashamed and 50% proud soooo just be normal.
And what if someone is 50% Russian and 50% Ukrainian?
"NATO (united states) has been sending weapons to Ukraine and training the Ukrainians for years, effectively turning ukraine into a de facto NATO member. Russia had enough of NATOs aggression and will ensure its own border safety and geopolitical sovereignty through its only remaining method of diplomacy, war.  NATO is such a garbage of an alliance. Only through painting Russia as the devil can it justify its own existence."
"@lyin4rmu dont get me wrong there is a Lot wrong with Nato. But logicly it is Not a threat. For given reasons. 
And the russians never wanted to join. Except a small period of time like a year long.
Expanding. Well the baltic and east europeen states wanted to join. Because as we see now russia is actually a threat If you are Not in Nato."
@s H if NATO is not a threat then why did it not allow russia to join it while continuously expanding into russia? a military alliance that wont let you join but keep getting closer to your border is a hostile action. not to mention that nato is essentially the european arm of the united states and all nato members have united states military assets stationed there. putin wanted to join nato to promote peace in the european region and move russia towards eurocentrism but nato in all its wisdom would rather have russia as an enemy.
"I think your perception about Russian logistics supply support is wrong , they have it, they are practicing for whole winter on border .
 what really happened that they didn't consider it in such high demand , they plan a short first/ last defence fight & day or two every thing over just as in Crimea .
Surprise effect is that Ukrainian President Zelenskiyi rather runaway/ surrender stand up to fight back .
When two days had past of Russian invasion , US get active & looks as opportunity to settle score&  make Ukraine the next Afganistan for Russia, involve from it satellite surveillance/ intelligence & is giving input to Ukraine military for pin point accuracy of attacking prowess. It looks as US is in direct control of conflict & authority & Ukrainian Army is some hire militia group .
Ukraine is a play ground there .& the Ukrainian President  is such a stupid that he himself destroyed his own country fighting a war which is not meant for it .
It is dirty politics there & there is no conception of free world , it is a dirty world"
"Honestly embarrassing, no country in the world should take the Russian military seriously. Like, ever."
"It's in a pretty sad state, but if they got more money, training, industrial output, and upgrades across a fair bit of time, watch out."
"moron in georgia they had also toiletseats and carpets on armor ..hostages and human shields as well , altho tunnel into mountain was made in 1955 ,somehow they managed populate and lie that ancient nation sud b saved . not very long distances ,maybe they are just maradeurs?"

"Failed logistics? huh? the russia/ukraine kill ratio will be extremely one sided. were they slower than anticipated..sure...but war cares nothing about opinions or the media...it's only focus is 'kill or be killed'. Russians (and chinese) laugh at us Americans as we report on their 'poor tactics' or 'disorganization'. They look at us as lazy, disoriented (due to tiktok, facebook, etc), ungrateful and worst of all....easy prey. make no mistake, our great grandchildren will likely be speaking mandarin."
"If Putin was man enough he would have act like Volodymyr Zelenskyy, instead of hiding underground and living like cockroaches!"
"the difference is that zelenskyy doesnt have to be afraid of their own people, because hes not rotten"
"haha...you neomarxists on the left are so predictable in your childish responses to any sort of challenge.  Smear it, dictate one sided rules of the debate or just openly censor the conflicting argument..  Garbage NATO propaganda and I say this as an American who lived through the real cold war in the 80's."
Poland has already agreed to hand over all its MIGs to US AF base in Germany. To be shipped by US to Ukraine. Polish government just announced that Poland gives  all 28 Polish MIG-29 fighter jets to USA so USA can give these Polish MIG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine for special military operations. In exchange Poland expects that USA will give 28 F-16 planes to Poland. Poland expects that other countries will do the same.
Very informative. Well done.
"I really believed USarmy power ,russia army is much weaker than the US"
"Who'd a thunk it?...War, what is it good for?"
"It's interesting that Russia doesn't seem to learn from their previous mistakes. Their over confidence leads to lack of flexibility. If they had simply planned for the possibility of it extending longer than 2-3 days they would have done significantly better and avoided embarrassment. At that point the West probably wouldn't have gone as harsh on the sanctions either because there wasn't as much to gain if the war was already over. Glad they weren't prepared, it has only made Ukraine stronger."
@umerk22 I had 2 strokes trying to read your comment.
@Babel Huber Like Russia when the USSR collapsed.

"Excellent analysis! No computer voice! Bravo, well done!  BTW the U.S. uses both push and pull depending on what phase of the operation. At some point, the transition must occur. Generally push is used in pre-packaged supply groups-but a lot of them, when time is critical (use what you need). Pull is too slow at the start of operations and used when rear lines are relatively secured.."
Zelensky is a snake throwing his people to the fire
Doesn’t this video actually help the Russians?  😂😂😂😂
I love how suddenly everyone became such an expert
"They quit their job as microbiologists and virus experts for social media.

Paper Bear…
By now the Russian military has been revealed to be weak. Putin is lucky that Germany is not armed as it was 20 years ago. 500 Leopard 2 and 100 Panzerhaubitze 2000 used the way the Bundeswehr applies its tanks and artillery would shred the Russian army to pieces.
"Hey, where you got your sources my friend?"
Am I the only one who noticed America's military logistics..'we will provide you with what you want and need'..emulates the capitalist system while Russia's military logistics..'we will supply you with what we think you need'..emulates a state-planned economy.
"LOL ""failed logistics""?  The war has just begun folks.  You millenials need to brush up on your knowledge about nuclear weapons"
@AliceFoxxo gee I don't know.. please tell me
"Do you even know the definition of ""logistics"", Pete?"
Weapons sitting in a warehouse is not the same as logistics.
Irrelevant
"oh no, that molotov was made wrong. You don't want there to be an unsealed opening unless you want to be covered in napalm"
When you plan something so complicated and uncertain i believe they looked all possible situations. Yes they believed it was going to be like Afghanistan first hours or Georgia but in Chechnya was little different. I believe now they go to plan B. It looks like they play football only in the half terrain! So the result is victory with more casualties or i am wrong? In modern military history is  there something similar? I hope I get un answer! Thank you for the professional analysis!
"The power of tiktok. 😅

🇺🇲✌"
Allah AKHBAR Putin!!!
"Tanks are useless piece of crap nowadays, nothing but show. Way too slow, and with all the guided missiles we have nowadays, they are such easy targets for a Javelin footsoldier (not like those classic RPG's from WW2 where you had to get close to the tank, that was very risky). Not to mention a fucking drone takes out many tanks with ease. You can take out a small tank army with a few nasty drones. Because it moves like a snail. Easy pickings for an eagle. I mean c'mon, what warfare is Russia playing? Definately not modern warfare..."
"This ignores *why* russia depended on completely unencrypted communication: their encrypted communication relied in cell towers.... which they decided to target early on in their invasion.

The russians themselves are the reason why they don't have secure comms."
This is pure propaganda
Ok bot
"Oh, lookie, Jacob just learned the word propaganda"
"Also note that the ""cope cages"" on the russian tanks don`t really do anything against a Javelin, just makes the tank even more visible."
"@Carbon 12 
Which are also filled with cardboard…"
They can be handy if they decided to loot IKEA for some Wardrobes to strap the roof before going back home
"@Carbon 12  Reactive Armor gets defeated by 2-stage projectiles, though, and as far as I know, Javelins have no issue with it. And even if the inside of the tank doesn't get penetrated, the vehicle will no longer be usable. Its optics and other hardware would be destroyed by the blast or the shock wave from the explosion. There aren't tanks rolling around that took a direct hit from one."
"The Germans used to put them on their tanks in WW2. They are at least a luggage rack and you can hang your laundry on it. in all seriousness they give protection from thrown things and from buildings collapsing and so on. Not to understate their utility- you can strap a lot of useful things on there- particularly with the logistical issues.

There is no evidence they are for javelin defence, and every evidence they are useful in urban warfare and with logistical issues, both are the situation in Ukraine. With the reactive armour and turret design, it is a rather sensible choice imho."
"@jarrod nash They have reactive armour against direct fire, which is much more protective"
No its not failed logistics!
whatdoyoumeaaaan failed logistics? its all plaaaaned 🤣🤣

What better logistics for a war than next door to your country and not in a foreign country 1000’s of miles away

What is the purpose of the disturbing plink-plonk in the background? So disturbing I leave the channel.
Very informative 👍.
When compared to the US attack of Iraq this is just a sad attempt
"Remember chechnya when russians got their logistic vehicles destroyed?
Seems they didn't learn the lesson."
"In the words of a German WW2 officer ""I knew we can't win the war when we captured a US soldier and found out that in his possession was a birthday cake he got from his mother. If they can waste transport logistics to get a fucking birthday cake to the front, we can't compete""."
@Gergő Gaál you sound goofy
Well by the time the us got involved they were already losing sooo it wasnt JUST the birthday cake :D
"The question is, what date did they say that? It was a very long and brutal war."
"A lot of things people need to keep in when criticizing the UN Is that, in a lot of cases they can't do anything because said nation is a member of the big five, or possesses nuclear weapons, sometimes both, and unless all five agree, which they never will, the UN will never be able to serve its purpose. And yes, the UN is useless, and I agree that it doesn't really do much, but a lot of times, this is why."
"Nato and the West is cheerleading Zelensky into war with Russia and they will probably continue to do so until the last Ukranian, whats sad is that it seems Zelensky is falling for it. This is imoral and a double standard,  Look at the humanitarian disaster caused by NATO in Afganistan, Irak, Kosovo, Lybia and many more, yet no one sactions them, (western imperialist privilege), they are extreme agresor thugs. look at the Wests terible double Standards, when Israel invade and anex Palestine and anexes the Golan heights from Syria, no one sactions them,  when Saudia Arabia bombs and destroys a whole nation such as Yemen and creats the worst human catastrophy in the 21st centuary, the West applauds them, NATO does nothing and of course will not sacntion the Saudis, because Britain and USA sales billions in wepons to them.  what disgusting hypocracy, my best wishes for the Ukranian peoples.     NATO acts tough with nations that have a weak military, but when it faces an adversary of the same size (like Russia) it runs scared and leaves Ukrain alone, what cowards, the bully only picks on people much smaller than itself. Another point that no one talks about, is the Russian oligararch money that the British economy and the Tories have silently benefited from."
"If you wanna make a point, and write an essay in the youtube comments, try to lead with something less idiotic, so people will actually read what you have to say ... maybe the rest is not that stupid, i for one, will never know."
"in other words , ""western"" forces are designed for conquering"
@Mirko You could make your point clearer by stating it clearly and directly.  Your point seems to be that your dear friend Putin started a war of  conquest with an army that is no good at conquering things.
"@Michael Sommers you are acting a fool are are one , how could i make my point more obvious"
All armies are. Some are just better at it than others.
"Confusion to the enemy, in this case Putins army,"
Can someone tell me more about the pictures around 16:07 ?
This is how Hitler started too that's history all over again you fools
"No.Where Hitler made a mistake.  Attack with heavy equipment in winter spring change. Terrain in one or two weeks will be freezing mud. The more movement the more mud. Tanks have difficulty in deep mud and wheeled vehicles don't do mud period. Blowup a few 20 to 50 meter sections of road  and the convoy is trapped and off the board.  
Napoleon made the same mistake with wagons,carts, wheeled cannon in winter spring action.
Putin second mistake. He has forgotten the lesson of urban combat in Afghanistan. Defender has a huge advantage. This time there is a lot more defenders with a lot more and better  weapons."
Semand driven supply chain is tha shit
This is like an episode of The Simpsons. Dictator sends his army to invade a country with fucking babymonitors for communications and no possibility of refueling or having something to eat so the soldiers just freezing on the sidewalks. And then Putin finds out all the money meant for military was stolen by his oligarks. SLAVA UKRAINI and to the world: we HAVE to find a way to destroy putin and his mafia mob so ordinary Russian people can start living free also!
"Documentarists need to stop saying ""x miles or y kilometers"". Don't bother with miles. Even among Americans, only idiots need to be told distances in miles."
🤣🤣 sarcasm right? 🤣🤣😂😆 🥲 right? 🤨😐😑
Only idiots use inferior units such as meters when miles are available.
I'm not shocked how out of touch the Russian soldiers were with the Ukrainian thinking. The amount of lack in knowledge with all of the Russians I argued with on social media was off the charts. They still think their war in Afghanistan was justified and highly more successful than what the US did.
"Very insightful, thank you"
Yeah such a failure they control the whole country
"If all they wanted to achieve was an iron wall, and people shooting at them, yea they totally control the situation"
Not even close.  Can't you read maps?
"The stupid vatniks really botched this, how the fuck does that even happen?"
History repeat blizcreg no logistical support failed from the begining.  Bad planing rush to judgment. No common since.  You don't put soldiers to combat with out sufficient fuel food and ammunition on hand.  That's being suicidal.
It's pronounced Kiev isn't it? Not keev
wow. this is incredible. so well done and researched!! everyone should watch this!!
When EVERY video you watch on youtube tells you that the algo is not going to promote them because of subject matters... And you got to them by the algo.

@Steve Downing Thanks!
Good luck man 🤞
"Superb video, really good!"
I hadn't considered the logistical failures in light of their in-country capability and running fuel piping through the warzone. Thanks for increasing my knowledge on this topic.
"this proves, that Russia is not a threat to Europe. Russia has no intensions or capabilities to invade it. This war is about us protecting from NATO."

Enjoyed that.
"Remember, it is not a WAR, but a special military operation to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine.
One simple thing needs to be understood. The Kiev Banderonazi regime must be eliminated. In any form, this power could not exist in principle. If I may say so, these people were only able to organize punitive actions against the civilian population and hide behind them. when it smelled fried. This power is an occupation power and seeks to fulfill the order of the United States and NATO to create a military springboard for them against Russia. The main reason for that. what happened is this unjustified, brazen, purposeful and extremely dangerous aggressive offensive by NATO against our country. The creation of such a fascized anti-Russian Ukraine fits perfectly into this concept. The advance of the alliance's military infrastructure to the Russian border is most similar to the disposition of the Wehrmacht troops in 1941. This poses a colossal threat to the whole world. Completely ignoring our demands to stop this expansion, the United States left Russia no choice. In response to the refusal to provide us with a regime of equal security, we switched to a regime of creating counter-threats - a regime of equal danger. We have made it clear that we will not allow anyone to create threats of various kinds on our historical lands and will respond if we consider that diplomacy has reached an impasse. The abscess burst after it became obvious that the cannibalistic neo-Nazi Russophobic regime, sponsored by the United States and the EU, pumped up with weapons, prepared to seize the DPR and LPR by force, arranging a real massacre there, and is also ready to withdraw from the Budapest Memorandum and create its own atomic bomb. For eight years, the US and the EU have openly supported targeted terror, in fact, the genocide of the population of Donbass and the oppression of millions of Russians in Ukraine. The West bears full responsibility for the establishment of this regime and its numerous crimes. And it's time to bring the owners of this regime to justice. The West is afraid of retribution and that even its own audience will be shown its true Nazi murlo behind the mask of a Democrat. This explains the desperate desire to hide the truth about the true cause of this war. This explains all the lies and Russophobic hysteria of Western media prostitutes who have been working for years according to Goebbels' manuals using modern information technologies. It became clear that the Nazi ideology is quite a natural state of Western elites and they are less able to hide it as their world order fades. It is obvious that Russia will put an end to this war and this is only the first of many of our steps to ensure our security in the face of the West's refusal to create military threats to us. We have no right to tolerate the revival of Nazism and the presence of a foreign military machine on our historical lands."
"@idpro83 people suffer, still afraid to talk about the government."
I wonder how our special economic operations are doing in Putins Russia. 🤔
"A really interesting video. The Russian Army - despite all its posturing in the last years - apparently is just as incompetent as it always used to be. And as so often the Russians managed - by using the time-honored concept of maskirovka - ""We are producing missiles like sausages"" comes to mind - to convince the enemy that they are powerful. The West completely fell for this nonsense."
Und auf einmal hat jeder den durchblick. Vor allem die Englisch sprachigen Kasper!
"For anyone brave enough to delve into the various subreddits in which information from this conflict is being shared in almost real time, you will start to get a pretty good understanding of how this conflict is beginning to unfold. Russia, to the rest of the world, currently looks as though it can't even sustain a war on its own doorstep, or maintain supply routes despite having control over three quarters of Ukraine's borders. It's aircraft are now having to operate at night to limit the risk of Ukrainian air defences, their vehicles are being destroyed or abandoned en masse, they're failing to take key cities and their troops are appearing less equipped than the ones before it.
In the early days we saw lots of Russian propaganda showing hoards of Chechen units all armed to the teeth. There were rumours that Russian Special Forces were en route. We were hearing that all the best Russian equipment was yet to come etc. etc.

The longer this war goes on the more it will become apparent that the Russians have absolutely no clue how to fight this conflict. They've plunged their economy to a point of no return, no one will trade with them, China has distanced itself and Ukraine has seen more western support, arming and funding than Putin could ever have appreciated."
"@ᛁᛚᛋᛅ ᛏᚱᚢᛏᚾᛁᚴ The question is wether russia will learn from this. Yes, right now it seems the russian army will be incapable of doing any real damage to europe as a whole in a military conflict. But that doesn't neccesarily mean that it will stay this way."
Anticipated? Srry to be that guy
I don't understand why Russia aims to take the entire Ukraine right away? why not take the territory one by one? Build bases and straighten the logistics until they reach kiev. Aren't they familiar with GO strategy? Seems their army is inexperienced as a virgin teen.
"""It all happened so quickly"" 

No, it took almost a decade.."
Pukin and his CLOWNS!
Hungry and unprepared Russian soldiers. Where have I seen this before ?
"Oh my lord, I've never imagined that so much bullcrap and misinformation can be gathered in one fairytale for the dumb naive masses. Btw, the ONLY reason the conflict is not over yet is that russians are being careful with civilians and civilian infrastructure. Oh, and how about that nazi ""azov"" ""tornado"" battalions that are hiding behind civilians, any thoughts on that? By the way, GOOGLE ""tornado nazi ukraine"", you'll be delighted! Hope you'll do a video about them!"
"I just watched a video about a tank killing an elderly couple in their vehicles, checked the comments, they were describing another video, where a man, a kid and his dog got bombed ... they have the video from the kids phone if you wanna watch how careful russians are with civilians, i could not watch it, i didnt even want to see the elderly couple."
The whole section of the video on nebula is absolutely confusing. No link to it in the description either ?
The 21 st century doing this
"Fuck, i thought it was Putin, but it must just be the stars aligning or solar flares"
"I know it doesn't fit neatly into a conversation about logistics, but it is worth mentioning that Russia's military leadership and conscript training has also been exposed as completely inadequate. A competent leader would have been able to rally the forces, avoid the wasteful and immoral bombardments, and have been able to predict these headaches well in advance of the attack.

And I think the low morale of the Russian soldiers - who weren't even briefed on what they were doing or why - plays a large part in how the war has turned out. They can't just desert, but they can stall and hold back from the front, which may be why the fighting has become a matter of long-range artillery."
"@FollowTheSpirit Wait, I read this as sarcasm but on second thought you might actually just be agreeing with me."
"@FollowTheSpirit ""Controlling"" not really. They have a presence there, but have only captured one city so far (and the population there continues to resist the occupation).
They were expecting to have complete air supremacy on the first day and to conquer Kyiv within  a couple of days, but failed

And yes, they ARE falling apart. Their soldiers are going hungry, communications jammed and intercepted, vehicles breaking down, mass surrenders, infantry extremely reluctant to fight hence the emphasis on artillery and armoured vehicles, plus 2 of their generals are already dead. It's anyone's guess as to whether their violation of 5 ceasefires in a row is down to dishonest intentions or incompetent commanders.

And all for what? A country they can't hold EVEN IF they manage to win, hundreds of billions of dollars lost, thousands dead and pariah status. Whether they push through or retreat, Putin's regime will not survive."
Russia is justified in its invasion of Ukraine.
"@Gergő Gaál Indian ties are good most nations, Ukraine and NATO nations included. Anyway, this isn’t a debate in cow protection but it’s a very bleak picture you are painting of all Indians based on isolated cases of mob violence in a very big country with a very diverse and large population."

It's all lies
"Ukraine Spetsnaz need to move over the border and seek out Fuel depots, and resupply points. Destroy, them and seek out  Locomotive's  100 miles in  side  Russia. They  are not guarding   the rail lines that  deep inside, they do not have the man power. A javelin is stand off and C4 is close up. Blow  them in chock  points if possible."
Logistics the big headache of all armys.
"This is phenomenal, I will looking into signing up for a subscription. Amazing documentary, thank you."
"The issue is that the US and NATO think they won the Cold War; Russia and China never considered that it was over. Hopefully, no one falls for the ruse that Russia is playing on the world and Ukraine. They've only committed 1/3 of their troops and equipment with conscripts and inferior equipment making the bulk of the frontline troops - the first wave. The first wave is a pawn to weaken the Ukraine military and is seen as cannon fodder. Once they estimate that the rest of the world has gone back to their partisan politics and are more worried about gas prices than the Ukraine, the will commit their best troops and equipment. It's all according to plan."
"They did win it ... maybe they thought it was over, while it wasnt, but they achieved the stuff they wanted to."
They should start playing säkkijärven polkka on the radios for psychological warfare
"Bree-ansk 
😆"
so we basically need to drop some bombs on some pieces of railroad in order to cripple russian mobility
So when  does the Special Military operation in Russia  began???
"According to CNN and MSNBC, Ukrainian forces have now counter-attacked and have crossed the border into Russia and Belarus. More than 50,000 Russians have been killed, wounded, and captured. The glorious forces of Ukraine have only suffered 100 casualties in total ... as per US intelligence. Thank you for listing your sources. I will share this video with the entire world."
"Ukraine is Putin's ""precious"".  He actually looks like Gollum.  LOL"
"Hilarious when an American (or Canadian??) voice says ""but the rest of the world saw it as war"" little realizing most populations of most countries have not favoured the US govt. narratives for decades. Only in political and corporation circles is the policing of the globe by a country that drops bombs every day and has done for over 20 years seen as conducive to world peace. But US hegemony is rapidly declining and the miscalculations of its governments since 1990 are best seen in its military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sadly, this video has no idea of the Kremlin's objectives and is simply going with NATOs dubious narratives. While Putin may want to destroy Ukraine's infrastructure (although this is counter intuitive to his objectives, so unlikely) he has no intention of repeating the blunders NATO made in Iraq 2. No explanation why Putin launched the operation in Feb/March, Mid Winter? I would help but I would just be labelled a troll.."
I just wanna point out that it's better to scramble road signs instead of dismounting them.
"Slava Ukraini! 🇺🇦

Thank you Wendover Productions!"
"I wanted to watch, but I can't listen to the Youtuber uptalk voice affectation."
It genuinely baffles me that in the year 2022 run and gun tactics are still even a considerable option by any military power
Shitskrieg in progress
This video will some day be shown in classrooms
It's not Shock and Awe. That's more NATO style.
"That is exactly the main porpouse of the tanks, you are so used to US 
army movie tactics you forgot about the real world !!!!!! think for a 
second, they will not risk having a full tank on any vehicule!!! think 
please, remember WWII tanks were armoured bombs, NONE of them had a full
 tank neither !!!! hahajaja"
"hhahajaja your completly underestimating russian tactics, you say they abandoned tanks out of fuel, OFCOURSE they will abondon it is only a means to an end, also asking civil for directions, thats the pickup line brooo, they will ask for simple information about people evacuating to have a better view on things D A M N better than radar dont you think haajajajajaah your are very biased by US thinking, and also looting grocery stores is part of their fun !!! you think below 0 temperatures and blazing bullets are fun, f a k that im looting the grocery store also !!!!"
dude is funny it was like only 2 or 3 videos showing tanks out of fuel that's probably less than 10% of their tanks
"Russia lost 11,000 soldiers in 15 days USA only lost 2455 in 19 years and 10 months lmao. They are failing hard."
tldr - russian army is pathetic and genocidal when they cant feign their way to a victory.
Very well presented. Thank you.
"the footage used at 16:55 is of the Tianjin Explosion in China on Aug. 12, 2015. It was a chemical warehouse explosion that killed 173 people. Just wanted to point that out."
"Stop saying Keeeeev, what the fug is keeeev"
When will Nebula be on ROKU???
This is a con.
Russia is going to win lol. The cope is unreal. Imagine shilling for the State Department.
Cry
imagine simping for a dictator. cringe
War is a game of logistics.
"It's too early to say Russia's invasion failed, since it only took 9 days until March 5th. Do anyone remember that how many days US occupied Iraq? 40 days."
@Phillip Lee yes every hour that passes
"he has lost close to 11,000 soldiers in 15 days USA only lost 2455 in 19 years and 10 months in Afghanistan. Yes Russia has failed"
So nice to see your video without your jokes
"Question to this MORON Zelensky was ( be neutral and stop shelling the f8ck out of your own people for 7 years)  He said NO and would rather point missiles at Russia and kill his own populace.
I say he needs to lose badly."
I blame Biden for this war
Okay now I have to book an appointment
Outstanding video!
Anonymous is def not AMATEUR
"Nah, they kinda are."
"""Fighting for Peace is like F....g for virginity""  The only way for peace is to stop fighting in order to stop the unnecessary and murderous bloodshed of these brother countries. Throwing oil into the fire or just replicating propaganda, no matter which side has zero value. Peace can only be achieved via diplomatic dialogue with russia and ukraine sitting at a round table and the entire world listening and working for a common goal that keeps all happy. Instead of sending weapons - offer a platform for peace talks. Ucraine has been led to believe they could win this war. The longer it takes the more unnecessary blood shed that is a fact. This war cannot be won by Ucraine, Russia may escalate further to keep their face. This is a deadly and disgusting strategy, which seems to be the geopolitical aim of a globalist geopolitical strategy , An ugly trap that may kill all of us if the nuclear option comes into the war strategy - War only creates losers on all sides!"
Thanks
"A new modern power has born, adjacent to the existing executive power, legislative power, judicial power, the press power and the new one that is the social media power. Then, strategists had been already anticipated that urban warfare to be one of the most complex environments to operate."
I think Wendover you support a certain side because you went too far with the misinformation and this is becoming a trend in your videos
Independent youtubers are a more reliable and non-biased source of information than any mainstream media outlet out there
"🤣 thats right, keep saying。"
"The content of this video is so rich despite the YouTube restrictions, and what's more baffling is that you're saying there's much more to see about the war on Nebula."
So usa can take out russia and they need to now dont let putin bluff with nukes  we have nukes two
"What a catchy title. Let me guess, this video is full of $***? I can hear it already 'It all happened so quickly...' ok I've heard enough. The mask has come off for this Nazi shilling channel. You notice these channels lately? They all join in unison when it comes to war."
@Ryan Fleshbourne So you don't think the Russian army outnumbering and outclassing the Ukrainian army in practically every facet couldn't just overrun Ukraine in any number of ways? And you watched this video through to the end«--that's funny!
@Ryan Fleshbourne Is that a cold war joke?
disinformation account go brrrr
lmao you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. Just forgot to mention that ukraine is controlled by neonazi paramilitary groups
FK PTN
when russia is an autocracy but the west is not lol
"make palestinian video next time, both suffered not only ukraine"
What is the name of this piano song?
"So much garbage on this subject, this video included."
They destroyed US payed biolabs.
"thanks for telling them what they doing wrong to invade, and how to fix it   :/"
I hope this is over quickly (and ukraine wins of course)
I predict his demise in less than 1 year.
if you dont like youtubes policys. then its time to create a better platform thats easy to access for us viewers!
"That's ... what they did, with Nebula."
We had to carefully write and create this video so we don't get banned from YouTube and support USA. 🤦‍♂️🤭🤦‍♂️🤭
This is paid western propaganda. This guy took a check and read from a CIA/NATO script. Or he's a spy buried deep within the Russian military ministry and knows better than us all. But I think the first one.
"@Ryan Fleshbourne ""everyone is susceptible to propaganda except me"""
Also probably because the Russian’s morale is low and they don’t have the will to fight this useless war. Considering that many Russian soldiers are killed or surrendering and abandoning their equipment.
"You should watch The Duran, I think you are missing a lot."
"A good general wins battles, a great general understands the importance of logistics. 

Guess the problem is simple."
And the fact that the Russian state didn't prepare for logistics in general🤷‍♂️
The fact that we get free documentaries on YouTube by Wendover productions is truly a gift  👍
"@Артем Евстигнеев there's footage of all of that going on, so yes, it is happening."
How do you keep up with these impressive streams and productions? Really impressive!
"trump and Putin prove that there will always be madmen in this world, and we have to have a better method of dealing with them.  No one person is worth all this death and destruction."
"Did i just see a Confederate  flag on a Russian tamk ?!!  Makes you wonder who is allied with who, doesn't it ?  Try this one on. Trump loses election. Putin not happy. Putin decides to invade Ukraine. West outraged. Biden compelled to make unpopular decisions ( banning Russian oil etc. )  Biden becomes unpopular. Trump wins Presidency again. Putin happy. Far-fetched ? For all our sakes, I sincerely hope so."
"""Whithin minutes""
You mean 40-50 minutes before he declared war. I watched the Twitter feeds live that night. In the late evening, the Russians announced a no fly zone over the entire UA-RU border. First the usual sporadic  artillery duels along the contact line went to work harder than usual over the course of the night. Russian state TV showed videos from Donetzk with artillery rumbling at the horizon (Of course claiming it was incoming ukranian fire). The first video of heavy fighting came from Aidar-Mykolaivka, several km deep in ukrainian territory behind the contact line. Videos from Mariupol came in, of massive artillery barrages rumbling and flashing in the distance. Livecam showed fire in Mariupol. On point, at 3 a.m., just like the rumors had said, Mariupol livecam went offline. Livecams of Kharkiv and Kyiv showed explosions from cruise missiles. BBC actually was just interviewing its corredpondent in Kyiv as the missiles hit. Only a few minutes in, a livecam on a border crossing at crimea showed incoming fire and the guard running away. Livecam went offline. A Video, probably from the DNR side, showed a hellscape of a bloodred sky from massive outgoing grad fire. Meanwhile, the U.N kept discussing how to diplomatically prevent a war. 40-50 minutes after it started, Putin declared the attack. It took another few minutes after that, that News Channels and the U.N. reacted.

That was terrifying to see unfold."
"Russian forces looked in disarray because a few twitter accounts with unverified names/no profile pics said they were in disarray? Notice how almost every, if not every, story we hear about Ukrainian forces ends up being fake? It's almost like this is a propaganda war toward the West, which gladly eats it up. Meanwhile RT was banned and Russian perspective is neglected/ignored... I am not pro-Russia, I'm not a Putin puppet, etc. But objective news is extremely hard to come by during the Fog of War--especially with a US/Western media that is so corrupt and war-mongering as ours. Beware what you read and watch--it may not even be real. Also... let's go Brandon! Freest and most fair election in history, 81 million votes, most popular ever president... EVER! Just so happens his son was involved in the exact country that is being invaded as we speak--same country Trump was impeached for not wanting to send military aid. Interesting. Very very interesting."
Just because it's a cockup doesn't mean that there won't be heaps more suffering down the road. This will end up being a longer war than anyone thusfar has planned for.
Railways.. Cause that junk wouldnt do 10km on its own..
"LMAO WHAT, brainwashed ""russian soldiers ask local Ukrainians for supplies and directions"" 🤣"
more NATO propaganda
I cant with this voice
I love it that the world is fucking up Putin's invasion by providing crowd source intel.
"I don't mean to offend anybody by mentioning this comparison but its something that I never understood. The Jews in Europe suffered genocide at the hands of the Nazi's for 12 years resulting in World War 2. After WW2 when the world caught wind of the inhumane actions took against the Jews during the Holocaust. The world came together and pathed a road towards the existence of Israel. So basically what I'm saying is, for the 12 years of suffering that the Jews endured they received a WHOLE COUNTRY. Africans were sold into slavery to American colonists around 1492 and this lasted until around 1865. So close to 400 years total and 89 of them years were under the Established United States of America. When the world found out about the evil treatment to slaves and the fact that they were not even considered as human beings, the world did nothing. When looking at these two evil historical events side by side, (The Jews killed during the Holocaust which last 12 years & a estimated 6 million Jews murdered) & then ( Africans sold into slavery, losing all human rights which lasted 400 years & a estimated 60 million + Africans Murdered) How can anybody say that the world's reaction & outcomes to the two separate evil travesties is fair or even in the same ballpark as fair! *___(((___The Jews suffered 12 years, lost 6 million people and the outcome was that the world basically gave them a country (Israel)___)))___* - *___(((___Africans were sold into slavery & suffered for 400 years, lost an estimated 60 million + people and the world ignored this and from the USA they received the thirteenth amendment and was released into a society that was mainly prejudice & hated them.___)))___ How is this justice, How come nobody ever talks about this MODERN DAY comparison ?  (American Intermediary)"
"This video is flawed, it assume and misrepresents the Russian strategy based on US centric point of view. It did not prensent the Russian strategy whatso ever, not that the viewers who applaud it would know."
"I guess Putin and his troops missed the Netflix documentary, ""winter on fire"".  The ukrianians are not going to just roll over."
Russia will be vilified for an entire generation!!
"The Russian troops actually believed they were going in to liberate the people of Ukraine, and would be welcomed and treated accordingly. Amazing!!! Unfortunately, Russian government propaganda WORKS!! What a rude awakening!!!"
Mental gymnastics in the comments are on a higher dimensional level. Actually makes me believe that 99% of the world's population is just NPCs.
Love the guy with a tractor stealing a tank!
imagine being Putin getting caught red handed cause of some teens on tiktok were bored
Very good report!
They are there to liberate them. Liberate them from being taken down the degenerate road by a Washington puppet president.
It’s not even over.
@Black Groyper do you... know how to read english? or did you just forget what i wrote as you were typing? 😂
"@Black Groyper July would be pretty pathetic for Russia... hitler took France, Belgium, and the netherlands in just 6 weeks while fighting the UK and poland at the same time. To say that a world superpower can only take such a small country in 5 months wouldn't exactly qualify as being ""annihilated""..."

If you think this happened “so quickly” you haven’t been paying attention to the news. You could have called this attack from over a month before it occurred with relative confidence. Do a little post history research if you doubt this.
@FTW Strategy fair point
"@three three three I did, it’s an even more odd way to start the video then"
if you watched for longer than 5 seconds you would hear him start talking about what was happening in 2014
WW3 has begun buy guns and ammo .. protect yourself if you survive nuclear radiation..
The trouble with counting on a quick victory is that youre counting on a quick victory.
"are you watching the same war?? every single US general, colonel, etc. knows the outcome is inevitiable. the fact that Zalensky is still talking tough will do nothing but kill more innnocent civilians."
Putin is and has been making russians weak since he joined. Russia is now a giant freezer full of Nazis (using old nazi aged war equipment at that) and an entire people that have been stupefied by one man.
Well it’s very easy for Russia to finish the war in no time...but they hv a different agenda....even USA doesn’t want to hv a war with Russia...does anyone think Ukraine can seriously stand a chance against Russia.
"""Believe to liberate"" Sometimes you still gotta pity poor Ivan"
"So everyone is talking about killing civilians etc. what about 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, bombing of city that has 2 million people at a time, thats not a civilian suffering??? All these media are fcked up, government in ukraine is set by mafia and russia came to kick that mafia out same they did in kazakhstan. The only thing that mafia poseses is media and they still control it trying to influence on this invasion, but nobody moved from their spots. Bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO wasnt shown on tvs you know and thats bcs everyone thought its ok bcs nato did it. no, nato is a terrorist organisation that is centered around united states, thats a fact."
"Enough rugs pulled out for USA's sensible trade relationships;  what the hell did you wait so long not to screw tens of thousands of years of children, imagine princess Diana scaring you.

They planned for the best case scenario instead of preparing for the worst.  That's simply terrible logistics.
Russia is letting the civies escape.  They did their probes and pulled back.  Issued their warnings.  Russia could already blow Kiev flat on the first day.  Russia left the highways and rail open for civies to escape to the West.  Which is sort of clever (in a bad way) to dump millions of refugees on Poland and the EU.    Overall this video seems clueless.
Now imagine Russia's difficulty if Ukraine citizens had a full right to bear arms.
"Just another nonsense video.    The Ukraine started donnybrook with Russia has only been going a few days.   The US debacle in Afghanistan against a bunch of men in sandals and using low grade weaponry lasted  for 20 years with no result for the US/UK/OZ, and several other European armies."
"This is not shocking to anyone in the US army logistics community or those of us who saw their failure fist hand in Syria. The Russian army is a bigger, clunkier, more poorly run and lead version of Hussein's. They are built to kill women and children, not fight."
"This has been problem for the USSR/Russia for decades.  In WWII, the vast majority of the trucks and other non-armored vehicles used by the Soviets were American.  They loved building tanks, but boring old trucks, not so much.  It appears modern Russia has followed that trend.  Having lots of tanks is nice, but if you can't supply them they're nothing more than expensive, interesting sculptures."
I like this video very informative. Too bad that 10 minutes in i have legit seen 6 ads. I am not watching 12 ads for a 20 minute video. Goodbye
Bye
What you watch on? Device? I got 1 ad. Odd
"It took America and it's allies a little over a month to enter Baghdad. The Russians are two weeks into their war and fighting to enter Kiev, and are on the door steps of that city. It sounds like they're right on time to me. Many Iraqis chose not to fight. The Ukranians are putting up more resistance. The Russians are fighting with no allies (No, not even Belarusian soldiers are said to be involved). In terms of advancing it sounds like the Russians are right on time to me. All of that other stuff about pace and progress sounds like media propaganda."
NATO is a force to be reckoned with their unity stands in opposition to Putin's division he has brought poverty on Russia and as soon as you crane has proper equipment they will fight against Russia fiercely and he will get more than he bargained for
The western world is brainwashed. You have to look at both sides. This entire video is one-sided and  I am disappointed in the fact that Sam is a part of this machinery.
This is Russia's Vietnam. Pro tip: it's not going to go well Russia.
Wow so much important details thanks so much
"Хорошая, плохая логистика..уже не важно..Киев почти блокирован,Мариуполь фактически бросили на расстрел, Одесса ждет десант и вся уезжает..Что думают в Львове, остаётся загадкой.🤣🌺🤣"
are they failed logicstis tho? couldn't that serve its own propaganda purpose? Fcuk i cant believe anything war related anymore
"simply russians aren't US  army they really don't want to kill civilians... they  don't carpet bomb cities.
 But if is needed to win the war they will use their missiles, so think twice when  you say they don't know where Kiev is and they are starving. Missiles don't need to eat.
Do you all really believe that Russia is losing the war? After 12 days?😷💉😷😷💉🐑🐑🐑😂 
How gullible people are always baffles me, I remember you that US after 20 years in Afghanistan and Iraq went away with nothing apart destruction and 2 millions civilians killed.
Sanctions will not crumble Russian  economy, Russia will not cease to exist simply because NATO doesn't represent the world but ONLY US and his docile dogs (uk, europe, canada, australia, etc)
If you poke the bear enough maybe he will change his mind and consider ukraine as his land and will put missiles there as was planned by US.
So it's better to surrend and become a neutral country"
"@Dio Klezian it's 8 years that Putin 8s asking to respect Minsk Agreements, but instead 14000 were killed during the past 8 years.
Moreover Ukrainians were developing nuclear warheads and bioweapons in their 26 biolaboratories along russian borders, while continuing shelling and killing russian in Donbass, until one month ago Russians was asking to respect the Minsk Agreements.
It's at stake Russia survival, so Putin will not stop"
"Russia can have neutrality of UKR like Austria declared 1956, when russian troops wenr home. For that it is not necessary to destroy the whole country and Kiyv craddle of Russian nation. Make immediately ceasefire and begin peace talks."

Western propaganda...
Wait. Was that a confederate battle flag being flown next to the Russian flag on that truck at 1:51‽
"It's the flag of Novorossyia (New Russia), basically self declared and unrecognised confederation of Donetsk and Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine."
Confederate flags have stars right?

"FUNNY!  Russian tanks are  out of fuel, the hungry Russiian soldiers stole food from civilians, the sky over Ukraine  is very contested. 
... .Facts There is no more Ukraine air force, Navy and that what is left of the army is trying desperately to defend Kiev."
Putin thought he could send his third stringers and just walk into Ukraine. Big surprise for Vlad The Failure! (With apologies to V the Impaler)
"Whilst any rational person feels deep sympathy for Ukrainian civilians of all ethnicities, please keep in mind that this video is very likely to contain disinformation and propaganda due to the anti-Russian bias of American media outlets. Remember WMD, the bay of Tonkin, babies thrown from incubators and Gaddafi's viagra rape army? All lies perpetrated by slick US media. 
Have we all forgotten the intercepted phone call in which Victoria (F the EU) Nuland was recorded choosing who would head up the new government in Kiev after the Maidan massacre? The USA fomented a coup d'etat and brought a puppet government to power. All in order to militarize Ukraine and begin hostilities with Russia. That unelected government was rejected by the people of Crimea and Donbass too. Crimeans then held a democratic vote to rejoin Russia, eventually doing so. The Donbass region declared independence and was immediately shelled by Ukrainian extremists called Azov battalion. That shelling began in 2014 and continued until 2022. THAT is the genesis of this conflict. Not an 'unprovoked' invasion by Russia."
"Can somebody take out Russia's railway network, please!"

Ukraine has weapons of mass destruction like iraq did thats why russia is invading
Prolonged war only helps destroy the Russian economy. Then an occupation of a country full of people that will fight you forever. Time is on Ukraines side. The war was lost for Russia once they didn't install their puppet government easy enough with little bloodshed or resistance . The opposite happened so this is will be another Afghanistan.

why does this video's narrator speak as if addressing children? That's the state of the West's news media

here’s the troll
Fuck Russia.  Only thing that this video was missing.
It's been going on since the 1900s so this is just a continuation only with more lethal means
Exactly.. since Crimean war and before. It's symbolic for the madman to achieve what the Czar's before him could not.
"That is hilarious. The mighty Russian army thwarted by cheap Chinese tires. A quick search has the Yellow Sea YS20 selling for $200 in bulk on AliBaBa. The Michelin Military tire around $800 or more. Considering some military rigs need 10 tires per, the savings are considerable. I'm sure no general thought they were going to invade the Ukraine in the mud season."
"Please, add sources for the information in your videos."
Yess.. good pics.. but in this info tic tok using video game Sam's( surface to sir) world.. we need links
The Russians are not in a hurry and want to minimize damage to the country.  Their basic military strategy is encirclement and outlasting the encircled enemy.
"russia's logistics failed, it could be a bluff that when china  knows it, china will come in so there will be 2 of them now against ukraine. right?"
Putin's nuclear threats tell the real story. He knows his army would be crushed by NATO forces in direct confrontation. Even the limited anti air capabilities of the Ukrainian forces are enough for him to keep his best air power in reserve. He's left with the usual Russian tactic of terror bombing civilians with artillery to force compliance. He's playing a dangerous game on a knife's edge and no matter which side of that edge he falls from it will not be good for him. The worry is how much damage is he willing to do on his way down.
_K e e v e_
"But now Russia seem to supply the Southern front with trains from Crimea. They have a ""war-train"" there."

"Two weeks in and you talk like this war is over, and Russia has lost a war in two weeks,  You're all fools."
Kind of like the U.S. navy which has a merchant marine ranked at #27 in the world right now. Any long-term conflict and the mighty U.S. navy will be returning to dock to get any supplies. Unless they become pirates of course. LOL
"sry you have absolute zero knowledge about the russian tactics in this war, clearly brainwashed west leftist media brain. this what the russians are doing at the moment is a strategy they used before, they know exactly what they are doing and the ukraine has no chance in winning this war if putin gives the sign. sry not sry"

How to create a succesful propaganda video: every time you mention something Russian - mention something American and claim it's superiority. Atta boy!
You NPC's really believe whatever bs narrative the media spews out huh
For failed logistics...they have brought ukraine to their knees....call the map maker cause  south/west is now novorussia.
This blood is on our hands US. President Obama failed these people.
This was an awsome informative video. Good job
"Nothing failed, that was complete success, ahead of schedule in 4 days ukranian army not existed anymore as active controlled force, they broke up in small isolated regions of resistance
complete air domination
the only problem is huge distances"
"Two week after this conflitct starts I think is very soon to jump into conclusion about logistics and purposes of Rusia invading Ukraine. This is not WW2 type of invation, not even a close a middle east conflict. This is a conflict between two countries manifested in such a different ways that ""normal"" war should develop o at least we are used to see. Do you think that russia doesnt have the capability to launch missils from their own land or from aircraft and then go ahead with a land invation if their final intention is to occupy?  I believe that there is so little information and certainty we have at this moment that the information itself is already a difficult battle to fight (mass media control and ""pray for ukraine"" kind of bullshit). We are experience the higher level of misinformation the world could ever have in term of a war event."
"Good Video, thank you"
"Russia has the GDP roughly of Florida, so if not for their Nuclear Arsenals they could very easily be pushed back by a much better invested and equipped force.  Also while I suspect that the Russian military is well trained they have little to no mass experience in recent conflicts. I hope they are ultimately repelled and the international community at least passively supports the conflict and recovery."
Putin Just announced that if Ukraine give them Half of Ukraine territory they will leave and settle peace agreement and agree never to invade again
"Can you imagine what a DISASTER a Russian fight with NATO would be......for RUSSIA? We all can now, seeing their debacle in Ukraine."
A nice topic
i fucking hate advertisers. there is a special place in hell for people who work in that field. As bad as pedophelia in my opinion.
Great video. One problem with it though… stop using past tense. This war is currently still happening. Thank you. Slava Ukraini.
"well written, , thought out and posted. This is very informative vs a nightly news update. This story with out all the sensationalism of nightly news is what more people need to see and understand WHY putins' russia has failed. They may have failed advancement but like wars past attrition is another matter. I would like a story to explain ""PUTIN"" and his dis connect from his people and real time based events. How could his info be so wrong? As NATO forces stand poised on the brink of war, it reminds me too much of learning history of WWII and Hitler listening to bad info, constantly changing direction, and increasing loss of metal reality. I wonder if putin would make the error of attacking another foe (more powerful and ready for war) and opening himself up for the end of his regime?  War is never good, for the Ukrainian people who have suffered through this the world owes them help to rebuild, but that will have to wait until putins' regime is removed from the field (Ukraine). Bad info: yes we had it too WMDs?"

Do you know that It all Started in 02.22.22 and mentioned publicly in 02.24.22?

Very good and informative! Long live Ukarain. Putin will never find a safe place on planet earth again.
"Surely  if  NATO  goes head to head with  Russia,  then  a nuclear exchange  becomes  'quite'  likely?   If so,  who gives a fuck about  logistics?  We are all toast.  Only winners in this bollocks  are the weapon manafacturers."
What's the flag @1:53 -ish that's kinda like the CSA battle flag without stars?

"Maybe you need to understand that using lame insults like ""soy boy"" renders everything else you say invalid."
"I see 2 major problems why russia is failing. First as you said is logistics. And the second they underestimated Ukrainian military. Before invasion started Ukraine had 250.000 active troops. Russia have send 200.000 troops and spread them across hundreds and hundreds of miles in 4 major attack directions. Of these 200k Russian troops less than half are professional and well trained others lack of training and experience. On other hand Ukraine was preparing against the major invasion since 2014 when russia occupied Crimea and Donbas regions.
This was at the beginning of the invasion. Since then Ukraine have mobilized another  300k troops (they lack weapons at a moment but should get then pretty soon). Then there are tens off thousands militia who are hunting down small, lost or left behind russian troops. Their main targets are fuel trucks to complicate enemy logistics even more. 
Add to this number 20k foreign professional military volunteers. 
If russia is not planing to though in another let say 100k troops then within next 10-14 days  we will see Ukrainian forces taking full initiative and pushing enemy to the borders."
You need a new  narator  with a better voice   this guys sounds like Snagglepus
Think still early days. They'll send in the bombers & missiles once all those civilians who want flee left Ukraine
With Putin - no future for Russia

"It did not happen quickly, many armchair generals heard of the movements, and saw the writing on the wall."
American Propaganda
100% nonsense.
"Lesson from Ukraine: If Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc., do not want to be attacked and dominated by China, they better get nuclear weapons quickly; Putin has shown how his nuclear weapons have deterred NATO and non-NATO states to come to Ukraine's defense and crush the Rusian invasion. Instead, the paralized Western nations, starting with the US, are so scared of Russia's nuclear weapons that instead of fighetr jets, cruise missiles, etc., they have been reduced to ""fight"" with Visa, Master Card, Swift, banning of oligarchs, sports, etc., it is ridiculous.

If Ukrainians had kept their nuclears, or had acuired new ones, Putin would have not dare to invade becaure he would have known Moscow and Saint Petersburgh, etc., would be wiped off the face of the Earth, and that would be too much even for mad dog Putin ano his generals.

If Taiwan has nuclear weapons Beijing will not dare to invade.

By the way, we should the ambassdor and the Chinese government in general because they are making their thinking clear: ""we have nuclear weapons and you don't, our cities are not in danger, yours are. Itsis only a matter of time until we have a conventional military so superior to yours in quantity that you will haveeno choice but surrender to us. This message is for all nations around the South China Sea, Taiwan, even Australia and beyond. Only if you have nuclear or other weapons capable of wiping out million more of us will be deterred"". This means that the 25 million Taiwanese must have weapons capable of wiping out all major Chinese cities. 

For the Taiwanese, Japanese. South Koreans. etc., it is suicidal not to have weapons of mass destruction and depend on American ones for their safety. Even Israel and Jews in general realize Israel needs its nuclear weapons because Israel's survival can not depend on US politicians, even if Israel has the extraordinarily effective lobby that so much influences US policies towards Israel. The Israelis know that political winds in the US can shift, as you can see by the several clearly anti-Israel US politicians.

The Japanse and the rest have still a window of opportunity of a few years (at best) before the Chinese, North Korean and Chinese bullies dominate them with the threat of invasion and nuclear weapons.

If the Japanese want to feel secure and not have another Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they have to do the opposite of what they have done; instead of renouncing to nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, they need them. China's current regime has turned China into a resentful, angry, mad giant that will not hesitate to invade Taiwan and dominate others like it has done in Hong Kong, Tiannamen, the Uyghurs, Tibet and is trying to to to Australia and Lithuania. 

The free world has to unite against China, Russia, etc:, because for those nutty leaders WWIII is already on."
"LOL! What ""failed"" logistics?? So far they  were advancing very fast and going by schedule. 
It is astonishing to see so much awkward assumptions by west ""analytics"" who are basing their opinion on propaganda (still believing Russia is stupid, weak, evil and incompetent), and not having ANY sort of information and facts to base it off. You got zero sources from Russian side nor what locals see in Ukraine. Get used tor eality instead of MSM crap. Any conflict is always a huge info war."
Russia: quit while you're still 'slightly' behind
"How did the Afghanies managed to kick US butt? Did they have better logistics capabilities? What about the Syrians? 
It is March 8 2022, this is from 6th of March, if you right the War should be done by next Monday 14th March…"
"So...in the west and south, people do not have to be afraid."
"We allready learned that after the five-years military shows in the past. Their arms were not real, the soldiers poor, hungry and desillusioned."
Ukraine needs PATRIOT Systems. And Helicopters for Operations behind enemy lines.
"What amazes me is that, after 7000 years or so of ""civilization"", people are still willing to let authoritarian governments use them as pawns for their own personal gain...🤔"
"One thing to keep in mind is how tiny Russia is, in many metrics. For example, the Russian GDP is smaller than the GDP of Italy. The Russian military has less manpower than the military of Turkey. Russia has about 1/13 of the NATO's military spending. The very only reason why Russia still exists as a relevant military power is their arsenal of ~6000 nuclear weapons. Without the nuclear threat, there would be no second thought whether the NATO should stop the Russian invasion on the Ukraine."
Ukraine must destroy as many as possible the military equipments.. the war ships must be destroy and on land and see..so that Russian know what a waste with this illegal war..
Ukrainian civilians were lied to by nato to believe that hard power does not matter. Their comedian president got played by the west and destroyed his own country for nato ambitions.
Are you a bot
"I can't believe that 90,000 troops from Russia....."

PROPAGANDA MUCH?
Interesting video..........
"It is a good s I action.
The Rusians did have problems including most probably self dlusion on an easy takeover initially.
But it really doesn't matter e r. Ukraine did not have the sir or missile capability to take advantage of the situation due to hesitant and inadequate buildup concurrent with the Rusdian buildup a direct failure on the part of the EU AND the Biden fumble factory.
You do not deter a 1t to 20 division buildup a ith threats of sanctions.
There are real only two choices left.  Massive direct support of Ukrsine by NATO nations with the attendant risk or concede that Ukraine is lost and try to stop an otherwise inevitable larg e scale massacre of zukrsinians.
I suggest without much hope that the Baltics and ztaiwan begin receiving massive inflows of heavy weaponry along with support troops from concerned nations immediately.
Pitin will take Molfovia as the cherry on the cake as he finishes crushing Ukraine.
Poland should also be heavily reinforced.
If the zuS and EOU are going to send planes or give planes to Ukrania I suggest that the planes not be concentrated in one airfield and that the staging and donor countries as well as NATO be prepared for Russian attack and prepare adequate counter measures."
Read the short poem 'for the want of a nail'.  This poem shows how logistics in war is paramount.
Won’t invade anywhere else after this amateur performance.78 yrs since the Russians fought a army .Easy to kill civilians in Syria and Afghanistan etc.A real army that fights back is a new ball game.Get you arse kicked by NATO real good.
"It's unfair to compare USA logistics with any country for that matter.
The US spends about double the whole world combined."
"I just recently watched preparation of US to war in Iraq and damn, man, this is whole lot different level. It occurred to me that all that wealth building was for one purpose to create perfect war machine with all this unlimited budget. They can fully deploy in any part of the world and have all the supplies there. They can prepare and make trials for one year and that actually was kinda overkill as Iraq was not competitive with outdated infrastructure but goddamn"
"The Ukrainian army is now the most powerful in Europe. If not they, then who? Rhetorical question."
"While it was Rail that modernized War way back in the middle of the 1800s, Armies cannot be so dependent on it as they once were.

To get forces to jump off points and to keep moving supplies, yes. But War is a rapid development and so placing Rail as the main means of mobilization is a negative decision.

There was a reason the US Army conducted the 1919 and 1920 Transcontinental Road Marches with Trucks. To identify the very problems plaguing the Russians right now.

In addition, the US Navy pulled off the Great White Fleet's around the world voyage. In fact, some argued because of poor support, the Fleet shouldn't have left. But the Naval officers and President Roosevelt made the counterpoint that was the whole purpose to begin with.

Which set the stage for the US Navy to steamroll across the Pacific in Late 1943, after the desperate fighting it had to maintain in the Solomons and still conduct operations in the Central Pacific while defending the North Pacific."
"I'd be very careful about broadcasting the perception that Russia's military is a flawed mess. Regardless of how true it is - the last thing anyone wants is a country at war (with nuclear capabilities non the less) resorting to ""drastic measures"" because analysts the world over are finding holes in their offensive. 

I'd maintain at all times that Russia is and will be a significant threat. Ukrainians and it's allied support need to be aware of where they can leverage and come out ahead in this conflict. Anything more that undermines Russian capability would concerning."
"lol , armchair generals ..."
This will age as fine BIB wine.

"Putin won't back out without a win of some sort. Even if there are logistic problems now he will just continue to pump in more resources until he gets what he wants. He don't care about losses now, neither Ukrainian or Russian...."

Good video.

"Having served in the U.S Army for 15 years and primarily as an Armament Systems Warrant Officer in the Ordnance Corps, I have to say that I am impressed with accuracy of this video regarding military logistics."
meow meow meow meow
@Kasper friis A ceasefire when your being invaded is a win bro. Why does everyone think in WW2 grand total war strategy where everyone either surrenders in 2 seconds or fights to the death for small shit?
Lmao video maker says there might be disinformation while giving a solid hardline of propaganda based on what Western media reports. OMG the Irony these days is too strong
"""Failed logistics"" you clearly don't know the military doctrine of the Russia 😂"
So.. if you're the West - all you need to cripple a Russian invasion is massive covert rail sabotage inside Russia?
"I know they watch your videos and you are giving them ideas haha
Otherwise the video is very nice and very informative"
"Very informative insights that I haven't come across until now. Well done! What, if any, are the Russian strengths, and what are the chances and risks of them conquering Ukraine?"
"Very high. Ukraine can't last forever, and Russia doesn't care about terribly high costs to achieve their objective with overwhelming force. In order to stop Russia, Ukraine needs major allied help. 

MAD says they probably won't be getting rescued."
"Incredible video. thank you, very instructive"
lets not underestimate these guys as I've only seen old tech and they spend a lot of money every year on military tech that we haven't seen
Mostly fair video but you really should add it started with the coup earlier that year. which is the reason crimea decided to split in the first place. You call them rebels for rebelling against a government that had only existed for a month or so at that point?
music ?
Thanks for this
"I never understood why people held Russia's military at such a high regard, sure they have a lot of troops, but their equipment and military infrastructure are a joke when compared to other nations."
"@kreek22 Sure, but my point is us westerners aren't terribly good at differentiating the Soviet capabilities from modern day Russian capabilities.  Its mostly a problem with our Euro- and Amero-centric view of the world.  A lot of folk don't even realize that Russia and the USSR are even different entities, never mind understanding what those differences entail.

> the only way they could have fully conquered it in 2 weeks was with much more manpower
No.. the only way they could have done it would be if a significant portion of the Ukrainian population wanted to become a Russian colony again.

The areas Russia already controlled (Crimea and Donbas) did have somewhat popular support for Russian control.  Perhaps Putin made the assumption that the rest of the country was of a similar mindset and would have just let him roll straight into Kyiv.

That would be a massive intelligence failure if that was truly his motivating factor, but its one of the few even remotely reasonable arguments for Russia starting this war in the manner they did.

He would have also had to underestimate NATO support for Ukraine - the Ukrainian military would be having a much more difficult go of it if they weren't being resupplied with things like anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to counter all the hardware the Russians are throwing at the game.

Now of course I'm no insider.  Maybe I'm wrong about their motivations, but the reality is that Russia has made many mistakes over the course of the past few days, and most are mistakes that shouldn't have happened.  The FSB is still considered a pretty formidable intelligence agency, so its unlikely they would have screwed up quite that badly which suggests the mistakes are coming from people above them who are ignoring or misinterpreting the intelligence they're receiving.

I think if things had gone to plan, Russia could have taken Kyiv in 2 weeks without a problem.  The trouble is that the plan was bunk - not the common ""no plan survives first contact"" type of failure that should be expected and compensated for, but bunk right from conception long before first contact ever occurred."
"@altrag The Soviets were much more formidable.  They spent 25% of GDP on their military, they had the most impressive espionage network in history, they had solid STEM people who could reverse engineer what the spies gave them, they were largely autarkic economically, they did not permit much Western propaganda in to weaken morale, they had twice the population and many satellite countries.

The Russians have performed poorly in Ukraine, but Ukraine a large country and the only way they could have fully conquered it in 2 weeks was with much more manpower and much more logistical support--basically, the Red Army fully mobilized.  It took the Germans 6 weeks to conquer France in 1940, a country of the same size and population as Ukraine.  A mere 6 weeks was considered a shocking achievement.  After all, it had taken them 5 weeks to conquer half of much weaker Poland a year before--with direct help from the Soviets who took the other half."
"@kreek22 There's also a memory factor here.  They may be a joke compared to the American military _now,_ but the Soviets held their own for over 30 years during the cold war.  And most people in the west still think of Russia=USSR, which is.. not entirely untrue but definitely a vast oversimplification.

As for the current iteration, I don't think a clearing propaganda cloud will fix Russia's newly-acquired view as a joke.  They have the manpower and if they can buy themselves the time there's little question they can take Ukraine, but even if they did so tomorrow this campaign has already gone on more than a week longer than it should have given the relative power imbalance between the two countries.  Win or lose, there is no other explanation for the duration beyond ""Russia didn't correctly assess its position"".  Or in other words, they're a joke.

Of course it only takes a better/less egotistical new leader to change that - they have the manpower and technology to most definitely not be a joke.  Its the planners that are failing so miserably right now."
"In my opinion, the US, EU, and NATO are more evil than Putin at one point. This is a 100 m event, why make it a rally. Put in everything you have got and fight Russia on the battlefield now. Sooner or later, the war will come to NATO's doorstep. Why the entire world is punishing the Russian people who got nothing to do with Putin's lunatic decision. What is the difference between what Putin has done to the Ukrainian and vice versa by the US & UE sanction? Exactly the same. The US architect of the whole blueprint and Putin's poor judgment and ignorance fall into his trap."
"Compared to USA presidents, Putin is a Jesus Christ or Buddha"
"We all thought Russia would win and instead the Ukraine is whipping their ass. If course, this is because of poor planning."

"Russian army is revealed as loaded with out model equipment, junior conscripts, and ponderous management. Likely a useful update for NATO analysts."
th south is what Russia wants they were not after Kiev as much as people think it looks like they are sadly failing the whole time he is cutting the south off from all of what makes its economy the ports they also used to leave supplies like they were abandoned and in fact put tracking on them to see if they took the items or gear to their base and then launch cruise missle
"​ @Vladimiras Vladimirovich  CORRECT...at best this vid is low grade click bait...more likely its just
western propaganda. Keep in mind we have NOT EVEN STARTED seeing what the 2nd wave of

"@Sn SM The diffrence is, that most westeners have access to eastern/russian propagande aswell. Westerners can be source critical while russians/easteners cant as most western sources are banned"
"Very interesting video, enjoyed it."
how about the logistics of the Americans that a war going on in Afghanistan for 20 years? But now we know that Russians failed in just 10 days. Right (No I am not disinformation actor/troll)
"So they were preparing since 2014 to actually lose in 7 days. And this happens when Russian army surrounded 60% of Ukraine's borders. And The West afraid of this ""army"" and this ""country""?

Glory to Ukraine and death to occupants!!"

"It's 106 miles to Kiev.
We got a full tank of gas, a half a pack of cigarettes, It's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses."
Same thing that happened to Napoleon when he decided to invade Russia
Why did Putin think that taking Ukraine would be easy? He does know that we remember WW II and this is how that started. We are now more in touch so that this kind of thing doesn't happen. Sow the wind. Reap the Whirlwind.
"So basically a 20 min video to say what some of us knew this whole time. The Russian military is trash and overhyped. Poorly trained….underfunded….and weak…..

Just a big ass weak military"
The US. is trouble maker all around the world!
russia made the trouble in ukraine and around europe everyone though russia would be good friend but when putin was leading russia it become more worse every year and russia is trying to keep nato away while nato was made for defensive act not offensive
"Where is your sympathy for the Afghans, Iraqis, Syrians and Libyans when the US bombed the living hell out of their countries?"
"Watching many other sources and more views from a military standpoint, it's not an failure and it is working like it should with calculated scenarios. You have to understand the doctrine and how Russia understands war or warfare. While there are losses it doesn't mean it is a failure, losses are calculate and unavoidable.
Just to make it short, Russians are making forward bases around Kiev and circling them around. First wave was a calculated disposable/expendable units and machinery, while it shows to a media how they lack this and that, how they run out of fuel and making wester and local media think that Russians or Putin thought it will work, and that this is a failure. In all reality it is now how it seems whatsoever.

There's a good military channel from an U.S. soldier - Task & Purpose YT channel, where he explains how it works and helps you to understand how Russian military works, how they approach war.
That's just one of many sources I use to make sense of this situation and reasons why it is happening, and how it is happening.

First few waves are just expendable forces to test the opposing force, to see what they are facing against, they use old and to an extent obsolete vehicles, or the bottom level vehicles so to say, the cheap scrap because it is sufficient enough to test opposing force and lay destruction while at it. Seems like it is working. Meanwhile western media shows how Putin miscalculated, that he wanted to do it quick etc. Who said he wanted it? Who in the right mind would even have a thought that such nation like Russia, with such leader like Putin who was a chief of KGB, wouldn't have multiple plans, backup plans, and all scenarios made in case of something ""failing""? Was his intent to blitzkrieg Kiev? No...he did it to see what defenses are there, how easily it is to get in, how deep he can get, to quickly scout the area and disorientate opposing force. Whether he would've succeeded actually would've been surprising to him, to be honest, but it never was really the main plan with the first wave of cheap and obsolete vehicles and soldiers.

Later came in more trained, more specialized forces scouting and setting up bases around Kiev, getting convoys that for us seem slow, but actually is really fast for such large convoy. They need to get close in firing range of Kiev for the howitzers. The plan is to circle around Kiev and cut off supply lines for it. It will be a matter of time before Kiev falls and Putin will be able to give ultimatum to Zelenski, to surrender or get shelled. 

There's nothing really failing, everything is going on as planned with calculated losses from Putin's side.

I recommend watching The New Atlas, RealLifeLore,  YT channels, and John Mearsheimer for better historical and more objective, or detailed, as well as alternative info. Putin interviews of past give a better context for his side of view as well. If any western media claims that Putin miscalculated these big things, or is failing, or how something is a failure...think again about who you are talking, and turn on some logical thinking and common senses, think outside of media claims with experts that are just advertising themselves and using propaganda to encourage, which is not bad to encourage, but it's a wishful thinking, since reality is different, and average civilians like us just don't really get this whole thing, and some portion just doesn't want to dive into details and workings of this whole war game show between nations and leaders, everything needs to be watered down for them, which is wrong and bad. 

So we need to get as open minded here as possible, and get every source of information from various points of views in order to make our own opinion and decisions.

It is only a failure if they loose a war, but they aren't.

P.S. U.S. had same things and problems to deal with when invading Iraq and Afghanistan from logistics standpoint."
"A few weeks ago, many said that the west are busy body. They said that the Russians have every right to excercise in their own territory.

"Bruh you’re talking as if ukraine is some tribal militia nation that should have been easily overrun.

And the UScThe zeU and NATO xd oti except run their mouth about democraic values and such more gas from Fussia and finish the Nordtresm piping while cutting its own energy production demented by a vision of climate change.
This.... theRssian destruction of Ukrsine is the payoff for years of complacency stupidity and deusions.delusions.
This particular narrator did a good job of summarizing an knew what he was about ."
Thank you for this video glad you are not Putin or you would have won that war 🤣well written video really amazing work you and your team is doing!
So informative!
It is not failed. It just begun.
"Нет войнe!  
Желаю силы украинскому народу.  🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
И желаю мужества российским протестующим.🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺


Strength to the Ukrainian people.
And courage to the Russian protestors."
Russia flying the rebel flag lmao
"So the Russia:

1) Has worse equipment
2) Has worse morale
3) Is on an attacking side 
4) Has less personell overall
5) Has terrible officers

What are their chances? Why aren't they surrendered yet?"
"Sorry to say i do not think most contrys would do better. I think the west does too much backpading not realizing they did not went agist anywere near a peer oponent and tryed to advance in the face of resistance without total air supremycy paving most bumps in the way.  What people do not understand you dont just blitzkrieg your tanks into citys and expect them to survive. Sure RU might have underestimate the Ukrains willingness of defence but in the long run Ukraine gets destroyed more and more whiele production in RU does not. And once defeces are comited  i wouldnt be suprised to see another push in the west to cut off western nation weapon suplys.

Sure defence favors Ukraine but on the other hand once major population centers are encircled and cut off from water and elecricity we will see how strong they can be hold."
Failed? Looks like they're still advancing to me
they can't deploy all of their 200 000 troops at once and thought they could win in 2 days but the resistance was high and now they have to supply their troops which shows putin wasn't ready for long war
Do videos about [The Failed Logistics of USA's Invasion of more than 20 countries]
great video
"A little suggestion - As a non-native english speaker, I found it difficult to listen and understand you. Can you do something for this."
Wow many logistic specialist in here. Uraaa!
This is nothing compared to Syria and Iraq. The war crimes committed by the civilised west.
American commentators tend to analyze this in terms of American shock and awe  strategy. Russians....not so much. This is going to be a down on the ground grappling match. Not sure if the European population has the stomach for this. They would much rather kick the Americans out of Europe and settle for peace with Russia.
Some commented (on Fox News) that Putin's tactics are Napoleonic (Napoleon like). And we all know how he ended up!
"1:46 ""this extension of military might was made possible by Briliant"""
"This is gross, Israel and the US want to conquer Russia by gradually expanding east even though they promised they would not. This is a huge threat to Russia and the west is brainwashed to think Putin attacked to reconquer old territory. If you support Nato (israeli safe-guard) then you support the genocide of the Palestinians."
Imagine  ( JOHN LENNON  )
If Russia wanted to they would of carpet bomb the entire country but this us more of a pr war than actual war
"Russia has no reason to attack ukraine, people who say they look at it from Russia's perspective are wrong. If you are unbiased, then also look at it from Ukraines perspective. A country that is independent for 30 years but Putin denied it is a sovereign country in multiple speeches before he attacked. Ukraines is a neighbor of russia and isnt allowed to make its own alliances to protect itself from Russia, because that would upset russia? The same Russia under putin that attacked multiple neighbors and Putin who regularly holds speeches saying they should restore the borders of the USSR? 

Russia's warcrimes are well documented. Shelling civilian areas with (unguided) grad rockets. Using cluster munitions and thermobaric bombs. Intentionally targetting hospitals and schools. Anyone denying this has an agenda and should be ashamed of themselves. You will be a victim of this too eventually if you keep finding excuses for warcrimes. A lot of people in Myanmar were denying the Rohingya genocide, now their military has turned against them too and commits such crimes on their own population. Remember this. If you hate the USA that doesnt mean you should suppport Russia's warcrimes on Ukraine, the civilians in Ukraine dont even speak English. They just want to keep their country independent and not be part of Russia, which has enormous sanctions on them and it will ruin ukraines future if they were conquered by russia."
Good.
"This supposed failure of Russian invasion looks very suspicious, almost intentional. This could very well be a distraction, a false assurance to the Ukranians. May be they want to show that they CAN do a lot of damage to get a better deal on table rather than hold territory."
The best information video on the subject so far. Will keep following. Great job man!!
"With their empire way of thinking. No matter the form of govt . It's always been the nobles at the top making decisions that peasants can't be trusted to blow their nose .
Usa has the smallest unit as a fire team      if you have 2 survivors they find out when they signed up or if szne rank .  We always have some one in charge. 
We are a citizen military. 
Russians smallest unit is a squad .
12 guys.
One Sgt in charge .
Always top down , not trusting the actual boots on the ground"
"This brutal invasion is not ony a sad repetition of history but shows the liberal dream of peace trough global trade has been an illusion. For decades Russia and China have build up their armies and strengthended their hold on their population with western money in trade for recources and cheap labour. Many people have warned for this and now we are at the turn in history were Russia and next China are moving into action to expand their territory and ideology. Economic sanctions will only drive Russia and China more together and gives them a narrative to defend their agressiveness. This may sound harsh but the west has to show their real teeth and draw a line with military force, and in this case should interneve in Ukraine hard and hammer down on Putin's army with full force. Even if that means ww3, this is the only language Putin and Xi will listen to."
Wait we seen this in the USA too during this same time.
Putin should have studied Romel.
Wait a minute if this stated in 2014 why wasn't it stopped then? So basically  Obama and trump knew this someone should have been able to stop this situation  so sad.
"Except that the world let Putin get away with attacking the crimea I cannot fathom how he thought he would benefit from attacking the Ukraine.

He is going to end up with Russia isolated and considered to be a pariah.
After the new and formerly happy Russian millionaires get through thrashing him and launch their own offensive, Putin is liable to end up in a gulag."
"While all the media is saying Vladimir will be the one to press the button, I'm just glad I get a break for a change. And you know the situation is F'd up when even *Bald* decides to leave. This is a well done analysis, comrade"
You get out of here Kim go back to eating cheese.
tact???
Hope so maney  thinks  not added in  this  dokomantory
"This is misleading, the convoy north of Kiev is the hammer and if not destroyed this unit will take Kiev."
"17:15 are we going to ignore the Ukrainian civilians who were murdered by their own government simply for ""staying in the place they call home"" for 8 entire years, and this dude didn't even make a video, but now of course, when it's not just war between the Ukrainian government and its peoples, but between Russia and ukraine, the deaths are sooo tragic. 

I'm Ukrainian, I pray for my nation and my peoples, for all of them. But you can't just ignore the fact that Neonazis were shelling towns, villages and cities in Donezk and Lugansk for 8 (!!!) years."
"Thank you for saying it's a continuation of one rather than a new one. I hate the memers saying it's a new war when it's been going on since 2014 when Russia took Crimea. Both times, Russia broke the Olympic Truce (yes, during a time THEY hosted) before the Winter Paralympics. And both times, Ukraine STILL attended the Paralympics.
The thing is, Russia calls Ukrainians the fascists yet in a Russian government source they've called this the ""Solution to the Ukrainian Question""...the irony just writes itself"
"This is the most intensive,  informational video I've seen !  Thank you for explaining the true cause of Russia's mis-calculation of its military complex  !   The satellite technology is such a strategic advantage of NATO 's military complex that it has proven superior to Russia's military advance and surprise invasion of Ukraine ! It looks as  if Ukraine was more prepared for the invasion than Russia was !  Putin underestimated the fighting spirit of Ukraine under Zelensky !  When a country tries to take away the freedom and homeland of a peaceful people ,it increases the level of  determination of its people towards it's invaders ! You've heard the addage , "" it's not the size of the dog in the fight BUT the size of the fight in the dog !"".   ""  GLORY TO UKRAINE !"""
Historical fact: The Ukrainians were the best fighters in the Russian army in WWII. It SHOWS?
Героям Слава!!!
I was a sr intel officer during the cold war: an amazing job putting the product together and delivering it. Note: the massive railroad network ends on the boarder of Ukraine—the sides have two different gauges (width if tracks). So everything must go by truck because all the locomotives were moved or willie peted into flames. Strong product!
"Un-fucking-believable that Russian military operates their radio comms in the clear, no crypto.  Truly stunned that a conventional military in 2022 doesn't encrypt it's communications."
"Finally, a satisfying analysis of the ongoing unfortunate and unnecessary war unlike the rest of western (Oooh Russia bad West is good and brave) propaganda, i had many questions about the unexpected imbalance of progress in this war from an average person`s perspective and you answered them."
Putin apologists have no place in this world. It’s time to do what’s right and take him out to 🗑.
Just another piece of western propaganda.
"Ukrainian jets were in the sky when Putin ordered to bomb all airfields, so now we have Ghost of Kyiv representing our entire Air Force. If anyone sees enemies convoy or pipeline, they report it to our soldiers in telegram immediately. Modern warfare, huh. Slava Ukraini!"
"the problem with curiosity stream and nebula is it isn't child friendly, there's hidden opinion in there that's cowardly and corrupting"
This is FAKE NEWS and PROPAGANDA.
profile pic checks out
"Hey man, I love all your videos. But considering this is a current event, maybe add a donation link or encourage people to donate before the ad at the end."
"So TLDR; Russia tried to fight a WW2 style of war and even tried the whole blitzkrieg thing like was tried on them all those years ago, and literally walked into many of the same issues, such as not enough logistics, trouble with the rails, partisans etc etc. Funny how that ""history always repeats itself"" thing keeps getting proven correct doesn't it? 

Also i find it incredibly interesting that people sitting in their bedrooms 1000's of kilometers away can mess with military actions. I wonder if that means more than ever you don't have to justify just to your own people that the war is just, but to the rest of the world, less you get hampered by people from across the world who can now have direct and real impact on the success of military operations....."
"Well it worked in Syria, but we didnt care about that as it sounded too foreign."
You don't know what a blitzkrieg is.  You don't know what WWII is either.
Just read the latest FSB whistleblower’s report. This was a Putin only decision. He’s likely going to bring down his entire country with him. I
This is one of the best videos I’ve seen you produce. Well done.
The best break down of the war I’ve heard so far. Great work.
I hope you never plan to visit Russia... ever... even if this war is over... Putin's government will want to put you in a re-education camp.
It's time for Putin's war criminals to go back home.
Its impressive how no westerner is mentioning the bombing of US bio labs in Ukraine
Great work summarising Russian predicament with war-time logistics.
How did it fail if the Russian are in Kyiv
"It's unfortunate that too many Russians are imperialists just like Putin. They don't see anything wrong with forcing their harsh rule over smaller groups like Ukrainians, Georgians, Chechens, Baltic nations, etc. This tiny little version of Napoleon won't stop at Ukraine, he will keep going. Putin's war crimes are piling up."
Happened quickly? Everyone saw it coming.
Lol it was sabotage by general or high command to make fun of Putin. Ever wonder why russia aint pounding Ukraine like usa did to iraq with hundreds thousand civilian casualty. Many soldier found not willing to fight

Excellent video.. This is the type of info on the conflict I’ve been looking for. BBC and npr can only take you so far. Thank you so much for this. Looking forward to more videos. Stay safe and be good humans out there y’all
Bendover has always been CIA shill propoganda especially the amount of sinophobic content it vomits out. Glad so many people can see through this rubbish and use their critical brain through this garbage propoganda

Long live Ukraine 🇺🇦
The Ukrainians are winning this war with memes and molotov cocktails?! Taking down street signs is the nail in the coffin. Russia is getting trolled so hard 😅
"I read a lot of history.  Thanks to You Tube I can watch a lot of movies and documentaries.  I was not surprised by Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  I was surprised that he launched a Total War against the Ukraine.  As much as I knew about WWII and WWI   the interwar years were very important also,  I posted about the Holodomor in a previous post.  
Something else I did not know---The Ukraine has the most resources that any other European or Asian country. 
I told my friends that the Soviets don't invade with large supplies of food, bullets or fuel.  The Soviet doctrine is use the inventory of goods from the conquered territories.  The United States is the opposite.   We carry everything we need to maintain an invasion.  That comes with a great cost in money and also a great cost in logistics.  I predicted this would happen.  If the Ukrainians were to adopt a scorched earth policy, there would be no resupply for the Soviets.  Why do I call them the Soviet?  What is different?  They are still ruled by a dictator.  They still have one man in managing the economy.  The Russians have been building up to this event for many years.  
I did not think Belarus would help the Soviets.  big surprise for me.\


Also, I want to make this perfectly clear----This is not a war that the US should send troops to.  #1  It is not our fight, this conflict has been going on for 400 or so years
#2 I do not think our Soy Boys with their man buns could withstand a full on Soviet style attack.  Also, our Trans female/trans male people will not be able to function if their hormones are not delivered.  I think they would work well if the stayed in the HQ somewhere flying drones.
# 3   Ukraine wants to be in NATO- well, NO,  not no but   HELL NO!!!  The US has spent about 6.5 trillion dollars on NATO.  We just cannot afford another foreign government sucking on the USA's sugar tit.  Yep,  the Ukraine and the others know that the Soviets have fairly good weapons,  BUT  they just don't benefit from the Soviet Ruble in the same fashion as the would from the Niagara Falls of brand new, fresh off Uncle Sam's Sugar Tit, of $100 dollar bills.  The United States contributes more than 200X of the dollars that England, Germany and other countries contribute.
NATO should be disbanded and let the other countries get together and form a European Treaty Organization.   
Watch:  The Battle for Sevastopol--the story of Ludmilla Pavlachenko.  It's on You Tube.   Boy Soldier--true story  watch the newest one.  The Bridge-- a German War movie made in the 50's in black and white- a very good movie---Stalingrad--  The Dawns Here are Quiet.  All of them have very good English language subtitles."

"This war reminds me of something, Oh yes, of course that is Iraq, remember, they have weapons of mass destruction, come on Europe help us poor Americans then we are not only liable, then we can do something about it, because the the first time it did not go so well, it was a nice training but we missed the weapons of mass destruction, the first time went very well, then the ambassador of America, Sadam Husein, promised not to intervene if he took Kuwait, what a sucker is that Sadam, you really have no use for him, if you order him to destroy Iran, you really have no use for him. You can no longer even quietly torture 20,000 Iranians to death a year, then those terrorists will just take our embassy staff hostage out of the blue, that even our Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, who has a large package of shares in Shell and the Shah of Persia, who her greatest friend is that she always welcomes him with the greatest royal honour, that will also help, because you can't leave your American friends in the lurch anyway."
Way too early to make this video...
"Russia suck at war against minor nations. They lost to Japan, then Poland, then Finland nor Ukraine."
RUSSIA liberators... Zelensky Ukraine neo nazi... Ukraine Nationalanist hard core fan of Bandera...
"If you know anything about the Chechen War, you can see how Putin might think this was going to be easy. Nope. The Ukraine is ten times the size of Chechnya."
"what ukraine did is exactly what i used to do in Age of EMpires
attack the supply , attack villagers and trade routes to choke gold supplies of the enemy, 
then launch my own offense on two fronts as a pincer ... 
miss those days"
Well alec pudwin is against ukraine handing out assault rifles to it's citizens
Enemies of Russia and Putin be binded and destroyed in the name of Jesus Christ! 🔥🙏
All satanic demonic attacks weapons be binded and broken in the name of Jesus Christ !🔥🙏
Victory for Russia and Putin in the name of Jesus Christ!🙏🔥
Lots of Russian trolls claiming this is all fake when you sort by new comments.  That's how you know you did a good job.
слава україні
"In my personal opinion, the russian military strategy here is simple, they will take over Ukraine and rightfully so. (most will never get it due to media). However, the military strategy Russias using is tactical. This isnt a country attempting to take over an enermy territory. its merely a country looking to get their step-brother in check. Russia is using its ""greenhorn"" battalions to get into action and show force to Ukraine and get it to snap out of the decision its trying to make. If Russia wants to ""invade/takeover/wipeout/genocide etc etc) Ukraine.. That can be done in a week (Just as we consider the US' capability) US isnt the sole superpower, thats why RU is in the picture when that word is used. The real strategy is to get Ukraine in check, and to protect the eastern nations. Its obvious. And so be it. US has made it so through all kinds of propagandas related to ""the fight to freedom' and provide liberty and justice to those afflicted by ""terror"". But who's to decide when another superpower decides the same, minus the highschool theatriCAL act everyones gotten used to."
Putin is resuming Stalin's attempt to destroy and exterminate the Ukrainian People.   the Holodomor Holodomor - Wikipedia
Anyone else digging into some Civ 5? 😂🤣
"How to cripple Russian land forces?

Blow up the railways😂🤣"
эту войну начала америка
cringe
"Its pronounced ""key, eff""

No one ever called it keef until this civil war popped off"
The Russian troops are showing themselves to be inadequate and frightened as well.Hardly the all conquering legions we in the west have been fearing for 70 years.
"Kiev populace remaining there should take this time given to them to leave the capital. The city will be ""choked"" until there's no more food and water. Eventually you will have to leave. Once civilians are gone, it will be air-stricken. Then Russian ground forces will come in to get Zelensky."
In a real conflict all there railways would be destroyed and they would be in deep poo!
"Maybe its not so much that the Ukrainians have put up a great defence,which they have,but the Russian offensive power was just inadequate,poorly planned,poorly supplied,poorly led,with pathetic frightened 18 year olds who have no real feelings to die for Putin."
So basically they are just stealing whatever they want when they want...🤔very typically Russian!
"Im no military expert by all means, but the first things I thought of was logistics/attrition which is undervalued in war. I think that since the war has gone past a couple days which Putin thought it would last, it is now starting to show the faults in this area."
So Ukraine really has nothing to worry about?
"Failed, Putin is just getting started. Unless Nato gets involved Ukraine will be at a disadvantage. Freedom for Ukraine and all oppressed people."
"Rip, you would think that because Russia used to control Ukraine during the era of the Soviet Union that they would have been able to plan for this better, guess Putin really is as stupid as people say he is."
"there is no logic at all. American could arrange supply coz they are an Americans, Russians cannot arrange supply coz they are Russians )))). Do we need to beleive that supply a few km from Russia is harder than a few thousand km from the States? Such a nonsense."
"I doubt this is correct.. it's very possible Putin used these poor young souls as fodder, to evaluate resistance, use up defender's ammo etc.. I'm afraid he'll come in now with actual crack troops. I pray I'm wrong..."
"Please,No More "" third screen "" screen splits. It gives me a headache, and makes me feel nautious."
"Most of this information is solely based on Ukrainian military propaganda, which has little to do with reality. Russians simply did not storm large cities to prevent civilian casualties, encircling them instead. Ukraine military is absolutely demolished, they will not win."
Putin went from hero to Zero real fast!
just like this video which is simply anti Russian propaganda
"It is somehow a damn sad little detail which shows how the irony in russia is hitting the wrong .. Young russian soldiers from the very poor corners of russia asking ukraine civilians for food after they had to invade them . I remember a guy came freshly from russia to germany and told me : There are only 2 ways for a casual young person in my home city to get something , crime or army .."
"And the difference is? If their crimes are prefixed with ""war"" or not."
"Evrybody saw US logistic superiority in afganistan :D
Russian tactisc are actually very effective, evry line they push they turn it to their new starting point line, which they are basicly moving, then rest then again, with minimal infantry loss possible. Considering they are neigbours theres no reason to rush, and its safe. They have surrounded larger part of the country, wich is cuted off by the river.
and this is pretty much operation, because in real terms numbers and equipment are incomparable, its not even operation, its advancing and taking"
"Let me guess, your Serbian lmao? 🤣"
"Sorry this attack is going on in Palistine or Ukrain? Oops a lot of Europian white peoples, innocent children's and young boys and girls with blond  hair and blue eyes are going to be displaced and their lives are also in serious danger. Mr Putin you are really a bad man. Bad bad bad bad even very bad man how dare you? they are not even Muslims. Mr Putin you are in my bad books from now on..Ukrain is look like any other destroyed city in Palistine, Iraq and Yeman. Its so bad Mr Putin. I am really not happy.  Any way My heart is really bleed for the innocent peoples of Ukrain though or even any waste of innocent life anywhere in the world. thanks"
"If there's one thing Russian are losing, its the propaganda war."
God help Ukraine survive this genocide! 💛💙
War is nothing to know.
"I hardly believe that Russians doesnt use secured radios and that any hams could listen them (if you have fréquencies, I could check myself).. Even if some vehicles were seized, it is elementary to change regularly cipher modes."
"Could you please make, like, a twice a week Russo-Ukraine War update video?  I don’t have a Patreon account, but I’d probably get one for that."
piplines. They must be really easy to guard
There is one fate for this war and it's Russias inminnent victory.
Its Russia. Failed logistics to us is just normal logistics
This is like real journalism ..
Wrong
"14:19 Sooooooo Russian, centrally planned logistics fails in compared to NATO market based logistics.  ANOTHER win for capitalism!! Sorry comrades 🇺🇸 🇺🇸"
I wouldn’t say this was a surprise. It was excepted nobody did nothing about it.
Wendover propaganda
"Blows my mind people are still saying ""Keeve"""
"nice and sounds true ,"
"The west give Russia too much credit. Third
world country military capability at best."
"NATO attack:
14,500 have died in Libya
165,000 have died in Afghanistan
224,000 have died in Syria
1,200,000 killed in Iraq
It did not shock anyone.
None of these countries received approval.
Russia's killing of 200 Ukrainian troops came as a shock. Human pain overflowed.

Does NATO have any right to blame Russia at all"
False numbers
Propaganda
"Oh no.... they didn't achieve 100% efficiency. It will be an interesting talking point when the Zelensky regime is no more and the Ukrainian people have a brighter future free from meddling NATO weapons dealers, neonatsi infiltration of their military and politicians pandering to ultra-nationalists. Better days ahead without agitprop like this video. Who is desperate?"
"adolf putler, stop war!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Im pretty sure russia is winning and has been, no failure here. they haven't even started to invade kiev, only bombard."
"stop this, adolf putler......!!!!!!⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔"
"stop this, adolf putler......!!!!!!☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️☢️"
Not the trutht
"stop this, adolf putler......!!!!!!"
"What is curious is despite all this, Russia has embarrassed itself by displaying its incompetency.  Were it not for its numbers and its disregard for human life, their military would be seen as a complete joke!"
stop war!!!!!!!!
"Stopped listening at ""Vladimir Putin, the autocrat of Russia.""  Pathetic."
Do you see a lot of checks and balances in Russia's government? Don't be so sensitive.

10 minutes ago
I'm Russian and I'm amazed at Palki Sharma knowledge. For the first time I see an unbiased report like a true journalism should be instead of cancel culture in USA. Couple things to add to that report: Russia asked NATO to join and was denied. Another important thing not many people know: Ukraine was bombing and shelling Donetsk and Lugansk regions since 2014 for 8 years! Killing hundreds of children and snipers shooting women with infant babies on their hands. A genocide of Russian people living in eastern Ukraine. Done by neonazis that were promoted and cherished by west and Zelensky. That same Zelensky who is now praised as a brave president by their mass media non stop 24/7. The same man responsible for thousands of death (more than 13000 people died for 8 years of genocide). Unimaginable hypocrisy from west."
Idk looks like another anti Russian propaganda
14:35 silly communists and their command economies
Good god 2014 was 8 years ago?  (Loads Calvin Harris playlist)
"Russia has been bad at war for well over a century. Being the biggest kid on the block with a population of servile nitwits is the only reason they win ""wars"" against much weaker neighbors."
"Well one thing is clear. Russian military capability is a tiny fraction of what we thought. Against a proper military like the US the war would be over already. Train tracks would have been bombed. Convoys annihilated. Strategic bases wiped out. Probably within hours. Russia has some fancy tech up its sleeve but in such tiny numbers it’s irrelevant. I honestly don’t think Russia holds a candle to NATO. Like it’s wildly lopsided. Euro NATO countries are far better equipped than Ukraine. I don’t even think Europe would need to the US.

That said, we all know why that confrontation cannot happen. Nukes. The only thing allowing Russia to invade a European country. If nukes weren’t in the picture Russia would have been demolished by a coalition the likes of which has never been seen."
"Sort of. They've certainly moved slower and taken more losses than we expected, but they've also held back some of their capability that they probably would use against NATO (not including nukes). And keep in mind the Ukrainians are also taking a lot of losses, a lot more than the US has had to deal with in any war since Vietnam."
@Pesticide your little brain is controlled by the plant in your profile pic 🤩 stars in your eyes you know the song
"Most of the Ukraine now is swamps. Snow melts, it becomes harder to deliver supplies. It very centralised and there is literally middle age outside the three biggest cities (this is very relatable to all CIS countries) so there is no infrastructure (even no roads) that could help with the logistics. Plus Ukraine is very big and it takes weeks for superpowers to at least cross it, not even conquering. There are 200 000 active soldiers in Ukraine and all men from 18 to 60 are being recruited (Ukraine population is 60 millions). They . Aside from that, there are lots of russian-hatred regions of the country since USSR times and they would fight to the death while a patriotism in Western Europe hits the deep. Also I would like to point to the fact that quarter of the Ukrainian population speaks russian (or even maybe native russians or pro-russian ukrainians) and Russian Federation do not want collateral damage. All these factors are unique for Ukraine and you cannot predict the outcome of Russia fighting NATO members."
What happend in Afghanistan all army’s could not beat them and retreated leaving all kit behind taliban won the war with pellet guns and mountains
Big If Kid haha you stuttered n mumbled at the end of your paragraph Russia is a massive fighting force you should be sweating not talking nonsense about equipment
"Russian military is like a bear, a panda bear that is"
Nicely done
"Sam,  thank you for all of your incredible videos.  For that, I've signed up for Curiosity/Nebula."
Don't they have GLONASS like GPS navigation system?. Why are they relying on maps ?
1970s technology with 1940s tactics... Tank warfare in modern times is outdated.  Their air force is decades out of date.
Fleet drones a jet fly through a bunch of those it’ll bring it down
RPGs take out trucks!
its only day 12........🙄
You make it sound like the war is already over!! WTF?
sooooo this video is basically saying send in spec ops teams to take out railroads
"hmmmm anyway pray for Russia that they win it so that cancer spread can be stopped. Also russia intelligence seems to be poor , its just ukraine not UK its on borders to them so through intelligence they should have gather all information and through their satellites too like where there are military bases are then like USA should have fire 1000 kaliber cruises missiles over those sites and should cleaned it and then through drone network locate their old mobile air defense systems and should hit them through their long range air strikes and also everyone knows where are gov buildings in capital should have blow them with their cruises missiles as Zalensky was hiding in one of them."
"Do you really believe that Putin wants a war??? Study the history of this conflict first. The fact that NATO deceived Russia and began to include countries in the alliance that, according to the treaty, should not have been included in it (after the collapse of the USSR, NATO countries led by the United States promised that they would no longer approach Russia), for Russia this is a direct threat to the security of the state (if Ukraine will join NATO (as President Zelensky has repeatedly said), then missiles will fly from Ukrainian Kharkov to Moscow in 5 minutes and no missile defense system will have time to shoot them down). But Putin's demands were ignored, so where is Putin wrong in trying to secure his country, which the West has deceived? What do you think, if Russia staged a revolution in Mexico and planted a puppet president there, and then they began to place their missiles there and began to pump up Mexico with weapons to confront the United States, how long would such Mexico exist? The US is doing the same in Ukraine!!! I tell the situation directly from Russia, my channel talks about how we see it!"
Grazing fire is the best way! A couple of rounds to the gut makes an impression on everyone! The person that got hit and the persons within earshot! Sepsis!
This will get much worse when the spring thaw happens. Napoleon and Hitler found that out.

"Russian President Vladimir Putin is the most ( HATED ) man in the world...   Russian President Vladimir Putin is a ( habitual and compulsive LIAR ) even to his own people, country, and the WORLD...         :)"
Russian logistics failed because they did not expect it would be so easy and they would dive in so deeply into Ukraine since the very first days! LOL! You people are turning it into some kind of Russian failure. It is nuts! All foreigners who are independent and just state what the situation is agree that Russians control by now pretty much the 2/3rds of Ukraine. It is just that they want to avoid bombing cities and they want to go in as smoothly as possible. That is all. All the rest is wishful thinking.
Stop your politician narrative point of view about it being a war. It was never a war. It is a invasion of a sovran country!!!
"Tsar Putin trying every ploy to legitimize to the Russian people his invasion of Ukraine. Using “Neo Nazi” is meant to evoke strong feelings harkening back to WWII when thousands of brave Russian soldiers and citizens died stopping the Nazi war machine. That, from Putin, is a disgraceful tactic that does much dishonor to the memories of those Russians who died fighting the real Nazis."
No battle plan will ever survive contact with the enemy.
"Does anyone else cringe when they hear ""keeve""!?"
"@Aggie Longhorn No, it's not. Its actually further away from it than the Russian pronunciation is 😂"
"That is the pronunciation that Ukrainians prefer. Ke-ev is Russian pronunciation. Knowing that, no cringe."
"It would appear that Russian Generals and war planners over estimated their army and airforfce abilities to hand putin a victory in 3 days.  Putin will have to bomb the Ukranians with chemical weapons to make them surrender or this war will go on for months, a Ukranian victory assured."
That video at 17:09 of the soldier sobbing while making that video call is very telling.
Putin wants to reinstall Vicktor Yankovich the pro-Russian president back into power.
Thank you for the unbiased information on a very tragic situation.
"China is now the big dawg barking up the chain, gonna have to discipline that one 😂"
"Imagine being one of superpowers and cowardly invaded a small country by telling the whole world “we are not going to invade Ukraine, we are just here in Belarus for joint training. We are moving troops close to the borders just to show power” 

Then once everyone is close to the border, they attack at 2 am😂🤣🤡 Russians are not coward but Putin and his advisers are the cowards that will be in history😂🤣🤡"

16:42 Absolutely to the point.
You smart guy.. Dont try to be smarter than Putin.. A big mistake.. You have no idea at all whats going on and what will happen..
"Do not describe every time the Russian troops stop as a lack of fuel or poor radio service. So far we did not see any harm inflicted to the Russians by the other side or any other issues related to "" poor logistics "".  Russia never planned to seize Kiev by massive ground attack or destroy the city of our common history. This is totally different from what the western propaganda pours into your ears or eyes. All Russia wants is to clear the former Russian satellite of fascists and nazis, (or bandera as they are known ) brought to power by the usa and their agent Nuland in 2014 anti gov. coup."
I get the impression Republicans are depressed about Putin not being able to pull it off…
"I think it's more the dichotomy of Putin bad, NATO good that's grown a bit tired. Modern Russia is not the USSR. They're overblown, and our western allies receive a ridiculous amount of cash, and material assistance from us, while the average American receives nothing in turn. They're like a very large blood sucking tick. They've had 80 years since the great war, let them handle it themselves. This empire business doesn't benefit us, and there are a lot of veterans from that last 21 years who could tell you of it's futility abroad."

@Mike Howard exactly!!!!
"I like your attitude, Mister!  Keep it up . I'm subscribing! !"
"If you ask me (We Didn't) Putin had tears in his eyes when he gave the ""Special War Speech"", he looks like he was not happy with what he had to do!"
"It isnt surprising, and the fact that the Russian army is unmotivated just makes things worse for Putin.  thankfully."
"Note the contrast in tactics between the West and East; Western weapons in the Middle East became more precise and less destructive (concrete bombs, mechanical shredder missiles) to minimize collateral damage/civilian casualties. Russia elected to just throw larger more destructive ordnance everywhere."
"Also shows why Western military intervention isn’t morally equatable to Russian invasion. It would be easy for coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan to just blow everything up, but we elected not to, and chose the more expensive option. That says something I think."
Russia thought they would muscle in and the Ukrainians would give up without much of A fight!! Instead they got punched in the mouth and don't know how to react. The Russian play book only had 1 play in it and it failed!
👍
"While this was interesting to listen to, the sheer amount of contradictory statements and misinformation I've heard in recent times means that I can't really take this video at face value.  We probably won't know what really happened in Ukraine until the history books get written... and probably not even then."
"@Grant Sampson Did I say anything of the kind?  I'm just saying that pretty much every piece of information you hear about the war comes from either Ukraine or Russia, both of which are suspect sources.  The first casualty of war is the truth.  Just because you like Ukraine doesn't mean they don't use propaganda."
@Grant Sampson da comrade!
Hi your video on Anchorage Alaska has suddenly become more relevant. Would be a sound investment right now. ✅
"supper glad you made this video knowing that youtube would not recommend it to alot of people unless they searched it, thanks for spreading the thruth and keeping people up to date on whats happening!"
"Should Ukraine invade Russia? Putin's 'Denazification' claim makes it apparent there he has no ground for invading Ukraine but…we must also take some of the pain as Putin deserves all that is coming to him, and more he has shown he is not worth the Russian people he is just a cheap KGB criminal/evil and this sort of determined resistance his criminal mind can’t grasp the reality playing right front of his eyes! He was a loser from the very start who stole billions with his close circle of loyal friends, that belonged to the Russian people. Like all dictators that live in palaces usually end up dead or imprisoned by the ICC. I am truly sorry for the many lives Ukrainians lost but they must be very proud that Putin will find out “what goes around comes around” let us not forget the tens of thousands he killed, there can be no forgiveness. Hey…Karma works. Now it is only a matter of time before Alexei will be free and make Russia what Russia will be once Russians learn the truth, thank you, thank you, thank you Zelensky from the very deepest part of my heart, the world is with you and Alexei you both will get on well and peace will conquer evil, Cornelis Pepsee de Bilde (on LinkedIn)"
"Good stuff and I wish the Ukrainians well, but this is just whistling in the dark. The Russian invasion has slowed down, it hasn't stopped. Most victorious armies out run their supplies and have to wait until they catch up. That does not mean that Putin will order his tanks to turn round and go home."
"I don’t agree. Russia and Putin simply are not as stupid as they appear. 

This is a deception. A pre-war as it were.   IMHO, devastation on a massive scale awaits Ukraine, and fairly soon. 

This is not in any way meant to take away from the bravery and nationalism of the Ukrainian Defence!  It has been, and will continue to be the best in all of world history. 

Ukrainians, please keep up your resistance using the best strategies available. I (who knows nothing), recommend training and arming all game hunters with scoped, silenced 22LR weapons and take head shots on all enemies. Eyes are good targets to incapacitate and kill. You’ll need thousands of such soldiers, but on your home turf you can be devastating. 

Or maybe I’m just stupid…."
"It seems that Russia has built their railroads and trains in No Step Back, but forgot to build the trucks for mass motorized supply, with logistic strikes by the ukrainians showing their over poweredness"
Failure? Not surprising given that this is the country that gave us Chernobyl.
"Two things I have noticed is......
1) a lack of infantry support. They can't be living in their vehicles for days. So where are they.
2) the columns, on a country road, are so long that just getting food, much less anything else,  to the head of the column would be very difficult."
Failed logístics ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Russia hasn't really evolved since WWII. Even using the same antiquated tactics they did 80 years ago.
"There will be no pity, no remorse, no compromise until Russia has completly crushed the opposition in Ukraine. Putin will never stop until all of Ukraine is under russian dictatorial control. All who believe otherwise are deluding themselves. Russian army will  most probably neglect, mismanage or accidently or deliberatly damage Ukrainian nuclear centrals causing significant global radiation contamination . For it's own protection, the rest of the world will then have no choice but somehow intervene directly, which will be the end of us all."
"I agree with you, Mr. Zelensky! Just one mistake: It's not NATO alone responsible for each death - it's the EU and the cowardness of both. When Mr. Blinken says ""tremendous lengths"", he is right: USA, UNO, NATO and EU went through tremendous lengths of time for 3000 helmets and the promise of 70 airplanes sitll not delivered! What are the pilots doing who came to pick them up? These four forces are incapable and unwilling (a fine mix) to make decisions. USA will not replace fighters, because it's part of that conspiracy! Cowardly assholes in all governments. You will soon see the results! Standing ovations from crooks mean nothing. I apologize for lashing out like Volodymyr - he does not know the EU, I do: 
EU is indeed a powerful decisionmaker when it comes to the curvature of bananas. Workers from Brazil to Belize get killed by the banana spider and can't fight back. I hope EU gets killed slowly by the tallyman with two legs not quickly by an animal with eight."

There is no substitute for brute strength. - Gen Douglas MacArthur
"Logistics could be viewed as not only the military weak point of the Soviet Union and Russia, but also a general weak point. As a communist state, both have economies driven entirely by the government. Logistical ineptitude in such a state results in surpluses of some goods, such as potatoes, and shortages of others, such as any other food. Mismanagement of resources could be viewed as the primary driving factor behind the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is clearly still an issue for the successor state of Russia."
"So Tik Tok was your primary reference, huh?  **shakes head**"
because russia is today's austria-hungria
"Kiev is surrounded (after two weeks) and it’s a failed invasion? How brain washed do you think people are?

Last example of Syria 
How long US was trying to make piece,  and how long it took Russia to do it 
And we're not even counting thousands of people was killed by US 
Talk to solgers who came back from Syria or Iraq,  they will tell you and about logistics too"
"Failed logistics is not so bad compared to, Ukrainian owner of brewery making molotovs gives out his name and company name live. Russia bombs a random brewery. Soldiers trying to loot, shooting rpgs at a nuclear power plants for giggles.Shooting randomly seems a thing in general, war crimes one after the other... The YPG is more efficient just to give an idea, with 1 billiontht of the ressources. The word shame regarding this has so many lvls. 
Putins big philosophy and wisdom is comparable to the idiot who knows hes acting like an idiot but hes too proud to admit it so hes gonna commit full balls deep to being an idiot because supposedly it makes you a though man there"
Nicely done. Top notch
One of your best videos so far!
Does the amassing of troops for months prior to the invasion mean that the invasion was not the result of a sudden irrational whim of Putin's?  Difficult to know which anti-Russia propaganda to believe.
"This video in no shape or form reflects the reality of the ground. It's been 12 days since the operation started and Russia now controls large swathes of Ukraine. The early stages involved probing, recon and intelligence gathering. The next phase involved encirclement of the opposition forces followed by crushing the pockets."
"10:10 This has been debunked as well. Hell, you even show footage of a Russian soldier with a military-grade radio in the previous clip. Come on."
Using random Twitter posts are sources... Come on.
"6:26
False. The Hostomel airport was never retaken from Russian forces."
"After seeing how badly they’ve failed at this invasion, I’m beginning to wonder how much of their claimed military might is North Korean style bluff and bluster. 

Sure they may have purchased a lot of equipment over time, but that means nothing if it isn’t maintained, or there’s no one trained to operate it. Their nuclear arsenal could be a pile of duds at this point, how would we even know? 

Maybe a lot of their apparent military purchases have been a mere front to funnel more money to Putins favoured oligarchs, so the supplied equipment isn’t that important to them? The main thing they 100% do have superiority in is their number of ice breaking ships."
This video was well put together 👍 I just hope Ukraine 🇺🇦 is strong 💪 enough to win and the rest of the world keep supporting Ukraine 🇺🇦
"Beep bob boop. Long live Russia

- C3PO"
Defending your country from invasion is suddenly good. News to Palestinians iraqis and Afghans...
Helps when you've never committed acts of terror around the world to get invaded in the first place.
Media is telling you it failed people on the ground are saying otherwise
Great video.
"There's something surreal about seeing a massive army build itself up through TikTok videos.

There's also something surreal about the idea of a comedian making a war effort against one of the most powerful militaries in the world, so impressive that signs reading ""Welcome to Hell"" sound more like a warning than a bluff."

FAKE NEWS!
"This video assumes that Putin is an unprepared idiot. He may well be for all I know, but it’s far too early to say and there’s far too little trustworthy information out there."
Crying shame that you felt the need to ruin an otherwise decent little doc with your crass advertising.
"I DECIDED............LIKE HE'S GOD...............THIS MAN IS GOING TO PAY IN HELL FOR ALL ETERNITY,,,,,,,,,IT'S APPOINTED UNTO MAN ONCE TO DIE, AND AFTER THIS THE JUDGEMENT..............HE HAS THE LAKE OF FIRE TO LOOK FORWARD TO, UNLESS HE CHANGES HIS WAYS...........BUT I DOUBT IT,,,,,,,,,,,,SORRY TO SAY.."
Russian citizens! Stop! Putin is a Trump! DON'T obey his directions. Revolt! Topple Putin.
"This is a very well done video, with good accurate information, compiled in a short amount of time. Well done. Keep it up for the war effort. Helping people understand what is really happening helps win."
a run for the money can you imagine if this were against a well-trained armed and supplied army AKA NATO joint force
"Seems a bit inappropriate how you're referring to this conflict in the past tense. It's far from over yet, with the resolution still uncertain."
"Don't forget those ""cheap"" Chinese tyres that keep going ""pop"" & disabling their trucks - very left field from their Chinese mates."
"HHUMM? And this is the SUPERPOWER with nukes that we are SUPPOSED to fear?

Okay ✅
"We're not even two weeks into the war, it's too soon to jump to conclusions such as this one"
"Sanctions are a team game. It is not played alone. Because it's boring. Once. Shares of European airlines flew at a peak, like the 737max. Finnair is on the verge of bankruptcy. The others are fine too. Shares fall to 30 percent. Russia, by the way, is so big that it is inconvenient and expensive to fly around it.

Two. The Ministry of Trade of Russia recommended chemical enterprises to suspend the export of methanol derivatives to Europe due to logistics problems. And that means this. Methanol is the raw material for such important products as pentaerythritol and urotropin. Without going into scientific details - without this, the EU chemical industry flies to the same place as aviation.

The share of our manufacturers of these substances in the EU market is 40% (pentaerythritol) and 50% (urotropin). ""European regulators are well aware that the short supply of these products to the territory of the Union can cause serious problems for the European industry of building materials, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, chemical and others.""

Three. Chemistry again. The Ministry of Commerce stated that it is necessary to suspend the export of fertilizers until the resumption of normal transportation and guarantees of delivery.

The ministry stressed that due to the sabotage of supplies by some foreign logistics companies, farmers both in Europe and in other countries cannot receive the necessary amounts of fertilizer.

Translated: on the eve of the sowing season, European farmers, and American farmers at the same time, remain without Russian fertilizers, and this is an ass, to put it simply. Our share in the global market is as follows: slightly less than a third of the world's production of potash fertilizers, about 10% nitrogen and about 20% complex.
There is nowhere to fill this shortage. That is, nowhere at all. There are no these fertilizers. Oh, stop. Belarus has them, which, it seems, is also a little under sanctions. And also focuses slightly. And in the end, alone without fertilizers. Somewhere, as in Ukraine, the sowing campaign has been disrupted. That is, in six months, the world food market, in particular, wheat, is simply collapsing. And interestingly, Russia is the world leader in the wheat market.

Logistics is destroyed, it is absolutely impossible to take our wheat to Europe. To China, that's easy. He needs a lot.

Fourth. It's interesting with semiconductors and chips in general.

""... The fact is that our country today accounts for 80 percent of the market for sapphire substrates — thin plates made of artificial stone, which are used in opto- and microelectronics to build layers of various materials, such as silicon. They are used in every processor in the world - AMD and Intel are no exceptions. Our positions are even stronger in the special chemistry of etching microchips using ultrapure components.
Russia accounts for 100 percent of the world's supply of various rare earth elements used for these purposes. The ban on finished products for Russia will result in a retaliatory ban on the supply of components.
production and will cause an acute shortage of processors
in comparison with it, the situation with supply disruptions at the end of 2021 will seem relatively easy”""

They say in Europe diesel is already 2 euros? And even 2.20? And a week ago it was 1.80. And the communal apartment has grown a little. Well, just a little. In principle, it is comparable to the fall of the ruble.
It's still more fun: nitrogen fertilizers in the world (except for the old Chinese coal—to-gas distilleries - the Chinese stupidly suffocated and killed the ecology) are produced, oddly enough (chemistry is a heartless bitch), from... natural gas.

Looking at world gas prices… In the UK, nitrogen fertilizer plants are already standing. In Holland, flower farms are on the verge of stopping (goodbye, Dutch all-season flowers, hello, new prices for March 8).
How much gas do you have there now? And the gas prices that have grown from $ 300 per cubic meter to 4000 do not bother?))"
Dear Russians. Send word home. You are now seen as thieves and rapists. Do better at home. Some advice. Before the west devours you all 😡😡😡

Good logistics - overkill on western bias :/
It's pronounced 'kyiv' not 'KEEV' lol
I cannot listen to this narrator's voice. 😱
"No, I do not think Putin's problem is logistics. For him, it's far worse. I think Russians are surrendering for a 'passport' out of Russia. I believe Putin's propaganda machine is NOT only ineffective at home, but also counterproductive. If the Ukrainians are smart, they will offer free emigration into Europe for soldiers who give up their weapons & plus bonus pay for advanced war materials. A long time ago, when the Nazis were Germans, Russian soldiers fought valiantly, even without guns, against Nazis oppressors. Now that Putin is Hitler, the troops, from generals to foot soldiers 1) do not want to fight this war, 2) Do not even want to stay in Russia under the present regime, 3) almost all could've foreseen & resolved the logistical issue themselves, but not chose. To frightened at the consequences of success. Putin may indeed be in real bad trouble at this point."
Report all the negative comments about Ukraine. It's Russian trolls and YouTube is kicking them off. They get paid to sit and talk smack about Ukraine and the NATO. Please pass it along. Slava Ukrain🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
@Frosted Butts yes it's worthless at this point. Less than a penny.
Pity they're getting paid in Rubles lol
Putin is destroying what he claims to be saving... If Russia wins this war how the hell are they ever going to afford the rebuild Ukraine when Russia's economy is 3rd world...
"Why is the U.N. not stepping in on this Ukraine invasion. Those people are on there own! 
 The Russian's need to be persuaded to leave the country."

"Interesting quote by General Pershing.  I remember a similar quote attributed variously to General Omar Bradley and General George C.

"@Peter Last i completely that for internal reasons trump would have been terrible, and I am the first one to be worried if he runs again I 2024. 
I mean sure, he had a great popularity in Russia, but he had that popularity because the Russian state propaganda let him have that popularity. And once he would have seriously opposed Putin on Ukraine, it would have turned around. I mean it’s possible that Putin isolation during Covid 19 didn’t help and could explain why he has acting as aggressive, but I also think this was probably coming sooner or later. Strategically speaking it was better for Russia to attack before. 
Nordstream 2 is super important because it is European dépendacy (especially from Germany) on Russian gaz that is stopping Europe from sanctioning one of the biggest revenue streams to the Russian state. 
Actually the afghan withdrawal and peace deal was the best option, because there was at that point no easy way out. For Biden weakness I would say that first his super long political career is a weakness because foreign countries can predict his moves. Also when he clearly lifted the strategic ambiguity with Ukraine by saying that there would be no us intervention, was the moment he signed Ukraine’s death warrant."
"@Pierre G why didn’t Putin attack Ukraine when trump was as president, for several reasons I imagine. Given trump’s popularity among Russians and being seen as overly sympathetic to both Putin and Russia, Putin would have been seen by his own people as too much of a jerk (even among his biggest supporters). Another reason is Putin’s Covid isolation, made him more unstable and delusional. The biggest reason is likely, a trump reelection win would be far more important than Ukraine, because it would most likely lead to the end of US democracy, as well NATO. Also Nordstream 2 wasn’t a military situation was it. Not to say Biden isn’t without his own flaws, for instance he let his frustration with Afghanistan drive him to not reverse trump’s bs Taliban appeasement and Afghan pullout. Biden may not be a Eisenhower, but he is not a weak president either."
"@Peter Last i mean as much as trump was crazy and dangerous to the internal us stage, I think people over criticize is foreign policy. He actually was the one that warned the Germans not to do nordstream 2 (to which they laughed at) and actually sanctionned the project, realizing how much it was helping russian interest. And I think it is not too crazy to say that Trump being crazy meant that Putin was legit scared of doing something too bold. If he really was a Russian asset, then why didn’t Putin attack during his term ? When Ukraine was much more divided and weaker than now?"

"The video was recorded by Putin a few days before, that is, everything was planned in advance and the troops were waiting for the recording to finish playing, so that they could vilely attack at night, as the Nazis did. Ukraine is on fire, but our armed forces are giving a worthy rebuff to the second army in the world. Russia sends terrorists from Chechnya, Syria to Ukraine and they will all die, because the truth is with us and God is with us and the whole world is with us"

Who are you liberating when the only people you attack are non-combatants?
I am really enjoying watching the Russian army fall on its face.  This is what happens when you tell your soldiers that you are just practicing and not going to war.  Ukraine is huge compared to Chechnya and Georgia and you are fighting people on their own soil.  Add in the massive influx of weapons to from around the world and the mission gets really really difficult.
It's like trying to start a revolution but not printing enough pamphlets.

"@Simplify Google ""Want to help Ukraine’s military as a foreigner? Here’s what you can do"" in the Kyiv Independent. AFAIK you have to apply starting at your local Ukrainian embassy, and you are expected to cover all of your own expenses, including uniform and armaments.

Just remember, war is not glorious or dramatic like the movies. You can read the accounts by soldiers. You will often lack access to basic amenities. There is by turns either a lot of waiting or constant, unrelenting movement, a lot of discomfort, and when the fighting finally arrives, there is a very good chance you don't make it out alive or intact; if you do, and you get captured, the results may potentially be even worse. What you see will follow you for as long as you live.

I understand how it feels to see all this injustice being done. You, like me, might imagine that the people seeing their families and friends torn apart could have been us.

However, there are also other ways to try and help Ukrainian refugees, or to perhaps help them rebuild when the war is over. Think carefully on it. This is not a decision to make lightly."
@Acting DeMickey Tell me how
You can actually do that if you are of legal age.
"Imagine where all Russian soliders sleeps, eating, sheet last 13 days... In TANKS, Pedestrians by rubble, pilots by helicopters or maybe some on Tents if they lucky. Logistics will fall apart every day now!! 💀"
"Can someone tell me if I’m right or wrong in thinking this, but even if Russia held the Hostomel airfield, it wouldn’t be that useful anyway if Ukraine played it right?

I mean yeah Russia can use it to land troops and supplies in kyiv, use it as a forward base for their aircraft etc…but couldn’t the Ukrainian forces literally just sit around the area with stinger missiles etc and just blow up any aircraft coming in to land or take off?

I mean let’s say your flying a huge Russian troop carrier or flying in vital supplies and your coming in to land….there’s literally no way you could evade a missile launched straight at you. And the same for their jets. When the jets are getting ready to take off couldn’t some dudes with rocket launchers literally just blow them up before they even take off?

Obviously that all relies on Ukraine holding the territory surrounding the airfield but if they do, I can’t see how it would be of much use to Russia."
"It's barely been 2 weeks and people think Ukraines winning, I remember in history when the French thought they were winning but an austrian painter proved them wrong in a couple months."
"How much did the Ruskis pay you to write that, ""Heisenberg""?"
they are winning lol
"“An amateur focuses on strategy, a professional focuses on logistics” or something like that"
Doesnt look like its failed to me. Not even 2 weeks in.
You could have the most powerful military in the world but it’s useless if you can’t deploy and put that power down where it’s actually needed. War is literally like a game of logistics. With a load of dead bodies thrown into the mix.
the problem with calling putin stupid? i go and listen to him. and he is smarter than all these shill youtube channels. which makes them look stupid. this propaganda campaign is very expensive. i hope the us dosnt go bankrupt
"See though, I don't get what his angle could be. Why act like you're losing when you're capable of winning?"
Why was Russia expecting Ukraine to just bow down to them? Lol - hilariously miscalculated
@SlavonicPagan are you suffering logistical issues?
They weren't. This is Ukrainian and Western propaganda. Every one serving in my unit knew beforehand that we'd face extremely stiff resistance
"Putin is sooooo vulnerable right now folkssssss. nukes in democratic hands only. we may need to take a few shots to get rid of putin and ccp stockpile. fight hard against iran or else.

i think we need to take this awful war now, or else we give too many ""mice,"" too many ""cookies."""
Russian armed forces are weak and full of 17 year old conscripts.  Getting spanked hard in Ukraine and will be the laughing stock of the world now.  Russia is now longer a superpower.  Even Israel could probably take them out.
Vlad is not a very good chess player. Not a very good history learner either.
Thanks Brandon. It's only a minor incursion.
The lop
"Where were the russian air forces and drones? A complete fiasco, or maybe .. a planned fiasco, and really justification for a 'palace coup'? It is worth watching what heads will roll in the Kremlin."
Logistics? Remember your WW II blunders when your mess up your logistics systems networks in your haste to reach Nazi Germany's heartland.
"The logistic can only be said to have failed if the Russians actually expected them to function more in an American manner. Invasion timelines that have been recovered by Ukrainian forces seem to indicate that the Russian advances are unfolding more or less according to their pre-planned schedule. A logistical system that dictates that victory can only be achieved at a great human cost is not a failure, if victory is nevertheless achieved."
Russia may have had the rail system in Russia but once in Ukraine the logistical supports failed. Logistics win wars then bullets and beans and it seems Russia is running out of all three. You have been lied to Russian soldiers just go home because Putin does not care how many of you gets killed.
It almost sounds as if Russia is less capable of waging a war in 2022 than Iraq was in 1990.
Did you bother looking into the shelling of the Donbass region?
"Just thinking on the fly here, but what if ""Russia's Logistics Failure"" is intentional?"
Interesting take...can you elaborate?
"Not well done, sam. You need to dive deeper in the history of Ukraine and how long it actually has been. Answer is 200 years old, as old as america. Why? Because Ukraine is a proxy project of the american government, a 102% corrupt country, funded and weaponized by the americans to poke at russia, specially after 2014. Its very important to note that zelensky is a jew and he is also a paid actor, only he is really an actor in occupation. Ukraine has had a population of 56m people, 46 million as of late years - why is that? Maybe there is something smelly and corrupt in the government there, and Putin was correct for starting the military operation."
"You're amazing and actually understand the rules!!!!!
Give the people the credit and you don't get screwed."
Why Russia and Ukraine hate each other?
"Putin has a massive rap sheet of crimes.
Murdering livinyenkyo.
Attempted murder using chemical weapons in Salisbury.
Georgia 
Chechnya
Syria, Aleppo. 
Now Ukraine
He's a murderer and warmonger. Glory to Ukraine!"
You have a weird definition of failure
Just like the Germany and France before them found out. Never invade Russian lands. Russia shot themselves in the foot
"Russians in Ukraine,  is like a hypothetical movie : ""Mr. Bean goes to war"""
So bottom line PUTIN LOST THE WAR .
We would fuck up Russia lol
"“Welcome to hell”

The balls of steel on the mad lad that thought up of that"
Friedman said it nicely we always overestimate our enemies!
"Does anyone understand military strategy at all. Russia has methodicaly taken the south and east of the country,  the convoy is a decoy. While they solidify their positions then they will surround Kyiv and destroy it. They don't need to hurry or rush the Ukrainian defence forces do not have enoph firepower to stop them. The rest of the country can be taken easily its mostly farmland."
Putin is a butcher
is wendover a fed or something? Ukraine is literally sending 18 year olds with 3 days of training to war. But yeah they're winning for sure
The Russian soldiers are hungry and deceived by their Commanders that they are just going to have military exercises not knowing they will be going to war so many will deflect. Also mostly are young people without real experience in warfare.
"I see Russia still as the world's bulwark against fascism.   I support Pres Putin in his military operation to end the aggression of the US and NATO that began, not in 2014 but in 1989 when James Baker lied to Gorbachev about the containment of NATO west of the Oder-Neiss line.   That lie was compounded by France and Germany.   In 1998,  Poland and Czechoslovakia were made NATO members.    Later, a succession of countries on Russia's European border were added to NATO.  These constitute a threat to Russia, and a threat is aggression.   The aggression started with the US lie.   Russia is protecting itself now that it is strong enough to do that.  The US has always been soft on fascism,  Italian, Spanish, and German.  Only Russia has fought fascism continuously and defeated it.   I support Pres Putin."
"Very awesome video and great contents in your Channel ! thanks for sharing , a fellow creator ! subbed ! !!!!"
They aren’t sanctions. They’re special economic operations.
"It appears you unintentionally acknowledged that sanctions are a form of warfare, economic warfare."
@Galova Russia will see. This invasion has shown the rest of the world that they need to free themselves from any Russian dependency. It won't take long for Russia to collapse while all the other countries continue on with a brief inconvenience. Russia depends heavily on imports/parts/technology for all of it's vital industries. Unfortunate what Russia's dictator did to his own people.
"@Galova I'm not sure gas prices shooting up for a while is the big ""lol owned"" for Russia you seem to think it is.  Those countries that now see Russia as an unreliable risk will work to decouple themselves from a reliance on Russia's resources - meaning Russia may well see a permanent decline in interest in their resources even if they one day are no longer considered international pariahs (which isn't going to happen for years).

Meanwhile Russia's economy has been decimated, they've had billions in foreign currency seized (and can't obtain more), their own currency is worth less than toilet paper, foreign businesses have abandoned their interests there and won't want to take the risk again for a long time, and they can't get access to imports they rely on.  Oh, and their army has been shown to the world to be a disorganized mess that completely underperformed even what Western analysts were expecting going in, and has sustained heavy losses in both people and materiel that will take years to recover from.

So unless becoming a bigger North Korea-style hermit kingdom was the master plan, this has been an unmitigated disaster for Russia.  But hey, gas costs more in Topeka Kansas right now - big win.   I'm sure the Russian citizens gathering in bread lines in the coming years will think it was worth it."
"@Oleg Naumov Relieve themselves of their insane leader that's the cause of it, or leave."
"@FollowTheSpirit We're making fun of Adolfimir Putler, Ok?"
"The fact that Russia is having so much trouble supplying troops when they're in battle next door. Says a lot.   With out nukes, Russias weakness has been shown to the world. They aren't as strong as we been lead to believe."
“Failed” lmao???
"@Acting DeMickey Objective was to make Ukraine neutral and demilitarised, meaning they targeting military facilities and equipment to ensure it's not going to be used. So far I think they were able to achieve that by capturing main airfields in Ukraine"
"@Acting DeMickey  Russia sent about 5% of its entire military capacity for an operation, if it would want to annihilate Ukraine it would have done so in first 3 days"
GOOD
IDITJI NA HRUI  JUPT
They are alot but but a very sad bunch... and by the looks of it they should be very happy they are not fighting NATO..
"SEEMS LIKE RUSSIANS ARE PLAYING IT DUMB... As if they wanted their machinery run out of gas and abandoned and then used against them in the end or just destroyed. it just makes no sense! No way Russians can be that immature at war its logistics as this has shown, but then again, one of the most corrupted superpowers known to men. May be the planning was flawless, but the execution and its funding was corrupted by the thieving, lazy and cowardly chiefs like Putin himself. Now young 18-21yo teenagers are stranded out in the m iddle of nowhere in a land where we are all brothers, turned against each other by damned government."
Wendover is now a propaganda tool.
So what’s the point of NATO if Russia can’t fight logistically a few kilometers outside its own border?
"One of the best analysis of this tragedy, unsurprisingly by this channel. Logistics is key in war. Keep up the great work."
"YT is fine as long as you praise the Democrats and globalists. After watching this, you're good."

Seethe
"The Ukrainians are literally using a varried version of the Russian/slavic defense strategy of slash and burn. Make the terrain impossible to navigate and destroy and resources the enemy can use. The Russian's burned the fields on the way to Moscow to make resupplying as difficult as possible if they were ever about to lose ground and had to fall back. 

The Ukrainians destroyed their own infrastructure to make going forward even harder and backed by an aggressive civilian population has made the Russian fight a living hell."
I always thought a conflict between Russia and USA would be very scary... Now I believe USA would wipe the floor with Russia lol...
They didn't fail lmao
All the tanks that have run out of fuel and been abandoned says otherwise.
You get russian tactics wrong
Because they apparently have no tactics.
Idk if Russia has any cargo planes like the c 17 but if they do why not drop 5000 gallon totes of fuel and food along side the convoy surround the convoy with drones and attack helicopters. That seems logical to me but I’m not expert at war
"lol, Putin. you noob."
"Anyone familiar with the Japanese book/TV/movie series ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes""? This bears a striking similarity to the Alliance of Free Worlds failed ""liberation"" of the Galactic Empire in the first book. The logistics officer tries to explain to the civilian leadership that the supply lines would be next to impossible to maintain, and he's right. The Empire cuts off their supply line, and without supplies, they start begging for food and water from the people they were told they'd be ""saving"". In reality, the citizens of the Empire just wanted to live their life and not starve, and their ""benefactors"" were taking their food. Needless to say, the invasion was a disaster."
@Joaquin Misa You are a good man
I am a fan of Yang Wengli!
"""Failed logistics"" Even though they occupy 70% of the country now and have the capital surrounded while the President has fled the country. Your pinned comment is right but the only disinformation being spread is from this channel"

"Lmao
Next episode tell me about how the ghost of kiev took down 30 jets lol
Edit: just wanna add that y'all larping military analysts barely a week and a half into a war is comical"
Excellent content again. Many thanks.
Sounds like a bit pro American video
"In this day age, it doesnt matter how you move tanks,  they will be seen. the first third of the video is pointless fluff. Its not 1941 when it was possible to hide large forces in a forest and surveilence could only be conducted in daylight, by planes, periodically. At 10,02 the video states that Russian troops relied only on paper maps.....thats a a total lie, Russia does have its own gps system. Very poor research.  Nice try, but this is amateur hour. You can find the russian gps system described at Wikipedia its called GLONASS.  seriously garbage video, try better next time Bozo."
"Excellent commentary and you knocked it out of the park. I have studied Soviet/Russian Military forces for years and honestly thought that if they didnt take their objectives within the first few days, they were going to get bogged down. Never did I think they were going to completly screw the pooch they way they have this operation. This war is shaping up to be just like Chechnya, hell it even used the same playbook (At least for the first chechan war 94-96)...and they got pretty much the same results (But worse). However, the Russians if they can recover from this huge setback, may come back with a much more competent and devestating attack, as much like Chechnya, they did recover and readjust to eventually win (If you call horrendous attacks againstr civilians and infrastructure ""Winning"")....I am thinking though that with the massive Vehicle losses and the extremly low morale and problems back in Russia, I really think the Ukranians might just pull off a victory. I am hoping so....The worry I have is that Putin in desperation might try to use Chemicals or just sheer firepower against civilians to grind the Ukranians down and win through slow genocide around the major cities. If someone were to put Putin ""To Sleep"", that would solve a lot of problems."
"00:20 "" I decided""  - very telling - not we , Russia .. just I ...  what kind  crazy want to kill millions ?"
Excellent stuff.
"unsubbed, bias garbage"
Great video
china better not try something cause their failture will be million times harder they have more people than food and non of them know how to fight in a war lol
"The Americans castigated British Monty for moving slow across north Europe, but he knew he couldn't move faster than the supplies could move forward, as in North Africa."
Maybe Russia just want to wreck the joint?

Don’t fight a winter war in Russia hitler found that out.

I will say to you an edited version of what the men on Snake Island said

Remember Trump said Putin was a genius and had nothing nice to say about the US and Western countries.
the biggest mistake was treating ukraine like it's a 3rd world country without a military or tactics.

"Watching those Russian rocket artillery firing off a stream of death really makes me feel for the Ukranian people.  Modern weaponry is truly terrifying, and it's infuriating to watch this scenario unfold knowing there's nothing we can do to help without risking a nuclear war."
"As others mentioned, it's stock footage of Russian rocket artillery (since the Russians aren't inviting journalists to their rear lines) but these weapons are hardly modern.  This gear is terrifying but more in a sheer brute force manner than a high tech one.  That rocket artillery is just a modernized version of a WW2 Soviet staple, the Katyusha rocket launchers (aka. Stalin's Organ).  There are gobs of WW2 era black and white footage of the old school versions of these things launching a screaming hail of high explosives towards German lines.  

They're quite intimidating sounding but they kind of just bombard an area.  They're also slow to load and expensive to use because the real expense is in the ammo, not the launchers (which are basically cheap vehicles and some launch tubes).  Great for a massive salvo to stun an enemy force but a terrible choice for a prolonged campaign unless you have WW2 levels of ammo production going.  At the rate the Russians are using them, they're going to go through their stockpiles relatively quickly.  

Normal artillery does far better precision work (and more cost-efficiently) with decent forward observers because it's aimed more precisely and the ammo's relatively cheap.  Of course, if you open up a battery of rocket artillery at a city... yeah, it's going to cause horrific damage.  However, once the Russians get enough regular artillery aimed at a city... it's really not any more pleasant and those guns can sustain fire in a way the rocket artillery simply cannot.

The West toyed with this sort of rocket artillery but ended up preferring guided missiles and regular artillery.  The American MLRS is the same general concept only a late 20th century vintage version."
"@BigBoy69 
It doesn't matter that this specific footage wasn't from the war, because there are plenty of videos showing ACTUAL footage which are exactly the same, both the firing and the landing of said rockets. Typical Orc."
"That was not actual footage of Russians useing them rn against ukraine. It was a display footage to show/present how these rocketlaunchers actually work and are used. Just read the source he provided with the video. At any point there is a source shown on the right or left bottom corner.

Also, Russions do not record their own attack with a civil drone and upload it on the net 😅"

"Looting isn't evidence of bad logistics. It's just what happens in war. Soldiers loot valuables. Americans did it in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Europe during WW2. Doesn't mean they had bad logistics. There's also questions about the accuracy of looting reports since a lot of what we ""know"" about the war is wrong due either to general confusion or propaganda campaigns. Ukraine is, after all, explicitly seeking a foreign military intervention and is doing its best to start off WW3. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of what we're hearing is just made up."
"Hard to troll the now obvious having said that there must be a reason for not using rail inside Ukraine proper for the movement of their entire ""special operation"" as opposed to what Nazi 3rd Reich Germany did for the entirety of *THEIR* ""World War 2"" which did include being greeted as Liberators in Ukraine on or about the Fall of 1941."
Bravo!  Great video.  I am signing up.  $14 is in the budget
"So your basically saying the Russian/Soviet military forces is accurately portrayed in the command and conquer series. Very powerful, heavy hitting forces yet they are inflexible and lacking in mobility and in some cases are built to be an intrenched/turtling force. 😂"
The failed logistics here are only of NATO and the US spreading violence and provoking wars
Top military thinks it intentional. Russia has only used 2% of its military force.
"@Lykos Lt well first of there is 2.8 million troops in Russia with there national guard. They have 250,000 ish on the boarders. Only sent is between 20-30,000 into Ukraine. So with the math that less then 2%. Pentagon even confirmed it. Putin hasn’t even started."
"Tell me how do you calculate 2%? Russia has around a million troops and sends to Ukraine around 200k, how's that 2% and not 20%? And do you really think that Russia will send over all of their active troops to Ukraine? With the logistical issues they'll be all dead."
"And if a YouTuber can put this all together, imagine what the intelligence community is making of it!"
Take that fucker out!! Someone in his party or over in Russian needs to take him out and have the courage to do so. I know there are other parties that would represent Russia the way it needs to be.

"They keep saying it’s failed, it’s lost, etc but they surrounded nearly every major city with minimal civilian casualties, I call for people to listen to both sides of the event, cause so far, you all fell for propaganda"
Russia is known very well for their truth.
"Just FYI Your rehashed State Department fantasy propaganda is not going to change the facts on the ground. Russia is not having any logistical issues in Ukraine. It just has a different strategy to the west when it decides to attack a country

The US bombs countries into oblivion before putting a single boot on the ground scared of domestic reaction to soldiers dying. Civilian casualties are not an issue because no one is there to report on them and they are considered the price of ""freedom"".

Russia sees Ukraine as a brother country. They keep aerial boming to a minimum and focus on ground invasion. They are willing to commit to more casualties in their army so as to minimize Ukrainian civilian casualties.

But the war itself is a walkover. Russia broke the back of Nazi Germany. Ukraine isnt much of a challenge."

Great battle history this will be!
In the end part of it is the Russian Air Force. Russia lacks air superiority and almost every hour you see a news report showing Russian Mi-24 Hinds getting slaughtered by shoulder mounted missiles (stingers) That’s what America did in Iraq they completely established air superiority and on the ground Iraq tanks didn’t Even stand a chance. American M1 Abrams slaughtered the T72 with superior night vision technology. All the while American F/A 18 and A10 (gotta mention the gun) were pounding Iraq positions and the USN was pounding with TomaHawk cruise missiles. Technology that Russia seems to lack. Instead Russia just tries to tank rush the living hell out of countries. A tactic that is becoming less and less effective. Also that waste of resources 7 mile long convoy in Kyiv is exposing logistical and economical failures in Russia. Often the lead vehicle well run out of fuel due to supply shortages and the convoy is often hit by Ukrainian drones. Ukraine is exposing how untrained the Russian military is and how Russia lacks thinking in the invasion. For example of the lack of experience many times soldiers in Russian convoys will jump on top of ATV’S and sit on them where a pushes can easily slaughter them all before they even know what happened.
"Sam, why have you ignored the Ukrainian side of the provocations since 2014?
On the same note, why didn't you mention the US invasion of Iraq to provide some logistical benchmark?
Or even made videos on NATO's logistical shortcomings, if any?

I used to admire your intellectual honesty.
It is disrespectful to make use of so much suffering for political propaganda."
A very biased analysis of what led to war. No mention of the people who were burned alive apposing the Maiden revolution or the horrendous 7 year siege of the Donbass region by the Ukrainian army.

its funny you say all this because according to putin its going as planned,according to other news they desperatly wanted to talk to putin about a peacefull deal becausw urkraine was run over pretty bad."
"Steinerinsky's counterattack will commence any day now, I have reliable sources that The Ghost of Kyiv™ will accompany him. Russia is sure to lose, I predict Ukrainian troops in Moscow in just two weeks."
kek.
Paper maps!! wow lol! and well played Ukraine removing and blacking out street signs
"They seem to be gaining day by day. Not sure how is that a failure?! Very strange content to say the least. And the comments are fake  apparently...? sooo, is this worthless then?"
putin is a brave man killing women and children i hope he pays a big price for it
I just hope Russia doesn't go Grozny mode now that they can't get into Kyiv
"""Failed Logistics"" as Putin and the Russian military takes over the entire country! I pray for the good people of both Russia and Ukraine."
Everyone says that Russia will lose but in reality their going to win
Were none (world)  aware of all this happening??
"Russia is not failing? They can conquer Ukraine in 1 day if need be, but they take time to not make civilian casualities. Western media is so cucked."
"They have not failed. As per their doctrine, Gulag equivalents criminal expendables are used as vanguard to make the adversary expose his game play and expend ammunition. The Russians expected NATO interference and have Plans for that. That is why they are using vintage expendable aircraft and dumb bombs in protracted time plans with expendable front line conventional weapons. It is not as simple as it seems. Russians have never let civilians escape this easily especially in a declared war."
It took 35 days to defeat Sadam Hussains bathist Iraqi government. The war has been going barely two weeks. It seems to me that it is far too soon to point out any failure. The Russians are still advancing.
Look out for Russian bots and trolls!
'Look out for the opposition. They're not really human.'

They haven't failed. You just don't understand military logistics or Russian doctrine.
Oh it's rare breed of tactics. Leaving tanks and their equipment is some sort of a new strategy.
"This is poor understanding of what is going on. 
1. Lol they didn’t mention that NATO helps Ukrainian army with tracking airplanes and sending data to their command centers ( Odessa, Kharkov ect) which are segregated instead of central command. In Mariupol, DNR found laptops with NATO info in real time on Russian Airforce.
2.Russian army moving according to strategic plan. Bypassing major cities which are not considered as crucial ect they will be taken after some time. After 4 days of war they have changed strategy since main goal was avoiding civilian casualties, this strategy was found very unsuccessful ( 480 russkies killed due to ambushes and street fighting) and was changed on 5th day.
3. Main goal is to destroy Eastern Ukrainian army in Donbass region because it’s a strongest army.
While cutting  off Odessa and then slicing central parts like a cake. And finally take Kiev and finish with Kharkov, Chernigov ect…
ect 
4. The reason they took Kherson was a build up platform for west-north-east strike and use it as a supply.

this is sad that western regular public has no real understanding on how this war is happening. Instead they hear about Kiev ghost aircraft who supposedly shot down 50 Russian planes ( its almost entire air fleet from Belarus strike force) and killed 10k Russians while destroying 7k of tanks and armor. These are mathematically impossible stats because if you smoke 7k of armor then technically, men causality would be roughly in 30k, unless these tanks had no people inside and were driving itself."
"Russia is loosing not only because it is weak in logistics, but also because Ukraine armed forces and civilians are  this brave and strong"

Excellent video
"The LAST invader of Ukraine had logistical failures, too!
I sense a pattern.."
war isn't over yet.  there are still over 100k Russian soldiers in Ukraine. lest hold off celebrating until most of them are gone.
The news of this invasion has been so depressing. I could feel my spirits lift a bit as I watched this. Thank you.
"Ya I'm sure your right....
Just look at the losses they took in Syria. So disorganized.  
And ever since that handsome and brave zelensky shoot down the admiral coleslaw with that home made Molotov cocktail the russians have been completely destroyed morally."
"@Gabriel Lemus sorry to divert. I was only thinking out loud. Lol but your right. 
I think Kiev has Putin right where they want him. Nothing days upper hand like having your city so well protected by a ring of battle  seasoned soldiers. Oh wait isn't it Russian soldiers surrounding Kiev? I could be wrong though after all you seem to know your military strategy"
"@seeker so quickly you divert the subject? LOL, please, I'm not going to eat you, the worst thing is that putin accepts the negotiations LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL"
"@Gabriel Lemus only a desperate nation holds peace talks. I'm learning so much from you.

"Hey Wendover, I love your content, but unfortunately you failed to do enough research into the conflict of 2014-2021 as evidenced by the fact you talked about ""rebels"" and ""separatists"", as if they were independent entities supported by Russia, rather than an occupying force directly subordinate to the Russian military and Russian intelligence. It would also be great if you made a video on that conflict (unless you already have one) and explore it with consideration of statements by Igor Girkin, a Russian intelligence officer who created the ""separatist"" republics, and with the hindsight of the current conflict.

Edit: That being said the main topic of the video, russian military logistics, is very well researched (as all the main topics of your videos are), so maybe I'm being too critical in expecting perfection from research on the background topics to the video."
"Commenting on the record rise in gas prices in Europe, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council Dmitry Medvedev reminded Western officials of their decision to freeze Nord Stream 2. “I can only congratulate the far-sighted European colleagues who reliably defended themselves against the insidious Russians and the Nord Stream 2 project,” he said."
I hope the Russians get stuck knee deep in the mud and the Ukrainians keep the pressure on and down every enemy aircraft overhead.
Russia should have stuck to attacking unarmed women and children instead of the Ukraine defensive force! Ukraine will be the ones that can demand an unconditional surrender of Russia.
Long live Ukraine and its Heroes!!!

Ukraine is carring a Tik Tok War.
"God I heard about those Russian soldiers. Imagine you were told you go to a training site and before you know it, you’re in a deadly war. Couldn’t even say bye to family and friends. And you’re grandma might live in the town you’re attacking. Yeah I would quit asap. Those generals must have been out of touch."
Why are trucks like the bane of Russia's existence this is just like World War 2 when America had to supply half of their trucks
failure to conquer Afghanistan was not really mainly due to logistics man. i got to do with their mountain/terrains. simply wrong
Fantastic video. Very informative
"Today Russia encircled 2 Ukrainian major military groups near Slavyansk and Kramatorsk. This is end to Zelenski, he will agree to Putins conditions."
"tbf, russia's military history shows they just rush b their enemies anyways"
"This is how Finland held back Russian forces for months in the 2nd world war. Finns didn't even have proper anti-tank weapons. They didn't have any tanks or armored vehicles that would have been relevant. They ran up to the tanks with satchel charges, rammed logs into the tracks, and came up with the Molotov's cocktail. 

But the main reason why the USSR forces were held back for so long, was their logistics failing. The soldiers were hungry, demoralized, and freezing in the Finnish winter. Finnish guerilla fighters were striking their supply trucks, which often traveled unprotected. The soviet war machine was heavily reliant on roads, so Finns mined the roads and set up ambushes, while the Finnish forces mainly used skis and horses for logistics near the front lines."
@TheBrowniesOwn Russia has a habit of treating its soldiers like bullets in a gun.  Which works until you run out of bullets.
"@Revy They were on their own side.  Sometimes, at least temporarily, the enemy of your enemy is your friend."

"I’m astonished that a “professional”, modern army could be this ill equipped for war. How do you achieve such a high level of complacency that you don’t even provide your own soldiers with enough food for more than a few days?"
"russion army is weak in different aspects. As i mentioned somewhere above, the notion of ""strong and professional army"" is just a myth, they have good PR skills, but that's it. They needed that myth cause that is the only thing to push their interests on the world stage, their economy is very small compared to most western countries"

"The reason Russia is attacking the Ukraine is because of the wast amount of natural gas and oil that’s part of the Ukraine. At the moment Russia has captured enough of the Ukraine to be able to take over these resources. That’s why they now started with “peace negotiations”.
I know there are many other reasons out there, but that is just smoke and mirrors to justify this. If the Ukraine would get their hands on these resources they would be a direct competitor to Russia.

This video is incredibly insightful and gave me hope that Ukraine will survive this conflict. Long live Ukraine!
I certainly hope Putin loses Crimea over this.
Great work Sam
Is it then a fair analogy that western logistics is like market economy (supply and demand) where russian logistics is like central planning?
"those terms aren’t really applicable in a way that actually makes sense when you’re talking about their economic systems (which are the same, btw. russia is super capitalist and putin is equally anti socialist/communist as a lot of americans are)

it’s like apples and oranges, i guess"
"British Field Marshal Archibald Wavell: 

“It takes little skill or imagination to see where you would like your army to be, and when; it takes much knowledge and hard work to know where you can place your forces and whether you can maintain them there. A real knowledge of supply and movement factors must be the basis of every leader’s plan; only then can he know how and when to take risks with those factors; and battles and wars are won only by taking risks.”"
"@Steve Lacy Regardless of what you think of Trump, the fact that he managed to become president of the USA means that he is a brilliant politician, therefore your analogy is crap."
"@Steve Lacy If you can get elected, you are a competent politician. You should maintain a healthy respect for your enemies if you want a hope to defeat them. He wins because other people refuse to engage with him, he is never challenged."
"Read this as Alfred in ""Pennyworth""."
"@EnglishroG Wavell is one of the most unfortunate figures in military history, his career was so cursed - he was almost certain to achieve total victory in Africa and the ME when Churchill demanded intervention in Greece. Churchill hated him because he made him look foolish in the eyes of history by being right and wise. 

He wasn't the only commander to get served a hopeless shit sandwich and be scapegoated for it - but it's worth remembering and praising him for not totally shitting the bed, and indeed for laying the foundations of final victory. 

Infrastructure isn't as sexy as posing dramatically in an armoured car, dashing around getting people killed for a few grains of sand (Rommel...), but that's the stuff that wins wars and why historians look kindly upon Wavell in hindsight."
"@Sami Henell He suffered from being disliked by Churchill. His choice of subordinate commanders was also mixed. Gott and O'Connor were good, Irwin was bad and Bill Slim was probably the best British senior commander of the war."
I am not pro-russia but in my opinion putin has not failed and is not failing. He is toying with ukraine but they are not surrendering. Not surrendering is the only thing i feel he has been wrong about. I am sure he thought they would surrender by now. He could have blasted ukraine to smitherines in about an hour if he really wanted to. People don't understand what his military has and how large it is. He is playing and hoping for them to surrender. He will eventually take over all of ukraine and i give it about another 2 weeks but he is going at the pace he feels he can break them. This is all obviously my opinion but this is how it seems to me.
"Reports everywhere are coming in.  Ukraine is winning, and winning BIG!  Russian military is being DECIMATED!  They are retreating and many have deserted.  There's even talk now of invading Russia to take out evil Putin.  UNBELIEVABLE!"

"If there’s one thing the Americans excel at is logistics, they would never have made these mistakes."
"Hot take: What if the invasion is so far not a total success, but no even this catastrophic failure the media makes it out to be? Russians are still inside UK and not too far from the capital. I remember reading these contradictory articles about the ""failure"" stating ""they've failed to take any major cities at all"" yet stating near the end of the same articles ""they've taken X city in the north"". Then there is the urban myth of ""the Ghost of Kiev"". Truth if usually the first casualty of war. This invasion is also a little over a week old. The invasion of Iraq lasted a little over a month.

I think these pundits are calling the results much too early as a cheap means to boost morale."
"Yeah I feel the same. Calling it a failure makes it seem like it's already over. 

Also, abbreviating Ukraine as UK is a bit confusing 😅"
"Excellent video, so well researched! As a Ukrainian, I'd like to add one more important factor contributing to their nearing defeat. We Ukrainians have been watching this for years. It's their self-confidence, their big ego, and belief that they are better, stronger, more powerful than literally anyone else. For example, if they lose at some kind of international competition, be it Eurovision, World Cup or so, they still consider themselves the best. It's others who weren't able to see their great talent or just were too jealous. They would never admit their mistakes, therefore they won't work at them and won't correct them. Russians believe that they are superior to every other nation in the world, and as we see that doesn't play well for them."

@gwolf and on what facts do you base your claims?
Putin forgot to hire the Winter.
That sounds like ww II at some point.
US and UK are definetely better at logistics to make war far from its borders all over the world 🌍
Russia is racing against time. The more this war continues the more will be at a disadvantage. Russian people are about to suffer from poverty and a big economic crisis will emerge in the country forcing russians to overthrow Putin if he doesn't succeed in the next month.
"That's my prediction for a possible outcome too. Also, the more time it takes, the more those NATO supplies, MANPADS and jets pour into Ukraine making this invasion drag even longer."

True.
I am Canadian, though but I disagree with ""failed logistics"". Soviet/ Russian military doctrine is NOT the same as that of the West.  I won't say much more here but I have studied this.   Thinking they are inept or failing is precisely part of the doctrine.  Also...they don't require air domination like the west does...again due to their way of war"
You’re going to have to elaborate more on what you mean. Just saying he’s wrong doesn’t prove anything
"Russian tanks have no GPS, and they are supposed to be our closest military rival???? Give me a break."
"Even if Russia takes full control of ukraine, what will they gain from this, their relations with the west have been destroyed, many companies are leaving (visa and mastercard in particular come to mind), swift leaving is one of the biggest losses it throws russian baking right into the last century ,and their currency is worth less than robux, the only ones that seem to be willing to keep negociations is china, but can they keep the same demands of russia's imports as european countries? Ukraine has a bunch of interesting natural resources, but will they cover the costs of this war? This all seems so wierd to me, it feels like we are missing something, this looks like a massive mistake"
"It was a massive mistake. As was noted near the beginning of the video, analysts figured that this would go better for Russia than it has. Putin did not seem to anticipate the western response. Troops thought they would be welcomed. They all thought it would be another Crimea, where the west would furl their brow and then forget about it. That's not what's happening. I expect that after this is over, the west will re-connect SWIFT and all that, but at that point a shit load of damage has already been done."
"How has Russia's logistics failed???

Have you even seen the combat zone maps? or do you just believe the propaganda."
"excellent analysis, i have told many of my friends how much of a military failure the incursion has been."
Recent Russian poll have shown that at least 77 percent of Russians support president Putin and support the destruction of all NATO democracies in Europe. So basically Russians are modern day NAZIS. That's why sanctions against Russia should never be lifted until we see a change in their mentality.
You don't have a fucking clue what is going on. We are being hoaxed.

"I noticed how you chose to start your history with the invasion of Crimea, and not the coup de etat to unseat the elected government at Maidan Square. How convenient."
This video makes me think that the thing that makes this war difrent from other wars is the power of the internet information spreads fast civilians become spies sending information to the world sometimes not even knowing spreading information about everything
"I got the weirdest ad in this video, announcing nuclear war in Europe. No author mentioned."
175 000 isnt a lot of troops. Russia needs to increase them to at least 500 000. 1 million would be best.

"@Shadesmar Erik I'm a NZer, my grandfather volunteered to fight Nazis in 1939 - soon after he was fighting Germans in Greece, and ended the war in Trieste in 1945. He was just one man, from a tiny country that could only field one or two divisions, but you could never say he didn't dodge as much or more Nazi bullets than any Soviet soldier - everyone who fought for the right cause is worthy of respect, they all risked their lives and lost their friends and to belittle what they did is the honorless behavior of a coward and ingrate. 

American boys who stormed Omaha beach weren't irrelevant - it wasn't a video game for them where they died and respawned and boasted about their K/D ratio later. Real soldiers who went through all that would never speak that way; Soviet, British, American. Grow up, armchair warrior."
"@Onylra yea... a third of the Axis from those who survived the Eastern Front... which is basically a third of nothing. And this reflected in the casualties of the war. Similar with Japan... Japan was at this time bound and grinded down in a land war with the country with the highest population on earth determined to a guerilla war. It was basically out of oil and all the US had to do was flame bombing their cities and dropping the nuke. And it needed the nuke only for fears of the Soviet invading Japan first before them.

U can talk all u want.. it doesnt change the fact that the US came late and didnt do much in this war."
"@Shadesmar Erik I'm just saying: Stalin and Hitler were mates, and where was the USSR when France fell and Britain was under attack? Too busy massacring helpless Poles and Fins, I guess - then when Hitler turned on them they botched it all so badly and had to go begging to the West for things like boots and Spam because they were so shit at war Germany stole all their cows.

Last I checked, you don't win wars by dying to the enemy. You'll find that the Allies faced about a third of the Axis in Europe, while fighting Japan - and beat them all. I'd call that pretty relevant, but ok."

"This war, are a result of Ukraine.. But now the focus has shifted to Russia..  If people opened their eyes, they would've seen the same!"
"Thing is: if this drags on for too long, Russia will escalate and start using longer range missiles and dropping bigger bombs to beat Ukraine into submission. And if all else fails, I firmly believe Putin will be crazy enough to nuke a city or two."
I'm desperate for Putin to fail so hard that this finishes him. I'm appalled that we are not doing more to provide meaningful support to the people of Ukraine.
"It is obvious Russians underestimated the Ukrainian army. However, it is too early to say Russians will fail. There are so many war tactics, Russians oddly don't use, they are choosing the hard way."
omg this makes me barf how ridiculous it is...
"As a Ukrainian, I applaud you for such an analysis! Thank you, Sam. It was really insightful to take a look at the war from another angle.
I would like to add a few more things to the list:
1. Soldiers morale is low.
Russians are fighting Ukrainians, their so-called brethren. That leads to Russians refusing to fight / surrendering / deserting. 
They also know about the reality of war here which adds to them being demoralized 
2. Commander’s lack of competence and professionalism. 
Many captives say that they weren’t even properly instructed and had no idea where they were going. What is shocking is that Russians are leaving their fallen comrades and even cremating them so that no one knows about their casualties here. (~10 thousands dead and 30-35 thousands injured) 
3. Ukrainians
People of Ukraine got together in one big fist. The mostly Russian-speaking cities are incinerating Russians while the western parts of the country supply the soldiers and welcome refugees. Every person in the country is somehow helping out: volunteering, ddosing, cooking for the army, getting Molotovs ready.
4. Ukrainian army.
It is bizarre, that western media talks about our forces as “resistance” hinting that it is militia only that’s fighting. This is not the case at all. Ukrainian army is pretty big and, as it turned out, well trained. Add civilians and militia and you have full-scale war machine.

Russians have totally messed up the ground phase of their operation. They have tried entering a few major cities, as well as capital Kyiv, but have completely failed. The only strength they have know is air-strikes. If we had more air-defense systems, we would have already won the war."
"@Epic Lego And I am afraid that the slowness of the advance might not be enough, specially now that they've started moving and attacking roads west of the capital and even started bombing the western cities of Ukraine now."
@Me King Tiger theyre trying to do that for weeks
@V H Good. But beware! Russian columns have been seen moving towards the east of Kiev/Kyiv. They are trying to close the encirclement and siege the whole place!
"@V H yep MIGs from Poland (who can fly F16s). Hold strong mate, good luck. The free world is with Ukraine!"
"@Me King Tiger we have received a lot of Stingers and Javelins. As well as assault rifles, submachine guns and ammo.

It seams you only get informed from bbc cnn and rest globalist tv stations. Maybe they dont want to destroy everything and they are careful about people that they live there. They can use airplanes and long distance balistics and destroy whole country. Think out of the box dont get your mind washed from tv.
@Me King Tiger Yeah
The problem is that the longer it takes the more NATO supplies and weapons pour into Ukraine...
Russia picked quite the day to invade. 24th of February is the birthday of my country of Estonia so in the middle of our celebrations were the news of war
"Well, this was the most un researched thing youve ever produced.
I will look for your detailed account of the 14,000 civillians the ukrainians have killed in the 8 years prior."
You're basing your whole video on information available from ukrainian side and western media sources which are both pure propaganda.
"@Lykos Lt I'd say they don't really care about information war, they went into battle knowing they already lost that part. Those who want to know the truth will find the way to learn it. After all, they're not in the business of fighting for ""hearts and minds"".
As for losses, of course they're taking losses, but not nearly at the level Ukrainians are reporting. Just the fact you never get to hear about UKR army losses is enough to realize its not a credible source of information"
"Well, to be fair, there is absolutely no info or sources coming from the Russian side whatsoever. I wonder why..."
please stop war
"Well done, Sam.   Sincerely, a real human person and not a bot."
"The war hasn't even gone on for two weeks. People are already jumping to conclusions about how it turned out and how it failed while it's still on-going. What on earth? We only saw the opening moves. This could go on for months or years, it could even escalate beyond Ukraine's borders. So this whole way of talking about the war is really naive."
@GAME ADDICT Iraq was on the other side of the planet to NATO. Russia is literally bordering Ukraine. No excuse.
@Kuro Usagi it took nato 3 weeks to beat Iraq
Imagine trying to be an intellectual about longterm infrastructural failures named Dingus Doofus lmao
The opening move of a war is always the most important one. Because 1 distaster is al it takes to end in failure.... If the Ukrain soldiers and the Western volenteers keep this shit show from russia going ukrain will be within russian borders this spring.
"Hey Sam. Long time viewer, didn't know you'd make a video about our war. I'm in Kyiv, thank you for this video, makes my hopes go up.

And I can add something to the things you said about fuel and food - most PoW's who were captured in the last week said that they were only given food rations for three days. So after that they started starving and either had to surrender or go maroudering."
"@Kuro Usagi I'm not interested in the narrative of the Russian government, nor do I have any intention to quote them as credible sources. But being pro-anything in the conflict makes you biased, and not a credible source of info."
"@Pale Dolphin just out of curiosity, if a source of information posts evidence contrary to the narrative of the Russian government, do you consider that source to be “pro-Ukrainian”?"
"@Kuro Usagi well, I know this alias by their Twtitter—and it's incredibly pro-Ukrainian, which makes me question their objectivity."
@Pale Dolphin tweets? It’s a site. It’s a site with photographic confirmation of equipment losses for both sides.
"@Kuro Usagi yeah, I saw some of his tweets, and I can't by any means call him unbiased, he's clearly pro-Ukrainian."
"What a load of bull.
To begin with, Russia has total air superiority, only anti aircraft systems that are still operational in Ukrainian hands are hand held systems which are impossible to eradicate and few mobile launchers that are hidden in between civilian buildings."
"Big mistake to write off the Ruskies at this stage. In 1939 the Red Army invaded Finland, it was a shambles, the Fins destroyed massive amounts of equipment and men. Result, Stalin had a few commanders purged, put the fear of God in the replacements and the jugernaut carried the task to completion. I would guess similiar actions are being carried out by the Russ leadership as we sit here watching this, the survival of the regime depends on it."
"What an incredible report. I've been searching for something like this for 2 weeks. None of the mainstream media is providing anything like this, so kudos man. Great work!"
@f also not true... she just didn't look very far.
"What media are you following? Most media sites (minus Fox) have articles on the logistical issues.

Obviously nothing this in depth though"
"Dos please look up Jimmy Dore and you will get the WHY, rather than the WHAT"
"That's what the need for mainstream appeal does to what we now call ""content-creation"". People who are barely holding on, everyday going to job, coming home and sleeping. No care to look further into anything. Just having something to think ""that's kind of a big thing"" for some moments. 42.
Edit: also dis comment has 69 likes, so, the mandatory."
"During World War II, the USSR heavily relied on Lend-Lease trucks and other logistical infrastructure (from the USA mostly) to drive its huge war machine from Moscow to Berlin.  It appears that Russia did not learn the lesson that trucks played a bigger role in their victory than tanks did."
Bad Generals talk about tactics.  Good Generals talk about logistics.
"I USED to have a lot of respect for Vlad Putin because of his hardline no shit approach to dealing with the problem of islamic terrorists, however this action against Ukraine is nothing short of an insane war crime and an attack on the 'rules' that the world works by. I'm sure that he doesn't care about my opinion, but I've lost all respect for this repulsive dictator who is obviously still living in the Soviet era. Well done to the Ukrainian resistance for standing up and fighting back."
"Awesome video ! Very informative.

Thanks a lot for you job."
Powerful ending man.  Nice job
"This means 50% is already killed... really sad this war. Full of lies,  not announced, killing already 50k civilans. Did we already forget WW2, are we now continuing to kill the Jewish president in Ukraine? Did we not agree that Russia would NEVER attach Ukraine in exchange for the war heads?"
No logistics? No gas? No bitches?
Don’t give me hope
This is the only thing that Russian's should be allowed to see on their Netflix account.
This video is just proper gander and time will tell.
On full swing. Predictable masses
Interesting analysis of role of logistics strategies.
"And what makes you think that you are the ""representative of actual opinion"" ?"

"Russian people! wtf are you guys doing? Shut down your psychopathic ape and install a more modern leader...

"нет пощады слабым орудиям путинских олигархов, которых вы называете людьми, настоящие русы знают, что их используют только тогда, когда они перестанут быть орудиями, будет ли у России снова гордость"
Russia has the strongest economy on the planet. This same rubbish was spouted back when Russia tool Crimea back and Russia never looked back. Russia quietly started dumping American Federal Reserve Bonds back in 2018 and has been buying up gold in astronomical quantities. It is not Russia or China or the other Bric members who are in Trouble. It is the UK and the US who are crashing.

"No logistic issue...time was given Ukranian government to surrender...don't think that convoy is for attacking kieve ..but for controlling kieve after winning the war....
And Russians will win ...don't have any other doubt in your mind"
Really good explanation!
"I still can't believe that they neglected logistic so badly. At this point it's quite criminal for the ""2nd"" army in the world"
Brilliant insights into how Putin grossly miscalculated - and hopefully will pay with his life soon at the hands of the FSB/KGB
@kreek22 perhaps we will all be more fortunate this time around 🤩
Russia: We have to attack before they retaliate for the attack we already did
@Mr Fart Sniffer you don't get it.      They started it but are acting like everyone else did they don't want anyone involved in Ukraine so they invade. Becoming the biggest hypocrites inhe woworld

"What would you finally understand: Russia is not at war with Ukraine! Ukraine did not declare war on Russia, and Russia did not declare war on Ukraine. Russia is at war with the United States and US satellites on the territory of the former USSR. For 8 (eight) years, Ukraine has been destroying the civilian population of its own country with bombs in Donetsk and Lugansk, but you have not seen it! Have you heard Putin now? You have been warned all these 8 years!!! The Russian troops do not need a blitzkrieg, because it protects the civilian population of Ukraine, and the fascists hide the army in cities and hide behind the civilian population. It was the US that destroyed Afghanistan, Libya and Syria with carpet bombing (where have you all been?) Russia is launching a preemptive strike to prevent a nuclear apocalypse! The USA will start robbing Europe, get ready. Look at the prices! And this is just the beginning..."
"putin: it is going according to plan.
the plan: starve it's soldiers, let them run out of fuel and kill them on frontline."
Russia really made an ass of itself. It will be a paria state in the civilized world for quite some time i think. Russia is such a immature disappointment. Its a horrible disaster for all people involved.
This video is disinformation
Navajo Soldiers
This is war and Putin will pay the price: Мирные люди не приезжают на танках с автоматами в соседнюю страну. Убийцы делают.
The detail about Russia's rail network being used to ferry their military equipment explains why Ukraine disabled their own rail interconnection links with Belarus and Russia. Awesome!
"@Lance James Oh yeah, you definitely sound like the man that has all the answers and knows all the truths. It's EVERYONE ELSE that's wrong and is lied to, but definitely not you. No, you and you alone can see through the BS. Sure. Let's go with that, Mr. Battlefield Expert."
"@Lance James  Because a no-fly zone would give them a large advantage, genius. Why WOULDN'T they constantly ask for it?? You're trying and failing to establish any kind of a negative conclusion here.."
I wish you still used the voiceover from earlier videos. This voice makes you sound annoyed and dismissive..
Putin has mental disorder Russian is the victim in the first place.

What exactly is wrong according to you?
Lol it all happened so quickly…. After 4 months of warning ⚠️
"The Ukraine has Weapons of Mass Destruction stored in labs paid for by the USA.
'Russia claims Ukraine destroying evidence of US-funded bioweapons program
Russia’s Defense Ministry says Kiev ordered scientists to destroy samples of plague, anthrax, and other lethal pathogens
As Russian troops entered Ukraine, the government in Kiev ordered the “emergency destruction” of pathogens including plague and anthrax at US-funded laboratories near the Russian border, the Ministry of Defense in Moscow claimed on Sunday. Earlier rumors that the Russian military was targeting US-run biolabs were written off as conspiracy theories, but the ministry has promised to back up its claims with documents.
“We have received documentation from employees of Ukrainian biolaboratories on the emergency destruction on February 24 of especially dangerous pathogens of plague, anthrax, tularemia, cholera and other deadly diseases,” read a statement from the ministry.
The statement accused the “Kiev regime” of conducting an “emergency cleansing” to hide evidence of the supposed biological weapons program, which the ministry claimed was funded by the US, and involved the production of “biological weapons components” at least two laboratories in the cities of Poltava and Kharkov, both of which have seen intense fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in recent days.

The documents published by the ministry purportedly include an order from the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to destroy the pathogens, and lists of the germs in question.
RT can not independently verify the authenticity of these documents. Russia’s Defense Ministry said that they are currently being analyzed by radiation, chemical and biological protection specialists. 

“In the near future we will present the results of the analysis,” the ministry said, adding that it believes the documents will prove that Ukraine and the US were violating Article 1 of the UN Biological Weapons Convention. The US, Ukraine and Russia are among more than 180 parties to this treaty, and under Article 1 of the agreement, all parties agree “never under any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile, acquire, or retain” biological weapons.

As of the moment of this article’s publication, Washington has not commented on the ministry’s claims, and neither has Kiev.

In the initial days of Russia’s military offensive last month, claims circulated online that Russia was targeting western-funded biolabs with missile strikes. These allegations were never verified and were derided by western sources as conspiracy theories, although the Pentagon has publicly stated that it works with the Ukrainian government to “consolidate and secure pathogens and toxins of security concern in Ukrainian government facilities,” for “peaceful research and vaccine development,” according to the US embassy in'roops entered Ukraine, the government in Kiev ordered the “emergency destruction” of pathogens including plague and anthrax at US-funded laboratories near the Russian border, the Ministry of Defense in Moscow claimed on Sunday.

"It's rather revealing how it's only the Kremlin propaganda machine that is calling Ukraine government ""nazis"". Whereas the rest of the ENTIRE WORLD has NO objection to Ukraine's government and the Ukrainian people are prospering FAR BETTER than the Russian people are. I feel sorry for the Russian people, because they are held hostage in their own country, much like the dictatorship of North Korea. Russians are threatened with violence and jail for simply protesting against the war, and the Kremlin are calling Ukraine ""nazis""? It's always OBVIOUS when someone is blatantly lying when they accuse their opposition of doing exactly what they are doing themselves. It's pathetic."
What's up with the cake at 3:27?
Excellent.
"Amateurs study military strategy.  Professionals study military logistics.  Putin is a KGB agent not a great military thinker.  Like Hitler before him, he gambled on a short campaign with little actual fighting and does not have the logistics strength to maintain a remote army maneuvering in the field."
Kremlin AI bots are more obvious during these times I guess
"Even with Russia's logistics problems, how would Ukraine push the Russians back to its borders without NATO getting militarily involved?"
"NATO should set up ""Special Air Defence Operation"" over Ukraine."
"Russia failed to understand the power of the ""universal unifying theory of f**k that guy"""
"please change your channel name to ""Westover propaganda"", russia doing special military operations to avoid WW3(NUCLEAR MAYHEM), Once the war over, Kyiv will be renamed as PUTINGRAD♥️🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺"
@Abi Kudiarasu Russia
@the gentelmen  NATO
Who started the war again
Russia is in trouble when a full scale attack from 3 fronts didn't end with at least a capital and 2 big cities captured. It sucks to fight 40 millions people on their homeland while unable to shoot them on sight.
Anonymous doesn't exist anymore. The CIA tracked them down and flipped or jailed them all. They are government lapdogs now.
"Dude, it's clear you don't understand what anonymous is."
"It's literally only been a 10 days... To come to a conclusion that Russia failed due to logistics is really too early to say..
And how do you even know what their strategy and intent was??  May be they already achieved what they wanted?? Who knows, only the top brass"
"As Napoleon discovered, lying to your own soldiers can backfire. How willing are Russian conscripts going to be when they discover they’re being asked to wage a full scale war against their neighbours? Not a training exercise. Not a liberation. War. Perhaps this - along with lack of fuel and determined Ukrainian action - explains some of the abandoned Russian vehicles.."
Video starts at 8:46
How are you going to make a video about their failure before its even over. This type of media is just making Putin act that much crazier. Thanks for that
Yes let’s blame everyone else for Putin’s actions.. you’re a special one
Failure might be a result of Putin’s “yes” men and the leader of Russian military was not brought up through the ranks.

"Pruh-buh-gun-duhhhh
Both sides. All of it. Just like the C-pandemic, you're being screwed."
PUT DOWN PUTIN
How are you a super power?
"Boi why you start the video by introducing the war. If we clicked on a 20 minute analysis video about a specific part of the war, why would you assume the war needs introducing?"
One of your best videos. Appreciate how respectfully you approached this topic :)
"You seem to have overlooked one important fact.
It was reported today that the Russian military machine is driving on sub standard Chinese made tyres hence why so many vehicles are abandoned , the tyres have collapsed."
"Russia is currently the largest copy of North Korea, but with an even more stupid and greedy dictator.
I'm sorry for the Russian brothers, but we await your civil revolution, against Putin and his money-hungry oligarchs 🇷🇺
Take back your money, your freedom and your honored history against this pig! 🇷🇺"
"As for military operations, the enemy has now accumulated strength in 2-3 days and is advancing. They tried to get to Nikolaev, Krivoy Rog and Zaporozhye. And perhaps in 2-3 days we will hear reports of battles on the outskirts of Krivoy Rog, on the outskirts of Zaporozhye Nikolaev. There is no need to be afraid --- this is a war! Not a single state in the world could afford to be evenly strong (no economy could withstand) for 3 thousand km of the northern border and 2 thousand km of the eastern border. It is irreversible that they will go in, but where they will go in and whether they will be able to stay there --- this is a question of our fighting Cossack spirit and the actions of the territorial defense, the armed forces and civil resistance. And if some cities are occupied, this means that they will be de-occupied after how we will defeat the enemy north or east of Kherson. And the turn will reach Kherson. You just need to soberly experience what is happening. !The advance of Russian troops is on inertia, because the Russian generals are centrally driving Russian soldiers forward. But this is not for long ---- all of these, without exception, the battles on the outskirts of all cities so far in 9 days of the war ended in a crushing defeat of the Russian troops. It will end in the same way near Zaporozhye , also in Krivoy Rog. In the same way, it just ended near Nikolaev. And I think that they will die on this --- they will not have any further advancement of forces! That is, this is their last breakthrough --- it may be the last or penultimate one. 90% of the troops that they have accumulated at the borders are already involved. We have not seen the entry of large columns for a whole day --- only those troops that are already on our territory are operating. And we will bury them in the vast expanses of southern Ukraine, where, on the one hand, they can advance (where it is hard to catch), and on the other hand, when they are caught, they have nowhere to go, they have nowhere to get reinforcements. Calmness and only calmness. The Ukrainian command knows what it is doing. surrounded, captured atili, but there are no our troops and no one is helping --- this can only mean one thing that the armed forces are luring the Russians into another trap. There is no need to be afraid ---- during the war, the situation changes very often and suddenly, including suddenly for enemy. As an example, yesterday they bravely ran into Nikolaev all day. After they were quietly cornered and covered with artillery and Grads in one area. This will be the case with those who are advancing there, and with those who are advancing in other places .Arestovich A."
Give them hell brother.
so if the U.S. ever get into a conflict with russia we should just destroy their railroads nice :))
"Just wait on the main roads, a column will get stuck due to their own incompetence."
"""Even a fearful dog when cornered will bite."""
"Nah, a propaganda made by US and Nato..to make world against Russia.. Everyone knows that Ukraine is a victim from their conflicts"
@Rasmus Gustavsson Good. I want more people out there to read my comment.
Ukraine don't agree with you.
I don't want my credit card on websites. unfortunately no support for PayPal!
"Its not Keev, its Kyyev"
the reason you got that impression is because you get all your data from western media. if you can get a hold of information from Russia you will see a different picture. of course the news from Russia will be biased to them and the news from the west will be bias to west as well. but if you are getting info from both you have a better picture. Russian advance is actually fast and is in the limit of their tanks operational range.  they are not actually expecting a quick surrender by Kiev so expect a siege Kiev and other major cities and find victory on the negotiation table.
"This narrator is just pushing relentless propaganda! United States of America, the most logistical and advanced military in the world still took 2 weeks to get into downtown Baghdad."
Russian military takes 2 weeks to go to the toilet LMAO
Except they didn't lose so many planes / Tanks and soliders + their soldiers knew how to fight and weren't sent in with a morale lower than your IQ. LMAO usa got a real army compared to russia.
Good to know Ukraine has a smart war plan. There was no info on this and I was worried Russia was just cruising in. Sound like Russia is getting bodied.
"Another drawback to Russia is much of the equipment being fielded is soviet era tech which many military veterans in Ukraine will know how to use, and effectively. This means they can quickly train conscripted soldiers on use of captured equipment, something that most poor nations cannot do generally."
@dubda da booda fake
"Lol wut?

Most of their tanks are t90s which began production in 1992. The Abrams is older than that 😂"
Russian generals: Write that down! Write that down!
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦

Lol look at the map. They haven’t even slowed down. Not bombing civilians or infrastructure like we did in Iraq. There’s so much propaganda. WMD all over again.

You talk like this is over ....Russia hasn't failed yet.
1 wrong statement and you will be jailed for 15 year :P
Days into the invasion and we already have insightful videos like this
"Biden saying that there would be no US troops on the ground so early in the conflict was definitely an eye raiser, but it makes more sense taking this into account. Would have to be mobilized for the initial push or it doesn’t matter either way it goes."
not blowing up the bridge at kherson was a bad idea.
Excellent thanks.
"Ukraine to surrender, there will be time to regain sovereignty when Putin is condemned.

 People's lives come first!!!

 Are you blind??"
What utter rubbish. This is pure ‘ spitting the dummy out of the pram ‘ western hysteria.
"as we've learned over the last 20 years, it's easy to invade a country, not so easy to hold it..and those 30,000 former SOF forces heading in Armed will have a real effect.."
"In my opinion, the reason why russian warfare logistics fail is for the same reason that they have always failed. 
Their upper enlisted and office ranks are made up mostly of personell that were promoted, not on their ability, but their loyalty to the regime.  If you promote unqualified or incompetent people based on loyalty or favoritism, you end up with a very crappy command structure full of morons who only know how to get something done by screaming and threatening until someone with a brain does it for them.
Combine that with the fact that russia's army is 97% made up of conscripts.. aka people forced to serve in the military, who didnt join willingly, and who do not believe in the mission.. it compounds that problem even further because they dont want to be there, they will only do as LITTLE as possible to stay out of trouble, while doing nothing more. 

Its actually the reason why the USSR fell. It didnt fall because of western interventions or tricking the USSR government into competing in an arms/space race. It failed because of incompetent leadership, combined with the heavy lifters (the workers) doing such a piss poor job because they didnt WANT to do the job, that everything fell apart due to the fact that russian military and government is populated by mediocrity ruling over unwilling workers.

Those two elements combined, engineer failure of the structure."
Watching Russian convoys get blown up by drones has been extremely satisfying. I just wish we could hear the screams!
Just a little reminder for the Western Think Tankies: 78% of Eastern Ukrainians opposed Russian intervention while 89% throughout the total Ukrain opposed Russian intervention. Ukrainians do not 'want' to be part of Russia.
"But you missed one thing, the operation is not a fail. Its been 15 days only, and yet you are saying that there is some wrong info in the comments, well how about your video then ?"
@KAD on top of that Russia invaded Middle East as well and were there before everyone else.
Russia is pedofilia country

"I guess you forgot all the NATO and US exercises getting closet an closer since the beginning from 2021 until the deployment of US troops in Ukraine border, making Russia to move to the borders, because of all the harrasment"
At least Russians know which bathroom to use
Russia violated the Budapest Memorandum twice by invading Ukraine in 2014 and today. Russia should've kept  upheld their obligations since Ukraine did their part by giving up the Soviet nukes it inherited.
Bad call on their part. Russia wouldn't have been so uppity if they had nukes pointed at them.
"Putin's Vietnam, but in 10 days
Now they shoot civilians and rape women out of frustation 🤮
I am glad to have such courageous neighbors.

They’re only 12 days in. Nothing has failed lol
"@Rasmus Gustavsson also, do you even understand why he invaded? His reasons aren’t as nonexistent as western media has everybody believing. He’s not hitler, he’s not trying to start world war 3. This is a targeted attack. Once he’s done what he set out to do, it’ll be over. Everybody needs to mind their own business."
@Zen723 and they are losing them like candy. 11000 soldiers in 15 days dead they lose close to 1000 soldiers a day right now so yeah….that’s an army that’s bleeding lmao you know they are desperate with little Putin threatens with nuclear war already.
@Rasmus Gustavsson do you realize how vast the Russian military is? How many thousands of tanks they have? Thousands of planes and helicopters. Those numbers are a speck of dust for Russia.
Gonna grow lots of sunflowers.
"~MABEY~
YOUR NOT THERE AND ONLY GET INFORMATION FROM WESTERN SOURCES! DONT FORGET THIS."
CAPSLOCK MEANS I AM RIGHT
"This is why Putin rattles the nuclear saber, because he know a war against the US would spell complete and utter destruction for him and Russia. It’s all he has. His military is nothing next to many Western militaries, the Ukrainian conflict is showing that Russia is nowhere as strong as previously believed ."

"@MrPLC999

If he goes nuclear, NATO goes in.

Actually, the Russian military would simply shoot him in the back of the head if he went that crazy.

You need to remember that Russia(not Putin in particular) MUST always keep a large proportion of its forces out east, the deter China from grabbing large parts of Siberia..."
"@Lazar Mihai The Russians have serious problems, but they can still win.  If they encircle enough of the Ukrainian manpower and cut them off from resupply, they can win."
"@kreek22 agree. But we only got a 4:1 manpower ratio in the current war if they both go all out without any civilian. Considering that a lot of Ukraine civilians are fighting alongside the army and that they use unconventional tricks( throwing tomato jars at killer drones or Molotov cocktails into anything, and being supported by literally every country in the world except for India and China, it’s pretty easy to say the Russians are fucked. They cannot afford this war, nor are they capable of having it head to head with the Ukrainians."
"@Lazar Mihai Two things were happening at once.  The Finns were killing the Soviets at a 5:1 ratio.  And the Finns were running out of manpower 14x as fast as the Soviets.  So, they were winning on quality, but losing on quantity."
"@kreek22 you’re just looking in the wrong direction. The idea is the Finns were way more capable and that’s why they had fewer casualities(not percentage, effective deaths and loss of equipment). And, as some wise men said, the current Russian army is nowhere near what the Red Army was. So they’re definitely doomed by a mad man to lose this war."
"So they have prepared for months, even years, and they perform this poorly? 
Glorie aan Oekraïne!!"
"NONE of this makes any fucking sense.  Russia is orders of MAGNATUDES more powerful than Ukraine.  If they genuinely wanted to take it over, they could do so in a matter of days.  They could destroy all internet and telephony, preventing communications between Ukrainian resistance groups.  None of what is going on follows basic military doctrine. If you are going to invade a nation with the intent to conquer it, you strike HARD, FAST, and without mercy. This is complete quack-fuckery and is playing out more like a romanticized caricature of war, with everything being streamed on TikTok and Youtube. Yes the installed comedian drag dancer president of Ukraine is heroically taking on a cut-throat KGB president whose forces somehow just can't seem to take over the country, or even take out basic infrastructure like the internet. Manufactured fucking quagmire."
"First of all even in war there are some protocols to follow, but secondly, cost of tactics you are suggesting would be so high that it would send Russia back to medieval times economically speaking."
"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to Brave Nation, standing for Human rights of themselves but the whole World of Democracy!"
"Failed logistics ? - Last time I checked , the Russians were advanicng and there was no one that could really slowed them down , let alone stop them . Hell , the Neonazis from the Ukrainian paramilitary groups even began to take their own civilians , in their own cities to use as a human shields , in hopes of preventing the Russians from suppresing them with artillery . Get your facts straight ..."
"I would like to comment about the vocal tone you have chosen for this video. It’s difficult for me to describe but I’ll try. It’s singsongy and sarcastic and conveys satisfaction, which, though justified, undermines your journalistic credibility. Future generations might be watching this report 50 or 100 years from now, and your vocal delivery could become the story."

"China's looking at this and thinking he didn't even have to cross a tumultuous body of water!  DAMN IT!  Meanwhile, the Nazi world war two parallels are almost absurd in their similarities, all the way down to China turning over confidential US appeals to reign putin in,  similar to Stalin telling Hitler of similar confidential appeals and warnings from Churchill.   🧠💥"
"Tbh. This is wrong. Russians are tactically superb and are advancing mad fast. I understand the hyping and rooting, but the russians are avancing absolutely insanely fast from military standpoint. Anyone who understands military tactics would just absolutely roll over if you said russians are doing bad. Sad war, but this just pure underestimations. This russian advance in ukraine will enter history books of military experteese. And saying russians couldnt take ukraine in 5 days. Are you mad? this is clear proof that you are absolutely clueless of military logistics. This is largest country in europe with some 600 thousand square km territory, 40 million people and one of the strongest armies in europe. Russia enters ukraine with 100-120k personall and withing 12 days major cities are almost surrounded, vast territories are taken and the military of ukraine is on brink of collapse. The advance past 2 days just clearly shows that ukraine ran out of gas and more and more territories will be taken now at faster rate. Once again i repeat. All this war is horrible for bunch of people dying, but from military standpoint russian advance is absolutely insane."
"Great video outlining push/pull style logistics. It is easy to see a former communist or current authoritarian regimes fail in the realm of logistics, since capitalism is essentially the practice of advanced logistics in a civilian sense. Authoritarian states can push power but dont have the capitalistic/calculatetive mindset to consider the cost of pushing power. They push but they cant pull, so alot of their forces are sent into Ukraine without the ability to reload their punches. Its like a brute boxer who cant pace himself to the end of the fight."
"so sad
!"
good video man
Great information. Thankfully we are adults. Here we can see how Putin is a true war criminal. We hope for the EU?NATO success.
This video is more helpful than 90% of all news outlets videos in the world
"Слава Украине! Ребята, только победы вам!"
"War, war never changes"
Great vid.
Ukrainian president is a puppet of US ! clown
Everyone thinks they're an expert

This guy’s inflection is really irritating.
Ukraine? You mean Western Russia
"Aww, the USSR collapses again, without even reassembling itself, poor babies."
🤡
When the war starts: **Wendover relieved and wiping away bullets of sweat as he realizes it won't be a naval conflict**
Well Putin thought Zelinsky was another comedian like Boris Yeltsin...well turned out the other way
"Yeah, no matter how good their logistics are, Ukrainians will destroy all of their attempts to invade.  You can't control millions of people who are willing to kill you with their bare hands."
"Russia is on pace for the fastest military operation ever.
Moving faster than the 6 day war. 
That isnt a failure."
"No they aren't lmao
Imagine having one of the largest militaries, setting up forces for months, invading by surprise and can't even push the 96 miles to Kyiv."
That's your opinion but military analysis see it differently like 1800 military facilities were destroyed along with 650 tanks 45 aircraft on the ground and 13 in the air.
"I believe  this would be the same to China PLA achilles heel. 

If they were to invade Taiwan and Taiwan defenders maintain  control plus additional supplies and military  support  from neighbouring countries  plus US supplies ( As they did on Ukraine ). China PLA Logistics would fall the same or worst. 

China heavily reliable to its military might with little Logistics  would be the its invasion failure, unlike Russia rail system support, the Sea is less forgiving. Chinese PLA military wanted the killing blow immediately but if they were prolong the war they can easily  cripple without proper Logistics. Also the other achilles heel is they don't  have a Central command structure which the Chairman is their ""command structure "" ( which is absolutely a bad idea ) and it's  3rd achilles heel is the corruption within the government and its  generals because majority of the party members have little loyal to the current  Chairman."
It didn’t fail. He doesn’t wanna show all his strategies to the world.
putin loss
Did this channel just show Russia using a nuclear bomb at 16:53
Probably a thermobaric fuel/air bomb.
"If anything:  this shows us what RuSSia really is:  a failed state with  gas, oil and some nukes that it tries to use as leverage."

"When I watch videos like this, I always think how odd it is that they somehow don’t bring up the fact that Ukraine was ethnically cleansing the Russian speaking people in the Donbas region, also the fact that the Minsk agreement was created in 2014 but Ukraine and America defiled the agreement for 8 years. Should I also mention the coup of 2014 that Obama openly admits to “brokering a transition of power” in Ukraine, also the fact that America has been funding neo-nazi paramilitaries like the Avov battalion with known Nazi affiliation.  Videos like this make what Russia did seem completely random and illogically… not saying that most of these videos are running on western propaganda which actually don’t show the full picture in which Ukraine, NATO, and America have literally been agitating Russia for 8 years while Putin tries diplomacy and for 8 years, the Minsk agreement is being broken. But you know, to each their own!"
You earned your 10 cents well
"Logistics can severely limit a commander’s options in terms of strategy or tactics.  Conversely, pro-active logistics can literally “redefine the battlefield”, by making more options feasible."
@TheLatiosnlatias02 silly goose
"@Marks Accounts with provenience have quite high value, it may be a hacked account too."
"@Ken Davies Non-Sequiturs are bad, mmkay?"
"@Dugie Joness that is the point of logistics, to take supplies and deliver it whole from one place to another. No vehicles, no transport. No supplies transported from further back, no supplies."
"@David McLean Not necessarily, channel seems to be of an anime fan, has quite a lot of other channels subscribed to. I'd wager a troll, or a really bad take."
When they rebuild Ukraine I hope they switch to standard gauge. Then Russia can't take trains into it.
Do you actually believe in the stuff you're putting out
I stand with anyone who wishes peace and happiness! I wish for this conflict over.
Fake News
"lets see if they last as long as Iraq.,... remember the US took 26 days to breach the Capitol .. so its been less than half that so far...and given the requests for no fly zones and some of the crazy coming out of ukraine ... i think they are pretty near collapse. Afterall if you are winning you don't ask for no fly zones or foreign aid."
Russian conscripts are not innocent casualties of war.
We are to believe that a military so well equipped and trained didn’t give much thought to logistics? Come on! The very first thing that a military does is ensure seamless logistics.
"@There Is HOPE / ITs Not OverRussian army is a great example of the PR campaign, not military lmao. Two weeks and still not much to work with for russians in Ukraine. Putin took a bite that was too big, so he needs to change his tactic to terrorism, just what he did in Syria back then. The country is too big to forget it was on a map, russian economy is already in agony, they can no longer fund their troops. All Ukraine needs to do is just wait and not give up, I don't understand what are you talking about. You're sus af with such comments, lmao. Either bot or Russian propaganda victim."
"The Russian military isn’t so well equipped and trained though, Muneeb. That’s propaganda."
Perhaps they are not as well trained as advertised.
Poor russians. They will be hated EVERYWHERE all arond the world

I gotta wonder if a reliance on rail directly leads to the usage of a push system
"While it might be easy to conclude ""oh duh they should just use the pull system, dumb authoritarians"", American wars of late have been fought against nation with coastlines were we can roll up with limitless naval assets, air superiority, and trucks, that may enable the flexibility needed for a pull based system. Meanwhile, european continental wars -> rail. But I also have to wonder, to what degree rail itself leads to a push system, given the lower flexibility of bulk, point to point operations and limited passing ability and potentially having to keep more rigorous timetables."
Put Polish fighter jets into Ukraine ? Why is Zelenskyy begging NATO for more fighter jets . . . ?  Because he has already lost most of his fighter jets         just 10 days after this war started  ???      Putin's response will simply be to destroy ALL the airfields in Ukraine.  Bit of a STUPID escalation ?
"RUSSIA’S LOGISTICS FAILED JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE GOD IS ON THE SIDE OF THE UKRAINE PEOPLE 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾

The Russian Army is only good in killing Women and Children. Many videos and pictures of them look like a Third World Army operating and commiting war crimes.
"1:51 looks similar to the Dixie flag/Southern Cross/Confederate battle flag. Wikipedia says It is the blue-red proposed flag of the self-proclaimed confederation of Novorossiya (or New Russia) is a variant of the battle flag which was adopted on 24 May 2014, with the addition of the coat of arms.

A white-yellow-black tricolor was presented on 13 August 2014 by Oleg Tsarev as a potential state flag.[2][3] This resembled an upside-down Romanov flag, which was the national flag of the Russian Empire from 1858 to 1883.

Novorossiya is an unrecognised confederation of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, claiming the territory of the respective Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. On 20 May 2015 the leadership of the Federal State of Novorossiya announced the 'freezing' of the confederation 'project'."
I love that you showed a bit of the Battle of Techno House
"We SHOULD have supplied the Ukrainians with WAY more air power capabilities, ie: Drones so that they could have eliminated all the convoys. Instead, they are letting the Russians regroup which is diabolical. What a waste of a victory. I'd say the failure is more on the Ukraine's part, or to be more accurate, the west's hesitation to do anything... You need to do a video on that now."
Thank you
"A modern invasion is basically impossible thanks to technology and the internet, your enemies can find where you're sending your armed forced and set an ambush and destroy your forces. An armed population is near impossible to invade."
Too bad the streaming sure on only reads HD and not 4k.
Russia will loose more that it could ever imagine!  It’s up to the Russian people to stop this.
"They were hoping for a quick land invasion and surrender, they could have don't ""desert storm"" and bomb the place for half a month before going in and that would result in better results for the Russians, not for a better outcome for the ukrainians I think. Because they would have to level EVERYTHING to make it as easy of an entrance as desert storm did. Would also kill thousands in the process, just like desert storm did. I believe during the first 3 days they were avoiding big cities and plan was to ensurcle them and keep moving rather than what actually happened."
Hello! Could you please add your sources?
"B.S. more western media propaganda here! Its controlled invasion was to limit the civilian casualties. Ukrainians are considered part of Russia by Russians, so it was never meant to be a brutal all-out invasion. SMH at the total black-out of any narrative that challenges the one-sided narrative of the West, then they call it Democracy & freedom?? B.S."
"Wars don't ever go as planned but overall Russia's winning, decisively, we haven't even seen frontal fighting, Ukrainian army has collapsed and what's left is surrounded and will be slowly strangled into submission just like ISIS in Aleppo, Russia is going very soft, they don't want to lose people and cause civilian casualties in urban combat. Zelensky should surrender, it's not a winnable fight and worst case scenario isn't bad for Ukraine, it's not like Canada is really sovereign. Or Germany."
"For decades, the DoD hyped up Russia's armed forces, to keep US defense contractors fat.  This performance is not a surprise."
"This millitary is just pathetic, or everything started as an exercise, everyone thought in Russia it will be one, and than they started the war without preparation because they thought Ukrain will just give up day 2.... and now they are f ed up, pathetic military, and the reason now they attack civilians is exactly for this reason, they want to destroy the Ukrainian moral, but the more civilians they kill, the worse the resistance will be... f ing idiots."
"So hear me out. You take a few groups of 10ish men. You send them 100ish km into Russia. You make them destroy railways. 

Boom, supplies gone. At least for a while."
"Love your channel always watch each one, the only thing is I think you could have skipped the sales pitch at the end, on this particular video. Feels a bit unethical to be pushing new services on a video about a conflict"
So basically russian military sucks and its not second most powerful
Stay away from this lying propaganda site.
Way this guy talks russia has already lost.
I am sold on the advert here
There is no weak agreement that will have the same results as in the past.
"Logistics and the vast territory of Russia has always been their ally, but not n this scenario."
ELINT News is one of my favorites. Also TexIntel though the guy seems wierd he is always retweeting the best bits.

"Ukrainian 100k army is surrounded and being annihilated in South East, Ukrainian two largest cities being surrounded and in process of clean up, entire airforce being destroyed

Wendover Productions: see, Russia lost this war!"
He never said Russia lost he said they could have done better
Exactly.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"the ""autocrat"" of Russia. Why do they feel this need to always qualify, as if just calling him by name is not servile enough, as if people don't know he's not exactly a fervent believer in liberal democracy."
"The problem is Russia can fail its logistics 9000 times, Ukraine is still fucked"
"Western forces , you mean US forces"
And these people are considered to be the second most powerful military force in the world? This video makes them look like arrogant idiots
😂
"Great content and exceptionally explains the lessons learned in a 32 year military career. For all of our failings, western alliances and all volunteer professional military is an enviable thing little boy Putin can only imagine. If only our governance was not a group of professional sellouts to the highest bidder."
These Russian soldiers are finding out what it felt like to “liberate” Iraq
"Not exactly something to be proud of, but the US is pretty much the only military force in the world that has the capability and understanding of how to insert an invading force into hostile territory. The superior logistics experience and planning is a priority. The US can create a beachhead in the most remote and hostile territories and keep it supplied, with losses coming from public political pressure.

Russia has zero experience at force projection. The few foreign actions they've taken part in involved, up until now, a friendly local power to operate as cover for this lack of understanding, such as Syria."
@Bob Becuase the ability to choose where and when to fight already secured and fended off most of the winnable fights. So there has been no bloody Boer War or Germany starting WWIII (and fail again).
"That ability doesn't seem to matter in the outcome. Why has the US has so little success since WWII. Korea was a tie. Vietnam was a massive failure. Granada was a success, but come on, it's a tiny island. Iraq could be considered a success if you ignore the many 100s of thousands of dead Iraqi civilians. Then there's Afghanistan."
9:58 so thats why they been so lost on the roads. I can't believe they don't have gps navigators for their units when they have one of the largest armies in the world
"I am in Kiev and my friends family just got killed by artillery they lived in a public housing complex- no military objectives anywhere near there.
Bows there’s just a giant black hole where his place and a couple more were.
I’m a conscript and we have 2 Russian soldiers hostage that we intend to take our our frustrations on and I can’t tell you he’ll be ok
Just like my best friend
 RIP THE VALIZKYS"
Russia should go to NATO and ask for help fighting the (Ukraine) Nazis! A Lend Lease for trucks!! LOL
"I heard once (I don't remember the source) that ""In the late hours of the officers club the good officers talk tactics, the great ones talk logistics.""

The number of quotes alone stating how important logistics are to the success of an army implies both its significance and how often people get it wrong."
If these people haven't even read Sun Tsu I'm not sure their opinion is very respectable.
"Putin's buildup reminds me of an rule in stage drama. IIRC Anton Checkov made it clear that if a gun was revealed anywhere on stage, it would be used."
Russia should have hired Wendover to design their logistics
"DUDE if you have not noticed...UKRAINE is almost the size of SPAIN, France, Poland, and  Germany....! Is not about the logistics is about covering all the territory with the Russian army at a slow pace, I heard some media talking about Russia meet with RESISTANCE....! Believe me Russian army know exactly what they are looking for, First; Diminished the NEO-NAZIS Militia, SECOND; Searching for warfare chemical weapon facilities, THIRD; Looking for Nuke weapons and Facilities where they might have been arming or have created any Nuke. And they will destroy Ukraine country to find these places.  (Russia INTEL knew this before their invasion)."
"Detengan a Putin ya, luego es tarde."
Excellent analysis.
Really? do you have any war experience at all?
"If you are a Christian one must realise that much of modern Ukraine is not inline with biblical principles, and many modern nations (democracies) if you will have become (heathen nations). If you are a Christian the Lord, has some telling warnings we need to take head. Read: Deuteronomy 28, it is evidently clear that the Lord God, (the creator of heaven) and earth will use your enemies against you, fiercely to teach you lessons, because you have left his ways for the ways of sin and iniquity and to drive one out from ones own land. Russia today, is basically the hand of God. The Americans, and the UK, your arrogance are next. Nuclear War has been seen by many prophets, you think the hand of God 's judgement cannot reach you! 3.4 million views, does not make your views correct in the eyes of God. Judgement is at the door, and poor people of the world, Nuclear war is just the beginning. A worldwide catastrophe is at the door, repent before the oceans sweeps your countries away."
"Wish we weren't so easy to manipulate. Fix OUR problems. Gas is out of control unnecessarily; we were self sufficient exporters of energy 2 years ago. Inflation is running wild.

how is this effect called when editing videos? I wanna show pages as they did in the video.
"Just like durin Crimean war, just like during Russia-Japanese war"
"One thing that concerns me about making Russia's invasion seem like a failure, is that it hasn't been stopped, many people are still dying, and Ukrainians still need help."
Putin is taking notes
Shitty maintenance has many vehicles disabled because they didn't properly take care of the tires.
Calling Vladimir Putin Russia's autocrat in the first 10 seconds of the video is such an important move to establish truth and combat propaganda.
"Lol Russia, hats off on how to fail on the world stage.. did they learn NOTHING from beating the Germans on home soil in 1941! Doh!"
"See, literally most of that could have never happened if we provided them with actual long range artillery and weapons. We could have landed missiles on those staging areas and columns with drone strikes, predator missiles, cruise missiles, etc. instead we gave them weapons in which they must have a line of sight. America needs to get their shit together and use this chance to wipe Russia tf out"
Russia’s logistics failed… because they used Windows ®.
Excellent piece of work
they are so weak...
"sebab, ego.."
Because KGB guys are not military men.
Lol Western propaganda
"Just an observation but I wouldn't necessarily say their logistics failed ... It took the US military 1 month 1 week and 4 days from the time they invaded Iraq to the time that Baghdad fell and this was considered at the time to be unbelievably fast and the Iraqi Army for the most part didn't put up a fight most choose to surrender - Yes, we've heard about patrol convoys running out of fuel and getting stuck but this isn't something that's uncommon especially considering the difficult terrain in the area (not ideal for moving heavy armored vehicles over the ground is very soft and winter thaw makes it a muddy mess) additionally (unlike the Iraqis at the time) a large portion of the active Ukrainian army has extensive combat experience from fighting in the Donbas region and they have been armed to the teeth with some of the most advanced weapons systems in the world by western nations. While I do believe Russia wanted this to be finished quickly and it hasn't, the longer the war the harder the economic stress becomes on the Russian people and support for the invasion will decrease rapidly. It seems as if the Russians tactics are fairly straight forward initial phase of the invasion destroy all critical military infrastructure and seize control of all critical infrastructure (ex. airfields, power plants etc) while slowly encircling Kiev. I think ultimately our media has their own agenda to spin and that spin is being based largely on the propaganda coming out of both nations involved in the the conflict. TLDR - Russia has experienced setbacks true, but I do not think they are as catastrophic as those watching in the west are being told."
"I did wonder that, I just wish there was a media that told the truth."
Who tf is Keef?
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
"I think it’s because Russian army is designed for defense instead of offense. Like in WW2 they’re tactics were to fall back and lose territory, to form a better defensive position. That’s why the Germans were able to gain so much Russian territory, only to get bogged down as they went further in."
"While you're right in many points, I wanna point that the shellin' of ""Civilians"" is a practice ""we all"" use.

All the time.

The US shells even civil tents in Yemen with Drones because ""They have informations that Person X is there""; nobody cares. In Afghanistan, an Afghan Live was worth around 200 Bucks. In Syria, Turkey actually attacked kurdish Civilians on sight and shelled their cities for months and we didn't care.

I think it's kinda weird to point now at Russia and say ""Uhu, they shellin' Civilians! :( That's bad! :/"" - Like, yeah, maybe some combat Forces were between the Civilians. We do that too. That's war mate. That's why everybody says ""War is bad :/"", because Civilians will be always hit."
"War always has disinformation. On both sides.
Like for example ""the ghost of kiev"" who is a troll post originating from 4Chan. Or using pictures/Videos from 2015 east ukraine conflict.

"No logjstic problem, West supply  Ukraine with billions in arms, the Ukkkrainaz leaves it for Vladimir, no problem, thank you Bandaristas"
You're absolutely right when the army has to pick up weapons from their enemy that points to NO logistics problem
"4:00 Wow, the russian government owns 20 trains? No wonder the logistics failed!"
"Going to be fascinating to see you try and thread the needle with this much detail and aplomb, when China is the war opponent, and not Russia.  

You know they're next.  We simply will not permit their vision of the world to take hold unless we are running things."
Listen my friend this is not a war because all of your civilians will be dead by now this is a special operation Ukraine government is using civilians to slow down the Russians. Why they are not evacuation the civilians from the city to keep them safe ? Instead they use them as shields. Everyone one is praying for Ukraine but yet you just fueling up the conflict  by sending more ammunition and arms to support those nationalist that betrayed Russia many times during the history.
"@Tomasz Wiatr even if you repeat lie about ""opened fire on civilians"" thousand times - it isnt become the truth...well, if there is a logistic problems, and if ukraine so sovereign - so dont need to nerve, its ok, right? everything is allright) you are about to win...just wait...right?))) pray...its very helpful, talk loud, fight in comments - this is a way to win))) arent u just kids?)))"
"They don't evacuate the civilians because Russian forces have opened fire on civilian convoys multiple times. By the way, how do you evacuate millions of civilians without creating a massive traffic jam?
Another thing, the civilians ARE evacuating. More than a million people have already fled Ukraine, with barely anything. 
By ""fueling the conflict"" you mean trying to preserve the independence of a sovereign country? Ukraine isn't Russia, Ukraine is it's own country.
Finally, I don't know if you're just a troll or just someone who hasn't got a source of media that isn't Russian propaganda. Take care"

utter bullshit Sam
Every YouTuber is a geopolitical expert. Fascinating.
"Not really but it can quite clearly be seen that he did his research, plus this isn't even mainly about geopolitics it's about logistics and military"

"The best thing about Russian paper tiger force, is that they never learn from the past."
If Russia is that bad in logistics then Ukraine has big chances of winning the war
"Iraq defeated the USA and Ukraine will defeat Russia. Right? No. Do the math. Ukraine brought this on itself. So did the West. Tragically could have been avoided but the West miscalculated in 2008 and 2014. I blame this all on the West, just as Japan was provoked to attack Pearl Harbor and the Gulf of Tonkin excuse for the Vietnam war was a hoax. US hoaxed into Iraq. We are being hoaxed AGAIN. Tragic and sad. This is not about global brotherly love. It is about the break down of fucked up politicians who fucked up. Simple as that."
"If Russia has enough money and capability to make an armored vehicle that can defeat the javelins and NLAWS warhead, they might succeed in Ukraine. The US created the MRAPs because of IED/land mines making the humvees obsolete. They need to innovate fast."
"Ukraine is and has always been Russia. How come this video doesn't explain why the USA was building up there military around Ukraine at the same time. American, Canadian, UK Force's were deploying.  This war is fake.  It was perpetrated by the USA govermafia.  USA and Canada are still buying refined oil, unrefined oil and natural gas from Russia.  Swift means nothing because all the countries that buy oil from Russia have there own versions of swift and Russian banks and the money goes from any country buying from Russia directly to Russia.  Look it up.Putin is on record and there is video of him asking in a conference with the USA back in year 2000. Stating that he asked the USA what they thought of Russia joining NATO. the USA govermafia laughed it off and walked away, instead of coming to an agreement. if the USA gets Ukraine,  the USA will put military at the Ukraine boarder, aimed at Russia. Because the USA want world dominance.  Hope you like living in a new world order, (hell). Stupid humans brainwashed by the mainstream media and the jab they took in the arm is why Stupid humans believe lies!!! GO TEAM RUSSIA  🇷🇺!!!!!  Zelensky is a coward as he sits in the USA. Zelensky was put in power by the USA govermafia.  ZELENSKY then put his political opponents in prison so nobody could oppose him. Fact check! USA propaganda and this war was perpetrated by the USA govermafia so stupid humans would stop buying from Russia and buy from the USA. FUCK THE USA!!!!! 
GO TEAM RUSSIA!!!!
Take 10 minutes and fact check!!!"
@MrBoots06 So provide your sources of facts. Were you imprisoned for opposing Zelensky? Were you on the front lines to claim that the war is fake? Did you see the Ukranian refugees on Polish borders?

I love your logistics Analisis !
"putin, like the communists, only act if they see superiority on their side, putin is a perfect cowardly abuser who does not have the required morals, since he has no justification for invading Ukraine. Bravo and my respects to the Ukrainians, they are brave Heroes."
its not Russian invasion its the Americans supporting Bandera ideology neonazis
Lol what i bias video. Clearly Russia is not going with their full power. Their goal is to pressurize Ukrainians and not kill them. They would be great by now if they wanted
I would say corruption and low morale is the reason Putin's army can't win not logistics
"The amount of comments is the number of bills russians need to bring to purchase a single loaf of bread lmao. People saying ""obviously russians are taking it slow and safe"" yeah right, let's wait until the value of our Russian ruble hits lower than a dead crypto coin.

I wish the Russia is stupid army videos. It is counter-productive because the Wests governments think that Ukraine will not be taken. Stop playing into Putin’s game. The Russian army is making progress. Please help Ukrainian people.
Very nice information... 👍👍
YAY!!! NWO!!! one world Government!!
"well, If Syria has teach anything to Putin is that no matter how many millions Ukraine's he may slaughtered, Europe will do nothing militarily."
I feel like this video might be premature
Well Germany fucked the supply problem up hard in WW2 but they came far into the east. Just imagine being Putin fucking up so hard they cant even keep up supply after 2 Days. Ex UDSSR should have known what happens if u dont have enough supply.... hahhaha
One thing not mentioned here is that the initial night of missile attacks against Ukraine military infrastructure wasn't so successful because of information received from NATO and Ukraine's military responding quickly.
"I think the 8 years they had to prepare after Crimea also came down to it. They knew this was coming. For Ukraine, this is the most important time in its history. For Russia, it is Tuesday, as the saying goes."
"Excellent video, just to let you know. I specifically did not subscribe as it would not be worth my while. I don't like this model where you are forced to pay for a channel with all sorts of garbage on it. No thanks to Curiosity stream garbage."

@Flow Circous Then tell Russians to stop attacking Ukraine. Nobody wants this war.
Very interesting.  I read a lot of books about the soviet army during the cold war.  They had a lot of these same weaknesses.  Fast forward to today and we have newer weapons systems but an inadequate logistics system.  You have an inadequate  (not secure) communications network and if you have dry rotted tires on trucks (inadequate training).  The Russian military appears to be a paper tiger.  It does not appear that they train the same way they fight . . .

The Ukrainians used a Muhammed Ali's ROPE A DOPE TACTICS. LET THE RUSSIAN LANCHED THE FIRST WAVE OF THEIR MIGHTY  POWER AND WAIT TO RUN OUT OF FUEL - AMMUNITIONS AS WELL AS FOODS.

Sweet propaganda dude
"Russia wanted to flex their military might.

Instead, they demonstrated how limp-dicked their military is!"
"And as of about 4 days ago, Putin committed 92% of his entire military power in and around Ukraine.  Leaving the 1.5 million square miles of European Russia and 100% of the 5.1 million square miles of Asian Russia (Siberia) completely undefended.

This might sound like nonsense, except that, in early 1917, Tsar Nicholas committed his entire army to his war vs Germany, leaving St. Petersburg and the palace undefended.  A garment workers strike broke out in St. Petersburg, and the home guard was barely adequate to deal with it.  When, on the night of the 4th day, the home guard flipped to supporting the strikers, the very next day the Tsar had to abdicate.   This was NOT the Bolsheviks.  This was almost a bloodless revolution.  A FIVE DAY revolution - by accident.  By demonstrations.  The Bolsheviks came along about 8 months later and overran the new government.  I.e., the Bolsheviks themselves did NOT revolt against the Tsar.

So, how many troops are in Moscow and St. Petersburg right now?  Putin might be more vulnerable to those demonstrators around Russia than he is to NATO.  Putin is rightfully afraid of demonstrations.

Jus' sayin'. . . ."

"This video is well done, I didn't know that Ukraine had destroyed bridges and rail-connections! Yes, it of course makes sense, but I thought that Russia would have taken those strategic points ASAP to make make this sort of thing harder to do (you could of course still destroy railway tracks (or worse: Set some mines, that'll go off once a train drives over them (or use C4 or SEMTEX for a similar effect!), so not only destroying a locomotive, derailing a traind and destroying the tracks, but also killing some enemies in the process (and if timed well, then the Ukrainians could also loot the train!)
As for comms and analog maps: I thought Russia had a modern army? Glonass (their wanna be GPS!)  should allow for navigation and their comms gear shouldn't have been without encryption (hell: Soviet Forces had that and that was over 30 years ago!)"

Funny how the pronunciation of Kiev in English has suddenly changed.

"Putin said that everything went according to plan, so maybe it's part of the plan..hmmm, genius!! All hail mighty PooThink"
"Russia is on kievs doorstep in only 2 weeks despite half the world supplying Ukraine with weapons, money and sanctions. How is that failed logistics. USA would take 10 years after amillion drone strikes."
Haven't heard of the Gulf War?
"The issue is they failed to realize that those Slobs that drive your Food, Ammo and Fuel trucks, are just important as those guys in the tanks or infantry vehicles. without a Resupply truck of tank rounds and fuel. Your not going far. Every daytime or Night time, We resupplied the Tank and Infantry units with food, fuel and Ammo. Tanks are glad to see you when they are low on gas. You have to have supply bases where you pick up from close to the front lines but still in a safe spot. Where your Support Companies can pick up and deliver it to the combat units. I think they thought it would take a hour or so to win the war. Now it will be alot longer and possible Russia another Afghanistan."
This video is fake news
"It's obvious that the Russians took advantage of the situation where. They have been planning for years to try to take over Ukraine.  Most Countries were busy stopping Global-warming and focusing on closing Coal Mines and Gas Industry leaving Russia as the main Gas Supply. Ukraine is a very strong Country in food supplies and that is what Russia wants. It looks like it doesn't matter at what price! Just Murdering Ukrainians and destroying everything in their path. I am ashamed of my European brothers. Supporting Sanctions is the very minimum that they can do. Sanctions are not a short time solution. It actually gave the Russians more incentive to move faster at the same time it also gave more incentive for the rest of the World to condemn Russia and come in as weapon and financial support for the defense of the savage and barbaric Russian invasion.
I take my hat off for the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and all the beautiful people of Ukraine."
Those who support a monster are monsters too ...
"A lot of information in this video is based on tweets. Are they really that reliable?
For example, let's take a tweet from NEXTA on 8:11. NEXTA was confirmed as ""fake news"" even by POLISH GOVERNMENT. (lol)
Both sides of this conflict have sunk deep into an information war. (Examples: Ukrainian ""Ghost of Kyiv"", Russian ""USA's chem weapon labs in Ukraine"")

You cannot trust anyone about this conflict.(which is a dumb conclusion, but please, keep that in mind for every news/analytics outlet)"
"Okay, that only applies to first third of the video.

After that it was pretty interesting and, probably, partially representative (I mean, Russians probably DO know how to fix railways). (oh, but the ending kinda sucked - it was kinda overdramatized (imho) and based on (probably) misinformation)"
Lol every media is against russia..expected
Agree and all those medias are western..
I have been struck by all the YouTube clips showing trucks with flat tires and abandoned.  Every flat is a blow for Freedom!
"Since the Russian army has nearly no more backup resources and shall be stopped any time.  Pls have Ukrainian keep fighting and shall win the war soon.  It is time to prepare the penalty to Russia to compensate for the loss to Ukraine due to the Russian evil act.  Devil Nazi Putin shall be killed by his own people shortly.  A Russian news anchor says millions of Russians feel invasion is a catastrophe!  God bless Ukrainian, and god bless European."
"I see a potential new pattern of pro-Putin disinformation. People are downplaying the ongoing conflicts significance with the reference to wars in the past in other parts of the World. Then the next step in ""argumentation"" is to point out that it's ""racist"" that ""west media"" covers much of Putin's invasion on Ukraine because ""nobody cared about wars at other places, because their inhabitants weren't white"". 

Let me remind those ""geniuses"" that it's a prime example of whataboutism and doing that they look really dumb."
"@Onboard Basil An answer that is whataboutism itself, how ironic. 

Topic - Russian invasion on Ukraine, all the atrocities, war crimes. 

Ppl like You - what about ""double standards ""  in media coverage.

Definition of whataboutism: Whataboutism or whataboutery (as in ""what about…?"") is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy, which attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving the argument."
"Its not ""whattaboutism"" its calling out double standards"
thanks
You planning to just ignore the western coup the took out a pro Russian leader and installed a western puppet ruler
Very well put together on short notice.
"awesome video. As a ukrainian, I can confirm that our social media is full of messages about destroying fuel supplies.

Also, keep in mind that russian government was selling this as a 1 day war. E.g., we're moving in, all local people will support us, ukrainian army is weak... bla-bla.

As we can now see, the ""greatest"" military on the planet is - sh*t. They lost Afghanistan war, they lost of Finland, they lost Chechnya war and basically had to buy their way out of it. They will lose this one as well. Exactly the reason why putin started threatening the world with nuclear rockets on the 2nd day."
Lmao putin alerted his nuclear force for its defence or counter strike to any country that tries to help Ukraine lol not to attack for his pleasure
It's still going on. How stupid is wendover
Russia just Russia'd itself...
"Just looking at this objectively, the first difference I saw between the early days of the invasion and all other recent military occupations was the apparent attempt to ""pull its punches"".  In Yemen, in Palestine, in Iraq or Syria occupiers target ministries, water, power and telecommunications, TV stations, hospitals, schools.  The moment troops hit the ground they round up men and truck them away. They rape the women. It looks to me Russia was trying to stay clean and have a strategic even symbolic war. They expected (and lets be fair, so did everyone in the West) that Ukraine would surrender quickly and the whole thing could be handled with little collateral damage and loss of life. We were all wrong - we completely underestimated how fiercely Ukranians would defend their country. I am honestly awestruck and take my hat off to them. Also Russian troops were told they were going as liberators so they didn't really put up their guard. There are clips of Ukranians sauntering up and taunting them. Even one where a Ukranian drove up to a stalled tank and offered to tow them - back to Russia. Everybody laughed.  Can you imagine if an Afghan had sauntered up to a US tank like that? Or a Palestinian to an IDF vehicle? They'd be vaporised while still 200 yards away.

Russia's mistakes were many. First - starting an invasion at all. They should have just taken the rest of Donbass and sat there ominously. Because two weeks ago they were scary. Now they're turning into a joke.  Second, trying to use a light touch. If they'd followed the US playbook from Baghdad and just carpet bombed Kiev from the air for 72 hours straight and maybe followed that with 10,000 paratroopers and aero-dropped tanks and artillery, things might have turned out quite differently. But biggest mistake is on the scale of bringing horses and swords to WW1 - not understanding that the nature of war had changed. They were completely caught off guard by how well Ukraine would weaponize social media and public relations. I call it the 'charm defensive' where Russia effectively brought a knife to a gunfight.

You know what, China watched everything and learned all the lessons to be learned. If and when the time comes, they will not make the same mistakes."
@Fenrael That's my point.
i doubt russia want to destroy ukraine. thats why carpet bombing was not used as a tactic.
"It’s been like 10 days… Aren’t wars typically multiple years? Seems a bit early to call this analysis, feels like propaganda. Stay free everyone."

I appreciate you admitted at the end this episode was carefully edited to please YouTube.
push and pull system! astounding to see how crucial is logistics during wars
"Never underestimate your opponent, goes both ways with Russia and Ukraine. 
Slava Ukraine! May they drive the invaders out!"
"Hey , buddy. Stop this BS! So disgusting all this lie,lie and lie!"
"So essentially, Russia tried to mimic the US’s Shock and Awe campaign and were so unbelievably incompetent that they didn’t logistically plan ahead for a shock and awe campaign, which requires huge loads of ordnance being brought to the artillery, tanks, etc. and constant air support. This is fucking hilarious. Superpower my ass."
"US shock and awe require 3 weeks to reach baghdad, chill"
How Russia can win any war on earth: Nukes
"So the world is already talking abour Russia's failure? It took the US 5 1/2 weeks to take Iraq, a country that's a 1/3 the size of Ukraine, easier terrain, older technology, and thousands of more civilians dead.... And in Ukraine we're not even in week 2... This is hilariously sad...."
@drusik Sure Thing Tankie Tom
"Firstly, Saudi Arabia borders Iraq (Turkey too, but that wasn't used I hear), Once you get an FOB started, it doesn't matter if its a neighboring country or not when you have the largest Navy in the world and the Navies of the entire Global Coalition providing you supplies.
Russia is on its own here. The US has the most foreign bases in the entire world, over 800 foreign bases in the world... Compared to Russia's 3 foreign bases in the world... So don't give me that ""half-way around the world"" crap... US and NATO is like the railway in Russia presented in this video..."
"@Ho-Ri Production Do you see a difference betwenn using military bases half a world away and attacking your neighboring country? If not, then you're correct. If yes, maybe think about your statement again"
"@partlycurrent oh yeah, US didnt even use saudi arabia bases when attacking Iraq right???"
"Dear Tankie, 
considering that Iraq is half a world apart from the US and considering that Ucraine is right next to Russia and both Russia and Ucraine were part of the same country once, most people will still see the Russian failure to be greater than the 5 1/2 weeks it took the US."
"something to take into account also is that like the soviets, the russians have no problem losing 15% of their male population to win a war and the western strategy right now is to throw money and weapons at the Ukranians and hope that they hold the line which is not a replacement for actual manpower."
Thanks! Very brief and very informative video! The first step to your disaster is to underestimate your enemy.
Cia media
"This is why China is not going to invade Tiawan (yet), not supporting  Russia, and is moving troops northward. Russian forces are weak and concentrated towards the west, leaving the resources rich eastern Russia vulnerable. If Russia has an economic collapse, our if NATO and Russia have a full scale war, China could easily take parts of Russia either by purchase it or with an invasion."
"The very first line of ur video is lie "" it all happened soo quickly"" lol bro the whole world knew  Russia will attack ukrain not only that they also knew where will they attack ukraine."
"I mean, most people probably thought that Putin wouldn't attack ""in broad daylight"", so yes, it actually came as a surprise"
imagine tryna contact your guys and the Ukrainians are blasting darude sandstorm over the radio
This is as bad as Napoleon and Hitlers winter offensive

Like how the Russian troops are checking the cash register for food when looting..lol
"They failed because they weren’t actually fighting a war. Russia still isn’t really trying to fight a war. 

Ukraine isn’t this impenetrable fortress of hardened civilian soldiers making an incredible stand against the Goliath. 

Russia for some reason just literally didn’t think they’d have to fight a full on war. 

This is hubris. Not necessarily solely stupidity and it sure af isn’t the Ukrainian military and population becoming some fucking overnight super soldier. Ukraine is a mess. It’s economy is a mess and it’s military is worse. 

They are admirable and courageous and just fucking amazing and I wish all of Ukraine the very best and god speed but if Russia wants to fight a real war Ukraine is fucked. 

All these people wanting to go help is admirable but that trickle of vacation tourist soldiers is going to dry up immediately if the actually dying starts. 

Ukraine is not the Middle East. Russia is not the United States. There’s nowhere to hide and if russias behavior during what can only really be called skirmishes thus far will likely have seriously different rules of engagement. 

If American wanted to flatten and slaughter the Middle East with conventional weapons, it could have. 

If Russia wanted to and if the rest of the world for some reason didn’t intervene Russia could erase that country entirely. 

Not that they ever would seeing as Kiev was the original capitol and was the cultural epicenter of the fledging country from the very beginning until comparatively recently. 

Russia never would but a bunch of armchair generals and tourist soldiers thinking Ukraine is really holding off try entire might of the Russian army are idiotic.

Russia isn’t and never has been a first world country (contemporary definition not war definition. Idiots). Not economically, industrially,….honestly in any sense at all whatsoever and was never ever an equal to the United States but that they’re closer to the United States than Ukraine is to Russia."
"As a Russian sitizen I don't won't to be associated with this madness, hopefully this war will stop asap
Слава Украине!🇺🇦"
So the best and easiest way to conquer Russia is cut off their rail lines bomb their fuel trucks and game over
Don’t be sure Russia is Russian
"This video forgot stating that since 2014 Western country constantly pumped Ukraine with weapons, instructors, military facilities, and Kiev regime was constantly attacking Donbass. Since 2019 Ukraine has gathered more than 250000 armed militarists ready to attack Donbass"
There is no logistical failure. The convoy is a pressure on Kiev. He does not want to attack Kiev.
"If you look at Putin's eyes while declaring the operation, he doesn’t seem sane."
1:35 You automatically assume Crimean was always a part of Russia and never a part of Ukraine.
"lmao, no."
Down with putin 😡🤬
"Calling Ukrainian defenders ""innocents"" shows how little you understand about being in a fire fight.  It doesn't matter if a civilian or even a child has a gun.  They are now a combatant and no longer a civilian."
"Failed or not, we still can’t consider the fight with them done. 

We do that, it absolutely will lead to disaster. That’s why I’m still prepping to go. That’s why other people should still go."
If ukrain only defends thre country no chance.
"Russians may slow in logistic supply but nevertheless now most Ukraine troops have being surrounded in east Ukraine, without air strikes their future is doomed."

"Russia's military incompetence is slightly comforting, though still tragic. But if Russia goes nuclear, it doesn't make any difference anyway."
"@Old man actually, you're right, Putin is who we need to worry about and a nuclear bomb would not do that much damage on the ground...

I think there is nuclear bomb planted in cities nonetheless."
"@Eumanuel I don't know about nuclear bombs being planted in cities already. Even if the US could pull that off, the bombs don't do that much damage when they're in the ground. They're most effective at a certain height above the ground."
@Eumanuel True

@Walther said the troll
...said the 1 month old fake account. lol
Incredible content. So well done. Kudos!
The Russian logistical system is a reflection of its command structure. The structure is top-down with officers down the chain of command  having very limited leeway in making decisions. This philosophy goes at least back to Stalin's Red Army.
"@kreek22 incorrect. American aid to the Soviets through the Lend Lease program was 11B USD. Soviet military spending prior to 1941 was 11B USD. In 1942, the Soviets lost approximately 1/3 of their economy and did not gain it back until late 1943. Thus, we can estimate Soviet military spending at about 7.5B USD in 1942 and 1943. A low estimate since the Soviets mobilized, but we will make it up. By 1944, we will generously give the Soviets back their 11B USD a year spending until 1945, meaning that the Soviets spent a total of about 59B USD in WW2, approximately 1/5th of that was American aid. Meaning the Soviets only produced 80% of their military consumption. 

The 3.5% figure comes from the comparison of American aid to the Soviet economy as a whole, which while totally mobilized, was still mostly being utilized to provide for Soviet civilians. 

Additionally, my earlier comment is true. While the Soviets received superior American made trucks, they specialized their economy in making weapons like the T-34 since the Soviets did not like the American/British tanks that were provided early on in the aid program.

Finally, to address your comment that the Soviets received less than the British, that is true in a monetary sense. This is because the British mostly requested and received fully manufactured goods which include labor and overhead to material manufacturing expenses while the Soviets requested and received resources which only have material expenses."
"@Kuro Usagi Only 3.5% of all American war spending went to the Soviets.  The British received 3x as much.  And, of course, 83% of the total was reserved for American forces.  In short, the Soviets provided over 90% of their own supplies."
"@kreek22 It wasn't corrupted in such way, as it heavily corrupted now. Every thing is corrupted in Russia. Not only army."
@kreek22 thanks to American trucks and western resource supplies.
"@kreek22 In my opinion, the only reason the Soviets won against the Germans was that the Germans worked on a similar, a push system that heavily relied on horses and trains. The soviet Logistics worked not because it was sufficient, but by sheer scale of the mobilized industrial war machine of the Soviet Union.

In fact WW2 soviet production was entirely switched to forgo quality for quantity, which is a philosophy that doesn't really work in the modern conflicts."
The propaganda is now here too.
"Please keep covering this topic, maybe on nebula with less regulations"
You need to learn how to speak with a normal tempo to your voice.
"So, your sources are social media, social media, social media and social media? This is a repeat of the disinformation that led Americans to destroy Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria - all non-approved by the UN, illegal wars. Learning the mistake of allowing journalist on the ground in Vietnam war, the US Empire has very much perfected propaganda, omission of info and subtle disinformation."
These innocent soldiers follow the orders of a dictator risking their lives while putin probably having vodka with russian chicks.Empathy to those soldiers.
Excellent Job on this.
"Logistics is very important to a military and it is a fool of a military officer that looks down on the logistics personnel. Logistics often gets looked down on because it's seen as very boring and there's no glory in it. Also the logistics personnel are often looked down on by the combat arms, as ""fat ugly poges,"" ""in the rear with the gear,"" ""rear-echelon MFers,"" ""the lowly quartermaster,"" etc...but if your military has inadequate logistics, it doesn't matter how badass your tanks and troops and planes are, if you cannot get adequate food, fuel, ammunition, spare parts, medical supplies, cold weather gear (for winter), etc...to the forces, then your military is going to perform badly. This was part of the problem of the German military in WWII. They had a culture that looked down on logistics.

Even weapons design has to take into account logistical thinking. For example, one of the factors that limits the design of a new battle tank is tunnel width, because if your tanks are too wide to fit through tunnels, you can't transport them anywhere. In WWII, one of the factors limiting the weight of U.S. tanks were the cranes at the shiploading docks."
How to defeat Ukraine war crimes.  And I have zero doubt if putin intends to take over he'll do it.
failed logistics is soooooooo premature! Ignorant and narcissistic take!
This is a comprehensive approach to the logistic enterprise.   Well done guys.
"Russia Defeated, Glory to Ukraine

Apparently it’s all over now except for Vladimir Putin’s inevitable fall from power and trial at the Hague, if the globalist media is to be believed."

Excellent. Thank you.
"There was a string of tweets about the tyres on Russian military vehicles and how they showed months, if not years, of neglect. 
Perished rubber indicating it had been left in the sun and not exercised \ rotated meant that the tyres were simply failing and disintegrating when under stress (like driving through mud).
It appears there have been systemic issues within the Russian armed forces that have led to these issues."

The Russian army(at least that is what the pro-ukrainina propaganda says) suffered way too many losses and wasted too much time. Ukrain should have been defeated until now. 

Another think that's mind blowing is why did Russian army din't bombed or hit with rochets stuff like: airports, communications centers, radar stations and oil storage facilities first. Even worse, why they are allowing weapons to flow from the west ? It's not like they can't see the transports from drones/satelite. 1-2 aircrafts could really stop the flow.  Russian army looks like an army of begginers and people who don't have much ideas about wining a conflic with minimal loses."
Putler is a shame of this century.
"Russian propaganda is awkward, silly, and poorly made. This is true with most of the products we receive from Russia.
Quality is not their forte."
"It's only been a week so there is no way you can know anything about anything happening over there.
As of today it doesn't look like failed anything from the Russian side.
You rightly said there is a lot of propaganda out there and you are not immune to it.
Maybe you are right, maybe you aren't, you don't know and neither does anyone else but Russia right now because all we get in the west is US/NATO/Ukranian propaganda at full volume and nothing at all from Russia or anywhere else that dissents from the US/NATO lead narrative.
Making every one of your sources suspect no matter how reliable you considered them prior to this.
You should keep this fact in mind when thinking you are getting any information from anywhere on the situation."

"Also Ukraine is not by all means a small country, I knew since the beginning that the extension of the territory would pose a major logistic struggle for an invading force. Instead of Blitzkrieg the shit out of Kiev with all its might, Putin following his ego organized a 3 flank invasion on the entire territory which is a logistic nightmare. Not only Russia can't win this war, but they will have even more struggles to occupy the territory and pacify it"

I'v very surprised that one of the biggest army's in the world don't have enough trucks I would have thought they would have had more trucks then tanks the Ural  4320 was first produced in 1976 and is  still in production...
"What happened to the 13/14 thousand people that died before Putin moved his army in? Why did Ukraine kill so many of their own in the east of their country? The problem now is we only see one side of the news because of the control the West has on digital media, including media that is via satellite. So many channels that were telling other parts of this story have been banned from the EU and some other countries. We all need to be able to access all channels, not just the BBC.CNN etc but all channels. Putin had his forces on the border of Ukraine for a long time. The build up was over months. The EU/US/UK did nothing about the problem with the Ukraine and Nato. The EU/US/UK did nothing about the civil war in the Ukraine where around 13/14 thousand died. They sat back and waiting for Putin to act. They wanted Putin to act because they were not interested in people dying in the Ukraine, they just wanted to get at Putin politicly using the media machine. This was an opportunity for the West to attack Putin himself, hence they left thousands to die before Putin order his forces in. I am not on either side of this conflict, I just want it to stop. Please access all data from all media outlets don't fall down agreeing with your own countries media and then find out about war crimes later. I can't remember the person's name who said this about the war in Iraq that lasted a generation, but it rings true today as well regarding the Ukraine. The Ukraine war will not be, ""the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning"". Please see watch and listen to all media outlets to understand why what is happening, is happening."

Putin should have said he was trying to spread freedom.
Its amazing how the Russians are both simultaneously failing at everything AND reducing all of Ukraines cities to rubble. Western propaganda is a helluva drug.

I am sorry ladies and gents - Russia hasnt even started yet and are moving quicker then Nazi Blitzkrieg

@J S Thanks for clearing that up.
I am surprised why Russians did not knock out the communication system of Ukraine in the first place.
You would consider the war ended? That be great.. I have not looked much into this but seems like lots have happend
"Definitely, the information war is so much different. Guarantee military strategists are looking at this as a new variable to how wars are fought nowadays."
The main reason is total ignoring of Russian interests by USA and NATO. Ukrain was sabotaging execution of Minsk agreement (15 feb 2015) for more than 7 years. First started sheling Lugansk few days before Russia started its operation. So west people should be thankfull to their politicians for that situation.
"The ghost of kiev shot down ANOTHER 679 Russian warplanes today. This makes a total 3853 bad Russian planes shot by the ghost, singlehandedly.

He then lands on a building rooftop and goes home to his wife.

"Unfortunately no matter how nicely this video is edited, the information provided is clearly one sided. Russian army is far from incapable and ineffective as it's being portrayed. 
It took the overpowered Nazi Germany a whole month to occupy Poland. Don't get me wrong here, I stand against on any sort of violence, especially war, and not taking anyone side on this. But listening to couch military experts here saying that Russian military was not prepared for this type of warfare is beyond naive."
add 'and Soviets'
Amazing video
what a joker 💀💀 Putin is such a Donald Trump. you can tell he acted emotionally. and not like a Real Man that knows when to properly start a war 💀💀 what an Rus incel lol
"The on thing the taught me about German high school regarding military tactics is that you don't invade Russia during Spring because the terrain is muddy and hell to navigate making it almost impossible to go off road and easily trapping troops. The same ist true for most of Eastern Europe including Ukraine.
You can see that problem with their big military convoy, that is stuck on the road every time one vehicle is held up because you cannot go of-road around them."
"@Percy Faith  The current special operation conducted by the Russian armed forces has no analogues in its scale since the Second World War. Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe (after Russia), its area is 603,549 square kilometers, officially the population is about 41 million people. 

For comparison, the area of Iraq is 437,072 square kilometers, the population in 1991 was about 17 million people. The American operation in Iraq ""Desert Storm"" lasted from January 17 to February 28, 1991 (43 days), despite the fact that basically the territory of Iraq is a desert with only 40 normal cities.
In Ukraine, it is almost a network of urban agglomerations of 450 cities, most with dense residential buildings, and this is the difficulty of conducting a special operation by the Russian armed forces. Russia does not cover peaceful cities with carpet bombing of strategic aviation, as the United States did in Iraq and the NATO coalition in Yugoslavia. During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, about 120 energy facilities and 140 civil infrastructure facilities, 89 factories and plants were destroyed. There is electricity and water in Kiev at the moment, filtration and pumping stations are not targets for the Russian army, strikes are carried out only on military facilities. 

In the cities of Mosul and Raqqa, American bomber aircraft wiped out entire neighborhoods so that the infantry supported by it could fulfill their tasks of suppressing enemy resistance, no one cared about civilian casualties. American politicians and journalists still expect that the Russian side is about to start using cluster munitions and vacuum bombs to intimidate the population.
It should be understood that on the day of the start of the special operation, there were 250,000 people in the Armed Forces, 145,000 personnel were in the ground forces in February 2022. About 2,800 tanks, 8,000 armored vehicles, 3,500 artillery systems, and 230 aircraft of various types were in service and at storage bases. In no other special operation of the modern Russian army has it been opposed by such a large enemy group and, of course, it will take time to grind it."
true the best books written on the analysis of the First World War were written while the first battles were being fought.....are humans the stupidest animals on Earth now?????
Lol. Nobody can confirm anything.
"Ukraine is a puppet of 🔺 the New World Order 🔺 . New World Order has something to lose in a much larger one, and Russia is fighting only for its very existence. As Rome fought against Carthage, not only for itself, as the Spartans fought not only for Greece, so Russia is fighting against the New World Order not only for itself, but for all people. Therefore, all suspicious actions from countries first activate the use of tactical nuclear weapons by Putin first. And then a nuclear weapon of full power and the destruction of the planet."

Putin tried a Blitzkrieg and failed
I donot think video represent actual issue . The earlier quick attack was all part of plan to disintegrate ukrain forces and keep the the fight to cities . Then the actual fight would now take place to capture cities . No one expected that russian would capture ukrain in intial 5 days.  Whaever we are interpreting is part of information warfare . Russian invasion is going as per plan thats what i feel.

"It's incorrect to compare Russian and Western logistics. Russia is waging a full-scale offensive war against another state where it is extremely difficult to organize logistics, NATO would have the same problems if it took part in a war of the same scale"
@partlycurrent =)))))
"""""Russia is waging a full-scale offensive war"" what are you saying, this is a special military operation, not a war!"
Its obvious that Ukraine had more intelligence and information about Russian logistics route. thanks to US and NATO surveillance.
"Nice job of totally ignoring the many very good reasons Russia has for this action. Without mention of the N*zi Azov Battalions, the 14,000 civilians killed by Ukraine’s military in the Donbas, the dozens of Western biolabs, massive Ukrainian government corruption, and the existential threat of Ukraine joining NATO, this report is weak."
Every mainstream news outlet about Russia is BS.
This whole video is based on the false assumption that Russia wants to occupy Ukraine. And does not cover our own military expansion towards the east. We must be very hungry for our own propaganda as we want this war with Russia to happen. Instead of having the realization that the only thing that couldve saved us from Chinese expansion was having Russia as our ally. We are done with.
wtf are you talking about Ukraine has fallen already in 10 days using only chechens and the cannon fodder material and army.
"Hard to believe that Russian military relies on maps and road signs. (I assume they also use compass and stars position to navigate?)  We are talking about 21st century military technology here, with the most advanced GPS system there is."
"GPS is an American system and the Russian army certainly does not use it, since they have developed their own (GLONASS) for a long time."

"i know its easy to missunder stand whats going on if you have no military background, for that reason i suggest you watch taskandpurpose reason why the army stopped outside of kyiv. he makes it clear and explains it better than my jarhead... head can.

i think the main reason it looks like this is because all the inexperienced fighters are being sent in first. theyre holding their actually troops in reserve.. because sure there was a bunch of incidents where the russian troops looked uncoordinated and green. but a few showed their actual troops. very coordinated and tactful. i think its a smoke screen."

Sitting in Kharkiv now - probably bombing civilian areas (like one I live in, I don't have a home basically) is just an attempts to push more people on the roads to distract supply lines.

It seems unbelievable that they would invade a country only using paper street maps
It does not seem that russians are struggling. They took half of the country and are close to take kiev.

"Some of this is misinterpreted for sure. Looting and pillaging would happen regardless, that's just how war is. Secondly, I believe their advancement is intentionally slow.

"This is not an American invasion. (Blow everything up, walk in) It's a Russian invasion to take the country intact. There is very little fighting going on because half of the Ukraine identifies as Russian."

The motivation so low for many of soldiers, also about 50-60% of them were taken to Ukraine without they knowing that (army commission sad they are going for training) and now they obligated to be there if they leave-> welcome to 20 years in prison.

But why the hell would they rely on paper maps?
"You fool. Everything you presented is almost correct. Except death and destruction is not Putin's goal. Failed logistic, though crucial, but not the end all be all, because surrounding and forcing surrender is the goal. And Putin doesn't want West Ukraine and part of Europe. He let their own social media hysteria destroy themselves. If Putin really wants to destroy Ukraine and then Europe, THEN NATO would have jumped in a heartbeat. But look, the West has not deployed into Ukraine yet. Zelensky cowardly been in Poland from the start. Putin and his cabinet have been toe to toe with the entire West for decades now, you think they are actually this stupid?

Russia can simply flatten kyiv... But what's the point? They need to make Ukraine to sign surrender.
But they will never surrender
"are the Russian military dumb? definitely not. most likely this whole war planning was kept secret by several people on the top. thus the logistic problem. this is to avoid people from the military insubordination. because if this plan is known beforehand, a lot of people in the russian military will reject this war. because they know the war will hurt Russia more than their enemy."
"I believe all of these weak-points are symptoms of a much larger, deeper issue in the Russian armed forces and society as a whole. All of these issues are a consequence of over-centralisation. Why are they over-centralising? Corruption and because Russia's leadership is TERRIFIED of it's own troops and population. They feel the need to keep every detail under tight supervision because they fear too much independence will lead to insurrection."

"This video was put together very well and it was very easy to understand. It does highlight one important thing as well. How Putin is lying that his ""Special Military Operation"" is going as plan and as you can see clearly from this video, its not going as well as he plans. He is going to fail and Ukraine is putting up such a big fight. I really hope that Ukraine comes out on top from this and put Putin in his place. Originally, Putin planned and anticipated that this invasion was going to take about 4 days. Reason for this was because his Kremlin ran media put a bulleting update out that said that Russia had successfully taken Ukraine, then it was removed very quickly because it was not a true fact. Another failed plan and lies that Putin put out. To me, Putin is a pathalogical lier and a dictator just like Kim Jong-un of North Korea."

The only way to stop this mess is to make it impossible for russia to maintain this war from an economical perspective. 
People, boycott any sort of collaboration with russia and push on international businesses still doing business there. Only complete isolation of that country can help to stop the loss of lives! Each days of delay costs dozens of lives of innocent people (literally)"

Look at the US, they will be Russia in its current state in 10 years if they don't start giving out some fucking free education"
"with this one-sided political shit your are the troll among thousands 24/7, do some bendover video about planes, ships what you can do better and do not mess around with topics you dont understand with your US mentality"
Your fucking talking from the nato perspective
"Putin is a democratically elected president, how dare you call him autocrat?"
It’s probably the last war putin started. His regime won’t survive this war.
"I'm astonished by the massive rusophobia in action imposed on us by our governments! I see millions of people across the globe getting really pissed off as our presidents are screwing us by supporting nazi Ukrainians and doing economical reset where we – ordinary people will be the only ones affected! But our governments don’t give a sh…t about us folks! People – we have the power! These dudes can mandate whatever they want from us and we are saying go and f…k yourselves. People of the World, aren’t you sick and tired watching this sh…t happening. Let’s stand up together as people of this World and say: We had enough of being told what to do by a few! We DO NOT WANT WAR WITH RUSSIA, we don’t want your pathetic sanctions because we will be the first one affected; we DO NOT WANT NAZI on our streets. We want peace and prosperity!"
"I don't get it.. ww2 soviet forces after '43 were the best in everything, best commanders, best troops, best equipment and on of top that largest ground forces in history that even the western allies were scared and Ike decided to stop or slow down to a designated meeting line before the red army steamrolled over their comparatively smaller armies by mistake, in '45 this monstrosity was confirmed when Stalin dispatched at random a marshal with a million troops (a mere 10% of his army btw) that blitzed Manchuria and Korea defeating 1,500,000 Japanese defenders at breakneck speed, something the western allies dreaded to do in China or Indonesia knowing how doggedly the Japanese defend, how on earth did they fall so far from that? even the US army had logistic complications in Iraq.. so how is it that 80 years ago larger less advanced armies covered continents largely on foot while in mortal danger saw logistics as their least concern than these smaller sissified forces nowadays?"
Do one on yemen
China have both military and logistic capability of USA and Russia
The World needs to take all weapons away from this sick country...
It isn't over. Ukraine will be properly fucked when this ends.
"Nothing has failed, it's still ongoing."
Excellent video as ever. Legend.
This extension of military might was made possible..... BY SKILLSHARE. Sorry it's a force of habit by now
It takes courage to stand up for Ukraine! Kudos to you!
Putin your coffins just about finished
Wow! This was so well made!!!
You have no soul
The Russians have learned absolutely nothing since Afghanistan.
Very good 👍
Ruck Fussia!
Why WAR in Ukraine is America fault? John Mearsheimer watch him on youtube its truth WAR could easily could be avoided making Ukraine baffer state?But America promote aggression and ignorance and provoke Russia instead of preventing WAR and possibility of NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION!
"no  Putin  a war sir, u are killing children and civilian, ruining lives in Ukrainian, letting rusian soildiers dead for what they know not. u r war criminal to be put on international war crime tribune"
The notion that Russia intended to complete the invasion of Ukraine in just a couple of days is pure NATO propaganda lol. Go to Real Life Lore for a more serious analysis of this conflict.
Beginning of WW3 AMINNNNNNNN
"Russia's reliance on trains for logistics is good news. If war with NATO is to happen, all we have to do is bomb their tracks. I don't see Russia winning even if they were to use nukes."
"The fact that you have to plug Nebula is proof that Alphabet/Google is, in fact, evil. Thanks for your content and fuck these oligarchs."
Impressive.
"Ahh Russia, forever the 🤡 of the world’s major armed forces."
Lets not get dew eyed over the Russian conscripts.Its they that are looting and threating civilians.
"I love how we are so nonchalant about, oh bombing middle Eastern countries. Those human lives don't mean anything to US, we don't control their capitalism. Yet, this is some kind of outrage... Until the population of the US wakes up to the fact that anything Russia can do has been eclipsed multiple times over by the US, I just don't care about the narrative. War is terrible, the US is even more so.
We just need to tell ourselves the truth!"
"That's what happens when a country invades another for the very first time, without real preparations"
"i'm very surprised 

growing up i was told again and again you should never provoke the bear but now it seems more like its more bark but no bite

it seems the bear has lost its teeth or maybe it never had them considering their history"
It's like powerful leader vs powerful country 😅😅😅😅😅
It took 5 and a half weeks for US troops to take Iraq
"Mr Putin, they're not sanctions. They're a ""special economic operation""."
Fantastic video. Thank you.
slava ukraini
Slava Ukraine.
Thanks for the good video!
"If it were me, since Russia launched a Special Military Action against me, I would return the favor and launch a Special Military Action against him by sending my air force across the borders and attack his main weakness. I would seek out and and destroy his locomotives. Tracks can be repaired fairly quickly, but locomotives are a different matter entirely. By doing so, I stretch his supply lines even farther back, making it that more difficult to feed and supply his invaders. Further, his air force now has to pull back a little to defend against my jets rather than firing at will at me on my home turf."
Putin has dead eyes.
"*ONE SIDED PROPAGANDA!*
4 minutes in and I've had enough of this obvious PROPAGANDA.

Nothing about the NATO bases in Ukraine which prompted all of this.

Nothing about how those bases were against Ukraine's constitution, thus US called the new bases ""training exercises"" which began in April of 2021.

Nothing about Putin objecting strongly to the US/NATO illegal bases and placing his forces directly opposite the US/NATO bases.

Nothing about the 2014 referendum in the Dunbas region of Ukraine, where its two regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, voted to leave Ukraine, and the referendums passed overwhelmingly, thus they formed the independent Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.

Nothing about Ukraine's refusal to respect these regions right to determine their government.

Nothing about Ukraine establishing a so called anti-terrorist force to attack the citizens of these two new breakaway republics, attacks which the citizens of Donetsk and Luhansk have suffered for 8 years.

Nothing about Putin giving a speech that lasted for hours talking about this and much more.

Nothing about Putin declaring that Russia is going to respect the results of the 2014 Donbas referendum and accept the two new independent People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Nothing about Putin announcing a mutual defence treaty between Russia and the two new Republics.

Nothing about Putin sending forces into the two new Republics because the Republics invited them in for protection from Ukraine.

Nothing about Putin warning Ukraine that if they send their forces into these new Republics there will be strong consequences.

Nothing about Ukraine then sending forces into these two new Republics, which Putin considered an invasion, promoting him to attack Ukraine.

Furthermore:
Nothing about entities in US pushing for sanctions against Russia in 2016, which the newly elected president, Trump, in 2017 stopped.

Nothing about 4 years of pressure from entities who wanted sanctions against Russia, inventing conspiracy theories about Russia.

Nothing about these anti-Russia sanctions efforts going cold by 2020.

Nothing about how the new president, Biden, in 2021, immediately after taking office, organized NATO forces to send into Ukraine, against Putin's strong protests.

Nothing about these ""training exercises"" obviously being there to push Putin into acting, to have something to revitalize their sanctions efforts.

Nothing about Putin being fully aware of their games and doing what it takes to make things right at his border, accepting that doing so will result in sanctions."
"@Dolorex  You're from Poland. I shouldn't have said your information is from CNN.
I should say your information is from TVN24.

I too am against imperialism. That's why I'm opposed to the repeated imperialistic actions of the US.

Yes, Russia did terrible evil against Poland in the past. And you might be upset now about the recent increase in the cost of natural gas from Russia 😡. I suggest you not let such things cloud your vision.

This current situation is the doings of the worst imperialists in the world with a long history of imperialism. A people whom are called the Cabal by some. People such as the Rothschild family, George Soros, etc. They are powerful, wealthy families and individuals who call themselves ""Ashkenazi Jews."" They are Yiddish speaking ""Jews"" who are not Abrahamic Jews.

Understand that in the early 1900's, before the Russian revolution, the Ashkenazi Cabal became powerful in Russia and Eastern Europe. Their arm of power there then was called the ""Jewish Labour Bund"" (bund is a Yiddish word meaning union or federation). These wealthy families became what was later simply called the ""oligarchy"" in that part of the world.

This whole thing is their manufactured excuse to impose sanctions against Russia because of Putin.

To make a long story short, Putin was one of them. They put him in control of Russia because Putin is as evil as they are. Then, Putin turned on them. Putin betrayed his imperialist Cabal oligarchy cohorts. He opposed all of their policies, all of their perverse ways. He toppled the power of their oligarchy in Russia.

What is Ironic is that Putin is a man of evil means. Thus the irony that only a man like Putin has what it takes to hold on to power in Russia while going against the greater evil of the Cabal, which had their people, the oligarchy, deeply entrenched in Russian power.

The Rothschild family refer to Putin openly as a ""traitor"" and they want to remove him from power.

The Ashkenazi Cabal replaced the legitimate President of Ukraine with one of their own. The current ""president"" of Ukraine is not just a puppet of the Cabal. He is a member of the Cabal.

Their weapon of choice is sanctions.The Cabal hopes that severe sanctions could result in Putin being taken out of office, replaced by one of their puppets who will obey them. Or worse, by one of their own.

If they succeed in getting Putin replaced, I guarantee you the person who replaces him will be lifted up in the press as a great leader, a visionary leader, revolutionary! TVN24 will call the new Russian leader a ""wspaniały mąż stanu!""

Nations will call for the lifting of sanctions.
The imperialists will have won. The history books will portray Putin as the evil president who was replaced by a great man.

P.S.
 I repeat, Ukraine's constitution absolutely forbids foreign bases in Ukraine. The president of Ukraine is NOT legally able to permit NATO bases in Ukraine."
"@Daniel English ok let me clarify my position. I hate imperialism in any of its forms, American as well. Nato has its problems for sure eg the fact that larger countries have more voting power. Nevertheless countries do have a choice i  joining Nato which should be respected. Russia's aggression on ukraine is in now way justified by the elusive thread of ""the west"", i see this just as a way to divert the attention from whats really at play which is the economic part. Nato sucks but it in no way justifies the actions taken by russia. Same way as nothing justifies the myriad of situations in which the us did similar things. Also Russia has previously deported the population of Krym and settled Russians in there, the Russian populated territories of Ukraine aren't there because Ukraine took them it was Russia that created the situation in the first place, later using it as justification for attacks."
"@Daniel English I've never watched cnn, I'm from Poland"
@Dolorex all you did was repeat CNN nonsense. I see you have no clue whatsoever as to what is going on there and have no thoughts of your own and only repeat what you hear on CNN. I see no point in debating with an automaton.
"@someone You said Ukraine can choose to have NATO forces in Ukraine. You're wrong again. Another failure where you imagined something instead of fact checking.

It's not a choice they can make. It's against their constitution. They have to amend their constitution if they wish to have NATO forces there. The president cannot legally just choose to do something against their constitution.

Also, it's simply hypocritical for the US to object to missiles in Cuba, stopping it with military force, then acting like Russia shouldn't be upset with NATO forces illegally in Ukraine."
Great
It's so weird to watch a history video about something that only happened last week. lol
EXCELLENT footage!
"l lets see ,what is the disinformation from the west,nato tryed to move into the ukraine,Putin being sensible stopped it"
"Just have a look at the American bases surrounding RUSSIA!!! There's maps out there. Search this ""us military bases around russia""."
"I have been wondering why Putin would decide to invade Ukraine now, instead of waiting  for Trump to get elected president again in three years, so that there would be no risk of NATO intervention? Perhaps Putin has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and he is in a hurry to fulfill his dream of reclaiming the territory of the USSR before he dies? Putin has been planning to restore the USSR ever since it dissolved in 1991. It is strange that he would suddenly lose his patience now, when he only has to wait another 3 years to get everything he wants from a second Trump presidential term."
Putin will never win this stupid and criminal war
"Russians could have done the American way: carpet bombing to the ground as they did in Baghdad for 40 days, then come in, strolling over the destruction with little problem to their tanks and trucks and no resistance. Mosul is another example of total devastation after continuously bombing and entering the city. I think 🤔 the Russians want to be the chivalry liberators like Christian Orthodox Templars of some sort, while the Americans are more like the John Wayne or Clint Eastwood type of cowboy, killing Indians or Latinos in their movies. If the Russians had bombed Kyiv to the ground as the Americans and British did in Berlin, the war would probably be over, and Zelensky would have been hanged upside down by the Ukrainians as it happened with Mussolini. Different approaches. Putin must learn with the Bush family. He is not the Bloody Vad. It's more like a sweet, old uncle. Far from Stalin, that let 40 million Ukrainians starve to death. NATO is also useless. Biden has authorized airstrikes from NATO countries, and Polland has already said that it will not do it. Are Europeans becoming softer or just weakling? Is the EU more interested in exterminating its population using the bioweapons they create and vaccination side effects? What's wrong with the world 🌎?"
intelligence
You should talk about the Chenchen war
"Does anyone know what the white ""Z"" and ""V"" markings on the russian vehicles stand for and why are the russians using Roman letters?"
I can already imagine the scenario where this is an HAI video and he just stuff as many Russian jokes as possible to add more fuck you's in the fuck you sandwich.
"COPE westerners, COPE"
"Failed logistics? Let's talk about years of Afghanistan and they did little to nothing to the taliban. 
This is western propaganda at it's best. ""oh they only reached the suburbs of their targets in a week lol so weak"", meanwhile the US bombs and cleans everything, civilian included to get to their targets and still takes them years. The reason they are making slow progress is because they do not want to destroy the country or it's people. If they wanted to, they could easily level Kiev to the ground and then take control ... of ruins. 
I don't understand how people can be so retarded to actually not realize this. 
I also don't understand how people think this is worse than NATO bombing Serbia, which bombs you could hear for months, from Romania, a long way from Serbia. Yet with cameras all over Kiev you can barely hear or see any ""bombing"".
Pathetic news coverage."
I’m so glad someone with a voice I can deal with made a video on this situation. I like this voice an the structure of the video! Great work an wonderful job on your channel.
Could Ukraine pilots fly into Russian air space and destroy the Russian railways? This would cripple the Russian supply lines at least for a while.
"Putin: ""I decided to conduct a special military operation"".( Meaning cluster bombing kindergartens and civilians, putting a nuclear powerplant on fire. My kind of fun.)  >:-("
"As a frequent audience of Wendover Productions, at 1:46 when he said ""this expansion of military might was made possible......"" my mind went into predictive mode and said ""by SKILLSHARE"" 😂😂😂"
@Kyle B glad I'm not alone 😂😁
Mine too :)
As I start watching I'm praying it's not paid for by the CIA
Didn’t fail. Not worth watching.
Okay russian bot
"This is the same irrelevant claptrap we heard during the Georgia 2008 war, despite the fact that Russian crushed the Georgian military in record time. This bad logistics narrative just the West's way of comforting it's impotence."
@Paul Cuckastein what commies? Lol
I absolutely don't agree that the Russian soldiers didn't know what they were doing. They may have been brainwashed but it really sounds like the Nazis during their war crime trials...
Great analysis. Hope fore more videos like this
"putins logic is diametrically in opposition of historical fact. Ukraine was ""russia"" before Russia even existed. It was the cradle of russian culture and civilization. So, by that logic Russia should be Ukrainian and Kiev should be the capital!! putin would be in jail, along with all of his other criminal cronies. Food for thought."
"You know it begs the question, they dedicated so much time and resources fixated on Ukraine, how does Putin see this as a win in the long run? Even if you completely overrun Ukraine's military, there will still be pockets of insurgency around the country. The amount of land to cover with military forces between both Ukraine and Russia is going to spread them out extremely thin. Sure they could ramp things up by expanding their military and building more infrastructure and equipment...but that costs time and money from a stable economy. With how the economy has been unhinged and flipped on its head, where does Putin expect to get the resources necessary to sustain his goals while keeping his desired ""empire"" afloat? Ukraine's people want nothing to do with him, and bit by bit his own people are realizing how asinine this entire plan of his really is. The further Putin commits to this whole thing, the more appetizing a ""French Revolution of 1789"" seems to be."
"@Makyura43  That statement you quoted affirms my point, not yours. NATO does not admit members with active territorial disputes. Ukraine has been ineligible from membership since 2014, a position which has been repeatedly affirmed by NATO leading up to the invasion and one which, as your quote correctly identifies, has not changed. Your final position does not make sense. Ukraine, as a NATO member, does not pose a unique threat to Russia. Ukraine would make a relatively small contribution to NATO’s military capacity, and offers little strategic advantage to NATO than is already had by Latvia and Estonia, which border Russia’s most populous regions. Ukraine on its own is not a threat, and if the threat is NATO, Russia should attack NATO. By attacking an independent state that has maintained its neutrality (no progress toward membership since 2008 according to your quote), how should Finland, Sweden, or Moldova act? If being independent sets them up to be invaded, why not join NATO? It saved Latvia, and being independent has done nothing for Ukraine."
"@KPro We reiterate the decision made at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process; we reaffirm all elements of that decision, as well as subsequent decisions, including that each partner will be judged on its own merits.  We stand firm in our support for Ukraine’s right to decide its own future and foreign policy course free from outside interference. 
Section 69 of NATO Brussels Summit.

Ukraine on its own do not represent threat to Russia but as a member of NATO it would. Latvia on another hand do not represent a threat even if it is member of NATO. Hope that makes more sense."
"@Makyura43 Ukraine would be a massive territorial gain for the Russian government, and would definitely help bolster their fangs towards NATO to back off...but to what end? Russia would be gaining land and resources, but giving up support and stability in the process. Russia cannot hope to build a stable and thriving infrastructure on territory where the people either leave to existing NATO countries, or stay and actively work against Russian authorities. Ukraine itself will not contribute to support Putin's empire, he is going to have to fork over mass amounts of his own resources to keep that ship afloat in the event he does take over Ukraine. That's going to spread him out thin and make him more vulnerable. He's walking on eggshells with this whole thing by showing how incompetent and impulsive the entire operation has really turned out to be. Putin and pals expected this to be a victory before the fighting even began. He expected Ukraine to be intimidated and to back down within Day 1 of announcing the invasion. Instead we're heading into 3 weeks, and Putin is on public display to the whole world with how ineffective his military/ diplomacy strategies have been against a weaker country that should have been a ""piece of cake"" to him. I don't see this as a LONG-TERM win for Putin. Wasting money and resources on a country that he's going to have to continue wasting even more money and resources to keep it, all while having to struggle with the economic + civil backlash back at home."
"@Makyura43 NATO announced that Ukraine could not seek membership owing to active territorial disputes in the Donbas and Crimea. NATO made no such “confirmation” that Ukraine would be exempt from that publicly stated and repeatedly affirmed position. So no, Ukraine was not joining NATO and nothing on the ground in the months leading up to Russia’s invasion suggested that would imminently change (and thus warrant an invasion). Your comment is self-contradictory: NATO is the problem, not Ukraine, but Russia will ignore NATO on its borders because the countries which are a part of NATO pose no “threat” to Russia? How exactly would Ukraine pose anywhere near a greater “threat” to Russia than NATO itself, as manifested by its member states along Russia’s borders? Ukraine is no threat compared to the massive, modern, and aggressive collective army of NATO. Ukraine additionally has no designs on Russian territory, and has even left Crimea in a stalemate since 2014 to preserve peace (hardly something a state which constitutes a “threat” would do, no?)"
What about the logistics of America’s invasion of Middle eastern countries
@bb1111116 true even though it lasted only 10 days almost one third of ukraine already under control of russia
"It took the US Coalition 6 weeks to conqueror Iraq in 2003. 
** I’m not in favor of the Ukraine War but this video talking about a failed invasion after a week seems like clickbait. I downvoted it."
"This is a very respectable video. Of course, the most horrible thing about this terrorist attack on the Ukraine by Russia, rife with various war crimes, is the senseless murder of civilians, and the displacement of over a million good citizens-more than can be said for Russian society, in general. (Navalny has basically called Russians ""cowards"",  and no one can blame him-they are brave when attacking civilians or arresting protesters.) Also surprising is Putin and his military regimes complete lack of insight into possible repercussions. They didn't think about worst case scenarios before invading another country? They didn't think ""what if we don't succeed?"" They didn't think of the response of the EU or the USA? They didn't think ""how will we do business with nations we threatened to drop nuclear weapons on'? The Russian military is out of touch with reality-they aren't the USSR anymore. The corruption is astounding: Russian enlisted soldiers having their pay stolen by ""professional"" soldiers; beating conscripts with shovels. Putin and his dreams of a USSR are both hated by the majority of humanity. Russians need to take responsibility for their government."

Fake Crap
"@Tipu Pakoro Ahh... even speaking gibberish, definitely a bot."
@Harvey Wilde Kia Ora mole.
Hello troll
"Guys, stories about Russia's failed logistics come from the Ukrainian secret service and are totally fake news."
@Bilegt B well they are not using their full extent because according to them they are liberators of they are so good then why are common Ukrainians resisting so hard and escaping to West shouldn't they welcome their Russian liberators with open arms
"@someone You obviously have no idea about modern warfare.  Initially, the United States took three weeks to occupy Baghdad, but it had a strategically valuable province to invade Iraq.  Second, the United States bombed the city and its citizens.  It was effective, but many civilians died.  Russia, meanwhile, is trying to inflict as little damage as possible on civilians.  If Russia had gone the same way as the United States, it would have already been able to take over.  Large supplies from allies also have a significant impact on defense.  But as I said, Ukraine is still enduring because Russia is not using its air force to the full extend. (I don't speak english and i will not bother replying to you)"
@Francisco Galárraga yeah it sounds like that I mean think about it america took 21 days to capture Baghdad which is about 10000 km away Russia on the other hand is like 380 km away from kyiv and has failed to capture it in 11 days  seems like logistics issues don't you think
@someone a third of Ukraine is controlled by Russia in less than two weeks. Does that sound like bad logistics to you.
He gave valid points and explained them   if you think you are better than him you should put forward your points too
You fall into propaganda so quickly. You crossed the line for me Wendover. Unsubing for the sake of principles I have.
Because optimizing logistics is a non-trivial mathematical problem for which even the U.S. Army in Iraq hired leading scientists from Berlin. 🤷
Another Russia is failing video. Yawn
So Russia is known for its capable on defence but not on offense
A bit soon to make such conclusions no?
No
This conflict goes back to when the wall fell. Gorbachev agreed to reunification of Germany in exchange for no more eastward expansion of NATO. Putin is a dictator but the west have done NOTHING to avert this crisis by continually provoking Russia. Imagine if Russia amassed forces on the US-Mexico border.
I don't think we have enough information to concretely say that there is any significant resistence other than handfuls of videos and Ukrainian ministry of defense.
Workers Party my A$$
"Viet name war : yeah we did that already, destroy fuel tank hahah"
"The incompetence of Russian military in this conflict so far both surprised and not surprised me. Not surprised because of how many of their equipments, networks, and mindset are outdated/ill-maintained/corrupted, but also surprised because I was under impression that during Syrian conflict they were the most capable entity in the war (afaik even Turkey -- a NATO member -- were riddled with more problems during their invasion/operation).

I think one of the most important factor that boggled them down really hard is that their military is simply not well-prepared and unmotivated for the conflict, as the war was sudden, has no proper casus belli, and I don't think most of their army are committed to actually kill their close neighbor. While yes, their artilleries/airstrikes/missiles killed people, so far their ground soldiers looks more like lost person rather than killing machine."
That was stunningly informative.  Puts network & cable to shame with their lame repetitions of the same twitter/youtube fodder that anyone can find online.  They need to fire their fat cat producers and hire you.

Great summary!"
"I have watched many insightful videos on this conflict, you're the first I've seen to focus on the logistics aspect which was very enjoyable to watch and informational."
"European nations collectively - not as NATO, but simply as civilised democracies, together with other countries throughout the world should send an International Army of ""peace keepers"" to drive the Russians out of Ukraine including Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea. And do it NOW. Putin needs to be humiliated and driven back to his own borders so that the Russian people can decide his fate. Putin is today's Hitler, and we know how long it took and how many countries were gobbled up before UK and France finally drew the line in Poland. Putin is a bully, plain and simple, and bullies always back down when their bluff is called. Neither the Ukrainians nor the Russians deserve Putin. WE MUST ACT TOGETHER AND WE MUST DO IT NOW."

I wonder who paid Wendover to make this video so soon and why it has been signal boosted so much after 2 days lmao

He tries to make it subtle but to a trained eye can be seen for what it is
Video mixes in actual facts about importance of logistics with completely made up stories and propaganda from the West
Contrary to popular opinion but neither you or other Western ""experts"" know the plans and strategy for the Ukraine invasion
Making up grand narratives and tall tails that Russia failed to reach my made up goals is weak
Using twitter as a source is really foolish right now. That thing is inundated with wall to wall lies and propaganda from biased sources. There is a very real psyop going on

2 week old conflict and Wendover is already making grand assessments based on threads from so called military experts with a blue check marks
Very same ones that said the Taliban would never take Kabul, lol
Incompetent Russian military and people is one of the oldest critiques in the book employed by the CIA/NSA/ Pentagon and State Department
Reminder, look through Wendover channel archive. No videos about America/NATO's colossal failure in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Afghanistan etc


Still waiting for him to get to those and upload them, For some strange reason don't imagine we will ever see them

Why? Because he is a shill for the West and not some objective and independent reporter
Purpose is to increase Fear Uncertainty Doubt and to condemn Russia compared to the big brained and holier than thou West
Any one who disagrees with this video is paid Putin shill and tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist  lol"
Agreed with your take.
Helo bot. Also TL;DR
Let’s be honest…Russia is a third world country that just happens to have nukes…
Thank you for this video. Love your content and have been struggling to understand a lot of this conflict amid lots of different sources. Keep it up

Wow 🤣🤣🤣
"Nobody is a medical expert anymore, but geopolitical XD"
russian army head for logistics was executed last saturday.  the reason why the convoy to kyiv is still grounded to a halt is bcuz of insubordination by some junior officers refusing to advance.  and no one in the russian army was willing to takeover the command for logistics.
"Interesting, if true.  Source for this?"
I recommend that people go to RT’s YouTube channel and flag any pro war video rightfully so as promoting terrorism. The more videos flagged the more they will be taken down and the closer to getting RT removed from YouTube.
Who is RT
"Wow, that is the best summary of the war to date I've seen.  Very thorough and it explained what's been happening in great detail."

"Russia has an impressive army, which it ferries around on it's internal rail network and park in army barracks. It has an impressive air force, which flies in front of Russia Today cameras rather spectacularly. It has an impressive navy, which either sits a decade in refit or is escorted by tugboats whenever it has to go anywhere.
Any countries can acquire an impressive military, if all it does is appear on state sponsored national television."
@Watashi Wa ask ANYBODY at random if you do not believe me.
@Rab Smith never heard of Russia vs Nazis. Look who's talking about false claims.
"@Watashi Wa no, YOU are. Nazi versus Russia was the biggest single land battle in all History, far bigger than anything recent like Desert Storm. Your claims that the Russians of WW2  were a bunch of un-armed peasants are completely false and unfounded."
"@Rab Smith and what is the point of shooting deadman's layer? If you wanna count that as achievement - go ahead. Also, there were no russian shells since russia didn't exist. So ur basically saying that nobody shelled Hitler's bunker?"

"Biden claims to care about the mass murder of Ukrainians in their own sovereign country. Yet he still refuses to stop buying Russian oil, which is fueling Putin's War against these innocent people.

In fact, anti-American Joe is currently working with Putin to broker a deal with Iran, which will guarantee these iternational terrorists a nuclear weapon within a decade, just as Obama was working on. And we all know how they have been promising for decades how they will wipe Israel and the US off of the face of the map when they do.

Biden also refuses to open up oil pipelines or granting drilling rights on public lands so we can become energy independent as we were under President Trump's Administration, indeed selling our surplus to the world. But instead, on his first day of office, Joe opened up Russia's oil pipeline so they could sell to the world, thus funding the slaughter of innocents to expand Putin's agenda of reviving the USSR."
"It's fascinating to see the NPCs watch a video with random plays on ""facts"" and then convince themselves that OF COURSE it's a failed invasion. Such a failure that nobody has stopped it.

When you need a warning to start off your comments section, you very well know this is rehearsed propaganda."
This video is good but its missing a whole lot of war crimes.

Apparently it is... I find out at the end of the video... But when I searched for Wendover on Watch Nebula I got nothing. 😬
maybe it's all a jebaite monkaS
Stand with Ukraine
wrong information.. No Country provides a right data on its battlefield.. Russia is using all old weapons and going to test its new Weapons once NATO + US are going to invovle.. Thats the reason.... US is working behind like a dog.... NATO knows they will be first to get hit..
"""Old weapons!"" T-80BVM (2017), T-72B3 (2016), Su-34 (2014), Su-30SM (2012). All are there, all are burning. You insult your own servicemen pretending they aren't."

Lol putin has got his work cut out for him!
Probably the most insightful video I have seen so far on this war. The fact you have managed to find/get all those clips is truly amazing. I think the main stream media and intelligence services can learn a thing or two from you. Keep up the good work.

tbh this is some clone wars type shit
The Russian Army is not only up against the military resources of the West but rather the entire economic might of the West. This is a no-win situation for Putin and the Kremlin leaders.
SAINT JOSEPH TERROR OF DEMONS PRAY FOR US .
Pls. Pray the Rosary and Devine Mercy Chaplet for Russia and Ukraine.Pls. pray for peace on all families and home. . . .
So the Russian military is bascially run with the soviet/communist mindset that they were 30 years ago.  It was piss poor planning then just like now
Wendover Drinking Game! Take a shot every time he says logistics
No
Dude this is a mess tbh..
"Looks, like everybody is an expert on warfare, why don't you criticize US invasion under false pretense of Iraq, Afghanistan and others. Why don't you look deeper at the whole picture. As always American ignorance and USA world domination. Ukrainian government right now, is in fact puppet regime of US."
No ones saying Russia doesn’t have have a good reason to invade.. we just saying their invasion right now kinda sucks. Video seems to be saying they could be doing a better job of invading.
"without nuke russia would be comparable to iraq in military capability. Where is russia air force? they dont seem to be much of a factor in the conflict. If they are afraid to lose there aircraft to ground fire they got no business starting wars. The americans lost 10,000 aircraft during the vietnam war, they werent holding back. 
Russia needs to finish the war or retreat, the longer it last the more people will be injured and still no victory."
"So to summarize a very through military analysis of the Russian Invasion into Ukraine, basically, Putin ""Jumped the shark""!"
The Russians are having a great batting average of their used to taking out small specks of land like the Crimea and Georgia which are about the size of a raccoons bottom and the Afghanistan give them a run for their money and now I think Ukraine's going to be their new Afghanistan
"You're talking non sens. In Ukraine, the Russians are only Kontrakti... Professionnal soldiers. 😁"
"this aint ur average war from the 1940s..  the internet, social media, and computer hackers can make things highly more difficult to win."

Russia is liberating Ukraine just like the US liberated the middle east
Good video.

Its facinating to see how information spreads in war now with the advent of social media and smartphones. Imagine how insanely different WWII would have been if this amount of near immediate information was available for all to see.
"What is interesting thought it's the fact we all place our selves in a ""bubble"" and effectively isolate our thoughts the same way some one without internet would have done so.

For example, myself. As open minded as  i want to be and as much factors I want to consider, this seems like an invasio that should not be happening. And I understand there are also legitimate reasons why Russia may not want Ukraine to join nato. But regardless how many comments I read, they will not change my mind.

@Harvey Wilde  because YouTube let's me know when vids come out :) just popped in to help the analytics.
They why are you commenting on YouTube
Somebody wants to play Omniscient. They don't get it.
Putin THOUGHT
Invasion of the Ukrainian plains repeatedly had proven a hard lesson in logistics. Putin is learning that now.
This coverage is not aging well.
"Video has many truths! We are having no fuel! Five days no food! Sergeant says ""be patient, is coming soon"" and gives to us ""lemon snow cone."" Taste is horrible! Sorry for bad english."
God bless ye sir. Those lemon snow cones from what I heard are worse than even the DMT elves cooking you as their main dish. Watch out man they’re in the trees.
Even if the Russians win this war they are going to lose way too many soldiers and their economy will be destroyed by nato and the rest of the world
"The CuriosityStream + Nebula bundle is unfair  , I bought the CuriosityStream alone for 14.99 and now is not giving me access to Nebula"
This video is not gonna age well🤣 did you forget about Soviet doctrine.
"I would like to see a Wendover Production of how the Ukrainian Army, (or one like it), manages its logistics.  A static defense has different problems and different solutions.

Also, what logistics problems are the Ukrainian civilians encountering, and how are they solving those problems?"
"@Ztack Do I win an award, or do you?"
Russian bot spotted
Awesome video.
"Awesome video.  I tried to tell people that Russia would have issues with logistics just like Iraq.  I hope US combat arms officers are paying attention. Infantry Wins Battles, Logistics Wins Wars"
You claim they are failing yet they keep conquering land almost every hour. Isn't that strange?
"If you followed their operations in Syria you would know this is how they operate. It is not a logistic failure. If they were failing, US wouldn't be planning to evacuate Zelensky. How many of you people even know that one the negotiators that went with the Ukrainian delegations has be assassinated? A lot of stuff is going on that they aren't reporting."
@Michael Osei well there are videos of the army looting stores and tanks running out of fuel they prove that they are having logistic issues note I am not telling Russian  is weak or something I just think they seriously underestimated ukranians
Well they asked him on day 1 when everybody thought Russia will win logistics issues became evident after day 2
Please try next time to pronounce local names right
Well no one cares
"""Resistance is mine🇺🇦!"" 
- sayeth the Lord👼✝️!"
"Classic example of amutures care about tactics, professionals care about logistics"
Which of the two care about grammar?
"TL:DR they expected Ukraine to surrender without a fight, and now they're in a war they didn't prepare for"
"Who said Russia had a logistic failures? They took over Ukraine's airspace in hours and took over airports to start bringing in supplies. The demilitarization  is over 75% done as of today and 60,000 Ukrainian troop have surrounded in eastern Ukraine. They have taken over 40% of Ukraine's land as of today with minimal civilian casualties. I suspect the reason why people think this is true is the 40mile convoy not moving in days. It's likely the are going to patrol eastern Ukraine even after the conflict is over. Anyone who followed their operations in Africa and Syria would understand what they are doing now and how the operate. The way their army operate might look dull and failing but don't be deceived, they know what they are doing.  The idea that Ukrainians resisted is a joke. Zelensky wouldn't have handed guns the civilians on the second day and releasing prisoners if they were making any progress. The only thing Russia have been doing is evacuating civilians which have been held by Neo-Nazi Azov Battalion and the cities have less than 2 days of food supply. They are using them as human shields. There has been rumors that Ukraine is going to be split into two which is reasonable because Russian troops  surrounded Kiev about 5days ago yet they haven't invade. Also, the Ukrainian and the Azov guy that are surrendering are being sent to western Ukraine. Most of the stuff people have been showing on social media as logistic failures are not true."
Mehh... Too Long Didn't Read.
Putin taped his speech so he was probably asleep when he sent the Russian troops to war
Of course the western imperialist nations have invasion logistics down. Decades of experience.
Russia had the capabilities. But they did very poor planning.
Nice documentary
"This was very thorough, but did rely on a lot of assumptions mostly backed by western ""analysts"" or popular opinion 
Mainly that 1. Russia wanted a 1-3 day seize 2. Russian supply woes were unexpected to them and 3. Russia is fighting only with antiquated gear cus whatever reason 

Boiling down their original plan to ""let's bum rush Kiev and overthrow govt"" is such a poor conclusion 

I truly hope for the best for Ukraine and it's brave men and women who are fighting. Simplifying their enemy down and downplaying the massive threat they are under is a huge disservice to them. 
Maybe I misunderstood your main points, purpose and title of the video, but yeah. Stay strong Ukraine."
"Russian troops don't want to be there. Their moral is zero. Compared to Ukraine's, who are fighting with everything they have since they have no other choice."
"The attack is only a week old, logical problems are normal for an invasion of this size. In the south is actually highly sucessful."
"This is just so stupid and senseless,  no one owns land it al belongs to God!! Does putin think he gets to live forever? God bless  all these innocent  people 🙏"

"“Failed logistics”? 
What failed logistics? 
Russia’s military is doing just fine. Now, if the Ukrainians would only stop shelling their own people, and blaming it on Russians, that would be nice."
"For those that wanted to help, but did not want to start World War 3 and bring weapons into the country. Bring them in bulldozers, and bucket loaders. These can be used to dig trenches, to dig tank traps,( huge ditches covered with brush for the tank will fall in it and be stuck there), and fortify, and build cover for your Frontline, etc. Like the molotov cocktail, it's a very good weapon, that's not a weapon at all."
"Ukrainian American here, it’s not the Russians fault. Putin wanted war, not the Russians. Better dead than red."
Thank you for a great video. I found it very informative
Wow 3 milllion  in a day
Ukraine really needs to go after that rail network. I'd imagine just a handful of bomb-laden planes could wreak absolute havoc within Russian territory and pretty quickly turn the tides.
"@clrum Alternatively, I wonder if sending saboteurs inside the country to just use simple explosives, or using railroad unzippers would be viable. After all, Russia's original plan for Ukraine involved quite a lot of saboteurs inside the country helping to make a quick easy takeover."
Arming civilians with molotov cocktails seems like a bad idea to me? Why turn an innocent population into legal combatants?
Cause better a molotov than a sharp stick if you want to defend your town I guess.
"""relayed solely on paper maps..."". Ok, you've been heard ;-) Omg, what a rave..."
Great video
All this and the West let it happen.
BLYAT PUTIN
"I’m Russian and it’s absolutely heart breaking looking all this madness. All my protest, open letters, petitions didn’t help to prevent this catastrophe. None of my friends support this bloody mess. People are protesting and get beaten by police.  I wish Ukrainians to stay strong and win this war. Fuck putin! Fuck this war!"
I've been crawling Russian YT channels and all the comments are just heartbreaking. I myself cried multiple times over this and I'm half a world a way from this conflict. Take solace that you at least tried something. Seems like most of the world has been sleeping on this. It's difficult knowing the sanctions are going to be affecting so many people that are completely innocent in all this. Take care and stay safe over there.
Your narration sounds like a bedtime story. ☝
"Fantasic video (as usual, sorry, it really is ""usual"" :) ... why not go into Russian Army Culture, including the girls holding the special fruitcakes for units when they leave?"
"Those Russians trying to use that rail system to move vital supplies to their troops, that wasn't very well-thought-out. Am I the only one, that could easily just jog down to the beginning of their quite incompetent trip, to where they started their Convoy of train Cars, and ever so silently, and simply, blow up a few of the Rails, or remove one side. You can lay something over the track to derail a train, you could pull all the Fasteners from one rail and then put it back in place. You could derail a train quietly and silently, quite easily. This would cripple their link of supplies, food, fuel, everything they needed to make war on Ukraine, and this would be a huge blow to rushduh, by doing nothing more than removing some Fasteners on a train Rail. Even better, you can pull one rail off of one side anywhere in the train system, derailing and making a pileup of surplus Russian tanks, ammo, food, fuel, you name it."

"Russia's lack of establishment of early air superiority is a big question in a lot of minds. Surprised this was overlooked. The U.S. made sure to establish it before invading Iraq. And when the U.S. did invade, their armor units decimated Iraq's tank units at night, using superior tactics and nigh vision technology. The Russians also seem to be lacking these tools. They look like a 3rd world country out there, but the unfortunate facts are that they still have a huge nuclear arsenal, so while NATO is obviously thinking they could easily handle the Russians, they can do nothing but sit and watch for fear of nuclear Armageddon if they respond."
"@Jon by the way, the new peace parameters 'suggested' by zelensky today is LITERALLY word for word, item number 2 on Putins demand for a cease fire that he made last week."
"@Jon and also, dont forget, I said they will be waiting. In fact, I said Kyiv itself will likely be last because its not that important as military target at this point. I never said when either. That said, there is just insane amounts of contradictory and absurd information coming from media all over the place one can really just believe whatever they want"
@Jon I would like to know if (like charlie sheen) is Ukraine tired of winning all the time yet?
"@Jon SURE! because like I said orginally, they are waiting, they are encircling, which is...EXACTLY what hapened"
@SEANMCAD So did you wanna reconvene to discuss the success of that long convoy that was supposed to take Kyiv yet or naw?

"@Michael Osei 'Almost' isn't good enough Michael. Ask the Germans who reached the suburbs of Moscow in '41, or the bank of the Volga in Stalingrad in '42.

In the West they don't need to threaten anybody with prison to report only good news, or say only nice things. It's human nature to see the things you want to see - but this video is rational and not Russophobic, it's not saying Russia will lose - only foolish people think that. The video is saying that Russia is having trouble keeping their vehicles fueled.

For invading Ukraine it's a minor inconvenience - if they were fighting the USA/NATO (who don't want to fight Russia) this enormous traffic jam would be the world's largest graveyard ... It is all so pointless - nobody wants this, but Putin did it and now he says 'SEE?! I told you they were against us'. 

We aren't against you - dangerous warmongers like Vlad  make people nervous; we don't hate Russians (we'd rather not care). McDonald's wants to sell you Big Macs, and I want cheap Russian fuel in my car and for everyone to feel happy. Putin is the liar - he has turned people like you against people like us, and we're dying about it, but he screws models on his zillion-$ mega-yacht, while Russians starve and get blown to pieces in a war he made because of a lie."
"@Michael Osei You're missing the point perhaps - if Russia was fighting a proper military this 'special operation' would've been over last week. Putin wants to project an image of strength, but this performance makes his army look like a basket case that would struggle to overrun Ukraine even if there was no real resistance."
No surprises about the failed logistical support from Russia.
"The Russian supply system doesn't ask you what you need, it just tells you what your getting; this is the same way that Soviet industry operated. They made 100 of everything and had stockpiles of supplies that were never needed. Now look at a capitalist supply system, we ask you what you need and then give it to you. If the Russian government can't meets the needs of their people, how can they possibly keep up with a moving Army?"
"On December 5, 1994 the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Britain and the United States signed a memorandum to provide Ukraine with security assurances in connection with its accession to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state. The four parties signed the memorandum, containing a preamble and six paragraphs. The memorandum reads as follows:"
Thank-you.  This video is very informative.  I was wondering why that huge convoy stopped.  Their delays generated a lot of discussion around no-fly zones.  Then I was wondering if Putin was calculating that having his convoy out there as sitting ducks could be an invitation/provocation for the west and Nato forces.  So they would be pushed to intervene and then Putin could nuke us all.  Glad to hear that there's a rational explanation for this.
"A huge underestimation of the people of Ukraine and leader, the Presidents ability to defend his country. Good job Volodymyr Zelenskyy !! You inspire the world. We will feed and arm your military. You will WIN. Putin is wrong and his invasion and attack on Ukraine is a crime in the worlds eyes and he should pay for that. He himself is responsible for a lot death. If that doesn't piss you off you aren't humane."
"I saw Russia as the second best military power in the world and as my top dog in the east. But this was just embarrassing they focused of missiles which hard hit their targets and if they did they didn't detonate 40% of the time. They are relying too heavily on their reputation as a power nation, yet the only thing they have is that they own nuclear weapons. What if they create a weapon that can stop any missile, their whole deal becomes useless? From attack a nation out of the blue and soldier who are not well equipped and do not know what exactly they are fighting for, to Putin talking all this smack about Ukraine, currently Russia is all talks they dependent too much on their reputation than actually maintaining it."

"Best to face the Russian terrorist state with crushing sanctions and advanced US/EU weapons and full international financial support along with tactical guerrilla warfare. Economics broke the Soviet empire, it can break Putin’s."

this is true
This video was a masterpiece. Thank you for your work
"its beautiful how bad russians military is, a complete hoax. Just utter shit :D"
Failed? They’ve taken all of eastern Ukraine?

Great video as usual @Wendover Productions. Love your  breakdowns. Could you do a similar logistics focused summary of a few other recent wars ? I'm sure many would love that. You can even make it into  a series. Thanks for all the effort you put in to produce this high level of quality work

"Everything you said is wrong. The point of Russia is the demilitarization not just to take the land. They’re destroying military targets all over the country it takes time, they didn’t just blindly went all in. I’m not with Russia but we should stop with this delusion."
Putin has a small p p
"Why is it 'failed' ? 
This is not American total destruction of everything that moves and stands. 
This is not American logistics of absolute anhialation of everything human, social and good. From a safe and cowardly distance using rockets and air bombing and chemicals. The American Way and MO.
Russia is not out to maim and kill for the sake of it.
Keeping civilians out of it all. Keeping the infrastructure in one piece.
Kicking out the American, EU, NATO puppets and US Bankster Oligarchs is the idea.
Keeping the Western corridor open for the American Mercenaries and NAZties to run away along.
That is not 'failed' anything.
Keep fool American Bragging for April."

"As an ex infantryman and logistician I'm shocked how badly planned this ""special operations"" is. Great for the Ukrainians. It's true that your army is only as good as you logistics. Pointless have all that kit if you can't deploy them and bring them to bear. Lots of Russian generals are going to be ""sacked""."
Why is Ukraine losing then mate
Thanks for this video!
"Great information, except for the last part, which was self-serving bullshit."
"I am sorry mate; you have 0 idea what you're talking about - nor have you studied previous communist wars.
The russians attack as a spearhead ; they push with their lowest rank infantery until they meet medium resistance (if low resistance they will push thru); then they try to push thru, if proven difficult, they retreat and encompass the target; turn up the heat using siege weapons then wait; 
Its idiotic to say ""oh putin failed cause he didnt get kiev in a day""; wars arent won in a day;
Also, please do your research on the Ukrainian government as they are filled with neo-nazi's ex c14 and azov members;

DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH."
"I sure hope we’re right here, but I keep thinking of Germany in Belgium in 1914. Things looked good for Belgium for a week, but the Germans just brought out bigger and bigger guns until they could blast their way through. As for logistics, it’s normal for maneuver elements to outrun their logistics in the first phases of an offensive. Combat leaders are taught to seize opportunities even if they weren’t in the original plan, and to prioritize forward movement over everything. So color me not quite ready to celebrate."
"I mean, ""We ran out of fuel, no, we don't know where we are"" doesn't exactly strike me as initiative. 
I do kinda agree though. It's much too early to celebrate. 
That said, I have very little confidence in the Russian logistics train at this point, and whilst they un-fuck themselves it's only giving the Ukrainians more time to organise the defence and an insurgency if/when they're militarily defeated."
WHAT ABOUT THREE SWORDS EXERCISE BY USA IN JULY 2021?
Cuz there using chinese tires!!!!🤣🤣🤣
"I'm thinking if I am forced outta my home,  perhaps leaving a dump is a spicey goodbye."
America would have the same problem with logistics if we fight Russia.
"@James Vollan Vladivostok is very close to Alaska/Japan/South Korea. 
And NATO exists as a staging area for an attack from the west as well. No real issue except for getting deep past the Urals and Siberia."
"@Horizontalvertigo   Simple, we have very long supply lines while Russia wud be very close to home.  We end ships that have to travel a long way to retrieve military assets that are spread over the world."
I don't see how.
YouTube unsubscribed me from your channel without my consent or knowledge. Just a heads up.
"I wonder if there is more going on behind the scenes in this war, it will be interesting to see how this plays out."
Fuck YouTube and Google for their censorship.
Bring Ukrainian refuges to the USA; they are the right kind.
"EU is not the reason behind Ukraine war

EU is not the reason behind any WORLD WARS happened so far

EU never trained Ukraine army against Russia

EU never supplied military equipment to innocent civilians to fight on WARS

EU never involved in any war across the globe and never killed innocent civilians

EU never involved in other country’s politics and never toppled any government in the world


EU countries never colonized any independent countries in the world (Past 500 Years)

EU countries never looted any independent countries


EU and NATO are for Peace

EU and NATO leaders never speak provocative words

EU and NATO are certainly not a modern Soviet Union with the intension of expansion

EU is always innocent and has no hidden political agenda


God, please save EU and actor Zelensky."
Bring the Ukrainian refugees to the USA; they are the kind we need.
"Just as a side-note! Pipelines are even easier to BLOW UP than ""trucks"" and ""convoys"" - much more difficult to keep secure, and much more difficult to REPAIR once blown - even with all the protection they might get, so ""putting down a pipeline"" is sure as hell no ""solution"" for making troops advance."
@digimaks cope harder daddy
"@linc02 Hello, Putin. I assume this is your alt account?"
@Seth Tucker Exactly right. Some people have such a problem with simple comprehension...
"@digimaks The images are an example showing that the Russian army has the equipment to lay pipelines. The video was extremely clear that they haven't laid any pipelines yet, it's just a capability that they have. 

So, yes, they are still getting supplied by trucks, which is the whole problem."
@linc02 Russia will lose. Go cry to putin yea?
We shortwave radio enthusiasts have been listening for anything out of Ukraine. So far all we've been getting is the Russians jamming the Ukrainian stations they can't shut down.
Because you know you're publidhing fake news. Wake up the world is woke against western propaganda
Can't Russia acquire more trucks through Lend-Lease?
Fake news 😆😆😆 this propaganda has failed thats why you're too quick to put a disclaimer 🙄
Long live Ukrainian
If Russia wanted to kill Ukrainians they'd have done it on 3 hours. Lets be real. Its neo nazists putting civilians on the forefronts but good for them theyve started running to Russia. Stop the foolery media 🙄
Cope
"The propaganda in this video is absolutely legendary! The narrator leaves out the simple fact of what caused all this madness and suffering in the first place. 
NWO"
The United states should have never removed all of the rails. The government should have bought them. Of course we do have the ability to toss them back down but it takes time and we have no real fear from our border nations.
"I dont like what putin did but Zelensky isnt a hero as well, hes a damn war criminal hes using his people as human shields, read what the Ukrainian army is doing to the Non Ukrainians stuck in Ukraine trying to escape"
"Ukraine must learn from neutral countries like Austria and Finland. There is a way to be prosperous  
without having nuclear weapons or being part of NATO or harassing your own national minorities.
Russia wants you to be like that. The mad west wants you to be NATO. Think about it."
Why won’t joe Biden let us fight
"“It all happened so quickly…”

Uhhhh…"
"SUNFLOWERS. I love the woman who offered the russian soldier seeds to eat, so that flowers will grow in her country when he dies in her country.  Woah.  She told him exactly that."
"Ukrainians F up, no NATO means noooo NATO."
putin is the Wicked Witch and his young people have the water bucket ........peace must come from within this time
"What’s the video at 16:55? I can’t find anything with that username, nor any video of “large explosion.” Is that a thermobaric bomb? Some sort of fuel/energy plant?"
Wow! Excellent report. This would inspire all Ukrainians.
"He sent his troops to Ukraine to eat,drink and Get laid."
It all happened so quickly the 10k + soldiers ariving at the border per day for weeks waiting for the Olympics to end. That's not my definition of quick.
"My fear is Putin being left with two choices... retreat with his tail between his legs, or double down with nukes... it all depends on how psycho he is"
Thank-you for being on the side of the Truth!
Thank you for streaming this to my YT or I wouldn't know the truth.  Im sharing on my FB.. Although they are cencering me. Yeah little old lady me.. Who hardly has anyone commenting or even seeing her FB.. They are censor me so my comments on a YT channel
Really? Putin's forces are killing Ukrainians and destroying Ukraine.
"Vladimir Putin, Adolf Hitler, along with Joe Biden. What do these three have in common?"
I wouldn't want to have a drink with any of them?
"Vladimir Putin, Adolf Hitler, along with Joe Biden. What do these three have in common?"
It’s likely they’re just the conscripts the least experienced and newest personnel while they build more FOBs for their more experienced troops to join the fight
What of the VDV?
ROFL! BS!
Putin is dying that’s why he started this.
loved the channel!
"Don't worry, Joke Briben and Kackala 'Heels-Up' Harris have promised they'd stop the invasion by that disgusting thug Putin and that they'd honor the millions of dollars in bribes the Ukrainians oligarchs paid to the drug-addicted sleazebag Joke Briben's son Hunter... Oh the invasion happened anyway? I guess the Russians, barbaric as they are, weren't very much intimidated by the Demoturd speech on 'systemic racism', gender wage gaps and preferred pronouns."
This is going to blow up in Putin's face. I just hope he doesn't go off the rails when his failures become clear.
This invasion was made possible by skillshare
"Bruh I fucking wheezed.

Putin: This invasion was made possible by Skillshare: learn how to do logistics better than us for 10% off by following the link in the description.

Comment is gold."
👎🏼🇺🇦
"The reality is that nobody is looking at the full picture. The majority of people in the comments are treating war like a sporting match and only seeing what confirms a preexisting point of view. 

This situation has been brewing for 50+ years. There are many valid points from each prospective. Unfortunately, the people who have been minimized in any stage of this buildup are the Ukrainians. The US was determined to have a government loyal to the US, the EU wanted to leave them waiting in limbo until a more convenient time. There has been division within Ukraine as to what the people actually want.

Meanwhile not only was the US constantly sending weapons to Ukraine for their defense, Congress impeached the former president for a brief delay in of a single shipment out of hundreds. 

There are lots of reasons for lots of people to think one side has been perfect throughout the situation. 

The reality is nobody has come up with anything the people of Ukraine did to justify what is happening. The US, Russia, China, and NATO have all been playing proxy wars since before and including Vietnam and Korea. This is a collective OUR FAULT and the people of Ukraine are paying the ultimate price. 

When you are done accepting that reality, start looking around the world at other regions facing the same reality as the Ukrainians. US weapons and minimal support to the side of a conflict we prefer to win 

I'm not so quick to brag about our logistics when we are funneling weapons into several of these proxy wars with no long term strategy other than having a reason to keep defense contractors busy enough to make their next quarterly profit numbers."
"How was Ukraine made a US puppet state? You're writing a lot of paragraphs, so, explain your position if you actually believe it."
Bunch of forever drunk war criminals is on the R***ia side and yet people is still wondering why did this garbage's logisctics severely failed. Wow.
"Hey, at least we can all participate in a war of our own.... Behold the Russian propaganda bots!"
Wow.  Great video.  Very thorough.  Thanks 🙏🏻
"It looks like Russia is fxcked. Welcome to Afghanistan 2.0. Ukraine is a new Russian grave yard.
It only takes 1 brave Russian man to end it all."
"you actually missed few crucial informations.

First of all, on the east border of Ukraine, and on the south border, near Crimea, oil was discovered.
It just happens, that Crimea was annexed by russia in 2014, and on the east border, russia created puppet countries on Ukraine terrain. 

This is a war for oil. Ukriane is crucial for russia for multiple reasons.
1) Independant Ukraine, allied with west, is a threat to russian oil export. Oil deposits discovered in Ukraine, they are big enough for Ukraine to compete with Russia. Russian domination in oil market would be contested if Ukraine were independant.
2) From military perspective, It would be easy for NATO to potentialy attack russia, if Ukraine was a member. But its unlikely to happen.

So, knowing that, it become obvious, that crucial targets for russia are located in east and south of Ukraine. Logistic problems, low morale, etc. Those are the problems on the north front. While south one, is still progressing. 
It looks like russia checked if its possible to blitzkrieg the Ukraine, and place puppet government in Kijev. Now we know, that the answer is ""no"", but they considered this as ""it would be nice if accomplished"". But crucial targets for them is securing oil deposits. For them it would be nice to take over whole Ukraine now, but as long as they keep oil deposits, it can wait. 

But why start the war if Crimea was already theirs since 2014.

And here is the reason. The reason is .... water. Crimea is simply out of water. Enormously high water bills, and threat of drought makes Crimea want to come back to Ukraine. When Crimea was Ukrainians, they supplied it with water from Dniepr river. But now, they just build a dam on that river on their side, and due to geography of that region, it is imposible for russia to supply Crimea in water. I mean, it is possible, but extremely expensive. So expensive, that they could not afford it. Water supplies in Crimea went bellow 5% !!. Second reason is that Russia is afraid of Ukraine joining NATO. Couse it would be much harder to destabilize NATO member, and it would be imposible to military threaten them. 
Russia is obsessed with maintaining super power status, and they are ready to wage war on Europe to keep it. Putin will not back off, at all cost. He can't. Because if he did, Russia's collapse as a superpower would be inevitable. And this is why we (the west) must unite, and support Ukraine at all cost. 

So while we can feel kinda nice, that Ukraine defence goes well. We should remember that in the front that is the most important here, russia is actually wining, and they are winning quite heavily."
"I'd argue the oil/gas is more a nice side profit for Putin's neo-imperialism and geographic insecurity. 

Ukraine would have to spin up a massive industry and somehow compete with Gazprom undercutting them at the international market whilst also competing with Russian pipeline infrastructure. I don't think the Russians were all that concerned tbh. Not in the short term anyways. 

I'd also agree that securing the seafront of Ukraine is a major objective for Putin, but so is either creating a puppet state as a buffer against NATO, or outright annexing it. Certainly regime change is a major objective for Putin. And for that they would have to take Kyiv, thus the abortive VDV attacks on Hostomel airport, and the Guards units attacking from Belarus and Kharkiv. 

If there's a main difference in the disparity of progress between the fronts, it's that the southern front is harder to hold in terms of territory for the Ukrainians, and maintaining Kyiv is more important to them. 

Encircling the Ukrainian troops on the line of contact with the DPR/LPR would be a nice bonus as well."
"This is bullshit the only thing Holding Russia is that Ukraine civillian making human baracade for russian not able to provide aid,... 

If russia do not have heart they can decide to just kill those people but they decided not too... 

enough with the mediocre anonymous shtt,... they have nothing to do with this,... that is the truth you are putting so many shit in your video,...


So a military decided to use unsecure frequency? wth are they using amazon walkie talkie now?...."
What do you mean? The Russians are already providing aid Syrian style :^)
Extension of NATO not mentioned that was very low from you
"@80 80 I hope my name doesn't sound that Russian to you because I am not Russian, NATO seems very friendly to ""democracy"" than right? I am lost here, isn't volodymyr the one with right wing fascist military groups in the army?"
"@80 80 what I said has nothing to do why Ukraine wanted to join NATO, it has to do why NATO wants to expand around"
Not enough vodka? Inbreeding?
It's so sad to see a Nation like Russia being so poorly prepared war lol.
Amateurs argue tactics professionals discuss logistics. Putin.... is not an amateur.
Blow up there gas and food. Brilliant!
What a load of BS
very informative
Good job reporting the news unlike CCN where they make up the news on the Russia American War .
Armies march on their stomachs
"u can simple say that ""Russia is pure evil, and russians is not a humans"" instead of inventing reasons for poor military organization, failed logistic, corruption and other shit. srsly. War is not over, you are on other side planet, but, you better know, OF COURSE, how things really are..."
I grew up during Nam War and most of my family members did not survive.  Can NATO and its Allies stop the Evil Russia?  A peace to Ukrainian people!

"putin is power hungry, takes nuclear sites, but Brave Ukrainian forces supported by Brave Legions from other countries aswell as volunteers and Anonymous will never back down!

putin used FOAB bombs called thermobaric bombs which are toxic and make vacuum, he will be judged in Strassbourg for crimes against humanity like nazi.

Currently tanks, jets like SU27 and helucopters are shot down.

Absolutely fascinating perspective in which to view the conflict.  Brilliant job.
Hearing the sirens and watching the flashes gave a chill down my spine.
"I am amazed that the team was able at all to make this, and in such a timely manner. This is now a legitimate news channel. I hope Sam I a proud of what his little YouTube project has been able to achieve. Cause damn dude."
"Apparently, general Maintenance has been a major problem as well. Not only does the Russian Army not have enough trucks, they haven't been using their already existing trucks enough, so the tires have been slowly dry-rotting away, This is made even worse when you realize that a tire of that size and grade can take upwards of a year or more to rot away like that. Also, i've heard that their CTIS units, which controls tire pressure, haven't been maintained enough either. So when the trucks hit the off-road in Eastern Ukraine, they became bogged down in so much mud, that some of the tires popped instantly when the tire pressure wasn't adjusting properly. They were so bogged down that the Army just left them, so now they are relying on the roads to transport anything, including that convoy of tanks that supposedly hearing for Kiev. Anybody that knows Russian Military history can tell you that this has the protentional for disaster, because its what cost the Russians the Winter War in 1939, its literally the same situation all over again."
"Putin said he knew in his heart and mind that the Ukrainians were Russian. If that’s true, he should have known NOT TO ATTACK THEM! Only an idiot would attack Russians without a legitimate cause."

1:15 RIP VDV. May your souls be reborn as sunflowers.
I've never really liked this channel but didn't know why until now. The statement at the head of the comments that people expressing an alternative opinion are Russian bots proves that it is a western propaganda channel.
"which US invasion of sovereign country is not under ""defense, liberalism and freedom""? US is a hypocrite for condemning Russia the same actions they took in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. When the world leader do this, why can't other follow?"

"@Horizontalvertigo marketing is not on point. Yes agree, fundamental actions are the same"
"Ok ! Watching this video, we are wondering when Ukrane will invade Russia"
Long live Ukraine
This propaganda principle is “instill doubt”.

Excellent presentation
I suspect this video is a little premature.
"If this is how they struggle on their own border, I can’t imagine what would happen if they fought overseas.  
Also, the uniforms and gear the captured soldiers have look like they are about 50 years old."

"By the way, Kiyv has something like 3 million people in it. That’s a larger city than Chicago, the third largest in the US. It’s a HUGE city"
"oh, gotcha, thanks for the clarification!"
"That's not accurate. Kyiv does have 3 million people, but its metro area has 3.5 million. Chicago itself has 2.75 million people, but its metro area has 9.5 million!
Kyiv is more comparable to Minneapolis, the 15th largest metro area in the US. 
Also similar to Athens, San Diego, Manchester, or Seattle."
"ring rust, not like the USA who are going to war every 5 years."
Commies epic FAIL
Why did Putin wait till now to show more aggression? Weakness maybe? And I'm not a trump guy.  But the whole world sees this weak administration.
"The counter argument would be, Putin was hoping Trump would get a second term and that he'd pull out of NATO/let Putin do as he pleased. That didn't happen, and he was losing patience, he misjudged the west's backbone and went all in on faulty intel. 
Biden's not doing too badly, outside looking in. To me he looks like he's busier behind the scenes with lobbying the EU, and is more interested in making this look like an EU vs Russia issue, rather than automatically escalating to a NATO vs Russia issue, for better or for worse."
"It was not quick. They built up for this attack over a long period of time. Need to attack their logistics tail and keep fuel, ammunition, food from their troops."
i love this but I wish you included any sources
"@DONUT yeah i wish I had sources for claims such as Russian troops not having any gps navigation
they have the only rival to the GPS in the world, weird they would not use that or like, a phone lol"
"According to comments I've read, he put the sources for clips on the lower left of the screen every time he showed one. For actual sources of information, you got me."
It hasn’t even been two weeks yet and you’re saying their logistics failed. Ok bud
Very good documentary. Very informative.
Russia lost 100 million people and almost 1/3 of its land when the USSR broke up. Putin still resents that. It has 11 time zones. Massive.
I don't want to complete denounce the UN as they were able to keep the peace(major conflict with world powers) for at least ~80 years but I personally believe they failed as a whole to prevent this war and even protect the civilians attempting to flee apparently the UN is only good at peace keeping in impoverished middle Eastern and African countries this is giving me a lot of WW1 vibes and I can't help compare the UN to the League of Nations and how they were utterly powerless to govern and prevent war with a rapidly growing German world power. If the UN can't even react to prevent a world power from massacring civilians by bombarding residential areas and evacuating civilian or to even regulate the Russian government from starting a conflict in the first place when they were amassing military on Ukrainian borders and further fail to regulate a world power in times of war I feel like the UN is useless I don't see the point in it's existence if it can't do the bare minimum and regulate a war from becoming a senseless slaughter of the innocent (Russia targeting and firing on residential zones). I might not know the whole story but this is from what I see right now again I still think the UN is a good thing for the world and it's peace but I'm very disappointed at how they reacted to this conflict I neither desire for WW3 but I don't think its a lot to ask from Russia to not target highly populated areas without proper warning and evacuation. Civilians will die but this is going too far and I'd like to believe that I'm not being naïve for thinking that.
@de209 hoth one can only hope haha
"@de209 hoth well the previous major physical force peace keeping operation was the Korean war, which was a UN lead mission on the western side. 
And that only happened because the Soviets were boycotting the UN at the time because the UN recognised the Republic of China (Taiwan) over the People's Republic of China. So the two main veto powers weren't in place. 
Russia would automatically veto any UN military mission against it.
China would automatically veto any UN military mission that would interfere with ""sovereign interests."" 
Maybe if they expel Russia and somehow get China to abstain on the vote then a military force could be organised against Putin, but like, a meteorite could fall out of the sky and kill Putin too."
@Horizontalvertigo You may be right on that part which I do agree with but it still feels like it lacks any physical involvement in the conflict and prevent desperate Russian attacks against civilian. They are successful diplomatically but I had already expected that as that is it's whole purpose of the UN to begin with. I guess I had a larger expectation on their physical involvement in this and any other crisis like in the wars spawned in the middle east and Africa in the late 20th century and would unlike the failed League of Nations get physically involved in the evacuation and protection of civilians and preventing the situation from escalating. I guess what I'm saying is that yes I agree with you and the UN is more successful than the past League of Nations and other attempts at peacekeeping in the past Diplomatically but  they repeat similar mistakes as the past in physical intervention I feel like the expectation is that the UN one of the most powerful organizations of human diplomacy in the world would have more influence in preventing a conflict to begin with and to further protect the people by taking physical and diplomatic action the second a major conflict breaks out. Am I naïve for thinking that; this is one of my more conflicting feelings for this conflict.
"Seeing as how Russia possesses a veto, I'd say that the UN has been extraordinarily successful compared to its usual uselessness. 
It's complex diplomacy and influence farming. Considering that China and Cuba both refused to support Putin at the UN, I don't see how you can call it a failure. 
There's been a really clear unification behind Ukraine and a rejection of Russia, to the point of even questioning the legitimacy of its UN membership altogether. 
Considering the power Russia wields in the UN, it's not actually doing that badly."
"Your statement is pinned to the video is very true, there’s a lot going on and a huge fog of war.all the propaganda being spread is also not helping at all. With that said this is an Interesting take."
"""It all happened so quickly""

"Excelente trabajo/Good Work/Thanks Puerto Rico,  USA"
I sincerely and seriously hope no Western defense analyst or military general or strategist worth his/her salt seriously thinks that Russia is doing badly in their invasion. It's okay for war propaganda and media blitz purposes but IRL? I seriously hope they're not thinking that way. So many armchair generals in this comment section think they know everything after looking at twitter clips and posts.
"Up to you to decide if it's spin or not, but Petraeus is on the record saying ""This is going to be a very long fight in Kyiv. The locals there have been stockpiling food, there is going to be an enormously fierce resistance. I don’t accept assumptions that it will fall.”
Other places saying ""going terribly for [Putin]"""
"Ukraine use to have one of the biggest Armed Forces in the world  during the Soviet era  - 800 : 000. They de-escalated their military plus got rid of their Nukes after 91 to become more Liberal and save money.
 I served in Berlin around this time in the British Army 1987 - 1991 and I'm now a fit and healthy 50 year old. 

So it's possible that the Ukrainians still have 100s of thousands retired trained soldiers within their civilian population that have now come forward and taken up arms. Alot of them now using better Western tech. Add these veterans aging between 46 - 60 with most being around 50 to the current Ukrainian armed forces that number around 200:000 with the Hardy civilians jumping on board and you have a decent fighting force. 

Given the size of Ukraine too and the FACT it has Western satelite technology and NATO intelligence on its side then the Russian generals and Putin really didn't think this through. 

That Russian invasion force simply isn't big enough to take a country that size and hold it. Especially given the points mentioned above. I served on the Challenger Tank crews after Berlin in 91 'Operation Granby' And finished in Kuwait City on peace keeping duties after we'd defeated Saddams Iraqi regime. The amount of kit and personel involved in that coalition to remove the Iraqis was immense (Iraq had the World's second largest armed force at that time). The coalition was over 700:000 troops strong from 30 nations with the best kit available. Once the air war was won it took us two days to sweep through the desert, into Kuwait and onto Kuwait City whilst destroying 80% of Iraqi armour and sending what was left back home to Iraqi. It was easy and enjoyable.

 I was having lunch at the Holiday Inn in Kuwait City that the council had paid for us 7 days from the start of the ground conflict when we first moved from over the Saudi border.

Putin will not achieve his aim and he's under manned  troops are certainly not enjoying it or fighting well . He's massively miss judged this and underestimated the Ukrainians and the size, logistics of that country. My only worry now is that looking into that man's eyes during his speeches I see a lunatic, a very frustrated lunatic! He'll start fighting dirty soon. If he can't take and control that Country he'll destroy it using long/short range ballistics and possibly tactical Nukes. The world simply can't sit on their hands and watch this bit of the War happen. I fear the worst and we all need to be prepared for the worst. 🙏"
"@Davo  I don't need you to explain the difference to me. I'm clearly talking about 2003, as is the poster I replied to.  As to taking on the 2nd largest army in the world, the Iraqi army during the Gulf War (which is what we call 91 btw) was quite frankly a joke. Turning up with outdated or as in the case of their tanks, fake equipment. If you want a pat on your back, go to some American army channel. You're no hero of mine."
"@Ash Jones learn the difference between Iraq War of 91 compared to the Iraq war of 2003. The difference is massive. One was to push back the world's 2 largest army and liberate a country it had invaded by force, killing, raping and toturing civilians. I saw kuwait and the devastation in Kuwait City and spoke to the Kuwaiti civilians that had their families beaten and raped by Saddams Iraqi regime and their homes set on fire, the place was still burning all around us.

I wasn't there in 2003 but that was an invasion of Iraq itself under the guise of the WMDs policy. There WMDs were never found and reason for that was we had destroyed them all and his factories in 91. No chemical weapons were found in 2003 because I personally saw them destroyed over 10 years earlier in 91.

Do some simple research and learn about the two Wars before letting your brain engage in what you type. 91 was a liberation, Iraq was not invaded by ground forces or occupied. 2003 was the invasion. Don't mix the two up has its disrespectful to the veterans that fought and put their life's on the line  to liberate another nation and destroy a Evil dictators muderous regime and chemical arsenal."

"While I truly appreciate the depth to which you have explained the logistical issues which have impacted the war in Ukraine, and hopefully, logistics will enable this conflict to end quickly. However, I would truly enjoy an in-depth critique of the American Criminal Justice system and how it has historically negatively impacted people of color and yet we argue that it is one of the most objective in the world. Just my thoughts."
It’s not failed Russia is on the win
why the fuck do Russians waving confederate looking flags thought that was an American thing duh faq 1:51 (pls explain it looks soo similar to US confederate flags from the US civil war)
"Apparently it's the war flag of Novorossiya, so the footage is probably from 2014, or there's still some believers in the project. Not an expert but that's what I found by googling"
"If citizens of the developed world each donated $10 to reward Putin's arrest and send him to The Hague, the Russians would themselves resolve the problem in a matter of days.

If billionaires around the world donated $1,000,000 each as a reward for neutralizing Putin, we would avoid the threat of World War III. We would all survive!"

"You forgot to mention the other event of 2014, which was the Maidan coup One third of Ukraine's population are ethnic Russians and were disenfranchised by the coup, which was followed by legislation which took away their human rights. They therefore declared independence in the Donbass, and were  promptly shelled by Kiev forces, causing many casualties. This has continued for over 7 years, and Putin intended to put a stop to it by occupying the Donbass. Angereed by NATO's insistence that Russia make all the concessions and compromises while NATO made none, he decided at the last moment to invade the whole of Ukraine. It hadn't been properly thought through."
"People this is propaganda! Do not believe a word they say. Ukraine is not a rival tours Russia especially when NATO and the U.S.
Is helping Russia by buying their oil."
"Like always, the Right resorts to lying how big they actually are. First in the bedroom, then about the election and now about Russia's stats."
"Remember that what we mostly know of the invasion is through western (or anti-Russian) media outlets. Putin is carefully completing the objectives they set and Ukraine is basically defeated. Pockets of resistance here and there, while the invanders carry on with their goals.

Obviously people want to cheer for the underdog and give them hope, but it's just a matter of time until reality sets in and can no longer hide it.

We will see in the end what Putin's master plan is, because that's still not 100% clear on all fronts."
"Uhhhhh, it's a bit premature to say it's a failure."
Putin just cured covid! The world should praise him. I havnt heard anything about the big c in weeks l. Thank you Putin for doing what Biden coulndt.

The Russians are completely humiliating themselves
"Great quality in the production of content as always Sam, but can I ask why you didn't mention Donbass once in your explanation of the origins of this conflict? Or why you don't mention that Russia has been diplomatically asking NATO not to continue it's expansion towards it's borders for the past 30 years and been ignored. And you talk about Russian funded Militant forces near the border, but fail to mention the US money pouring into Ukraine to fund militant groups that supported ethnic cleansing? Not to detract from any of your coverage here, just goes to show that nobody wins when it comes to war. 

P.S there are clips of Russian's bringing in trucks to hand out humanitarian aid now, may have only been put out after this video was made, but I wanted to put it out there to share some good news for as change. Good breakdown of the content but as always, it is tough to find unbiased coverage of this topic."
"If Russia advance to the west will find nato troops, and if stay at Ukraine is on the risk to get all the military vehicles destroyed..,"

"You should pay someone to do a voiceover of this video in Russian, it's too well made and informative to not do that. Would make it easier to spread around Russia"
"@MomasBoyOnline Those videos alrerady exist obviusly. And they are in ukranuan and russian languahes.
My english is not good enough to translate them sadly."
"@Agring you're free to make a video which gets information first-hand from them if you'd like, that would be good too!"
"do you really think that some english-speaking youtube channel knows more about situation, then people who really leave in russian-speaking sphere and getting infomation first-hand from both ukranian citizens and russian sildiers?"
Interesting and well thought through. The Russians had the same problem in WW2. While they focused all their attention on building tanks they became almost totally dependent on the US for their trucks. How often do you see wartime footage of the ubiquitous C-47 delivering masses of supplies to forward bases.
We gave them lots of aircraft too. I really feel like we should make every nation that's supported Russia in this war pay dearly but within reason.
"I also insist that people remember that this is Putin's war, not Russia's. The people of Russia have made it clear through their protests that they do not want it. See NFKRZ's videos to see how it effects the average Russian. Do not go after and pick on Russian folks for a choice they had no part in making, be mad at Putin and the other elites instead. Russophobia is not ok, but ""Putinphobia"" is.

Glory to Ukraine!"
OUTSTANDING report
"Probably too early to say who is winning and etc.  In fact, Russia has a very big forces that it may try many different types of logistic plan before settling in on a plan for sustain operations...  The Ukraine are also adapting as necessary.  However, they do need a ""source"" of replenishment (ie...US, UK and NATO)."
"@Rogelio Gloria I'm not following your argument here tbh. 
I wouldn't call Nazism ""correct"" either, but that's just me"
"@Horizontalvertigo No, there are a lot of people who have different ideals because they studied and observed many things...Russia is geographically a very large country.  Nazism is holding one correct view.  Old style Communism is the same.  We can already see it in the Cannon Fodder the Russian sent in.... but is using the STUPID calling out the misinformation."
"@Rogelio Gloria I don't see how that's relevant if the essential issue is a lack of supply throughput. 
Besides, Russian supply is organised by Battalion Tactical Group, are you suggesting they'll change that model on the fly?"
"@Horizontalvertigo I don't think you realize logistic is dependent on the particular organization or service branch you belong to.  For example, a tank battalion is different from an infantry platoon or recon.  There is no such thing as ""One Logistic Plan that fits all.""  Only the stupid think one person he can micro manage shit like this."
"Generally, trying to change logistics mid operation is not a recipe for success, it's something you have planned, organised, and supplied weeks in advance. 
Supposedly the Russians have committed 95% of the forces they had prepared for the invasion as well, if true that would mean little ability to change their strategy quickly."
loved it
Wayyy to early for this
"How stupid. Russia is making great progress in Ukraine... Consider the fact that Ukraine is 2nd largest country in Europe... and at Day 5 they control the sky and 1/2 the country... and now they are closing in on the large cities... The only thing Russia is doing wrong is NOT killing civilians unnecessarily... Unlike the Americans which would have destroyed essential services and started bombing the cities killing over 500,000 by now... Like they did in Iraq killing over 1,000,000 the first month... Over a Media LIE ""weapons of mass destruction""... At least Russia is fighting over its actual security threat cause by USA and NATO...  Did you know there are Nazis in Ukraine at every level of Government and Military... Don't take my word for it do a web search ""Ukraine NEO Nazi"" and you will see... The last time I say them post the civilian death at day 5 there was only 350 deaths... If you have notice they stopped posting the deaths because then they would have to post their military deaths as well and it would look bad like example 500 civilians and 8500 soldiers... It would look like Russia is protecting the civilians more then the Ukrainians are..."

Even after he has dared to assassinate after in his country, beyond his borders even at whatever cost he would pay. & Once again After Ukraine he won't mind paying a price, unless this time the Cost is too high. & Under Trump we know Putin would have a field day with NATO Divided by Trump, & Trump excusing Putin, & playing it off as hands off BS. & Should we see horrific stories of Putin's slaughter of Civilians I'm sure he would try to deflect as exaggerations, or his famous ( IT IS WHAT IT IS ).

The Ukraine/Russia war video I’ve been waiting for
Do we really need to tell the Kim Jong Deux why his logistics are shit? Is this form of online narcissism actually helping the enemy?
Excellent vid.  Thank you.
Because logistics and Russia do not work together. Never.
The war was provoked
This is cheap Western propaganda. Do you honestly think the Russian military are relying on paper maps and unguarded fuel trucks 😆 Russia doesn't have enough trucks... give it a rest mate. So what you're saying is that the Russian military is equivalent to that of a banana republic's?! Absolute nonsense.
russia is a banana republic
"Logistics is reality based and requires independent, localised decision making based on objective information gathering. Autocratic, centralised rule isn't especially compatible with it; even in more open societies the front line military struggle to secure reality based decision making over central political narrative. Iirc the Germans were badly defeated going into Russia in large part due to lack of fuel, adequate clothing etc, something their leadership's refused to believe was necessary. What need have they of fuel and winter clothing, Russia will be crushed long before supplies run out!"
"🇺🇦🤍 Ukrainian people have already won, putin just hasn't realized it yet"
Does Amazon have overnight weapon delivery!?  Or how about Ubernukes!?  Think Bi-dope   asked Hunter!
"I wouldn't describe what I have seen as ""failure"". Putin is blowing up large areas of cities."
Another propaganda channel.
"This is history repeating itself. the only reason the Red Army had any success in WW2 was because countries gave them trucks. US gave over 200,000. Putin and his staff are just as stupid as their Soviet predecessors."
"also I hope and pray that EU or/and USA will not feed us to russia, to avoid involvement in the war"
What a terrible Russian plan ! A lying puppeteer and his lied to puppets for a battle plan. Really ? That sounds like it should all go perfect to plan. 🙄

"Putin : "" I decide to .....

"Ummm if russia and ukraine are ''One people'' according to Putin, why is there a need to drop 600 missiles on your own people?  If they are 'peacekeepers' according to Putin why decimate entire Cities? Why destroy an Entire Country merely because its leader is a Jew? Why are Western countries not utilizing a Single drone? While Democracy is Falling? PUTIN Says he is exterminating 'Neo-nazis' while he is attacking and destroying and Obliterating a Jewish Run country? I'm trying to understand all this"
"Wow, this is actually an Incredible insightful and informative Video and channel. I was more Surprised by the minute! They are showing things, you can't find elsewhere, like the Inside of Russia's logistics and refueling, etc. I've never seen it, before, from the Russian vantagepoint. I've never, further, seen Such a detailed breakdown of the Logistics issues and the problems their encountering. This is quite inspiring. The mainstream News just generically describes 'they are having problems' with logistics...Never going so Far in detail!! I am quite more than Impressed. I will be buying the Subscription to your Channel most certainly. It is an Honor to get this kind of detailed information and Analysis."
They’re not “Sanctions” they’re special economic conditions.

This is fascinating.
Every topic about Russia or China has a load of trolls spreading misinformation in the comments. This one looks like it’s no different.
Hard to believe that one of the most advanced armies in the world don't have the most basic military encryption and rely on street signs for directions.  Strange if true.
Corruption
This channel is complete lie
Then talk about it & explain why with some form of coherence.
Why are Russian soldiers seemingly unaware of Ukrainian hatred for them it seems they are being blocked from social media or they seem to use a different internet
"Russia's version of ""shock and awe"" is more like a ""bump and grind"".
Too bad it's not a ""slip and slide""."
The video we've all been waiting for
Timeline of this video 1943
"Putin is the president of Russia. You started the video with a lie. you introduced him as the autocratic leader of Russia. Let's stay balanced. If i wanted propaganda, then i would watch corporate news."
Not much of a democratic leader if you systematically destroy all opposition parties and non-state media /shrug
"Putin is the president, but holds absolute power over the nation. Per the definition:

""Autocracy is a system of government in which absolute power over a state is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject neither to external legal restraints nor to regularized mechanisms of popular control."""
"Even if Kyiv falls and Zelenskyy is toppled, this will simply become a long-term asymmetrical conflict.  Just like the Soviet–Afghan War was the perfect proxy war for the American CIA, this Putin offense appears to be the perfect proxy war for NATO.

Russia's annual GDP is $1.5 trillion and the combined annual GDP of the NATO nations is $40 trillion.

War is a game of economics.  Time is not on Putin's side.

As long as Putin keeps throwing multi-million dollar air and armor assets into Ukraine, NATO will keep arming Ukrainian guerrilla fighers (who know their own land) with relatively inexpensive anti-air MANPADS and anti-tank portable rockets and missiles to take them out at a fraction of the cost.  Ukrainians will quickly become the best armed and therefor the deadliest guerrillas the world has ever seen."
1980s are back lol
"""It all happened so quickly..."" bro this all started back in 2014. It just went on pause cause of Trump & the Beijing Olympics"
THERE'S ADS!!

-  Biden refused sanction against Russia and continued buying oil from Putin! 
He did not even waive banning oil extraction on Texas national lands to let USA Oil companies extract oils! He also did not restart the Keystone pipeline project!

Is that real?? I thought it's propaganda BS. still no idea what to believe. 🤷🏻‍♂️
"Despite everything you're saying, there is one fact which makes it all unnecessary. Ukraine is losing the war. You can see it on any map provided by any state or YouTube individual. Russian forces are advancing nearly every day, and gained control of a little less, than 1/3 of  biggest country in Europe in 11 days. Of course it could be done better, but it's easy to say from cosy YouTube studio, as you don't know anything happening in reality."
@Horizontalvertigo .... On day 11- yes. Let's come back to the question on day 30.

I'm sorry but yall can't fight. The Russians vs America will be a joke.  You pay no attention to history.  Russia pays no attention to Valor.  You will find a wall everytime you fight free men.
"Can we please keep in mind that most of these Russian troops are poor kids, conscripted against their will, sent into the field with no clue what they’re doing there, cold, hungry, far from home & suddenly finding themselves being shot at.
All these videos of pows calling their families sound like their parents assumed they got drunk, stole a tractor & ended up in a local civilian police station.
 & not that their “captivity” was a result of being captured as a prisoner of war.

Pows should always be treated well. Always. No exceptions.

There are never exceptions to the rules of war. You treat your captured enemies well, end of story. You only hope your enemy treats your guys well in return, cause if not, that constitutes a war crime just like assaults on non-combatants & anyone guilty of it should be tried for war crimes & punished."
Russia is still going to win.

"So if you convert the Ukrainians to a Guerilla group, that has several agendas, one to destroy the railheads, the others to destroy the roadways, and destroying the transports, maybe that could be arranged.  Look at Vietnam,  the Middle East, maybe its time to think about going back to old time tactics…"
difference is the terrain
This is very good.
"""This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object""."
"This is a brilliant video and made the slow-down of the Russian offensive north of Kiev far more comprehensible. Getting supplies beyond the rail heads have been a big problems since, well, the invention of trains. It was a reocurring and serious problem for both the Wehrmacht and the Red Army in World War II. 

But there are still things that I don't understand. 

1. First of all why take the risk to launch this invasion if Russia didn't have enough trucks to both transport ammunition used by their heavy artillery and provide fuel for their armored forces at the same time? 

2. Secondly, There is a distance of about 135 kilometers from the Russian border to Kiev if one drives on any of the major highways. That simply should not be a major problem for a modern mechanized army. Even an army of infantry on foot with horse drawn artillery, like the Wehrmacht in 1941, could complete such an advance within a week .

3. I looked at the terrain around the highways from Russian going southwards to Kiev. There are harvested fields almost all the way. A few lines of trees line the roads. Even multiple well planned ambushes with anti-tank weapons should be detected and destroyed in advance by scouts, helicopters, satellites, drones and airdropped special forces. How come the Ukranians are able to attack and ambush Russian armored columns at all in such terrain. 

4. Also Russian armored vehicles are supposed to advance in battle line formation if they fear counter-attacks from Ukrainian forces. Why are they moving in a congested column along the roads that ensure traffic jams? Even with the Rasputitsa/mud season has started, they should largely be able to move across the fields? Or would that be too difficult? 

5. This video mentions that the Ukrainians destroyed their own rail infrastructure. Nice, but the Russians should have anticipated this and employed rail constructions units rebuilding them. Why didn't they do that from the start? 

6. This video also mentions that the Ukrainians destroyed their own bridges leading to Kiev from the north. Nice, but the Russians should have anticipated this and bridge engineer units to construct pontoon bridges and that only takes hours at the most. Why didn't they do that from the start? 

7. Can the explanation simply be that the Russians betted on seizing the airport close to Kiev with airborne units and then conduct an airlifted armored assault on Kiev before it had properly mobilized defensive forces there? And how come the Russians used such small units to seize that airport when Russia has more airborne (and heavily armored with air support) forces than the rest of the world combined? 

8. Or is the explanation as simple as Russian soldiers largely having no appetite to kill human beings (Ukrainians) or risk being killed by people who have effectively done them no harm, while the Ukrainians have a good reason to kill and risk their lives? I know that I would desert at first opportunity if I was a Russian soldier. 

9. This military operation is so far surely a fiasco, but I wonder how it could have been that poorly planned? Did the Russians really underestimate Ukraine that much? The Russian generals aren't inexperienced or stupid, so what is the problem? I know that the Crimean Peninsula was largely subdued in a day followed up by Russian reinforcements. Maybe the Russian military thought that it would be just as easy to conquer Kiev? 

This is all so weird."
"@William Collins exactly, the RUSSIANS are gunning down the civilians when they are trying to leave. Ukrainian gvt tries everyday to negotiate to open the green corridors from the hottest cities (also, that are aided by the red cross), but oftentimes russians occupants just shell the vehicles that transport civilians or humanitarian aid. besides, the national railway has a lot of ""ghost trains"" that pick up the civilians from shelled cities. Ukrainian gvt is doing everything they can."
@Paul sorry I comment on so may channels that they sometimes run together  !!!

Heavy Brainwashing and Propaganda majority of Russian soldiers
"Your video fails to make its case, that there has been a failure of Russian logistics. Your references are to 1. Twitter, full of opinionated fantasists (I wonder why you made no mention of the Ghost of Kiev, or the claim of 7,000 Russian casualties), and 2. the assumptions and opinions of Western military analysts. You present no evidence that Russiian logistics HAVE actually failed. You try to buttress your argument by talking about the Soviet failure in Afghanistan, 32 years ago. Hint: Modern Russia is not the USSR."
Is wendover productions owned by the US government?
@Godsdj Of course it doesn't have to be. Wendover always has a specific narrative though and they often have peculiar insight. It would just make sense that it was a partial or fully owned government program on YouTube.
"Doesn't have to be, privately owned media and channels can make whatever claims they want. And unlike in Russia, Western media outlets can speak out against each other and their own governments without facing several years in prison."
"It is Fog of War and is really really hard to know what is going on there, there is no hope for UA army, thats for sure and I bet this video is just more wish than reallity. If Russian wanted take down UA with ironfist they would have done it in 2 days, but they use tactics to make less damage as it is possible."
Russia bad America good 👍
russia is bad yes
Amazing video - thanks for collating this info at a time where it must have been hard to do so.
"I'm going to sign up for your subscription service anyway. But just a feedback, when I tried to sign up on Curiousity Stream. There is no option to use my paypal account which is the most convenient way. I don't always have my credit card around me. I will sign up later with my credit card tho."
"Fantastic video again, thank you! Oftentimes, the conversation is about the strength of military assets, but this again emphasized that force is severely impaired in its effectiveness if the logistics don’t work."
"This was great, thank you!"
They got some sick fucking trucks though
And they want to fight NATO lol pathetic
"Haha, this logistics reminds me of the war between Finland and Russia. Russia were unable to overwhelm Finland too much thanks to their poor logistics, again. They hadn't taken in account winter conditions in their equipment - and it gave Finns a huge advantage. 
Thus, why Finland survived the war as an independent country."
I'll be honest...ending the video with an ad after dealing with this tough subject is fairly tone deaf.
"it is quite obvious that the tactics of the militants of the Ukrainian army, who hide behind civilians like rats and actually took them hostage, are similar to the tactics of the ISIS militants.There is nothing surprising, because they have the same Western teachers and military advisers.that is why the Ukrainian militants do not bring agreements to the civilians at the negotiations on the creation of corridors for the exit of civilians/refugees from the blocked cities.and they continue to shoot refugees trying to leave the blocked cities.after all, these rats, under the leadership of the drug addict nuclear terrorist Zelensky, are cowards, and they are afraid to fight in the field, without hiding behind civilians.where they are instantly smashed into minced meat"
Putin's failed war
"Almost every video on youtube is about russia failing in something. That is just a PR. It is simply  not true. I am proukrainian observer but i think Russia is doing just fine in this war, ukrainians are on back foot on every front. I think thay are brave but bravery is not enough."
If the USA starts producing oil will put Russia out of business. Russia does not have the quality army needed and fighting away from home means you take everything with you.
"There is the other side as well, what is available to supply may not be up to standard. A lot of evidence of poorly maintained vehicles abandoned when broken down, with things like poor quality tires and parts. A kleptocracy like Russia encourages creaming off of government budgets, military contractors supplying substandard components, MRE suppliers instead of throwing out the old MRE as they are replaced just sells the replacements and keeps the bad ones. Etc etc."
"the American saying ""professionals talks logistics"" comes to mind"
Sauron decided for military operation
"I like how evey one was wondering why the hell the Russians were welding those awnings over their tanks, now we know they were afraid of javelin"
"Ah the rails...what screwed the Germans over in WW2 as they advanced East...the rails were different in Russian than in Germany, wasting time and resources to redistribute logistics"
Just drop some nukes and end this
Let's not. People should enjoy life while they can experience it.
"Putin fucked this up SO badly, jfc that’s so embarrassing. What a fool."
Russian Logistics - Rush B!
"1:48 When you said ""made possible"" i honestly expected a sponsor placement"
Russia's stalingrad.
"Behold ! The ""mighty"" Russian war machine. Threatens NATO, can't even take a lone country."
How could Russia who is like 20 times stronger than Ukraine fail to invade a giant flat plain with virtually no natural boundaries and hardly any N.A.T.O involvement?
"Same reason the Ukranian armed forces could not overcome two separatist republics. Russia armed and supplied them, whereas the Ukranians are being supplied by the Russians. Also, there is a surprising amount of Ukranian forest in existence in the 21st century..."
As a Ukrainian I can tell you this: the Russians control only the dirt under their tanks and the plots of land where they're decomposing) Glory to Ukraine!
I still think Russia can win this with all the difficulty...West will not prevail
"Trains...Wendover's new love. Sorry Planes - it's not you, it's them."
"The Russian troops searching/looting for food is so sad. Considering they didn’t want to fight to begin with. This war sucks, and I pray Ukrainian citizens AND insurgents survive and conquer due to Russian forces’ weaknesses. Thank you for providing further information and illustrating the real sobering casualty of war. This sucks yo."
*Kiev
Minsk Agreement and the failed attempt of Fake News Legacy in Ukraine 🤣🤣
"""Autocrat of Russia""??? That's a nice term. He's basically Benito Mussolini."
"The big bad convoy in the North of Kyiv is a perfect description of Russia's logistical failure- it is a 64 km traffic jam where vehicles in the front have stalled due to lack of fuel, and are waiting till fuel arrives from the depo far back. Not to mention that vehicles in the middle and tail are wasting fuel by idling their engines to run heating, comms, and other functions like for example, AA vehicles. Since mud season has started, they are locked to roads like in Winter war, meaning they can't even send their units from the middle to go around. Thanks for the likes and (mostly) civilized conversation in replies."
@21 Kindness So... how is that encirclement of Kiev going?
Firstly a operating base and casualty centre need to be set up prior to this convoy arriving at Kyiv. Due to fighting this is not possible at least until Russia can surround the capital.
Only problem is that Ukraine lacked the weapons to hit it hard before they regrouped. A couple of hundred of cruise or hellfire missiles would have made wonder for the Russian morale.
"@Toncor12 I dont know where do you get informations from. I will share some of my info. Russians are not take cities and front is not solid, yes its true. The russian tactic is to cut main roads, to stop supply and destroy workshops. That work very well! Main roads to Kiev are cut and Russian army stay 18 miles from the center. I dont think there are real siege of Kiev as Russians want blocade city and force to surrender. Very important to keep Zelensky alive as he is legit president of Ukraine. Same situation at other city: Charkiv and Odessa. The Russian losess are not that important as Russia CANNOT and will not loose this war. If Ukrainian will resist, the resolt will be devastating. No Russians or Ukrainian agreed with such scenario."
What is impossible to not notice is the difference in morale. Ukrainians are determined as fuck. Russian soldiers aren't that willing to fight. How would you be if your superiors took away your passport and there's a mobile crematorium rolling behind you
"Why do you call the elected president of Russia an ""autocrat."" He is probably more legitimate than either Biden or Zelensky, both of whom are under the suspicion of having stolen their respective elections."
"Despite the flaws, the Russians are closing in on Kiev and dropping paratroopers. I believe Ukraine's gotta be helped sooner militarily"
Thanks for comprehensive revew!
Amazing
lmao russia is a failure.
Unmanned submarine supply is not bad but why would I help warring factions
"I do love when others whose opinion you don’t agree with must be a ‘troll’. It actually indicates their own lack of self esteem or insecurities. I live in the Southern Hemisphere, have absolutely no association with Russia or Eastern Europe, was born in an Anglo country BUT I can see hyperbole and opinion a mile away and this video is an example. Unless Sam has people actually on the ground or is being fed by the CIA everything he says is conjecture. As an analyst myself (not military though) ‘I’ know yet he (Sam) seems to think if you disagree with him you’re misinformation. That put my antenna up straight away that he is working on behalf of someone else to have such thin skin. A well rounded person would acknowledge that what they say can be fraught with judgements and incorrect assumptions but he is so certain it makes me wonder how arms length Wendover really is and who is backing him. Plus, an army slowing down? 24 yo Sam is showing wilful ignorance of his own history - the allied armies during WW2 slowed down many times when supply lines became stretched; in fact they regrouped for a period after D Day and on one occasion they had moved so fast, The army had to be pulled back (had to retreat) during the Ardennes offensive as they moved faster than the supply lines could supply them. But here, without any other questions, it’s being only presented as a negative."
"@AndyRob the problem is not the pause. Rather it’s the convoy itself that is a problem. It would be fine if the Russians were pausing to build staging areas along the way to the front. You know, somewhere where truckers can camp and rest. But they have not. Thus, their truckers have to sit in their vehicle with the heat on wasting more fuel attempting to deliver fuel to the front line units. That’s why people think Russia has supply problems."
@Kuro Usagi no but my point was it’s hilarious to assume a pause is due to a supply lines OR the a pause in any advance is a sign of any issue.  There can be a myriad of reasons.
"Things have changed since WW2. In the first place, Ukraine shouldn’t even exist anymore just comparing the air assets of both nations. It’s both amazing and baffling that the Ukrainians can still fly in their own air space. 

Allied armies in D-Day relied on supply lines that stretched from the USA to the UK and then to the beaches of Normandy. As any analyst must know, offloading supplies from a sea route takes much more infrastructure and logistics than simply running it overland. Russia is literally on the border of Ukraine. It does not face the challenges of the western allies in WW2."
"Lmao, the war started 8 years ago when the elected government was overthrown. From then on the 'Azov' paramilitary group and other ukranian 'nationalist'(nazi) movements did similar things, crucifing people alive, burning a whole builidng down with 40+ people in them some of them kids and shelling the Donbas region. Look up Alley of Angels Donbas. Dont belive everything you see on CNN and BBC americans, your society is doomed and the clock is ticking..."
"Putin and his Kremlin cronies putting the ""special"" in special military operation."
It's hard to believe a YouTube channel... Russians can't be that incompetent in 2022..this is nothing but propaganda.
wake up sheep
*This invasion showed me how weak Russia really is.*
Question. Are you trying to milk for cash this tragedy or are you spending 100% of all revenue you make on this one and related videos to charity to actually help the Ukrainians?
this is his job
Another bunch of lies being catered for the stupid and the willing.......
"amazing the war is still going on but russias logistics have faild, going after the opinion of hobby generals and the propaganda spit out ukraine is standing at the gates of moscow."
"You do not need to watch the video to understand it is purely propaganda or at best wild guesses. We do not know the situation in U., we do not know Putin‘s tactics and strategy. Save your time, friend."
All of these weapon movements are easily seen by spy sats
Failed might be correct but with enough time logistics can catch up when its only your front line is under attack. Hitlers logistics impeded the Russian offensive. It was only the harsh winter that halted its success. It wss the destruction of germans rail network at the wars end in the west that crushed the germans ability to move new resources
"this ""stock propaganda footage"" you have in your video is actually much better then what Russia deployed in Ukraine in reality"
Thanks
"I have heard an old saying that tactics win battles, but logistics win wars.  Seems this saying still holds true today just as previous conflicts, such as the World War 2 and the Napoleonic Wars, have demonstrated."
@Brian Sammond Thank you for the correction.  I was just saying that history tends to repeat itself for those who have failed to study the events that actually happened.
"The actual quote is “Infantry wins battles, logistics wins wars.” quote from Army General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front during WW1."
"These people must live in some parallel reality. I bet a year from now when ukraine is under full Russian control they will still be making videos titled ""How Russian invasion failed"" lmao..."
I learned so much with your videos! Entertain and teach all in one package! Thank you
Putin looks like under the influence of drugs
"Special military operation 😎?
Or..
Pointlessnessification 🤔"
In ww2 the then Soviets didn't have enough trucks and it was American supplied trucks that kept them going
"Yeah, of course. Someone on YouTube knows everything about Russian army. Ha ha ha. 

Conflict between Russia and Ukraine is only their own business. No one knows the real story. You all believe your news, who is lying. Actually as russian news too."
Title should be how us game is over after this war
Why so many big words? Speak 8 grade .. please.
"I am from Ukraine, but to believe that Americans"" are helping ukraine is far from true: this is the same thing like america is promising to immigrants to protect the immigrants. One group of people is bringing you to United States, and another group of Americans are hunting you; And they are using all kind of illegal chemicals to hunt people: 
I have been spy for over 15 years in the United States which they try to hunt and kill me - and that is only because i am Christian,, it is a miracle that I am still alive today.

Refuges immigrant people should be protected in the United States not to be hunted""

If you hear an American saying i love the Christian's - That is a lie."
"These are not sanctions, this is a special financial operation"
"I legit thought he was gonna say ""This extension of military might was made possible by Skill Share"" but then I remembered this isn't an HAI video 😂"
"This is absolute propaganda, but the creator indirectly already called anyone who doesn't just outright agree with him a troll/shill, so whatever."
Putin had been planning this for years. Just got lucky in Crimea with surprise but that not possible anymore and the country of over 42 million will not go quietly! If he cannot win or back down he either takes his own life or as many humans as possible with him!
excellent analysis
"In addition to hoping the Ukraine wins I am so impressed by their resilience and shrewdness.

I am so sad that this is happening, and I really hope that we can bring peace to Ukraine as well as democracy to Russia.

I hope to being able to welcome Ukraine into the European Union soon. I just hope we are doing enough to help now."
"@ᮝᮖᮄᮟ᳆ So it;s been a bit over a week, how's that whole being over thing ?"
"@Tobias Rörvall Rodrigues Then you’re talking about stopping the Maidan coup in 2014, fool."
@ᮝᮖᮄᮟ᳆ A country should be able to decide its own future and not by being coerced by another country. What is stopping Russia from attacking again? I would be fighting like Ukraine as well if I was in their position.
I've gotten more information from this 20-minute video than I have from tens of hours of watching mainstream media. Amazing job dude. Thank you.
@Richard Arriaga You clearly don't know what Hybrid Warfare is. Better do some research to avoid nonsense talking like that.
"@Jeremy Gibbs When you say ""...was at no risk of invasion from Ukraine"" + ""loss of influence""  it clearly shows that you don't understand what is happening... can't blame you, videos like this are showing very biased view based on one side and totally ignoring the other. Taking a look at ""Hibrid Warfare"" should help understand all of this."
@elenabob Let me check him out. Cheers!👍🏿
"Russia has always historically thrown bodies at a situation,  the don't care about supply lines they will keep sending people"
"The Ukrainians are not poor. They know this is their way out of the ""Russian"" world. Where some old piece of shit rules the police state while everyone who doesn't lick the boots of the regime is forced to squalor in poverty and stagnation. Ukraine will leave that desolate world behind."
By far the best and most informative video about the conflict
"Russia is one of the best countries in defending itself, but in terms of attacking they really suck"
"This video is incredible, I've gained tremendous respect for you. Until now you were just the brick and airports video guy"
Thank you for this update.
"We should have struck all their staging areas at once, we could have decapitated Russia as a military power overnight while going to DEFCON 1."
"I wish every Russian soldier in Ukraine a very


Javelin to the dashboard."
"Uncle B said we will watch their movements and gv it out world, imagine what could hv happen if order countries turn their back against Ukraine 1week Russia forces 'll round up everywhere there."
wow... thats so interesting!! thx a lot

The P could be for Россия (Russia). Remember the alphabet is different.
Great content to educate people
"Damn, that oldman trying to reach his balcony fence, while entire building is crumbling :/"
So Russia could never hold a conflict in America (from south no north). Just throw a missile. USA can move whatever wherever.
"What kind of gas lighting bullshit is going on that EVERYONE is calling Kiev (Key-ev) ""keev"" ridiculous."
An army the size of the US with an economy smaller than Italy.

Can we get a Nebula Xbox app? That’s my primary device for watching your videos and one of the reasons I’ve refrained from buying nebula
"It's still a bit too early to say anything concrete about this conflict, except that the resilience and determination of the Ukrainian resistance has surpassed all expectations, and will inspire the world in the struggle against tyrannical regimes for years to come."
Tf are you talking about?  Its a US pawn.
"Your last line is spot on. I was thinking the same, for the last couple of days."
Special military operation*
"Guys, it's not an invasion, it's a ""special military operation""."
"The thing is yes, logistically speaking the Russian military will improve the longer the war goes on. But in the bigger picture, the longer the war goes on the harder it will be on the Russian economy. 
Putin's war chest could very well run out, which won't end the war, but it will create widespread misery in Russia. So it really isn't desirable for the Russian military to stay in a prolonged war."
"I had seen an article bouncing around that stated that Russia had gathered a war chest of something along the lines of 2/3 - 3/4 of a trillion Euro. Now if this means that this is what they're going to pay for their war with, and the 15 billion euro per day price tag that I saw on another article holds true, then Ukraine just needs to keep going for 50 or so days before they bankrupt them"
@Nuclear Armament So then they will just win the war and sit there like North Korea ?
"War is fought with natural resources, not fiat currency, you fool. Russia has more natural resources than any country on the face of the planet by at least more than a factor of two. Russia does NOT need money, it has resources, they just dig it out of the ground within their own borders and send it to you. The only chokepoint for Russia domestically is food, for they only have so much and only about 55% of Russian food supply is domestically produced, versus 95% in the Soviet era. That, however, can be solved too during a protracted war effort on behalf of the Russians. The only technological roadblock Russia faces is the domestic semiconductor industry, but they are capable of producing them to power their military even in the face of Western sanctions that haven't been as strong since the Soviet era."
@Mercs that's going to make it difficult to pay for things.
most of that war chest got arrested.
This channel is hands down the best Youtube has to offer.
Can we have a video about how the sanctions have effected the worldwide airline industry and the  russian airline industry in specific please? I have always wondered how sanctions would effect the airline industry.
"Finally a youtuber/outlet showing clips relating exactly to what they're talking about. Either that be a training video, infographic, or an on the ground video. makes it much more believable and probably is."
Just lost a subscriber. Your bias shows. So disappointed you did this.
I hope Russia continues to see nothing but failure. GLORY TO UKRAINE! 🇺🇦
"Realistically they haven't failed and I don't know from where and when in history is a 10 days war seen as something possible, especially if you don't want to destroy everything in your path! Realistically even a population with no military and only guerilla civilian resistance can take months, if not years to defeat and it may never be defeated. 

Again unless Russia wants to destroy everything in its path it can't win a war in days! Why is everyone claiming that Russia is failing logistically or militarily? I condemn the war and every previous war on behalf of France(Libya), UK, USA(Libya, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq), Nato/EU/USA/UK(Yugoslavia, Serbia), etc... they are all wrong and from Bush Senior to George Soros, Sarkozy, to Bush junior, Obama, etc... they should all be in jail. 

Doesn't mean Russia is failing on a military, intelligence or logistical way! In fact what they achieved in 10 days is militarily impressive, even if its humanely repugnant!"
"excellent video very informative, Keep up the good work"
"They did the same thing in Chechnya bombed Grozny to the dust got inside, and the Chechen rebels started killing the Russian army on dozens when they tried to leave the city."
This video narrative could also be propaganda.
I noticed you picked up the narrative AFTER the American funded coup in 2014. NATO has been building up bases on Russia's borders for years. Zekensky IS a puppet of NATO. He refused to abide by the Minsk agreement and the Ukraine govt jailed it's opposition and seized their assets. If we are going to discuss the situation let's be honest about things.
The interesting thing would be to establish a  larger cel tower network and use the people to track convoys.
bullshit propaganda
A wise man once said a $5 million tank without fuel is just a $5 million paperweight.

"Oh, love this ""doc"" style - almost instantly gives this feeling, kind of ""historical proven facts etc"". Funny that youtube highlight it for me 😁"
So interesting.
"I think that Russia is not showing us their true potential and ability why should they…the real war is yet to come 
They are more concentrated to destroy their military infrastructure from above
Its not an invasion its an regimechange like US did many times

Didn't know Sherman's tactics of blowing up railroads would still be so relevant.
"Everyone should read _Ender's Game_ in school.  There's a whole sub-plot about spreading viral misinformation in the actual book.
  
Propagandists these days use a trick where two different bots each take an opposing side in order to start arguments between with multiple users on a forum at once.  They start the fire, pour fuel on it, and then back off when the argument becomes hundreds of posts long and self-sustaining.  The goal is simply to create ""sides"" and bury any accurate information that bubbles to the surface."
This is highly informative ad revealing.
"The countries which have sent - and continue to send weapons and support to the Ukrainians fighting a civil war for the last eight years, are the ones responsible for what is happening now – not Putin. The West stirred up the conflict in Ukraine without giving a second thought to the human suffering and 14,000 deaths which have occurred over the last eight years. This might be difficult for Westerners to accept - but we are the bad guys in this instance."
Why is the Russian military relying on paper maps and (Ukrainian) road signs? Why aren't they using GPS (or their golanass system)?
"That's bullshit, cheap propaganda."
exactly like wtf what military uses paper maps and road signs?
keep in mind THIS VIDEO  is very likely to have disinformation due to the nature of this conflict. It's likely not representative of actual facts.
"Exactly, like what military uses paper maps and road signs OMG wtf
Russia is really advanced in terms of military capabilities, you cannot convince me they use paper maps"
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤣😂🤣
"One thing no-one is taking about or covering is the sectarian violence in Ukraine that started with the schism in 2014-16 their have been churches and monasteries burned, Ukraine tried to form a new church and we're trying to outlaw the Russian orthodox church, Greece sent weapons to protect the Greek orthodox living in Ukraine, I can see why Russia has invaded as they do not want the sectarianism to spread to the Russian mainland, of course this hasn't been put forward by the main stream media, because this is what the USA does, Iraq, Sunni against Shi, Syria, Christian against Muslim, divide and conquer. The Ukrainian Juda ruling class won't care if the other orthodox faiths kill each other."
"@Gregor Kikelj they also changed the law so only Ukrainian could be taught, half the country speaks Russian."

Politicians + media × propaganda  = weirdo's and liars
"Huge thanks for this, it indeed provided clarity to the on going conflict. Just subscribed. This video deserve more views"
"The Western allies learned their lessons from WWII.  Logistics trumps everything.  They didn't have the best troops in the field but they definitely had the best supplied.  The Russians should have learned this lesson, given that it was Western supported logistics that literally kept them alive during the darkest days of the German invasion of the USSR."
@Nuclear Armament 🤡
"@OptimusWombat yes, claim its disinformation, when pretty much everything i stated is established fact. hahaha, very funny way of having a last word. you need to open your mind some more"
"@Nuclear Armament no, you needn't go on, because I don't pay attention to disinformation.  Bye!"
"@OptimusWombat The Soviets invaded Manchuria in August 1945, and it was a major factor in getting the Japanese to surrender. This of course is something you will NEVER hear taught in Western schools. Hell, when the US instilled in Japan the WGIP (War Guilt Information Program) after occupying it, they forced the educational system to write in their own schoolchildren textbooks that it was Joseph Stalin and the USSR that were responsible for dropping the two nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as opposed to war criminal Harry S. Truman and the imperialist USA. Need I go on?"
"@Richard Arriaga Absolutely preposterous. Lend-lease trucks didn't make up any of Soviet truck inventory in 1941 after the Germans invaded it, and in 1942 Lend-Lease trucks made up no more than 5%. Even in the Battle of Kursk, which occured in nearly the FOURTH QUARTER OF 1943, Lend-Lease trucks made up NO MORE THAN 15% OF SOVIET INVENTORY! This lie that Lend-Lease saved the USSR in the Great Patriotic War between 1941 and 1945 is just that, a FICTIONAL FAIRY TALE. The Soviets were winning after 1942 when they were on the brink of collapse, and the total amount of Lend Lease made up not even 5% of the total inventory they possessed, and during which they were already winning against the Nazi war machine!

 The Soviets even repaid Lend-Lease in full under Russian Federation in 2006, four full months before the British did. The Soviets repaid it in blood as well--over 27 million casualties--9 million of which were military and the remaining 18 million civilians. You are a HISTORICAL REVISIONIST!"
"Why is Russia not bombing with planes and drones like they did in Syria? They did some attacks from air but they are mostly relying on rockets, as you showed. Do you have an opinion about that?"
"Wait, do you mean to tell me that Russian troops were posting all of the buildup to TikTok this whole time? 😂😂😂 JFC the FSB is going to be mad mad."
your doing very good job. Thank you.
Funny that at 1:50 the *Russian soldier is wearing an FBI hat.*
Putin is the new Hitler
"This is BS. If russia wanted to they could of taken out Ukraine. They already have gained the aerial supremacy over Ukraine. The TRUE reason their assault isn't going as far because they aren't trying to get into much conflict, they are taking as much as possible without having any resistance to fight back at them. Ukraine's pathetic government enstated a conscriptionship saying ""all men from ages 18-60 should serve."" No old fart can beat a professional Russian soldier in his 20's... If russia wanted to they could of cUkraine."
Not the Russian solders asking for directions…. Ummm leave
-------------- Blame DICTATOR PUTIN and leave from RUSSIA ..... embargo to RUSSIA -----------------------
Great video I learned alot
"So you’re saying Russia failed but is slowly suffocating Ukraine like an anaconda.
 Russia could of bombed ukrain to shit from the sky from day 1
Also noone wants to attack in the winter it’s a stupid idea."
"Fantastic and fact-based analysis.
It feels like only one side of this conflict ever watched Red Dawn."
It all goes back to pre WW2 and afterwards...Stalin killed millions there.. then the Germans were welcomed as liberators.Then they did their own atrocious behavior.Bloodlines were slaughtered by the Red army in retaliation.Human beings are as such.. merciless... atrocious...only God redeems us
So basically Russia has been bullying Ukraine for 8 years…
More like centuries.
"Great video certainly so considering the limited time frame.

Hope Ukrain can keep going for the next 2 or so weeks it takes for russia to completely get fucked from the economic damage and the russian populace to end this..."
"This doesn't sound right for one of the feared military in the world,  soldiers asking for directions, food and no plan for supplier, it' s like its the first time they're invading the country."
Do keep in mind that most of their soldiers are unwilling young conscripts who heretofore have never been on a real deployment.
Love the color scheme on the thumbnail
"A typical Soviet-Russian ( Chinese etc. ) failure : Nobody dares to tell the superiors if there is a serious fault or inadequacy somewhere , so the superiors and the Glorious Supreme Leader are under the delusion that everything is running percet."
"that logistics weakness is the reason why Russia troops seized nuclear power stations. just by storing ammunition and fuel beside nuclear sites, no one dare to attack them, so they could keep the supplies."
You mean the Nazis are invading Ukraine because that's what it is Russia is the new Nazi organisation.
"One of the things that you kind of did and didn't mention is that while the Russians can set up the logistics network of trainlines and pipelines, this is incredibly difficult in a country with an armed, resistant civillian population. It is also made more difficult by the fact that the Russians do not have air superiority."
"@Agring Please you don't spread disinformation. Maybe watch a video on BAYRAKTAR and learn what all constitutes ""air forces"". Further, to this day (Day 11 of the war) Ukraine claims it still has some jets in service."
"@Mike Taylor I mean that’s exactly what I’m saying, Russia easily have the capability to have Air Superiority, that’s a fact. But they can’t because the threat from the ground is too great. I’m just saying unlike previous wars the biggest threat to Russian aircraft isn’t other aircraft, it’s portable surface to air missiles like the stingers. And unlike second gulf war, we saw US using electronic warfare aircraft and equipment to counter SAM sites, but these are ineffective against stringers and other Personnel S to A missile systems. I’m was just making the point that air superiority in the traditional sense isn’t the problem."
@Digvijay Sisodia did they learn to stay away from the convoys?
@Dan those stingers that were sent pretty much keeps the russian airforce grounded they have plenty of experience with them from afghanistan back in the 80s where russian used to be able to do cas after the afghans got stingers russian troops had to do without cas
You should seriously sell this video to broadcast networks and NATO. They don't have any of this information in their broadcasts. All they are talking about is up to 9 million Ukrainians fleeing their country.
Any video just for likes
"Amature talk strategies , the veterans  talk logistics"
Too early to make any judgement...
NATO did a good job educating brave freedom fighters of Ukraine
"russia invading ukrine ""RUSH B"""
What I'm hearing is that a few tons of thermite on Russian railways could turn the tide in Ukraine
One reason why russia loosed for a while cuz they where sending troops without saying for what reason to go there
"This War is going as expected. Biggest issue I've seen on the internet is everyone has been so fed the illusion of Russian might for decades that anything else even from some ""Western"" people is believed to be lies and fake. 

Add to that, Russia'n trolls and other people from other places that want this to go well for Russia. Some compare this invasion of Ukraine to wars in other parts of the world when its not the same. Tell them that we are told its because we dont care about the people of that nation because of religion or color, I cant speak for the entire world but i very much care what happens in Syria for example and any other nation, NONE, no matter where you're from deserve this suffering. 

But some of these regions is very complicated and its almost impossible to ""FIX"" when so many over there dont want to fix anything until their enemies are dead. We got the same issue with Russia now, there is no talking Putin down from this, it would not matter what we had done or NATO had done, he will continue either way until someone inside stop him or he run out of material completely. 

I hope this does not turn out in to a prolonged war but its hard to know whats gonna happen, and the more desperate Russian leaders get the worse it might get.

What I've gone by in all this long before this started is how they struggle to keep their ships and planes and all that flying to begin with, the rations their soldiers have with them ran out of date 7 years ago, and also, they expected frozen grounds, its a mudpit, another reason they are all stuck along major roads. Plus ofc running out of fuel and food. Ukraine has destroyed as much fuel tankers and support as they can. I think I spend 5+ hours a day now following this horrible war Russia has started. :("
very informative content which helps me to understand the current progress of war activities in my close European neighborhood a little bit better. Thank You
Great content. Was worth the 6 ads
Very interesting information
Please keep in mind that comments is a person's viewpoints which one would prefer to a war for sure.
"God bless Anonymous, they are a great help in war."
"The axis alliance member, China will supply trucks and even military personnel for the invasion of Ukraine. China takes the role of WW2 Japan."
Quit pretending you're a expert in everything you talk about.
Incredible video man
Wow.  Just wow.
"You said they use analogic comms but I only picked up encrypted ones on the frequencies I know they use...
Some scrambled faxes, some scrambled teletype. For the dirst time I heard no cw comms (encrypted enigma style)

Seriously, I can't believe they don't use digital and secure comms even in field."
This is so WHOLESOME !!
"This my friend, is a marvelous, well thought out video. I don’t typically comment on YouTube videos, but how this was put together blew my mind. Your ending talking about how Russia compensated poor strategy for deadlier tactics on the Ukrainians was well thought out and honest. Extremely educational. +1000 and a SUB"
@Tom Swift You can't talk about that or you'll get cancelled
Did he mention that Ukraine is arming civilians and stationing troops among civilians? If he did I missed it.
First of i dont agree with this war... But saying the russian logistics has faild so early on in the war is plain stupid and only being made for people to click. You have no damn clue what you talk about so like the rest of youtube smart boys about this war. Shut it until there is clear fact about the war..
@Kevin Ya and if they make a movie on youtube its more prof of how wice they are. Its sickning.
"Everyone is considered an ""expert"" nowadays if they spend a few hours of research online and speak with confidence."
"sadly you dont need superior logistics if you can just threaten with your doomsday button you can press if you will die anyways
as bitter as it sounds but i kinda think that putin will make everyone lose if he loses"
Where's the brick propaganda?!!
8:30
Holy hell this needs to have more views. I’ve talked to too many people thinking that this issue could easily be resolved if we gave Ukraine air support and ground support. I don’t think they understand just what will happen if the US and NATO gets involved. Especially when going against another country that has as much military prowess as ours.
thank you so much for such a detailed and clear historical background as well as a thorough analysis of the current situation there!
The incessant Russophobia here is palpable. Not even a mention of the US-backed coup in Kiev in Feb 2014 😒🙄
"""Comrade Putin, a Ukrainian farmer stole our tank."""
16:50 if civilian testimony is to be believed The Ukrainian are the only one looting
Crap leader + crap soldiers (who were tricked into invading a country populated by people they consider friendsand even family in some cases) = crap effort.
"Hey, who wants to turn to Jesus and live for him and obey everything he says? This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son or daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I'm a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew 7:13-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It's not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God's presence forever where you're never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can't continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins  Jesus says to repent or perish (Luke 13:3) and you also have to follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn't rise from the dead. If you want more help watch the YouTube channel Cleveland street preachers he has been verified by the holy spirit so if you do watch him and not sure if what he says is true ask the holy spirit for confirmation and also ask the holy spirit to teach you and to guide you in case you haven't. 

Do any of you need prayer?

Only thing that will fail will be your propaganda. Btw Russia already achieved what it wanted if you didn't notice? LOL Donbas is Russian and that land is 2 times bigger than Crimea for example.
16:58 thats an ammo depo not a weapon
This is the first time I have seen a Wendover video.  Great discussion and well made.  -  Logistics are so important to any military operation.  Logistics was a principal cause of the quick collapse of the Afghanistan military after the US announced and began its withdrawal from the country.  The seeds of this collapse (logistics failure) were sown about 3 years earlier.   This would be a good topic for a future Wendover video.
@Ed L what i typed is simple enough to say in a video.   Being a troll has nothing to do with it.  This video is being seen by millions of people.  Broad generalization has its place in a video like this.
"@I Sheet From As Whole   First, the video is not meant to be comprehensive about all the war's aspect and of possible future actions.  It is about the ""logistics"" limitation that is affecting the Russian's progress.  I don't think you understood the video and may just be writing negative stuff, acting a troll.   And yes, there is a phase 2 or better called contingency planning to address the invasion's initial failures, as the original Russian plan for a quick occupation of the country and decapitation of the Ukrainian government fell apart.  The original plan was a failure as evidenced by the destruction of Russian forces attacking the airport Northwest of Kyiv (as one of many example) during the first days of the invasion.   -   You need to understand what the premise/ topic of a discussion is, if you intend to make any meaning full comments."
"Lol, Ukrainians are brilliant."
♥️
Russia showed the entire planet that they’re a fraud world power.
That's very impressive by the Ukrainian military and citizens. I wonder if they can hold out long enough for the sanctions' effect on the oligarchs to cause Putin to commit suicide by shooting himself twice in the back of the head
"This is some top tier journalism, well done and thank you for this interesting video!"
"lol russia practically won the war, but apparently ""she had logistical problems"" lol bunch of stupid propagandists."
"I hope the Russians learn from this and modernize their army. It's ridiculous at this point.
I would also like to see logistics videos for the U.S.A army and Chinese army."
Wow. Hope they fix those issues and everybody has fun
"Sorry Putin, no lend-lease this time"
@Hollywood like what? Our govt isn't full of Russian agents this time?
The whole world sees that Russia is the aggressor. And no amount of propaganda will change that!
"Good documentation of what happened since Crimea, but it fails to provide context or any explanation of why this happened.  The discussion starts after the 2014 coup d'etat and never even mentions it.  Poor Ukraine is a football kicked back forth between USA and Russia."
How did it happen so quickly if Russia has been fighting alongside pro-Russian Ukrainians since 2014?
"Don't use conditioner to wash out radioactive dust from your hair because it causes it to stick to your skin. Good video. Looting and propaganda are part of every conflict in history. All the aggressor has to do is eliminate equipment and infrastructure to achieve it's political goal. They do not need to worry about time. Summer is coming.  It will cost ordinary people greatly but the Russian gov has been waiting for this moment for a long time, it would appear, their debt to GDP ratio is in a better place to support this war.  Choose your ""elected"" leaders more carefully my fellow homo""sapiens."""
"Also Ukraine used USSR's strategy, they concentrated milatary in the cities and stopped people from flying away From cities, using them as army ,also as human shield. Because of this with logistics failure, of Russian invasion slowed down near the cities."
"Russia needs to be de-leninized, de-stalinized and de-putinized. There is no way we are just letting Russia be after this, no shot."
Drone
Tactics decide the outcomes of battles but logistics decide the outcomes of wars.
I love the thought: It's justified because they might take back what we took from them!
"Great in-depth analytics, I agree on most of the facts you mentioned in this video. Unfortunately as with all wars propaganda is doing it's job very well, for both sides so it is really hard to distinct what is the truth, since both sides use the same videos presenting them in the manner it fits to their agenda. I think that Ukraine army and morale are in more dire situation than it is displayed on social networks, especially in last 2 days, Russians from Donbas ( DPR and LPR )  moved a front towards the west, and Russian units from Crimea linked with them. Nevertheless, I think that time works for the Russian army,  as you mentioned, they can quickly build logistics infrastructure. Hope Ukraine people will find a way to prevail and that peace negotiations will bear the fruit."
"Where did you get your source material? I thought early on they had logistics problems, but all I could find was anecdotal evidence.  The news has been frustratingly lacking in hard info.  How many ran out of gas?  Where?  How many abandoned?  Where?  And so on.  Where did you get the info on interdicting the rail lines?  I have never heard of this before.  Tactically, it appears that Russia has not secured its lines of communication with cavalry, which begs the question: when is Ukraine going to counter-attack forces in march formation?   Again, without hard militarily relevant info, it's hard to assess the situation."
"@Skyler Green yes. Over the russian logística, i would give props to the strong ukranians sharing info and their guerrilla resistance. 
The video also IS dumb for praising ""west logística"" leading to success. Given the US with its seemingly andless supply chain still didnt get what they wanted in both Vietnam and Afganistán... Both of wich they also caused ridículos colateral damage (adressin that moving ending about civilians suffering). They were in middle east for literally decades to achive nothing. But yes. Supplies are the key to success, i Guess."
"As for proofs, I mostly see a bunch of tech in fields filmed by people on Facebook, which could always be fake, sure, but it’s just sooo much! And also so many pictures if destroyed machines with happy captions from proud Ukrainian farmers who got their own “trophy from those pigs”. Make me feel proud to be Ukrainian!"
"The rail thing was mentioned in Ukrainian news media, I read it like last week. They don’t put up much info on positions, concrete amounts and locations online (talking about the Ukrainian side) so that the enemy can’t use it to their advantage (i.e. know our next target). Most info on movement is discussed in chat bots between civilians who see something move in the contryside and the army or territorial defense to know were the movement should be stopped. And you won’t get any info from the Russian side, cause they are again “almost not here, not shelling, not shooting, just a special operation that is going tooootaly according to plan”."
"Pretty good analysis.

One thing nobody seems to notice or failes to mention though is the improvement of the personal combat equipment from the Russian soldiers.
It took mayor leaps in that area, in the last conflicts there soldiers where running around on Nike shoes, had no body armor/decent helmets, hell they didnt even all have camouflaged uniforms.
So that's something i guess."
I like how even Russia manages to use socialism into their millitary and still fail. Lol
"Please keep in mind, this is a western propaganda channel financed by western governments. If Russia is failing so bad, why are people fleeing? Why is Ukraine emptying its prisons, (which is a last ditch effort) for more fighters? How does this channel know what Russian strategy really is? If Russia was planning so far ahead as claimed, how could they possibly run out of fuel? The US invasion of Iraq also took much time. In the next few weeks we will see what garbage this channel is."
very lucid analysis. good job.
"I hope China's military is just as bad. This is just laughable. Must be from all the corruption and shady deals. This is what a country looks like when run by strongmen, they usually have shitty armies because they're too busy filling their pockets and barely funding their people and military."
Well Russia is corrupt and government running something is rather a weak point
For reference: 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine
This video is so brilliant that I just signed up for Curiosity and Nebula just to say thank you.
"The Russians are losing personnel, equipment and time. Time is of the essence as with the sanctions as thy are now - the country is losing millions of dollars every day. They're not making any profit on all of the oil and gas that was being exported to Europe, which to Putin's surprise found an alternative in the Middle East. The world's energy sector is no more as we've known it and with the realization that has this conflict been for the Western world and the ability to adapt and survive without Russia - it might about start to spell the beginning of the end for the country. The country can only go for so long before it starts collapsing under its own weight. For now it's not happening but in a couple of weeks as soon as stockpiles of imported goods run dry - the country will enter a downward spiral and the internal problems will put an effective stop to any offensive campaign."
"I spent 10 years working as a military contractor here in America. Take my words for what they are, we are sending thousands of military contractors to Ukraine. Russia is not failing, Russian logistics are not failing, this is how they fight. Truth is Nato is buying all the gas masks and chemical suits. They are hiring every single business that make bomb shelters (big and small) America politicians are preparing for a large war. Real DEFCON levels are not reviled to the public. People I know that still work as military contractors are telling me it’s DEFCON 2 and they are being hired by the thousands to go to Ukraine whixh Russia will take as an act of war. Russia is building forces on Sweden’s broader. This video is a complete lie, DO NOT under Estimate Russia. This is a feel good video and sticking your head in the sand soothing your feelings is the worse thing you can do. Legacy media and you tubers and social media people are all in an echo chamber, none of them are reporting facts about what’s happening. It’s all gossip. I’m a proud America, I’m not pro Russia or Ukraine. Both are tyrant regimes. My point is I’m not on either side, I care about my country and I’m tired of democrats destroying this country and just giving it away. They are jeopardizing our freedom and our prosperity for their own gain in power."
"You know whats funny? When Russia destroys a Ukrainian propaganda tv station western channels like Wendover Productions call it a war crime. 
But when Ukraine destroys civilian oil tankers, they don't call it a war crime and they even gloat about it claiming Russia failed with its logistics. 
And when i point this out they call me a troll? Yet im pretty sure that by definition, gloating of someones failure is what trolling is. So really this is a troll video!"
"It's entirely possible that everything so far is exactly how Russia has planned it. The small force it sent to Kyiv wasn't meant to get a quick and easy surrender, but to distract while they set up an attack base just close enough for artillery to reach the city."
"Damaged railways can be repaired and I am sure that is what most of those Russian railway troops are doing right now. The hard part of building a rail line is choosing a route and doing earthworks (filling gravel bedding to gradients ets.), but once done it is very difficult to sabotage.  Laying tracks, slippers included, is the easier part of the job. You can sabotabe the tracks, but those are relatively easy to repair, and even if you tear the slippers too as the Germans did in WW2, it san still be repaired relatively easily."
"takes time and resources to do, in which logistics get the final say."
"There is something to be said about pre-emptively digging and burying high explosives under perfectly maintained railway,  to either detonate with a pressure sensor, under a train,  or remotely in conjunction with a surveillance drone."
"Many of the railways were destroyed using ammonium nitrate, and ohh boy does the Ukraine have allot of that (as they use it as fertilizer)  and not just in one spot either, multiple segments on the stretch of track have been obliterated, so that's a significant amount of rail and craters that will have to be built and backfilled again to make the rails operational again, and as other people said above it doesn't stop a cell of Ukrainian saboteurs from doing it again once the tracks are repaired. Further more to spite Russia they probably would do it as a train is passing to cause a derailment, which is far more catastrophic of a loss for Russia as instead of just a few trucks, a entire train and its supplies gets wreaked, and it would take allot of manpower and resources to fix that problem. you see now where the problem with Russia's logistics come in, its too vulnerable to attack where had they perfected supply lines like the west did its much less vulnerable to attack in convoys."
can’t repair and build bridges that fast tho
They have to hold the territory in order to build the rail line which is why the rail line system is only successful within their own borders and not on foreign soil.
"All Putin will get out of this is crippling sanctions, loss of rights for his own people, and most importantly evidence to the world how weak and pathetic his military is.  I’m shocked he went through with invading Ukraine, but even more shocked on how incompetent his army is.  Russia is a joke."
Russia: ✍️ Rethink ✍️ logistics...
"It SURE would be bad if someone funded all the separatists in Russia...
But seriously, if the entire world knows your military's flaw, then how do you not know it and fix it?"
"There was a Twiiter thread by a Russian scholar about the state of the Russian military. 
Defence Minister Anatoly Serdyukov - appointed in 2007 - he led much needed reforms to modernise the army. He reorganised the makeup of military units to reflect western standards; reduced the size of the officer corps to prioritise quality over quantity; streamlined the process to churn out new military hardware tailer-made for modern warfare; improved accountabiliy of the budget by monitoring expenses much strictly. These reforms allowed the Russian military to evolve into a sophisticated modern armed force. 
So why the Russians managed to royally fuck-up the entire invasion through sheer shocking incompetence? Well, the minister that I just mentioned was apparently fired for - and here's the surprise: for doing his fucking job in 2012. The fine chap apparently made a lot of enemies within the defence ministry. Many detested him for being a civilian (In Russia, DMs are usually a high ranking military officer) and being a competent person because competency spares no space for corruption, which the officers obviously didn't like. 
In his place, a compliant dude named Sergey Shoigu was appointed as DM. He's a general, which is a plus for the MoD general staff and a good obedient kid, who will turn a blind eye to any anomalies within the MoD.
The end result is something I don't think I have to reiterate."
@Kappa Spinning You're literally insane
"Thank you dude for sharing this info, it makes so much sense now why Putin‘s war has been going badly."
"@Kappa Spinning, what kind of drugs are you smoking? Putin as representative to extraterrestrials? I wouldn't put Putin in charge of a Chuck E Cheese."
"Russian logistics isn’t failing, this false sense of security been fed by legacy media and you tubers is miss informing people. The pinned comment is gas lighting anyone’s opinion you defers. Research the history of Russian military tactics. Russians do not care about casualties the way America does. Russia sends in their weakest first and then surround the enemy with their stronger better equipped forces. Ukraine is making defensive positions ontop of civilians, it’s part of the narrative. That away civilians will be killed and they can say Russia did it. I’m not pro Russia and I’m most definitely not pro Ukraine. Both are bad, both have killed innocent people for beliefs and political gain. Ukraine doesn’t have an ace pilot and all this talk of glory from Ukraine soldiers is false. Innocent people have been killed on both sides. Their is real journalist actually on the ground over there that aren’t making videos and editing them from the comfort of their home like this guy. The guys on the ground have the real footage that isn’t just videos clips pasted togthwr while he talks and gives his opinion overlaid ontop of video. You need to ask yourself why does everyone want you to believe Russia is failing? There is no proof or facts in this video. It’s just video clips and the empty words of some guy on YouTube sitting in his house on his couch with a bag of chips and a soda. After he gets done editing this video he will probably turn on porn as he is lonely and then fall asleep."
Putin brought the world together 🤣
"Nonsense, you are not an expert at all.... How do you know Kyiv was their grand prize?  Kyiv is only a grand prize when Putin would expect government to surrender. But if government runs to the west, Kyiv does not matter anymore. Anyone who does know something about WOII, could know the allied forces did not want to liberate Paris .... They would have a logistics problem ...

When Russia takes Kyiv, the western countries will tell Russia to take care of the civilians in Kyiv, and then the Russians will have serious logistics problem .... I never expected Russians to take Kyiv at once.

Russia also has to communicate with China and India ... Azov headquarters is in Mariupol .... China and India do know they are neo-nazis ...."
"I can't be absolutely certain, but it's unfortunate this video has most assumptions wrong and many details are suspect. For example the idea that Kyiv was the ""grand prize"" of the invading force."
"@The Dwight Mamba According to news I've looked at, I think so. The bulk of the fighting is going on in the East of Ukraine. The Russian military has experience fighting in Syria and it looks like they're using the same strategy to accomplish their objectives. Individual clips on twitter are not representative of the scene as a whole, and frequently get debunked within 24 hours."
So you are assuming that assumptions are wrong?
How can we solve the problems of the human kind if we still have to solve shit like this? Stop war!
"Russia has bigger problems than this war, like their declining population. Good one Putin you’re just helping the acceleration of the decline of births in the country!! BRAVO"
If i was Ukraine i would give up no way you were winning that the president killed thousands just cause he didnt wanna give up
Great Content.
"sun tzu once said; if you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles, if you know yourself but not the enemy for every viktory gained you'll also suffer a defeat, if you know niether the enemy nor yourself you will succom in every battle.

someone didn't do their homework."
"Excellent video. I’m so impressed by the valiant, honourable Ukrainian people! I believe they will ultimately prevail, but the costs will be huge. I fear for the innocent civilians. Those of us in the civilized world must do all we can to help Ukraine. The Russian people will pay a heavy toll for their dogged determination to ignore the lessons of history. Yet again, they have ceded control of the nation that rightly belongs to them to a tyrannical regime, whose leader will end up with his head on a spike, leaving a broken, rudderless pariah state that will be ripe for the picking for the next sociopathic overload, and so the cycle continues. Have the Russian people really failed to learn that a nation’s greatest comes not from its leaders, but from its people?"
"9:10 LOL. The person in this video got her makeshift cocktail all over her arm. Luckily for her and her stupidity, there was no binding agent"
Russia owns the Ukraine. There is no need to rush a closure since talks are on the table. If a settlement is possible there's no need to battle. If the talks fall apart then you will see a full force closure of the country. Wishful thinking is a road best avoided because reality always wins.
"It's just a stumbling block. The real reality is that somehow the west was able to pit brother against brother. These politicians lied to their people, stole the countries wealth (Russian and Ukrainian) and now ask their people to pickup the slack once more and lay down their lives while they left the country and are sitting in their villas in France, England, Belgium, Bahamas, and such. Sooner or later the russian Army will regroup, make a final push, and more people die needlessly all the while Nato sits behind the border in Poland, and waits to see who the viktor will be. Even if Ukraine defends itself and pushes the Russians out, the European union will once again deny Ukraine membership. People of Ukraine suffer more from the west lying to them. You never know, Ukranians just might say screw you NATO, you don't want to help? Well then we side with Russia"
So the Red Dawn movies about the Russians and N. Koreans coming here are logistically impossible. Pheww. I was worried about that after watching them.
Pretty sure Russia is easily winning right now so not sure how it's a logistical error other than western media fake news propaganda.
"For something completely different - I was reluctant to subscribe to the curiositystream/nebula; had you (or anybody, for that matter) mentioned it *does not* require DRM, I would have done it years ago."
"Yes, we all know that west has much more experience in attacking forom countries, far from it's boreders."
"Wendover, Thank you for educating us on something new! Always good to see your name on youtube! :)"
"Putinsky is an old school warlord.  A window into the past, the worst of humanity.  Up until the last couple of centuries, nations and empires were created and ruled by psychopaths.  In general, Western civilization has been more advanced and enlightened in that regard."
Remove this video. Russia will learn from you and improve.
Lol
"Very informative video , thank you!"
Never forget an 225 a small loss no where near compared to the many lives but still a shame
"Thank you for covering the topic! This video describes the Russian invasion of Ukraine waaaay better than most of the politic or army focused channels out there! 

Mad respect to Ukrainian people for standing up to the invaders 💙💛✊"
"What makes you think it's a country conquer? If Russia wanted to take over a country of this size, then it would probably end on the same day it began. You have a completely illogical conquer theory. For Putin, the goal of the military operation is the demilitarization of the country. In Ukraine at the state level there are such battalions as Azov, etc. For some reason, you are missing a bunch of facts that are unfavorable to your position. If you find out that there are official paramilitary Nazi battalions in Ukraine, will you split into two parts or what? The world is not black and white, it has an unlimited number of colors that you do not notice, but prefer only contrast. You cannot have a villain attack a villain, no, for you there is only a villain who fights the innocent and wise clown Zelensky."
It’s so satisfying seeing russia get its ass kicked.
"While the analysis regarding the russian deficiencies seem pretty spot on, i think its a bit too early to proclaim that western nations are just so much better at it. Would the US really do THAT much better when thrown hastily into the battle in small numbers? Imagine a NATO force making an incursion into russia with partisans and a battle-hardened professional army with modern AA and anti-tank system in support. It would be a slough for every army. (Especially if you outrun your truck supply lines and have not such a good railway corps)."
"USA lost 2500 soldiers in 20 years in Afghanistan while simultaneously rebuilding infrastructure. Russia has lost more troops in 11 days, right across their own border. It's not even close at this point."
Excellent explanation!
Professional liar
thanks for the video
Ukraine  CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS.
Bastards robbing food from Ukrainian grocery stores....
This is the second episode of the invasion of Finland
"I want to thank you, Wendover Productions, for all the work you put into this video. Specifically, for filling in the gaps of my understanding about the conflict, and a more complete context regarding the Russian military as it was deployed around Ukraine. I now have a clearer picture of what is going on, a better understanding as I take in more information in the future. Again, Дякую!"
"If you are going to invade a country, do it swift and effectively. So don't be like Russia, this is the second time they've fucked up an invasion 1st Finland and now Ukraine."

Great video. Sad that war is still something we have to deal with in this modern era.
11:11 remember when russia thought those dumb cages could protect against a Javelin missile or an NLAW? lol
Ukrainian soldiers should sneak into Russia and mine those supply train's.
"Putins watching this like, “ohhhh”"
"16:00 you can't be serious
Their ONLY ""successful"" war was ww2 where the USA basically gave them their entire logistics trucks fleet, among tons of other aid. They failed against the Japanese, the Afghan, and barely won only backwoods conflicts. There is no ""Productive might of the people"" there is no economy. Are you suggesting slave labor?"
"Yes, our government is out of control. Somehow, starving people is more humane than physical violence.  I was terminated from O.S.M.H. for not releasing my vaccination status. Now I am 55yrs old with no unemployment insurance, no income, no severance because they said I was terminated with cause. The one lawyer I contacted basically said he didn't want to see me because it's legal. It's been over 3 months since termination and I'm now out of money to live and support my dependant. I'm just now starting to be able to speak out because of the pain they caused me. I'm a highly specialised biomedical engineer that supported all the local hospitals. Vaccination status was never a term for employment when hired. When and if I can find a job in my field of study, what is to prevent them from terminating me in the future. I am a victim of illegal acts by both my governments and employer but, not one to play the victim card. What do you recommend I do not willing to divulge my medical information? P.S. I'm not Typhoid Mary and if I was, I would isolate myself without a mandate!"
Any comments?
"I mean Russia did not build its army for invasions like America 
So it rly does not have nor expirience nor logistics for large scale invasions"
"They haven’t failed yet, it is failing tho. Slavs ukryiny"
"I like your positivity, a well earned like."
"I stopped watching after 1 min. Sadly this is yet another western 'documentary' that is backing the Ukrainian claims that russian seperatists ""conquered"" Krim, Donbass/Luhansk in 2014. This is a 100% lie and misinformation. Those are russian speaking Ukrainians who have been living there for endless generations. Just like french speaking people live in Canada, dutch speaking people live in belgium, and so on. Following the story that these people are all occupants is exactly the main source of the hypocracy and double standards the west is using, and a total lack of recognition that russian speaking Ukrainians even excist. The real reason there has been a civil war since 2014 is because the first law of the new president, after the US and EU sponsored and pushed coup, was to ban the russian language in schools and tv while 33% of the country (14million people) speaks russian. This same president said ""they better go to their cellars instead of school in Donbass"" before starting to bomb his own civilians. Democratic referendums for independance were refused (like it goes in a EU democracy, remember Catalonia), so the russian speaking provinces defended their rights and fought back. Off course with the help of Russia. Imagine the Wallonie people in Belgium suddenly say, Belgium is ours and no more speaking dutch. I think the flemish would also go to the border and ask help from the dutch speaking Netherlands. For 8 years there have been 13000 deaths and nobody was schocked or saw anything, and now that russia got envolved, the first wounded civilian is on the frontpage of all the western newspapers and we are all fully supporting Ukraine's ideas of ethnic cleansing of russian speaking ukrainians. It's just sick, no other words for it. This current president Zelenskyy only got elected with a big margin because he promised to stop the war in Donbass. 2 weeks later he forgot about that promise and starting talking about nukes again..."
I'd like to see a video on humanitarian logistics!
"Yay, trains. Oh no..."
Western military let strategy lead logistics while Russian military lets logistics lead strategy. That’s an interesting way to look at it and that explains why Russians have so many casualties
@Fat Tracks Ty 👍

I accidentally dislikes this video for like 2 seconds and I’d just like to publicly apologize.

Russian government tends to be very reckless.  That recklessness caused the Chernobyl reactor meltdown.  Several Russian nukular submarines have melted down at sea.

"at first I thought Russia have some logistical problems, but why do they giving out supplies to Ukrainian civilians for free when they themself are desperately needed it?"
West is deluded...they are not failed..it's part of how their operations are set up. I'm fir truth no silly fiction
EDITED VEDIO   AND FAKE IMAGES
Hmmm..... nice bot. If only it could speak English properly.
"Jesus, what a bunch of bs propaganda, Lmao. Half of the stuff you mentioned are not true at all, Russians push old vehicles first and when they get destroyed they just leave them because they are junk. The point is that you represent that like a bad thing, but it's not, they are not dumb. First comes weak and old stuff and young soldiers. Second, Russia could absolutely burn whole Ukraine from the sky like the USA did to Iraq, bomb the shit out of them for like two months and then enter on foot, but that's not the point, we are talking about really careful operation, with minimum civillian casualties, that's why it takes more time too. No, Ukrainians don't have a chance at all. Don't spread false hope because people are dying for literally nothing, and that clown and NATO's puppet Zelensky is killing his own people by not surrendering, he knows he don't stand a chance against Russia. Russians will get their plans done, no doubt about that, don't be dumb. Ukraine is winning only on twitter and on mainstream media."

well put together....
Ahh the shiefflin plan of modern day
The fact Putin says “I decided” make him guilty of the war crimes he’s committing.
"In your mind they may have failed, but in the real world Russia is still advancing across Ukraine."
What was the rest of Putin's speech...looks like it was cherry picked for that one comment.
"""... Or painted over the roadsigns to say 'Welcome to Hell.'""

Gotta hand it to Ukrainians, they certainly have style."
God Bless You
This is a NATO failure. Had they given Russia a warning perhaps this level of attack would not have happened but although I watched this build-up on the news I didn't hear one word from NATO or the EU and the rest of Democratic countries who are not part of NATO.
God Bless You
Paper map? Cant they use google map?
@Jasper oh yeah the Russians cant connect to Ukraine's cellular network. Haha silly me.
"I think they need internet for this, and I guess Ukrainians shut down their cell towers if they find out that the cellular network is used :P"
I think it was a crucial mistake they didn't cut off telecommunications - in a country with latest network capabilities and free media!
Propaganda.
"If China has to invade Taiwan, it would be more difficult than that, especially when Taiwan has a robust military and strong allies on its side!"
"I appreciated this post, it certainly answered many of my questions. What is unfortunately forgotten or simply ignored is the human factor and the determination and conviction of 'Ukrainian civilians' who also are playing an important role. If all the mobile phone photography/videos are to be believed, Russian regime were/are not entirely honest with its justification for its invasion. Reasonably large numbers of Russian civilians as well as it's military are not supportive of Putin or this action in particular. Interesting report that the Belarusian army refuse to enter Ukrain. Please don't ask me for my factual data. I have none, just international reportage and updates from others actually on the ground."
"Putin: ""Shock and Awe"" didn't work for the Americans in Iraq, but it will surely work for us.
Ukrainians: Go **** yourself, Russian warship.

Also Putin: Let's leave our money in European banks, because that will earn us 2% interest and surely they'll allow us to access that money after we start the largest war in Europe since WWII.
EU: lol.

It certainly hasn't helped Putin that he censors information, discussion, debate, and protests, and then he surrounds himself by sycophants. That is the source of his problems."
Russia. War criminals. Great video!
"9:47 Lol Ukrainian towns painting over their signs with ""Welcome to hell"" is smart but also pretty funny."
"Great video, thanks for sharing. 👍"
How exactly are Russian conscripts innocent? Are they shooting their officers in droves? Are they surrendering en masse?
Why is Russia attacking Keith?!
"The first casualty in any conflict is the TRUTH. It's a great shame that Wendover productions, one of my favorite channels on YouTube and a previously non-political channel is now pushing fog of far propaganda to generate a narrative-- or worse manufacturer consent for intervention that would lead to WWIII. If anyone wants real information about what has been going on-- basically the reality is that there has been a civil war in Ukraine for 8 years and we have been building up to this moment. I encourage independent/libertarian minded folks to watch/listen to Jimmy Dore, The Gray Zone, Scott Ritter or Col. Douglas Macgregor if you want to understand what is actually happening on the ground. Many academics and intellectuals alike from Chomsky to former US ambassadors have warned and stated that NATO expansion to Ukraine is a terrible mistake and would lead to this conflict. This is by NO MEANS an endorsement of any state actors actions but a simple reality and 35,000ft view of what has and has been transpiring for over a decade leading up to this moment. I can speak for myself that I don't come to Wendover for ministry of truth-esque information parroting identical mainstream media talking points; I come to Wendover to be uniquely entertained and informed about economics, aviation and other misc. strong suits of the channel not found elsewhere. Unfortunately I am unsubscribing from this channel until it goes back to its original formula that made it so great to begin with."

@Denis_48 I wish it were tbh
@Local Dude Haha nice joke.
Please do a video on the fact that Ukraine broke the Minsk ll agreement killed 4 Russian peace negotiators in 2014 who went to Ukraine in 2014 for diplomatic talks and the fact that Ukraine has been killing Russian civilians in the Donbas region by shelling for the last 8 years !!!!
I think this video doesnt show the full Picture. It seems to indicate that russia is in a worse position than what it appears through many other sources of information
@David Dunmer but you said about the full picture and russia is definetely not doing well in logistics
@Igor Ribeiro I was talking of logistics as well.
This video is only talking about the logistics of the russian army
"10:00 is where the video lost a bit of credibility, I have with very basic consumer equipment a GPS that can navigate, weather wristwatch, cell phone or handheld device availalbe for super cheap. 

I also can't imagine a first world army with unencrypted comms, no matter how low budget they are (which the russians are not)

Smells a bit like propaganda to be quite honest."
You are overestimating the russians
Ukraine actually used their drone to blow up a fuel train in Russia on day 7 or 8 which Russia was desperately needing to continue their push. I’m just hoping Ukraine is somehow eliminating access to their fuel in the areas Russia is taking over or occupying
western silly propaganda

From all of us watching. Thank you
"Geez man the hypocrisy of listening to an american talk about the subject is top notch cringe worthiness.
Lets forget about the past 60yrs,50yrs,40yrs,30yrs,20yrs hostile Us over seas, lets call it ""intervention"" shall we....and with a stable kill rate of civilians world wide of around 370k people annually...
You see i think what triggers the yanks in this is the fact that putin didint bomb his own people in a staged false flag insode job type of event.... rather hes been saying for yrs what would happen if things persisted and boom things persisted and he did what he said he would do...
I dont care what the russians say, but the fact you even feel the need to ignore the past 60yrs of your own war loving history to voice an obnoxious opinion on a conflict which your nation was crucial in creating and ascertaining and facilitating is beyond disgusting and disgraceful....genuinely *STFU*"
"@ErectusVonCockenstein You are failing to note a key difference between all the US interventions and the Russian invasion... Every country the US has intervened in is still an independent nation. The American flag has not been planted anywhere new since World War II, when the US took over administrative control of several former Japanese colonies. Of these colonies, most would seek (and receive) independence afterwards. One of them, the Northern Mariana Islands, remains a willing part of the United States today. Many of the others have chosen to maintain very close ties to the USA (The Compact of Free Association), but are ultimately independent countries free to make their own decisions.

In comparison, Russia has annexed part of Ukraine for themselves and Putin is actively suggesting that if Ukraine doesn't capitulate soon, they will never have a state of their own again."
"@Jarynn aha i see so the two ships blown up werent in any way part of the recruitment campaign and subsequently used to justify military presence...
Tell me why did the Us intervene in libya?
How many countries has the Us invaded in the last 60 odd yrs....

Whats russias excuse for invading ukraine....is russia reason more valid then any of the Us excuses in the last 60yrs...."
"@ErectusVonCockenstein You spoke of the US bombing its own citizens to justify a war. The only conflicts I can think of that started with US assets being attacked were the Spanish American War, World War II, and the War in Afghanistan.

The justifications for the First Gulf War were to protect Kuwait's territorial sovereignty and also a not insignificant amount of fear that Saddam might push into Saudi Arabia, an ally of the United States, next. Most evidence available at the time suggested Iraq was making plans to push forward into Saudi territory. And thus, the King of Saudi Arabia requested American assistance.

The justification for Vietnam was that France, a close ally of the US, requested American assistance. After France pulled out, the justification shifted to protecting South Vietnam."
"@Jarynn did i mention 9/11 anywhere?
How was american intervention in the first gulf war justified?
How was american intervention in the vietnam war justified?"
*Kiev
This war will be taught as the first war reported by civilians through TikTok in the future

"@Chad Gaston  He underestemated the ukraine , because once again he and his Dictatorship like goverment made same mistake every Dictatoship makes at some point!   Beliveing in their own propaganda/lies  ,when they shoul have and could have know better !  Most problem they face now were pretty well known! Like the people in most of ukraine view russia very differntly than the people of donbas and Luhansk! That and many more!"
Sure there was. Putin just was too stupid to plan it.
Amazing content. Subbed.
Yeah shooting in the military is the easy part logistics is the hard part

"It is so beautiful, This is one of the best documentaries"
There is no single European nation capable of war away from its lands even they admitted only US.
@Jarynn they barely can deploy few hundreds soldiers without US help. Not to mention all mechanized force or full scale invasion. It is hard even when you have all resources at disposal as Russians have.
"Eh, France and the UK have both proven relatively capable of deploying forces away from their homeland. Though the US is definitely the absolute king at it. A century of conflicts on the other side of the planet means the US has always had a ton of focus placed on supply lines."
"Djeezes, you remind me why I puke about US geo politics!"
"When I went to sign up for the Curiosity Steam + Nebula bundle, it forced me to a page that said I already had access to Curiosity Stream as a customer of Optimum. But now how to I access Nebula?"
If Russia can barely hold their own here then how would they expect to go head to head with US/NATO without nukes?!
They can't.
"How do we know what the Russians’ expectations were? It doesn’t matter what independent analysts agree on, because they’re not privy to the kremlin’s plans. At this point in the war, the Russians have moved faster than the Germans in WW3 and the Americans in Iraq. You can’t achieve this with a complete failure in logistics.

The war’s barely started and we’re already declaring winners and losers."
"@Rick Keep in mind that France was also a near peer adversary to Germany, as in the two nations had relatively similar capabilities. Ukraine has nothing on Russia in terms of population, resources, or military technology.

As for the Invasion of Iraq, we must also compare numbers. Ukraine has 170,000 active duty soldiers. Russia amassed around 220,000 soldiers. The Iraqi Army had just shy of 400,000 soldiers and the US brought 300,000. This meant the US was actually significantly outnumbered, compared to Russia's operations where they hold a strong numerical advantage. Furthermore, Russia boasts more resources, better supply lines (on paper), and significantly more advanced military hardware than Ukraine. On the other hand, Iraq's army was actually pretty well equipped and trained. People tend to forget that Iraq was a regional power player before 2003. Saddam's forces were no joke.

During the invasion, the US and its allies lost around 200 personnel to Iraq's 30,000 losses. In comparison, Russia has lost somewhere between 2,000 and 6,000 men to Ukraine's 1,000 to 3,000 men.

No matter how you slice it, Russia's invasion has been a trainwreck. They are likely still going to win through sheer brute force, but lets not pretend this is going according to plan... Unless we want to operate under the assumption Putin wanted to make the Russian military look like fools and suffer way more causalities than necessary."
@Dennis Bowen the battle of France took a whole six weeks. Russia already controls at least a fourth of Ukrainian land. Keep in mind Ukraine’s larger than France.
Russia ain't moving faster than Germany in ww2.
From Russia. With love. On Ukraine.
Media didnt care about Putin's massacre in Alleppo and no one gave him backlash for it in 2016 so it happened again taking other innocents lifes
Key-ev.  Not keev.
"@Billy Croan Eh, I did poorly phrase it, but to clarify... The pronunciation guides provided by the city universally recommend 'Keev' because the way Ukrainians actually pronounce it involves a sound that English speakers are unaccustomed to and thus struggle to make. It is two syllables in Ukrainian, but it is not pronounced the same as Kiev (as in the dish Chicken Kiev). As I understand it, the pronunciation of Kiev in American English does actually pretty closely match the Russian pronunciation."
"@Jarynn Do you live there?  Are you even from there?  You are correct about the spelling. But the pronunciation is key-ev. Source: a friend I lived with for 2 years, they were born in Ukraine and came over with his entire family who also pronounce it key-ev. Two syllables.  Your media is lying to you and this isn't the first time the invent new pronunciations of words to get attention"
"According to the people who live there, its Kyiv, pronounced Keev. Kiev and its associated pronunciation date back to the USSR and stem from Russian dialects. The Kyiv pronunciation stems from Ukrainian dialects and better matches what they actually call their city."
prepared for eight years and ran out of fuel in a day.. sounds like propaganda.
"Russia hasn't failed its just that Putin didn't choose the American way of invasion by totally destroying and annihilating the territory rather he chose a more civilized and clinical way of invading, if he wanted he could have asked his airforce to go full sicko and just flatten Ukraine it would hardly take him 4-5 days for that but that's not what he chose he clearly wants to keep the civilian casualties as less as possible unlike what America and the NATO did in the middle east."
"@Trojan Horse
Of which a huge portion of those jets are in storage, are outdated and aren't logistically feasible to feild.

The Russian airforce had the element of surprise and weren't able to disable ukraines SAM network, airforce or radar systems.

And no, just saying :they're at war' doesn't cut it.
Since day1 they've been hitting residential and non military zones in the cities with artillery and aircraft and have literally been shooting at evacuating civilians escaping from karkiv.

They've also been shooting at and blowing up other nations ships in the balck sea as well and have been killing their own wounded and shooting their own soldiers.

Every step of this invasion has gone wrong for them."
@Trojan Horse never got that high in one week regardless pal.
"There is no winning this war for Putin. There has long been split opinions in Ukraine, should they be European leaning, Russian leaning, a neutral country... All Putin did with this war, and the invasion of Crimea previously, is provide the people of Ukraine with a common enemy to unify against. He thought it would be a quick an easy victory, but instead was met with the best equipped and most well-organized guerilla army in history. On top of that, the sanctions from the West have frozen or even seized 350 billion in Russian assets, while this war is costing Russia 1 to 1.5 billion dollars per day. That's not even in rubles, the value of which is tanking. Not only did Putin want to win this war quickly for the sake of his logistics, he also needs to if he wants to save its country from bankrupting itself."
I like how anybody can understand a countries battle plans nowadays. 😂😂😂 Thanks to vids like this everyone knows what Putin is/was trying to do! 😂😂😂
Impressive research!
Let’s hope they go back to rail and the Ukrainians sabotage their rail network to cause all of these cars to derail at speed resulting in destroyed tanks and military equipment
"I'm glad Putin is too _daft_ to take notes on this video if he ever comes up with a fake reason to watch it.

Seriously though, let's show our support for an end to the conflict in some way, and a good way to start is to be informed. Thanks again for another informative video Wendover!"
Intereseting topic. Why cant NATO react vs failed organisation by Russia vs much weaker country?
The civilians stop being civilians when they started targeting field trucks. And to be honest most of that cities are still intact wait till they finally get pissed off and decide to actually level the cities morons need to get out of there quick.
@Dennis Bowen  lol 🤣 good work point out my poor sentence structure but don't attack the argument. Lol
Wait until you learn proper sentence structure before anyone takes you seriously.
Stop lying 🤥
"I dont think they ever planned to capture kiev on the second day, they just got close enaugh for the russian artillery and stuff so they prepare there for the next attacking wave."
@Jarynn In austria the german name is kiew and most would translate it to kiev idk why tbh.
"@Daniel Marcher Kiev is a Soviet name for the city that represents Russian pronunciations. Kyiv is the Ukrainian name for the city and better reflects what the people who live there actually call their city. At this point, the only official sources that refer to the city as Kiev are typically Russian propaganda arms. They use the word as sort of a spit in the face to Ukrainian sovereignty."
@Jarynn Yeah i have no clue about this kiev/kyiv thing whats the difference xd?
Kyiv*
"Russia: arrogance used to cover incompetence.
By the time the war in Ukraine is over, the Russian army would be seriously decimated."
I wonder if Putin would have done this if the US had elected an actual strong leader into the WH in 2020?

There is actually a master class strategy that works and it is not all about softwares because there is no software, calculator or robot that can predict the market.

Russia went so deep into their propaganda that they started to believe it. They expected Ukraine to welcome them...
"Still, since Russia has atomic weapons they can be as unorganized as they are and still don’t have to fear to be attacked by any other war party. And that’s the reason, wars today are out of balance."
"YES , Russia´s logistics is garbage & the attacks of partisans / terrorists (who can be legally shot when cought & are NOT protected by the Genova convention!) & the Ukrainian military make this only worse , resulting into looting soldiers becausde no alternatives ... 
The Ukrainian army was cought (incl. GRAD rocket lunchers & artillery cannons) now often stationing it self close to civillian buildings ( = human shields) as it was documented , see for example the T.-gram channel ""NeuesAusRussland"""
"""Amature talks about tactics veteran talk about logistics"" this got proved."

Can u do the same topic about the US-nato invasion iraq ?
Iraq please
Arguably the best video I have seen explaining many many things thank you for this
Look. Like America win in Afghanistan ..🙄
🔯🇺🇦🔯
It would be pretty dumb from Russia if they didn't account their logistics while invading Ukraine. What really actally bugs me the most is Ukrainian propaganda that says they are destroying russians left and right and that they are willing to pay russian soldiers if they surrender. It seems to me that ukrainians are actally losing and are getting desperate. This is just some thought of mine.
Well they have a Lot outdated equipment and poor chain of comand. That seems clear now. Also they expected kiew already fallen after 3 days
"Western media has lost all credibility post covid. Sorry. I just dont believe in the West anymore. Every single day, every headline wad a lie during covid. Why would coverage of war with Russia be different?"
I really hope this war ends soon
If this would be nazy Germany they would be by France 🇫🇷 by now good think Russia can’t push much let’s pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦
Massively more in depth than any news agency seems to be showing.
"Would be funny since most of their troops are on the South Western Russian border, someone would come from the East and take over the whole of Russia...just saying. 

There's a strategic advantage there. 

If there only was a strategic country to the East of Russia that could do that and had the power to bring freedom and liberation to the poor Russian people 🤷‍♂️🤔...🤠🇺🇲🤠.

Discounted land for the US if they wanted to go in now. 😎"
"@Sean I too believe they would drop nukes on any marching convoy since that part of Russia to the east is largely desolate. But still, one can dream.

But the US has great anti air defense...so idk. Would be cool to see as long as the war is contained within the Russian borders and they don't send nukes our way cuz then we'd have to send nukes their way and that's how the world ends"
Have you heard of nukes?
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Glory to Ukraine! 🇺🇦
Eight wierd laws?  what ?
Watch Patrick Lancaster YouTube reporting on the ground in Ukraine for real professional journalism !
So why is Putin destroying Ukraine 🇺🇦?
The Crimean Referendum to be governed by the Russian federation won by 97%. This is true or false.  There were preliminary referendums since 1994. True or False? President Trump has stated that the Ukraine has a big problem with corruption. True or false? Can this war be described as a CIVIL WAR? Yes or no? Should all NATO nations get rid of their armies and become neutral? Why not?
@Sean Warm
How's the weather in Russia?
"I’m going to try out Nebula.  Thanks for the tip, I’ve been considering replacing my paid-for-two-years YouTube Premium account after discovering they have been shadow banning my thoughtful and reasonable comments for more than a year."
Nice video
"Russia has huge issues with corruption, broken chain of commands, and outdated military equipment. However the issue seem to be the top down decision making as mentioned in this video. This was more informative than what any news source is able to provide."
@Samuel Dartel Low effort trolling. You didn't even blame it on George Soros or cultural marxism. 3/10
"Now that russia is seen as the devil in the world you are able to make this video on youtube but you cant do the same for us invasion of iraq or israels war crimes. Dont get me wrong, what russia is doing is indeed, evil. But the fact that we are able to talk only about russia while many, many western countries did, does or will do the same shit, its fucking hypocrite and annoying."
@Dennis Bowen You really want to turn this in to a fight huh?
@Barış no not whatever.
@Dennis Bowen I'm talking about this YouTube but whatever.
"Hey Wendover, fantastic video as always! I wanted to ask, is there a reason for why you didn't discuss the mud in Ukraine, that the Russians didn't anticipate and got stuck in as a result? Many vehicles where abandoned due to this oversight."
@Francisca Peña I guess they didn't expect the ice melting that fast.
"Russia is way over reliant on the railways, so the road conditions for trucks (which are too few in number) never was considered including the famous mud. 
Simply put the Russians are incompetent."
It is weird that they didnt anticipate it... Very suspicious since it is quite famous
sounds like western propaganda
My favorite social media post was a farmer stole one of the Russian tanks and just towed it away with a tractor
Thats the reson America and Nato Run From the Afghanistan and still they scared like a baby to fight with Russia!
"This war started with the egoistic of Ukraine's president... What if Zelonsky just stop his bullshit to join NATO, Ukraine got freedom from Russia back to history. All this shit against Russia(most leading nuclear country) can be stop... What a joke. That's why you don't vote actress to be leader of the country next time."
"Based on many years of studying Russia, the Middle East, Baltics and European countries; the only two things that we can be certain of are that the vast majority of news outlet and social media info coming out of Russia and Ukraine right now is false. The other thing is that Russia isn't trying to actually take Ukraine nor are the surrounding countries making actions like its a serious situation."
You can do it Ukraine !!!!
Simple end to this war... All NATO has to say is   No we won't.
Failed? Didn’t know the war was over.
Failed logistics. Not failed war. You can fail at one thing but still succeed in another. But it does mean that victory is going to be more costly and brutal.
Imagine that you couldn't even tell your troops that they are going to war. Talk about cowardice...
"“The line between disorder and order lies in logistics…”
– Sun Tzu"
The Ukrainian's were taught well...... By Americans!!!  The logistics front was how we crippled Hitler. I see Putin doesn't study much history.
USA is the real culprit in this war...bcz usa wanted to keep its military and weapons on the Russian borders.. Russia had to do this...in reality people are dying bcz of American trust.... America sucks another country men blood for its supremacy...and us companies are making millions from this war..see their share prices...
@hulaluuyaa maybe Russia shouldn’t rely on US companies as much. So that if they were to suddenly go away it wouldn’t hurt as much. Especially since Russia doesn’t like the US to begin with. It shouldn’t have been too much of a surprise that this happened.
@Dark Killer in reality no country should allow us companies to operate in their countries ..other the day will come of twisting of arms by us companies
@Dark Killer it is all called .. pressure making tactics
@Dark Killer hopefully yeah
@T L2 then why are US companies shutting down business in Russia? Wouldn’t that hurt their business?
Russia buying time to get supplies  to its front line. That is the true reason they claim a cease fire to allow people to leave.
Russia lost all my respect for this move. Also i learned that their tactics and land power is useless. If they were fighting against us(I am living in Turkey) with this incompetence we would be in the way of Moscow.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 you would be in your way to wake up no logistics troubles will save turkey against russian forces. Not invading  you in three days dosent mean anything you can win. You maybe can be annoying enough for them to ask for  peace under thier conditions which will happen with ukraine

Good video. Pootie assumed that the Ukrainian people would believe his propaganda. Because he lives in a bizarro parallel universe. What a turd.
Thank you Wendover for talking about this conflict. This will reach a lot of people around the world.
How can I know this isn’t propaganda
All the keyboard generals here are gonna be really disappointed when the dust settles
Uraaaaa !! We stand with Russia !! From Malaysia 🇲🇾
Uraaaaa !! We stand with Russia !! From Malaysia 🇲🇾
Basically what you saying at the end of the video is that you prioritising the video been monetized over honesty.
Yes...obviously they have failed and are now retreating LOL!
Thank you. This is the only thing in the recent days giving me optimism. I hadn't heard about the destruction of railway lines and the monumental importance of the task.
"If you search a lot and make some reasonable throught process linking the points with the current information made available throughoutthe days, you actually become more optimistic about it. There are even dozens of images showing Russian aircraft and helicopters getting shot down from yesterday or so."
Russia is doing the worst nazi Germany mistake again!
Putin is hero
"This war happens because Stubbornness of Zelensky, also Karma for Him for support Invaders like Israel when Bombarding Palestine in Gaza City. Now He see in His own Eyes how it's fell being Invades 🤭

Russia is not wanna created Puppet Government in fact They want overthrow Zelensky who is puppet by the West

I really think you should note somewhere that that huge explosion near the ened was not nuclear.
"Normally I like Wendover Productions but this video was entirely stolen from the article written on Forbes by David Axe without any reference to him. Really shame on you, claiming other people's work and showing it as yours. You can find the original article easily on google ""the Russian army doesn't have enough trucks to defeat Ukraine fast."" The credits belong to the original author."
"Sorry, but lots of the news you take as true are just FAKE. The Russian tanks destroyed a day ago? Ukrainians. The Russian soldiers lost in Ukraine and especially in the Donbas zone? Old videos. The same with THE GHOST OF KIEV, the 13 Ukrainian soldiers massacred on that tiny island, and so on.  Putin is a cold-blooded emperor, but not a criminal. Russian forces have asked civilians to abandon the areas where they will operate and have opened a corridor to let them leave. Ukraine CAN NOT WIN THIS WAR. Go to Gerald Celente's site. The interview with a Texan guy who is right in the front in Ukraine."
that dude at 17:17... fuck 😭
"This will be the best documented war in history, that's for sure"
"I feel for the Ukrainians, but also for the young Russian men on the front with little supplies and poor command. May this war end soon."
"One thing is for sure, if Russia can’t take a country a fraction it’s size and borders it then they are in for a very long expensive humiliating war"

"and remember boys and girls....this is all going great according to Putin's plan HAHAHAHAHA he's very much like orange man Trump in which they both refuse to admit when they make mistakes. Too much ego, too much pride and lots of mental instability."
"So if Russians were so good in moving huge numbers of troops and tanks by rail in Russia, why did they not keep using the rails in Ukraine? Track gauge is the same, electrification is the same (and even if not, you can use diesel locos), and one can easily seize stations and their staff and force them override the central command centers."
"@touyats1 Yes, it seems the railroads have been sabotaged and inorder to fix them and keep them operational, Russian forces would need to hold the cities connecting them. There's an article about this by Bloomberg titled: ""Railways Helped Drive Russia Off Track and Into Ukraine’s Cities"". I would link it but Youtube doesn't allow that."
"@AJ By ""they"" you mean Russians? I'd say though that you don't need to hold key cities, just key stations. And then move lots of tanks quickly to Kiev. After all if Kiev falls, the entire country falls. Feels awkward 10 Russian soldiers with automatic weapons can't seize a station (and keep it seized) from a bunch of molotov cocktails by citizens. Or were the railways cut at the border? (railways have historically been one of the first infrastructures to be severed in time of war)."
That's why they're trying to hold the key cities - so that they can connect their railways there. The main objective of the Ukranians has been to avoid this from happening
Can you do a documentary about how America itself has invaded other nations?
"Чушь собачья , если будете много крякать как Украина , то медведь и до вас доберётся ))"
Sounds like a noob playing HOI4
"Did you know that Ukraine's army had more than 100 000 soldiers on the border with the Donbas area ready to act just previous this invasion?  On the other hand, Putin does not care about the Russian in the Donbas. All this is pure geopolitics. The Navy base in Sebastopol has been Russian since centuries ago, and Russia cannot leave 2/5 of its navy to the Ukrainian government who since The Coup D Etat of 2014 have declared themselves enemies of the Russian in the Donbas and of Russia itself.  Those who believe this war is about good and evil know nothing about geopolitics. Putin is an emperor, and the gang in the government of Ukraine are puppets of oligarchs and of NATO."

Social media sources are not reliable. This is nonsense and wishful thinking. Lord save us.
Hahahaha
"Thank you for the accurate assessment of the beginning of the invasion. Yes, the initial logistics were not well done by Russia. Do not, however, take this as a defeat. In my opinion, these large and very slow convoys will eventually arrive and set up around Ukrainian cities, just out of range of Ukrainian weapons. The Russians will then use artillery to reduce these cities to rubble. So yes, initial Russian logistics were very poor, but eventually enough men and equipment will arrive to crush the opposition."

Russia is not a super power and people should stop being afraid of them.
I agree like any war both sides engage in propaganda.
"I was just thinking this. Russia is mostly talk. Putin got in by manipulating media and probably does the same for the morale of his country.

But it doesn't matter. People still died, on both sides, because of the decision of 1 or a few people.

Why does anybody have to lose?"
I didn't think that the constipated news would howl fakes (
"Puttin, you are running out of money, you can not feed your soldiers, the only option is a nuclear war.

Remember"
"I noticed that videos are increasingly appearing on the Internet (even on YouTube) in which russian teachers tell schoolchildren about the need to ""cleanse"" the West (not just Ukraine) from nazis/fascists/militarists/nationalists and others.
Obviously something is being prepared for the coming years.
Unfortunately, NATO has shown itself to be a weak defensive alliance. The question arises, will NATO be able to resist the aggression of russian terrorists? The loss of Ukraine would rather weaken it than strengthen it.
Wouldn't it be better to intervene and help on your own terms than to intervene when there is no other choice?"

Interesting to see this Video while Russia is coming with civillian trucks to the fronline now.
"They did not fail logistically. War is bad and evil. Everyone looses.  But so many people around the world are blinded or ignorant to the truth because of the deceitful messages they receive from public officials and the media. Truth is Ukraine's economy is mafia based money laundering. The Clintons, Bidens, and others are involved and are just the tip of the globalist iceberg. Ukraine also has treated its minorities very poorly, often deadly and inhumane killing 14000 with western support. Something to think about."
"I am so HAPPY that I get to witness real war in Europe. Could have not asked for a better time to be alive!

Don't question why Ukraine was ""fighting Russia"" for 8 years, resulting in 90% of casualties being Donbas ""separatist"" civilians, without firing a single shot towards actual Russian troops in Russia or Crimea.
Or why Ukraine lost the war within hours after ""Russia reinvaded"". Apparently, Ukraine was fighting some other Russia for 8 years.

Also one thing is that most of the soldiers are badly trained so that even more afected the logitstic
"Well main reason is they thought this would be over in a matter of 48 hours. So no need for advanced logistics. But then again, russians were never good at logistics. This point explains for ex. how their newer aircraft such as the Sukhoi Superjet were not a success. Because when you need aircraft parts, they have to come in a matter of days if not hours. Not weeks or months. Nearly every single non russian airline that flew SSJ 100 doesn't nowadays because of that, mainly."

Yeah I guess russia after centuries of war just is incapable of logistical support of its troops or using gpss with paper maps. Those silly russians....
Very informative thank you
Ever since the demorats installed joe.
The last time the russian was able to operate outside of its own territory somewhat capable was in ww2 but back then they have captured many bases so they could expand their logistics reach the modern military has a heavily reliant on train transport that couldn’t move outside of the builded rails
@theInsaneRodent a yes it slipped my mind but yes you are right American automotive industry back then was one of the strongest
"Remember as well that the lend lease program sent them hundreds of thousands of trucks from America.

"Russia with radio, sat-com airdrops, etc: stalls a 40 mile convoy because bad logistics
MEanwhile in nazi germany: 100's of kilometers of mevement in a day, with minimal logistics problems, and the thing is, they didnt have precision airdrops, or gps. or sat com, and very primitive radio comms."
"But what difference does it make, Ukraine will capitulate anyway, and its statehood will be called into question, NATO took advantage of Ukraine, and abandoned it at the most critical moment. The defeat of Ukraine is only a matter of time, obviously, Putin does not have the opportunity to lose."
Hahahahahahaha... yes we all see this fail... you are the next!!!
"All information about Russian army problems with logistics is fake. In reality, the author described Ukranian army situation"
"@Robert H They didn't leave any vehicle at all. Ukranian army has not enough oil for their vehicles now, because they usually buy oil from Russia 🙂 There are many fakes in youtube about problems of Russian army. You need to check all information more carefully if you want to know the real situation in Ukraine."
"You could also say, that objective and justification was the problem. If they wouldn't have indoctrinated their troops to ""liberate"" but to conquer. ""Clearing"" the area of civilians, their military support doctrine would have worked. Same if they would have actually been a liberating force for the civilians. So in short, they fell into the trap of believing their own external lies."
"This video is overflowing slightly from issues that are just more of individual delays, we better have a part 2 of how Russia took over Ukraine in a month"
"Evidently the Russians suffered from logistical incompetence combined with Russian culture of selling everything they can on the black market, whether they own it or not.  They also have no reason or threat from Ukraine, so troops are really not motivated to fight."
"Attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte: ""An army marches on its stomach "" Logistics in the 18th century! But it's still true......."
"Im not even mad at russian people or the army for this war im mostly upset at putin and his inner circle for doing this , i feel like majority of government people didnt want this war a coup needs to take place tbh and it feels like brothers are force to fight brothers"
Its facinating to see how information spreads in war now with the advent of social media and smartphones. Imagine how insanely different WWII would have been if this amount of near immediate information was available for all to see.

"The issues Russia is facing now - top down logistics planning, and a chronic lack of dynamic supply lines, seems very very similar to what led the Ukrainian forces to perform so poorly in 2014. Ukraine learned and has adapted, but it doesn't seem Russia paid attention.

Also worth looking at aviation. Russia has a massively superior air force to Ukraine in just about any possible measure, but they have not pressed home their advantage with a strategic bombing campaign to completely neutralise the Ukrainian air force - they have planes sitting on the ground near the border, idle, while their troops over the border go without air cover. I don't understand why they aren't using their air power to protect their own troops, nor pin down Ukrainian positions.

Looking at the navy it's the same picture. The Russian navy easily dominates the Black Sea, but even as their ground forces dig in around Mariupol, there's no naval gunnery or missile bombardment to supress defences in Mariupol itself.

The whole affair seems oddly half hearted and, as my mum would say, ""arse about face"". (Indeed, that's exactly what she said when we were talking about it)"
"I wonder how we could all be so wrong about the Ukrainian people and their will to resist a Russian takeover. given how easy it was to seize the Crimean in 2014 and the willingness of the people in eastern Ukraine to become a Russian satellite the assumption of Putin and his general staff had some merit. most western analysts agreed with them. history is a bit ambiguous about Putins claim to deny Ukraine's statehood (Ukrainians tried to defy Lenin as well in incorporating their newfound country into Mother Russia again 100yrs ago) and there are many cross-country family relations plus the similarities between Russian and Ukrainian languages. 
so what happened between 2014 and 2022? Ukraine ist still a deeply corrupt and dysfunctional state failing their citizens on basic services. per capita GDP is lower than in Russia and even lower than in Belarus. so why risk their lives for this crappy entity all of a sudden? what did we miss?"
"Ukraine will likely fall within days. They’ve destroyed Ukrainian airfields and Air Force, captured key cities and assets and have the capital surrounded. But the invasion is a failure?? Mmmmkay..🤔"
"They’ve been trying to capture the capital since day 1 and failed every time. Russia has donated hundreds of vehicles to Ukraine by abandoning them and the Air Force still has a majority of their planes, but they are using them minimally until they reach a deal with the EU to get more."
I understood nothing from this video

"There are always some failures. But fact is Russia already got 1/5 of the Ukrainian territory. Russia bombed all stations to fuel military vehicles, so there are also non left to fuel Russian vehicles.Still the invasion is going well. France only surrendered in 3 weeks and they are three times as small as Ukraine."
"Im disappointed with the Russian army with how they are performing against a weaker Ukrainian defense force.

They are supposed to be the 2nd or 3rd strongest in the world

The first mistake is not destroying the entire Ukrainian air force in the first few hours of their offensive

2nd is not disabling Ukraine's internet and communication.

3rd is not preparing for a long war

4th is the assumption that they will be welcomed as liberators

But right now the Russians is adjusting and correcting their mistakes

They are now destroying/seizing all of Ukraine vital infrastracture

Putin is going to win this war but the military community is not going to be impressed with how they perform despite the overwhelming advantage in all military aspects"
"Just a note: despite the repeated claims made in this video, state control isn’t the main factor in the availability of rail infrastructure. Plenty of networks have been highly developed by private rather than state investment, so whilst this isn’t the case for Russia, state ownership isn’t necessarily the driver. And developed networks are rarely withheld from military use regardless of who owns them. In privatised systems the major infrastructure (be it road or rail) is almost always fully available to the military of the home country - the main factor is government propaganda making the people support the military operation. Most private companies would offer their equipment voluntarily either as a PR exercise or because they believe (based on the information available on in-country media) that the military is undertaking a just and appropriate action which they want to lend support to. Even if it’s not voluntary, most nations have a process where the military can assume emergency control of pretty much whatever they want. It’s hard to imagine, for example, that any American rail operator would refuse the US army access to any part of the network they might find useful because it would be commercial suicide to do that in the face of patriotism and popular support for whatever action was being undertaken, and because even if they wanted to resist, the army has bigger guns. Claiming this is a feature of state control is a strong capitalist bias but not necessarily accurate."
"Even though i like and watch your videos why did you have to get political... Furthermore using the failed Afganistan invasion as an example where America also failed miserably, to show the invasive might of NATO. Very dissapointing."

"Reliance on bombardment with air and artillery is a clear sign they know they cant win in an all out ground war and it's incredibly stupid to think it would make people give up. London survived the Blitz, Ukraine can survive this. All it does is make people hate you more."

"How cute, the fact that Russia didn't bomb the hell out of Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, like NATO did in Iraq and Yugoslavia, and is moving carefully, killing each terrorist in close combat, is considered ""a failure of logistics"". Well, dear whoever you are, we'll see in a couple of weeks that Putin followed through on his every word - demilitarization. And then a period of denzification will take place. And the NATO will shut up and look on helplessly. They promised power and money to Zelenskiy, their little pet president, and now he is screeching in terror that he was pushed to confront Russia and was left all alone. No planes, no protection, just more guns so that the war would continue until he runs out of Ukrainians. And NATO flies all manner of terrorists and mercenaries so that Ukraine would turn into an absolute hellhole for the civilians."
Did you ask anyone from Ukraine what they think about it? Because I'm pretty sure Ukraine doesn't want their country captured
"Just a note: despite the repeated claims made in this video, state control isn’t the main factor in the availability of rail infrastructure. Plenty of networks have been highly developed by private rather than state investment, so whilst this isn’t the case for Russia, state ownership isn’t necessarily the driver. And developed networks are rarely withheld from military use regardless of who owns them. In privatised systems the major infrastructure (be it road or rail) is almost always fully available to the military of the home country - the main factor is government propaganda making the people support the military operation. Most private companies would offer their equipment voluntarily either as a PR exercise or because they believe (based on the information available on in-country media) that the military is undertaking a just and appropriate action which they want to lend support to. Even if it’s not voluntary, most nations have a process where the military can assume emergency control of pretty much whatever they want. It’s hard to imagine, for example, that any American rail operator would refuse the US army access to any part of the network they might find useful because it would be commercial suicide to do that in the face of patriotism and popular support for whatever action was being undertaken, and because even if they wanted to resist, the army has bigger guns. Claiming this is a feature of state control is a strong capitalist bias but not necessarily accurate."
"@mjl1966y I think you might have missed the point. As sort of an aside, patriotic support is pretty easily generated - I'm not convinced it would still be entirely absent after say 5-10 years of blanket media narratives of Canada harboring terrorists or plotting attacks, for example, which has been the case in Russia regarding Ukraine. That kind of narrative tends to be pretty good at getting the people behind a war fought on foreign soil (see Iraq, for example - still no WMD found, and it's been 20+ years now).
The US is a little unusual in having a large land area but very few land-border neighbours anyway; most of your wars are overseas rather than with your land neighbours which makes it harder for you to imagine, because overseas enemies cannot be reached - nor battles there supported - by rail; but generating patriotic support for military action elsewhere hasn't ever proved to be too difficult.
Either way, as I said, even if it wasn't voluntary and patriotic support is minimal, there's legal mechanisms in most countries for the military to requisition any resources they might need - all the government has to do is to discover or manufacture an emergency and help themselves. So private ownership of the infrastructure wouldn't be a barrier to its use by the military, and state ownership isn't necessarily a driver either."
"Except this war does not enjoy popular patriotic support in the motherland.  If the U.S. invaded Canada for no good reason, not sure rail companies here would be all that supportive."
"It obviously trying to cash on the current scenario with the many videos, scenes. How it ends up, maybe not a quick and easy win but i would say according to russia plan."
"Had to pause the video and comment. Changing the street sign to 'Welcome to Hell' now that is scary. You are lost, low of ammo, gas and hungry that would be insanely scary even you are inside of a armored vehicle."
"Also very importhant fact is that Russia has compulsory conscription. All males between the age of 17 - 27 are obliged by the goverment to serve in the army at least 1 year. If you get caught cheating, you get fined!

Many people don't understand this, conscripts army is VERY different from a professional one. Conscrips are not good for an attack.

I think that if Russia had used only professional soldiers, who have trained for years, they may would have already won this war."
You are talking about a military that can sustain prolonged suffering. The final objective will eventually settle into starving the Ukranians. The Ruskies objective of keeping the West out would have been achieved. Long enough to park nukes along the Polish border.
Russian military is a disorganized mess.....it has been for decades
We have only seen the Russians conscripts so far. When supply bases are setup the real war begins
"Yo, don't give them advice!!"
"Putin's Russia is weak. All they have is oil and gas which the world is moving away from. For a Dictator losing your income to pay the army he only had one choice; conflict to try to force a wave of Nationalism. Though he greatly overestimated his strength so now he's fighting a war with no decent allies, everyone hates him globally and his own soldiers that were told it would be an easy fight are realizing Putin has destroyed the economy and they've been fighting against people that just wanted peace. At some point frontline Russian soldiers are going to be hungry enough and fed up of being the bad guys so they'll surrender to Ukraine. All Ukraine has to do is hold out and offer then sanctuary at the right time. Then Putin will be assassinated by some other high ranking general in his own army."
"The Belarus government has its head in the sand, they’ll be next for the Russian cowards."
I'm under the impression that Russia is nostalgic of its USSR days :-/
This War gives the russian army good experience with logistics in the army. They will learn from mistakes and do it next time better. This is a nature of every war.
"Be prepared for this conflict to drag out for a long time. Russia wont want to take a humiliating defeat. The oligarchs are beginning to balk at the sanctions and economic upheaval but ultimately Putin holds power and he's a far right nationalist. Pressure is being mounted on him but unless he is materially forced to stop, his own people revolt, or he's killed or forced from power. I don't see him stopping anytime soon. He made it personal and he's the ""I'll rule it or see it burned to ash around me."" type."
That type of mindset  is dangerous for a leader.
Putin watching this video be like: hmm 🤔🤔
Mad respect for all Ukrainians. I'm terribly sorry this has happened to you and I'm incredibly impressed by your tenacity and morale. I hope this war will blow over soon and that you get ample help with reoperations. Thank you Wendover for your hard work in fact checking and crediting as well!
"@alxnd_r Ukrainians and Serbs are both Chads, cause they managed to secure their culture and religion throughout centuries of imperialist's oppression."
@Chris Miles Yeah im sorry. Im just mad
@MrNineT Im not Russian bro. I wish you all the best.
"I think why it shows a poor showing for the Russian military is because you're in a position that you've got Ukraine surrounded from almost all sides and yet they are making things difficult for the Russians, the west is watching this and analysing Russians capabilities and honestly, it looks weaker than a lot of us expected, now fair enough, Putin is likely holding back, but still, Ukraine isn't exactly a power, they are quite a poor country even by eastern European standards, that Ukraine is able to give them a fight at all is quite impressive and shows that Russian military capability isn't as strong as they would like us to think, it also shows a lot of poor planning.

I really have to wonder if EU, US or NATO troops or techs went into Ukraine and how would Russia fare, but honestly, Russia looks weaker than many of us expected that they are finding it challenging to take on a poor country."
*Putin killed the same people he said he was going to liberate?* Ukraine people love democracy.
"I'm ukrainian and your analysis seems to be spot on! Thanks for sharing this with the world!
However, I still have to stress that it is tough here and Ukraine suffers a lot of civilian casualties :("
"Wendover is one of the more trusted of my suppliers of information. I'm thankful of their honest portrail of the pre-invasion history. I would love a set of videos that show the Ukrainian history, as serfs under the Russian empire, as slaves to the USSR and end holodomor genocide of my people as well as the Ukrainian search for independence after the collapse of the soviet union. Understanding why we fight so hard is understanding why the world shouldn't turn it's back. It saddens me when I think that we knew all this was a stones throw away and we did nothing.  Слава Україні"
"Ukraine on Fire, it a video on youTube, but it might not be what your are looking for. It's a history documentary on the events of 2014 and has some of the pre-history your looking for. But it does grey up the morality of a good vs evil narrative. It may be a hard watch for you."
"This is what happens when the entire government pockets the money that morealy can go to upgrade things, and this war to is just for one reason, for their pockets, the only problem is this time it backfired."
"If US NATO agreed to no membership for Ukraine, all this could have been avoided."
"true, but russia is still in the wrong for invading, you know the show invincible? if so, one of the episodes, a son and father are fighting, over something the son doesn’t want to understand, and the father destroys many civilian buildings. and the father blames his son for the DAMAGE HE DID. 
its like this situation. russia is blaming the west for the damage they’ve cost so far."
Most of the videos from ukraine is from tiktok
Still can't believe the invasion actually happened.
Should I believe ANYTHING I hear or read about Russia? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would rather hear about the FAILED American INVASION of Vietnam and Afghanistan. The Ukraine is RUSSIA. The people are Russian. It's like me saying I'm not American. I'm a Californian. DUH!!!!!!!!! America has NEVER been invaded while Russia has been invaded numerous times over the last 900 years. How can Americans even begin to relate to the Russians and their situation? Putin knows what he's doing. It's all PROPAGANDA.
"Go on instagram theres loads of Russians ""influencers"" , send them a simple message. ""Ask about Ukraine"", ""Tears for Ukraine and the tears for the 8000 dead Russian soldiers"" .........if they are on there they can be influenced. You cannot unread something. Do the maths and compounding you can get to an incredible number of people as Facebook research shows 3.57 degrees of separation to get to billions.........do it , it costs you nothing and may help. Love to the Ukrainians"
"that video was stellar, great work brother"
The day the full invasion started was one of those rare moments when you really felt like you were living through historic events.
"""back in ma day i sat at home thousands of miles away comfortable and cozy watching the news! ya kids these days wouldnt understand!"""
Because we technically are even the other stuff we had happen to the world.
I bet Putin watch this😂😂
"I honestly think what going  kill this invasion is not logistics.     IMHO it's that the Russian soldier is invading a population that speaks ...Russian.
It's easy to fall for lies when you are not being yelled at in your own language

I guarantee this war isn't going to be about logistics.    It will be a war of words...in Russian.

It is the equivalent of the US invading...Canada. and then talking about the war in terms of tactics and logistics."
"This video is generally very interesting, I just wonder how much wishful thinking by the west is in the military analysis and how closely it pictures the truth. Misleading your foes in a conflict has always been a powerful tool. I am not supporting the russian politics, but I advise everyone not to underestimate them. Russia might be on a decline for a while now, but a wounded beast will only fight more fiercely."
"Of couse USA are much better in logistics, they destroyed far too many countries around the world compared to Russia who is just starting outside its borders"
though the same lol
"Calculated from inception. Send in conscripts, no resupply. Conscripts unleash hell as they are starving. Russian warfare 101. They are just buying time until the artillery is in position for the final assault."
"Why are Russian military radios unencrypted? I get that super high end is expensive, but just encrypted radios seems... basic?"
After 20 year leaving Afghanistan with your tail BW your legs. Is failure
Let’s sit back and witness the fall of Putin
"Failed? I don't know for sure and you can argue it's planned. Zelensky is already losing fate in NATO and the EU. With not installing a 'No-Fly zone' he finds himself in big trouble. Kyiv will fall sooner or later and the West will not do anything. It all goes according plan and the Russian war machine won't slow down anytime soon. 

And then the oil and gas, we Europe still pay the Russians 600 million dollars a day."
you forgot one thing though. russia is controlling the air space so they can if they want to supply their army through helicopers and planes. also if the russians feel like they get no progress they will start using heavier bombs until the civilians give up
"PUSH RUSSIA BACK, BURN IT TO THE GROUND"
"Hoi4 players: Rookie mistake!
Just max out rails, paratroop supply hubs, reinforce with airdrops and don't send out tanks if not neccesary or supply is red"
"Thank you for this video, it's very interesting to see a deep dive into topics like this while they are relevant. Keep up the good work!"
Fake news we don't like
they need freedom probably got from americans
stop trying to call a outcome after a week of fighting
too many video games
y
Because Russia was and forever will be useless.
"What do you mean failed, do you know Putin's plans?
Ukraine is not Granada"
Major Takeaway for Ukrainian forces: Strike Russian transport trucks; they are more valuable to the enemy war effort than the Russian tanks themselves.
Just wow With nearly 2  weeks and halff of  the conflict we already got a documentary that is so rich  with information  with sufficent amount of   images and videos   if that was 25 years ago we would have it  after mounths or mybe years that shows how our today world is so different and how fast it change  all this fast flow of informations exposed literally  a super power  weakness in a matter of days that shows how todays wars are really hard  in an era where intelligence gathering  became  easier than ever  before
I just read a couple of comments
Order more Attack Drone. Bomb all Food and oil supply for tanks and army trucks.
Russia Putin invasion towards Ukraine will fail as bad as when Soviet invaded Afghanistan. Slava Ukrainia
"ELIKE  THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA LIBIRATED IRAQ FROM SADAAM HUSSEIN , LIKE THE TIME NATO AND FRANCE LIBIRATED LIBIYA . PUTIN IS LIKE THAT BOY . KARMA IS A BITCH   NATO IS A BITCH"
"everyone thinks it takes 2 days to take a country. It takes months, and all these things he is talking about happens to all nations that invade. Germany lost 60,000 troops trying to take Kiev for example."
"@Makis This is one of the things that frustrate me, Even grown adults have no common sense and think this is some kinda of popcorn show that ""is taking to long"" now. Its a very sad World Situation."
"this ^^
people think war is a call of duty map where attackers go in a city and lets see who gets the most capture points to win in 15 minutes.
Only talking about kiev, logistics problems or not, no matter how powerful your army is (us or russia or anyone) you dont just march into a capital in the first day. They have shut down their airfields, they will shut down their electricity, water and food will become a problem for the people, while they will continue to do ""light"" artilerry/air strikes, until the time is right to go in after days of heavy artillery bombings.
war is ugly and terrifying, and I feel for the millions of lives destroyed. Even if russia left today, a poor to begin with country is set back decades just from all the infrastructure destroyed. Its just sad."
Unplanned war
Russia will loose. Like USA in Vietnam.
"Ukraine has been fighting Russia since 2014. The reason is, that was when Ukraine started talks with NATO which Putin very much detested. 8 Years of continued talks with NATO have pushed this conflict to where it is now."
Why the fuck does it take you so long to get to the point?
Who the fuck want to go back to 1950 comrade eating potatoes from putin!? Bah CYKA BLYAT
Love how neutral u present the topic. Top of the line presentation of a topic discard of anything else
"Ukraine has been fighting Russia since 2014. The reason is, that was when Ukraine started talks with NATO which Putin very much detested. 8 Years of continued talks with NATO have pushed this conflict to where it is now."
"Hmm, one side point - there are two types of railways, in ""Russian"" width and in ""European"". The train wagons themselves aren't compatible, so you need different machines, which makes me think that their good rail-based logistics have a very, very definite endpoint."
"Does Ukraine have the same gauge as Russia? If not, why not?"
"In 1941 Germans and all other SPECIALISTS had the same conclusions, and then Russia win the war. 10 days, 10 days, and half of the Ukrainian territory are under control, ( control mean enemy troops can't move) when you have 10 000 - 15 000 vehicles it is normal to have broken and damaged by enemy fire, sadly Russians move quik and efficient Europe HAVE to make all to stop the war at any matter. We have to stop now or all of Europe will pay the price in the next 3-5 years. Just now Natural gas price is about 1500 euro. That war has to stop."
lavrov eats Putin's tiny dog sausage 🌭🌭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"This is almost all assumptions with nice graphics. It's the hot topic so I guess I understand your ""NATO propaganda"" oops I mean ""informative video"" at this time."
Theyv been sent in without that phones so that fucked that two
"Wendover, please provide Russian subtitles !!"
"No governments worldwide should ever be trusted, if you do so, it can and does prove fatal!! Just look at the war that Russia has started."
"if youtube takes down this vid... then they should be truly ashamed of themselves, deleting important information..."
You really think Russia has failed?
@David W So haven't failed.
"They planned for a two week operation, thinking most combat would be over in 4 days. 11 days in they don't even have all their day 1 objectives, They have completely failed. They might still grind out a victory in months."
"Have you considered that Russia will not invade Ukraine and just want to push NATO back from trying to make Ukraine join NATO, since he is heavily against it in NATO Meeting at 2008?"
What are you talking about. They invaded Ukraine 11 days ago.
"I think the Russians initially went soft. Unlike indiscriminate US and allied bombing of weaker nations, the Russians spared civilians and were very careful about they took out. as the Ukrainians armed civilians it made the job easier for Russia who now attacked apartment blocks and other places where ''terrorists'' were holed up. in case anyone wonder what ''terrorist means, its a word so fondly used by the West to describe civilians who take up arms to defend their freedom and fight invaders, specifically western invaders."
"And if you are able to get additional ""forbidden"" facts outside of the corporate media, you would see what a schill for corporate interests this channel just became with this video.  He was likely fed this information before the war started by the US government, so that is why he got such a quality video out so fast. 
It's sad to see that even ""independent"" creators I admire,  are exposed as being just as willing to feed the narrative of the same powerful interests that poisoned the mainstream media.  
Can't say I blame him. If he actually gave an independent perspective, his career as a content creator would instantly disappear.  
This ""war"" is used by big tech and western governments as a pretext to further shred what little free thought was left."
"Pretty ridiculous to think anyone who doesn't want to start WWIII over Ukraine is a ""Troll"" ... check my account. I Just hope it ends soon. Ukraine is a very corrupt former Soviet territory that has only been independent since 1992. Russia made it clear fir decades they wouldn't accept Ukraine joining NATO or not remaining neutral. 

Zalensky is in his secret bunker right now still demanding NATO start WWIII over this. Thankfully NATO voted against enforcing a no-fly zone, saying this is ""not our war"""
ukraine shot first
"Wait, so russia has the exact same problem as the wehrmacht in 1941? Ironic."
"What percent of Ukraine is farmland?
Overview. Ukraine's agribusiness sector remains the most promising sector of the economy. With 41.5 million hectares of agricultural land covering 70 % of the country and about 25 % of the world's reserves of black soil, agriculture is Ukraine's largest export industry.Sep 24, 2021
Why is only 8 percent of Russia's land suitable for farming?
Russia comprises roughly three-quarters of the territory of the former Soviet Union, but only a small amount of this vast area is suited for agriculture because of its arid climate and inconsistent rainfall."
Why is Russia fighting like it's 1922 instead of 2022?
"Fantastic video, so informative and all the sources on screen. Thank you for this vid"
Fake news
"You forget to mention one important aspect in russian military which touches logistics - corruption.
Officers pocket resources which are directed towards vehicle maintenance for example.
Simple soldiers who serve and get absolute shit pay and suffer bullying ""duxi"" in the military feel little loyalty for it.
So stuff if they get to fix something, often spare parts or fuel are sold in civilian life to make additional profits. 
Or some tech like radios are sold off for their precious metals when they get their hands on it.
West make due with politicians being sometimes corrupt. In russia entire system is based on having access to national resources and pocketing personally from it. From higher officers to low key individuals.

Now what evidence we have for that actually manifesting directly? Food rations are 7 years old. No-one bothered to allocate resources to fix that. Or resources found someone's pocket.
Captured Pansir - S1 was obviously unmaintained and haven't been taken for a spin allowing it's tires to rot. Which makes traversing off-road very dangerous. Hence abandoned vehicles left malfunctioning.
Now russia's army is road bound in Ukraine's spring mud season in the north completely and that probably effects any trucks whatsoever.

I wouldn't be surprised that a lot of stuff gets simply stolen before it even reaches troops on the front, while previously lack of maintenance and care effecting them now from the very start."
"@Troodon I have no idea what are you talking about.
If you are about me pointing that US and it's satraps did ten times worse damage ten times more often then what Russia is currently doing in Ukraine-fine. It's not defense or whatever, it's pointing out hypocrisy.
Few days ago White House members said something along the lines ""Statesman who invade other sovereign countries have no right to rule"". I mean, that would leave very few US presidents eligible indeed. I'm not versed in 19. century American history, but I'm willing to bet that by that standard you could count presidents on one hand who could qualify for such lofty goal."
"@Cirkhan I was wondering how long it would take for someone to use the old tired ""other people did bad things too"" defense.  You do realize it's a defense that has never worked, right?"
"You describe Ukraine, not Russia."
"oh, not more propganda"
Слава Україні!!!!!!
"Putin, like other politicians is a leader of a country and does what's best for the country. Only in the first 10sec, 0:12, Wendover describe him as an autocrat. So the video is already biased.

It would be wiser to use rather neutral description/words when dealing with events as such.
I do understand that you can't fit everything into a 20min video but you can definitely use a more careful phraseology avoiding words that are used by others. 

Other than that, overal is a an ok video by someone who I doubt ever step/travel or lived even close to Europe however listing your references/resources you used makes you look little bit more credible but definitely more information based and that's a good thing so thank you for that."
The ironic thing is that Germany had logistic problems inside of the Russian Soviet republic because of a poorly built railway network.
"You mean the Nazis, not Germany."
Agree with the overall theme of the video that this was a logistical failure for Russia. However I find it hard to believe that a country that has it's own GPS network (GLONASS) would rely on paper maps. This just sounds like propaganda.
"If the circuit board for your digital GLONASS map reader was removed from the vehicle three years back, and sold for the gold on the electrical contacts...A paper map is what you've got, if you're lucky.  Otherwise, you follow the vehicle ahead of you."
Logistics logistics logistics is the Russian weakness they will a slow them down this is a going to be a long drawn conflict it will it’s Achilles heel period
Putin become a loser sone
Soldiers asking for directions in the country they are invading.. I found that a bit chuckleworthy. Seems they were deceived
THE NATO MILITARY BLOCK TURNED INTO A HUMANITARIAN ORGANIZATION. RUSSIA IS GOING TO GREATER IMPRESSION AND AGGRESSION TODAY RUSSIA IS A TERRORIST STATE. RUSSIA'S WORSHIP OF CIVIL POPULATION IN SYRIA ALREADY CONTINUES IN UKRAINE AND AFTER CONFLICTS WILL BEGIN ALL OVER NATO'S BORDER. THE POPE OF ALL CHRISTIANS IS  SILENT.
The narrator's gay voice is very annoying.
"Is Putin trying to draw the west into sending troops into Ukraine? He is a evil man, but they could have crushed Ukraine in day's."
"Does anyone know why Twitter is collaborating with Putin? When you connect via a VPN located in Russia (Moscow) and set up a Location Near you on Twitter, basically only the lies of the Kremlin are displayed."
1:52 What is that CSA battle flag doing there .-.
This was sooo wel done!
As Napoleon  said: An army marches on its stomach.
Is 10 days a little too soon to be writing it off as a failure? How does the invasion timeline compare to say Iraq?
"The ""autocrat"" in Russia... 
That's your perspective dude."
"Who's willing to to execute Putin for $1,000,000,000 cash? You can do it on your own or create a team. You will denounce your citizenships from your country's and be "" killed "". You will no longer be alive on record nor will your team and your loved ones can never see you again. 

You will be ghost, and given everything you need to succeed, but unlike those who tried to take out Hitler in the early days of his invasion of Europe, you must succeed, and cannot fail as the future of humanity depends on you. 

You have a green light to kill all Russians, or NATO members who stand in your way. 

You and your team will write your memoirs before you embark on the greatest hit job in human history to avoid nuclear war and save billions of lives.

This is not a joke, and we could easily gather the funds and resources from around the world through "" humanitarian aid "" funding. 

This could become reality easily."
The title made it seems like this is a bit of analysis. But alas this is pure propaganda. Sources? Trust me bro. Numbers? You don't need numbers! You have emotions! Also here's a few twitter fakes.
"Hi, my name is Ilya, I'm 17 years old and I'm Russian. 
In my country, almost all people are divided into two camps: those who support Putin and those who do not support the war.  I consider myself the second group, but like any national conflict, the Russian-Ukrainian war has many pitfalls.  For example, since 2014, Ukrainian has become the only official language of Ukraine and many Russian-speaking people have not been able to study in Russian-language schools, which separates them from their culture and history.  Or another example.  On March 2, 2014, 42 people who supported the government, which was overthrown as a result of a coup, were burned alive in Odessa.  And many people in Russia do see the government of Ukraine as Nazi and inhuman. They have their reasons. And propaganda since the days of the USSR often draws the image of the enemy in all countries that compete with Russia, and this is a big problem, but simple people never be want war. 
That's all what I want told you.
With love from Russia 🇷🇺

PS: Sorry for my bad English. That truly unpleasant"
Ukraine are fascists. U supporting nazism.
Where are the fascists?
"Kiev is surrounded, cities are being taken one by one. Stop spreading lies, go tell people to stop attacking simple russians instead."
"Путину так грустно, что ты принес разруху и нищету в Украину. пришло время положить конец этой войне и восстановить мир. Никто не может остановить вас, используя ваше ядерное оружие Никто не хочет причинять вред вашему народу. Окно для переговоров закрывается для России. Скоро мы убьем ваших людей, как вы убьете наших. Но твои дети умрут, твоя семья умрет, если ты не покончишь с этим сейчас."

"This Russia must be new to the DLC, he forgot to build trucks lmao. He was probably still learning the paranoia mechanic."
"Still getting used to the new logistics system, haven't figured out the meta."
Propaganda
It seems that the feared Russian military machine is a colossus with the feet of clay
This feels different and dirty. Just a feeling of wrong all around. This should all so wake people up to puppets like Trump who are nothing but Putin want to be’s.
"Yes I agree the Russians seem to be lacking logistics but in my opinion, more than logistics, it's the cause and reason why you wanna go to war that really matters. Then why were US, NATO, and its allies, unable to hold Afghanistan, despite having abundant logistics, and when almost every nation of the world were in their favor of invasion? What broke their morale despite having perfect strategies, impregnable airbases, best generals, and state-of-the-art weaponry? The invading forces were the countries with some of the highest GDPs, with undisputed political and economical leverage, yet why did they fail to quell the insurgents with simple ammunitions? In my opinion, it's because they didn't have a strong cause at all to invade. They invaded countries, thousands of miles away from their borders, that posed no serious security threat to them. As the war began to weigh, they did maths to find if their expenditure was worth the security they were getting by the occupation. It wasn't so they left. So, their strategies were indeed driven by their logistics when you see it in the long run. Right back where they started 20 years before. 

Putin's invasion does not justify the NATO's actions in Iraq and Afghanistan but I think he has a strong case for security reasons. Russia shares 2000 miles long border with Ukraine (strategic interest) which is why no matter their poor logistics they will not back down. He cited the same reason the US & NATO used in Yugoslavia and Iraq i.e. to protect the minorities and demilitarization, to invade Ukraine. We all know that US and NATO had false intelligence in Iraq invasion or was it intentional? No countries were sanctioned or held accountable or were taken to ICC. Its terrible to see so much helplessness in Yemen, Palestine and Ukraine, and now all that matters is peace. Please, don't take this the other way. Just a different perspective, not a disinformation actor. Hope this conflict ends soon and affected people are happy again. By the way, your content is way better researched and balanced than Johnny Harris guy."
"HI

Not enough Shock and Awe? Maybe they should have followed the American and British method and just bombed teh fuq out of Kyiv like it was Baghdad?
"Doesn't matter whether logistics is failed or not... Ukraine is gone.. done and dusted by Russia...
Please stop licking NATO's boot..."
"I wouldn't be surprised if China decides to attack Russia now, just for the resources.

I doubt China would do well, again for the logistics aspect, but still."
Shock and awe didn't work.
"I think you should just disable the comments for this video. Saying ""keep in mind there may be trolls/active disinformation"" doesn't completely prevent the harm they can cause."
"I had no idea how cut off the Russian people are from what is really going on. With that said, whats going on, that we, in America, are not informed of?"
"The west, me included, isn't very well informed on what happened in eastern ukraine since 2014, which led to this war."
Now do the same about American presence in Ukraine if you have balls
"@Martin Cuba had nukes there. Ukraine would not have NATO troops in its border like the Baltic's didn't have.

The Baltic's got NATO troops in its border only when Russia invaded Crimea and the tensions spiked. The only aggressor around is Russia. Ukraine didn't want to join NATO until after Crimea was invaded. Everything is Russia's fault and they dare to put blame on EU."
@Lykos Lt how is that bad? How did the US deal with similar problem in Cuba?
@Lykos Lt why dont you answer my question?
Wow.... what a humiliating position my man Putin has made for himself.
None of the Russian troops thought they liberate and none wanted to do that lol
"if civilians don't want to get shot, they shouldn't attack Russian troops and logistics tanks"
"Plot twist: Kiev cae, y Zelensky marcha al exilio."
Th one thing that YouTube is great at is censorship.  UnAmerican.
After seeing this it's hilarious reading the Russian bots and a handful of genuine tools claim soldiers believed it was a mere exercise.
Let me tell you a couple of three things:  1 - The Russians are aware of it. 2 - They will adapt. 3- Unlike USA the Russians only want to secure their border and not dominate the whole world. I think I' ve been clear!!
"I think it would have been somewhat of important to mention, that Russian Media spreads the misinformation that Ukraine is ruled by Nazis and the Ukrainians want the russians to free them."
Great video
"oh shit hurry delete this video, the Russian will learn from their logistic mistake"
Super work.  I know what you are talking about.  You are right on!  Well Done.
They didn't even believe they were there to liberate them they were told they were there for military exercises and then suddenly they were told they were invading sorry not invading crossing the border to protect the locals
Whoever kills Putin will go down in world history as the biggest badass and life saver to have ever lived.
"And today we're seeing the results of their truck issue, footage is popping up with trains carrying civilian junker vehicles, presumably to the front lines to make up for the massive destruction of russian trucks by the ukrainians."
Putin  baddie
Vladimir Putin showed the world their weakness. It was only in the mind of people the might of Russia... their armies are just so weak... their militarily can only destroy civilian which they are doing now but can't fight with other armies. .
"Ukraine asked the West to give it nuclear weapons. Why does a monkey need a pomegranate? If you want to die as soon as possible, then let's go. Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States. I'm not afraid to die. But if you are tired of living, then we are ready. If there is no Russia in the world, then why do we need such a world? Think. A resident of Belarus, Ukrainian by nationality."
Why Ukraine is not attacking the Russian Convoys? It's a once upon a Time Opportunity.
Russia did not expect for Ukraine to surrender. He’s an intelligent exKGP spy he knows what he is doing.
"Everything is logistics, everything is 4, and everything is racist.
It seems Ukraine was prepared for war. Russia not so much.

Perhaps it's time for China to come to Putin's rescue, roll their troops through Russia and suddenly stop to seize their nukes ;)"
"The very slow moving supply column may likely be the result of numerous ""breakdowns"" by those operating the trucks in order to stay away from the front.   Teenage conscripts were told they were going to do training and then ended up in a war in which they didn't want to be in.  On a railroad, you end up where the train takes you whether you want to go there or not.  Soldiers operating a truck who end up with a flat tire (because one of them stuck a bayonet into the tire) will have to pull out of the advancing column and replace/repair the tire while others pass them on the way to the front.  A ""breakdown"" may save one's life.    Czar Nikolas II became involved in an exhausting war and that ended his regime, his life and that of his family. Putin may be following him."
"they dont have to necessarily bayonet the tyres
apparently they are suppposed to maintain their vehicles and especially protect the tyres. But with corruption in russia this doesn't always happen. so the vehicles are not checked, turned over every month, tyres covered from UV damage etc
so the tyres...rot and rip. Even those trucks with air pressuration system( for different terrains) cant pump enough air pressure to to keep damaged tyres running. its alao a belief that they use the roads rather than the mud because it damages the tyres if they havent been maintained.."
Chinese tires haha. Can you imagine how low quality the products will be in a russia china partnership?
"This has happened again and again in history, you should mean that *someone* had learned from it. A few examples: Napoleon failed on his russian campaign because after the burning of Moscow there was no shelter for his troops. 1914 the German attack against France failed at the Marne because the Germans ran out of ammo and - surprise - were too far from their railway end points. Railway infrastructure in Belgium was destroyed. Every following attack failed after a few kilometers, because the logistics in the conquered craterfield were neigh impossible. 1944 the German attack in the Ardennes failed because they ran out of fuel. And these are only the few I know instantly."
"@David Kendrick Thank you!
Commendation! Not what you expect in a Youtube comments section..."
"@SanoyNimbus oh boy there we go again, there is no such this as peace, people never learn."
"@Morboxx Great, well reasoned points. I really appreciate it."
Because of Lukashenko's stupidity they lost a chance to put a puppet in Poland. Orban already said that he would not allow leathal weapons to go through Hungary.
Well of course they start looting. And scorched earth tactics are something the Russians are very familiar with. This was will cement Putin as a brutal dictator. Curse his name.
"That was *extremely* interesting. As an American general said in WWII ""My men can eat their belts, my tanks need fuel!"""
"Man this is absolutely genius how Ukraine has fought back with such a significantly smaller army.

It’s like the big bully Putin thought he could just walk in and win with little effort.. but it’s David vs Goliath here and we all remember what happened in that fight."
Yeah. Goliath learned real fast that ranged weapons were a thing and David had plenty of practice.
Conclusion .... Bullies perish
Didn't the American backed coup in 2014 happen before the Crimea incident?
"Another pile of nonsense, selling the idea of WW-2 offensive in Ukraine, which is a complete lie. Russia has zero resupply problem in Ukraine, all roads and air is freely available. The only 'problem' for Russia in Ukraine is SAVING RUSSIAN LIVES OF THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, with less than 150 casualties in  2 weeks of war, unlike the Americans which level cities to the ground completely disregarding civilian life. So stop the lies please. But you are getting paid to lie, its a good american tradition."
"HAHAHAHA, wait your'e serious? AHAHAHA"
Russia tried to impose through some people the Poponar Republic of Ukraine (comunist) but they were caught.
This war was nothing more than a massive lightbulb moment for the world. we all realised that russia isnt the force they claim to be without the power of nuclear arms.
David and Goliath
"Good video, but Anonymous doesn't exist anymore. Not since 2016, at least. It's just LARPers who don't even know why it's called 'anonymous', taking up the name for street cred."
How about corruption in the Russian army? Money meant for logistics was simply stolen. Chinese tyres on general mud rasputitsa in Ukraine? Come on Vlad.
"Either logistic problem or planned slow advance. Russia did survive both in Leningrad and Stalingrad, Kiev will be extremely well fortified why rushing it would be a error. Now the Russians stop electricity and supplies i several smaller cities to send a message to Kiev. But i doubt they will be succesful."
"What failed?  
All mayor cities are surrounded, most of the ukrainian military infrastrucre destoryed and 60% of the ukrainian army is expected to experience a pincer move in the next few days.

Doesn't sound like failure to me."
Hitler needed 300 000 troops to guard supply lines alone. He is absolutely crazy if he thinks you control Ukraine with 135 000 soldiers.
"Great video, easy to follow. They don't tell this stuff on the rolling news I tend to watch"
"We need a ""logistics of a wendover video"". Getting out this video in the usual top notch quality within 10 days is nuts..."
All thanks to Putin :@
When will you release video about famous Operation Cottage by US and Canadian forces against Japan during World War 2? I'd really be interest to have deep insights about logistics and military tactics.
Go Russia!
Same thing happended with US and Middle East countries
"Very uneducated and misinformation about Russians forces incapability .
Fighting in a civil war isn't as easy as in conventional engagements .
Don't forget it that they defeated Napoleon's invasion, later the German invasion in first and second Europe's wars .
Never underestimate it ."
The reason Hitler failed in invading Russia in ww2 is his tanks and vehicles could not cope with Russias harsh terrain. The dust would literally  seize up vehicles
"That and German logistics was terrible during this time period. The reason why they used ""Blitzkrieg"" was because WWI showed them they did not have the logistics to win a long war. Either they win within a year or two or suffer a slow, but guaranteed, defeat. Unfortunately for the Germans, Russia was simply too big to take in that time period. Their logistics grew from terrible to nightmarish the deeper they got into Soviet territory. And that's not even factoring in the fact their inability to defeat Britain meant their factories and rail lines were always within bombing range, making resupply of their forces in the USSR even harder."
@taskandpurpose intrerested to learn what you think of this...
"All these issues can be overcome and rather quickly. If Russia can refrain from using soviet tactics, they can rally their troops and people to better support cause. It might be too late though. In this case, Russia looks like a joke and loses its place as a super power."
"@queerdeer12 ... yes, but Russian army is a massive beast. Really massive. And as any massive beast, it is hardly adaptable.
Remember that 65 millions years ago, those huge dinosaurs gone extinct, while smaller ones survived and evolved into modern birds. 
Russian army is too big and too cumbersome to adapt."
"@CipiRipi00 No, but I am optimistic. If it means the difference between completing your objective or suffering a total loss, I belive adaptations would come to fruition."
"""If Russia can refrain from using soviet tactics...""  Can you imagine an army the size of Russian army developing and implementing a whole new set of tactics overnight? :P"
I think part of the problem of the  Russian failure too is the fact that the Russian soldiers do not want to hurt innocent civilians as well as innocent Ukrainian soldiers for some stupid dictator Putin
I don’t know where wendover is reporting from…but Russia has encircled 16 battalions in a move called ‘the cauldron’ in the south and is driving a tight circle till they surrender or die of bombardment…..
Yup .
Also underestimated the size of Ukrainians balls
"Awesome explanation I studied the rise of leptospirosis on Spirochaetes type of biological and warfare in late Cold War because of the accusation of Russia to usa back then To the corn production but in the end what led to the starvation of their own people was the incapacity to produce local food on their pacific border and the corruption of the key cities as Moscow and san Petersburg which lead to amassing the corn for their own stablishment and not the redistribution of goods. 

In the First World War América did not have big logistics and the construction of Route 66 and decentralized army from Atlantic to pacific gave USA a global reach and of course the best logistic in the world which still stands

So far the multicultural approach of USA thank god will not be compared to no country which will allow a global reach for keeping this lunatics at hand

Unfortunately for ukranian people to soon to late

Is amazing that such an intelligent person as the Rusia president made this stupid mistake

It shows that they lost on every level 
Political
Military
Logistics 
Economic
And culture war"
"I truly thought Russia did just a horrible job at there logistics and that's why they failed.
But clearly Ukraine has done some great job of causing the problems Russia faces now.
Weirdly this is the first time hearing about it. While it's already going on for days."
BTW the Russians are not going to storm the cities there tactic is to.destroy the military not civilians  and they  are extremely sucessful
It looks like “Russia isn’t even trying no more”because apparently they said they are waiting for “civilians to evacuate” but I don’t know. Time will tell because Ukraine is actually stopping them they might just be the most impressive force. Like a David and Goliath thing.
I would argue this entire video is disinformation and propaganda hahaha.
"As a Russian with a PolSci degree, I think the politics side should be mentioned. Throughout last 3-4 years, Russian government agencies experienced massive corrosion in terms of decision-making, management and expertise process. This is a common thing for authoritarian personalistic regimes. Obviously, this process didn't leave the Army unaffected.

Finally, it is widely argued that Putin, solely responsible for making the decision to invade, was misinformed by his elites that the Ukrainians are truly awaiting for ""liberation""; the Russian army would take Kyiv in ""hours""; and the West would step back like it did after the Georgia War. Personalistic clientelist regime problems, once again.

One of the primary examples of this corrosion is Roskomnadzor, agency responsible for blocking any independent media, was a biggest joke in 2018 when it failed to block Telegram. They just didn't have qualified people. Methods of propaganda also deteriorated drastically, as well as quality of official public communication."
Seriously! How? I mean they planned to invade a country and didn't expect this scenario at all????. Are Russian military leaders just a bunch of incompetent people ? 🤷
"What am I watching now, CNN?"
USA also lost in afghanistan
"What a bunch of BS :). As far as I can see, focus is on the south and south ""offensive"" is going great. Ukrain's major army groups are encircled. That is what I call a success, not a ""fail"". Kiev is not the main priority for now."
Don't be silly Russians and the Donbass troops have 12 brigades a brigade is 5000 troopsneo fascist and Ukraine troops  surrounded in a cauldron this is same tactic used in Siria  isolating and destroying Islamic fanatics setting up civilian corridors
Putin=Hitler with nukes.
It's not an invasion its a special military operation 🤫
"I think some information is untrue . To a country such as Russia with advanced military arms , Ukraine would be an easy target . I just think they're taking it slowly in order to reach a conclusion with the West."
Nice analysis. Thank you.
"As unprepared as Russia seems to have been for this war, this won't mean they won't ultimately win it. The issue is that Putin is willing to go as far as it takes, even if it means flattening Kiev and the other major Ukrainian cities with airstrikes much like he did in Grozny, Chechnya's capital in the past. Moreover when Putin makes a threat he typically means it, unlike our leaders in the west. Thus when Putin threatened the usage of nuclear weapons we must assume that if push will truly come to shove he will borrow a page from Truman's book and nuke Ukraine much like the US did to Japan during WW2. After all in Putin's mind this is a war he can't afford to lose, much as how WW2 was a war the US couldn't afford to lose. Once you're at that point the distance to using the kitchen sink is very small and Putin, unlike the west, doesn't hesitate."
Wow! Sane analytical reporting.
Awesome video bro thank you!!
"Hey, if this invasion ends up with a war not as long as Irak, not as expensive as Irak and with less deaths than Irak, against the second largest army in eastern Europe and one of the largest armies in Europe (Ukraine), will it be now consider a logistic success only after french invasion of Libia?"
any yet Russia is still winning
Genius video!
Puten Exposé his weaknesses in war economics.
LMAO
"Great research, too bad YouTube and all western news is basically banned in Russia now."
Putin is coming for you ;)
have you been hacked or something?
As much as Russia and America feel they are super powers... The afghans has severely humbled them
Thanks for this informative video! My respect to the Ukrainian people for standing and defending their country with such a courage.
Crazy what goes into military logistics now imagine WW3.
"You telling us that the Russian military doesn’t have GPS  . 

A space going nation’s military getting lost in a 1st world country 😅😅😅😅😅😅"
Russians are good guys hope they win this operation 👍🏻
you are being lied to
Obviously russian logistics plan was based on the idea of flash invasion and looting Ukrainian resources.
This is such great work
"Putin  knows that he has not long to live. He has not had sex for many years and he has a lot of things frustrating him. His main frustration is his manhood. He will almost probably give the signal to his nuclear units to bomb the west with no warning. He has become the classical evil villain who tells you what he is going to do but takes his time by slowly torturing you.
His wife left him because his penis is too small to satisfy any woman.  If you look at most men who are fighting in any war most of them are sexually frustrated. They have no way of releasing the extra testosterone build up in their ballsack. I know from my own experience as a teenager. I had a very strict mother who watched my every move when it came to girls. I did not even know what masturbation was and even when I found out what is was I did not do it for a very long time. When I did start masturbation at the age of 22 I would always feel very guilty after every session. Fortunately I found my very 1st girlfriend at the same age. Once I was having regular sex I did not feel like physically fighting other guys to prove I was a man."
"Absolutely brilliant video. You did what you do best, and applied it to a modern day tragedy, and so fast! Thank you. I learned a lot."
"10,000 souls dead, millions homeless. Russia pays $1.80 for gas we pay $5.00. Who's winning this war? Open US oil pipeline and defund the War"

"причина этой войны; Она возникла из-за опасений России за безопасность в результате амбиций и капризов Америки и ее сторонников включить Украину в НАТО и попасть под нос у России. Если Америка откажется от этой политики, война немедленно прекратится. Куда бы ни пошли НАТО и американские военные в мире; принес кровь и слезы

the reason for this war; It emerged due to Russia's security concerns as a result of the ambitions and whims of America and its supporters to include Ukraine in NATO and get under the nose of Russia. If America abandons this policy, the war will stop immediately. Wherever Nato and the American military went in the world; brought blood and tears
A"
"""the reason for this war; It emerged due to Russia's security concerns as a result of the ambitions and whims of America and its supporters to include Ukraine in NATO..."". 
We heard the same tune long ago. The reason for Winter War: It emerged due to USSR's security concerns over Germany using Finland as a staging ground for an attack against USSR.
Old lies, new liar."
"nato doesnt pose a threat, youre falling to propaganda"

World: ummmmmmm"
"I'm from Ukraine 🇺🇦, you can ask me questions about the situation, thanks for the video, hope this madness ends soon"
"Why can't the European Union and Russia become allies for fuck's sake ? 

I'm so tired of the lack of all the russians leaders ambitions who always want Russia to be the main power when Russia can't live on her own. 

And that the european union is an american puppet. 

Damn just imagine what would happen if the europe and russia created a new alliance we would literally rules the entire world and both China and USA couldn't do shit against us... 

I'm so tired."
"Why? ""Russia is the third Rome"". Russia is destined to rule over others. And if Russia doesn't have its own Empire to rule over, there is no need for such a world. ""Why do we need a world if Russia is not in it""? - Dmitri Kiselyov"
Why would the EU want to be in an alliance with a mad autocrat? The US isn't perfect but at least they are a democracy.
Well in America we thought the Russians had a powerful military I don't think it would take much for America to defeat them
"Logistics weakness by Russia, a gain for America and NATO to hit Russia hard."
"This is a good story, but you have to go back further in time.
In 2009, Obama visited 9 Wuhan style labs in Ukraine.
In 2012, Obama sent in CIA agents to train neo nazis to have a que and over throw the president of Ukraine and put in a puppet president.
In 2014, Biden and politicians put family and friends on energy boards, hoping to build an oil pipeline through Ukraine, but that failed when parts of Ukraine voted to be part of Russia.
Ukraines president  retaliated by cutting off water to those parts of Ukraine under Russia.
Ukraine asked to be a part of nato breaking Russias treaty of 1996, which was to remove Russian nukes and be a free country.
Fast forward to today, where weeks ago bill gates said there will be another covid style break out again coming soon.
If Russia soldiers look lost its because they are looking for something or someone.
This fight with Ukraine and Russia is because of the EU and America turning Ukraine into a laundry mat for dirty politicians and criminal organizations, factor in the rich that want to eliminate the world's population.
Know your history."
Take out every railway line leading bear or to ukraine
"Lol, how the western countries have been exposed by Putin is purely ironic
It was all Okay to bomb and ruin the dark-skinned folks but now when the war has entered the European borders, its all of a sudden Wrong?? 🤣"

@locust useless argument. What happened in Iraq and Syria doesn't make this any better.
"@Booger McPhearson what the difference did you have the same sympathy when iraq, syria , afghanistan etc civilians where brutally murder or just fake sympathy because there white, blonde blue eyes."
Very well done! I don't know if I'm more impressed by the remarkable quality of the video or the seamless transition into an advertisement that actually emphasizes the value of the product to the viewer. Kudos.
"THE AMERICAN ARMY AND THE NATO ARMY ARE THE MOST COALY SOLDIERS.  YOU BOMBED CIVILIANS, IRAQ, SYRIA, LIBYA, SERBIA.  YOU BURNED VIETNAM WITH NAPALM, 2 JAPAN'S NUCLEAR BOMB.

YOUR GOVERNMENTS ARE SOWING CHAOS AND WAR, AND THIS IS A FIGHT AGAINST RUSSIA ON THE TERRITORY AND WITH THE HELP OF UKRAINE, ALSO THE NAZIS GOVERNMENT OF UKRAINE!!!  YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS.  I WISH A FAST PEACE IN UKRAINE!!!"
As usual you forgot 8 years of hell for Donbass under the bombs of ukranian nazi.
@Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig Do you have evidence of Putin's lies? Source
"@Andrej If you have a problem with his sources, tell us what it is. If you claim that Ukrain is a war-mongering Nazi regime, provide your own sources (that can be checked). But just claiming stuff that cannot be backed up is worthless. If you can't provide sources, I'll just assume that you have fallen for Putin's lies."
@Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig Sourse of video don't rice any doubt obviously...Yeah?
He keeps saying there nazis well proof before action and diplomacy before war putin
I wonder what happened to russian lovers mocking USA's disastrous invasion in the middle east claiming that Russia would have done it better.
"We all could see US/NATO advance logistic in withdrawal from Afghanistan. Even with expensive production, your propaganda sound very cheap."
@9 nine that's not a source.
"@Steinchen drei von und zu vierzig CNN, MBC, BBC and others 😂😂😂"
@9 nine Can you provide a source for that?
Tell me where he's wrong
Someone needs to ask putin for proof of nazis
"Who cares about logistics issues, when you're winning? Way to deflect from the reality of what is going-on."
you misswd the entire point of the video..
I would believe most of the common people of Russia wouldn’t accept this action from ‘dickhead’ Putin
"It seems to me a bully is still a bully.
Why does a country have to have a pact with another to Aid in the defense of a weaker country?

If a student is getting bullied at school other students have a choice which is to simply walk away or to step in.

"What are you in about ! 
 Why would China invade Russia 😅😅😅😅😅😅"
"Putin is not wise, he doesn’t understand the fact that Ukraine is strong. However not as strong as Russia and yet there actually having to rely on logistics and railroads for Russia. What a weak military!"
Wasn't the reason Russia won the Winter War was because it kept throwing bodies at Finland?
"source: facebook posts?

this is one of the most inaccurate explanations, feels like they red news as ""research"", which explain this pile of crap"
what's your explanation?
lucky for us they haven't learned the lessons... but also many western leaders do not know the impact of logistics on soldiers morale... i have a constant battle teaching this lesson to my superiors
"my only question is, why would you brand it as successful or failed while its still happening?
You've got to wait till it finishes and only then with enough evidences (like you generally do) claim something."
Look how far Hitler got before the tide turned against him.
"@Sid Raina Abandoned tanks might be, ironically, part of the strategy. Some analysts suspect the Russians decided to first throw old hardware in first to test the water: they knew Ukraine received weapons from the West so they wanted to see what they had in hand, and would send more modern and powerful weaponry later. 
It may or may be not the case, we'll only know it in the future, as you said."
"@TechGeniux it's still an opinion of an individual that it's failed. Maybe it hasn't worked initially the way the army would want but labelling anything as failed is still too early. We all can speculate right now but we can't conclude right away.

And abandoning tanks is not a conclusive evidence for failure. Only if the objective wasn't achieved, will it be considered a failure."
"He just said the logistics failed, not the whole invasion.

And the logistics clearly did fail because there were abandoned tanks"
Very incorrect and misguiding to keep the world and Ukrainians falsely keep the war alive while western forces can step on their corpses and plan their future media and military campaigns.
"When US invade : Liberation
When Rest of the world invade : Human Right's violation/War Crime/ Whatever you can come up with
Russia has right to protect his territory and country from every possible incoming threat and neutralize it before it is too late."
If Belarus is helping Russia maybe everyone should send troops in too?
Western propaganda
14:30 capitalist style approach once again shows its utter superiority
"Ukraine may be thousands of kilometres away from Malaysia but to Malaysians, it is much closer emotionally. A routine Malaysian Airline Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down there on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 on board. That scar is still raw. The World has forgotten about the killings of civilian flight MH17"
WELL DONE SAM & TRISTIN! 👏👏👏 THANK YOU FOR ACTUAL REAL INFORMATION WITH SOURCES! NOW THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE! 🇺🇦
This is going to be in the history books in the future and we're seeing it happen live
"Putin, just admit you’ve lost, there’s no way out. There’s a price on your head, so just do what Adolf did in the bunkers in 1945, and make this world, a world worth living in. Because hell, due to you, I’m not even sure if I want to put mini-me’s on this world."
thats why people should stop comparing russian military to US. Russia in general is so average.
"Putin has brainwashed his people to believe that this is a ""saving"" of Ukrainian people from Nazis. LIKE WTF!  My mind was blown when I heard Putin's address that was on Russian TV from last night. HOW CAN THEY BELIEVE THIS BS! 🤔🤯"
"A lot of people who was for the DPR at first (Donetsk people republic) now regret it because basically Russia didn't help them in any form and their economic status have become horrible. 

Russia claim to want to help those people by integrating them into the Russian federation but in reality he just want more territories to put his military facilities just like NATO do... 

Their isn't a good side in this story... 

The reality is that both the NATO and Russia fight to get a piece of Ukraine and the Ukrainians people are in the middle of their geo strategic little game suffering for no good reason... 

Fuck all of them."
Putin never fail
💩💩💩FAKE 💩💩💩
russian bot 🤡🤡
In short. A functioning logistics is freaking important! Brilliant documentary as always!
"I think Russian logistic design for defending the nation rather than an offensive one, their logistic look like to  ""an extend"" prepare some funny mustache man invades them again. Either their high command doesn't realize it(which make them an Incompetent bunch) or Putin have really big balls for dreaming that he can win in the opening days of war and doesn't see that guerilla war and partisan is a possibility"
"So Putin forgot that his railroads wouldn't extend into Ukraine? Wow. Good job, Putin."
If this what Russia has so there’s no ww3

"Nah it wasn't failed logistics, the ghost of Kyiv single handedly took down the Russian military"
"@Lil Jojo in case you haven't noticed, this is called a j o k e"
messages from Ukrainian ministry when Russian troops are in Kyiv be like
Myth
Do same video when this is over !
"Your analysis is crooked, Russian Forces are working as per their Doctrine."
"@Golf Sierra Russian military doctrine doesn't include huge convey backups, getting their tanks and military vehicles hijacked and masses of their troops surrendering. Any which way you look at this, this war is far more costly for them than they expected

And what does alleged HR violations have to do with a logistics video"
"@Shamrock one sided, didn't disclose about how Russia operates its troops, no mention of Ukraine's HR Violations in Donbass and Lohansk."
Crooked how
"Tho the video was written with the algorithm in mind, I want to point out at it's also an easier watch for those who need a less emotionally charged report, due to fatigue, anxiety, depression etc. I've tried to stay updated but find myself crying every time, so this was a nice change. Thank you"
"A lot of people think America's military might is due to technology like big guns, missiles, stealth, etc. But it's not. Consider that we can send any plane anywhere in the world without ever landing it to refuel. We can literally move a bridge anywhere in the world within 24 hours. Like, that's fucking incredible. We have fuel trucks that fly, float, and roll. That's our real power: oil."
"Putin's tactic was to scare everyone off and take ukraine in 1 day or less but he failed, russian propaganda tv (similar to goebbels) said that most of Ukrainians want russia and will welcome russia's army but it didnt happen, they tried to blitzkrieg like hitler in ww2 but failed, now they bomb cities, civilians and shoot everyone they see in ukraine in order to scare Ukrainians and cause panic among people, now Moscow sends other nations to ukraine too like buryats, chechens, tatars, yakuts etc. also calls reserved soldiers, russia loses a lot in ukraine which shows that the ""unbeatable"" russian army was just a myth, russians themselves cant fight against an army especially without other minorities in russia like chechens and tatars etc. Russian army can only fight against unarmed civilians and in the best case fight terrorists in desert using rockets and air strikes. If nato could fight for Ukrainiane russia would collapse in a month or so"

As a Ukrainian I find it hillarious how the articles and videos from weeks ago on ""how many hours it would take russia to invade Ukraine"" have changed to this type now.

"@AT2T vastly improved... I don't know what you've been smoking but I want some of that.

Crimea's private industry has taken a serious downturn. IT industry has shrank significantly due to political instability and sanctions, maritime industry has shrank due to the difficulty of Russians acquiring visas in the EU, and small businesses area suffering from a lack of tourism in the wake of the invasion

The only upturn is in government employment and that's simply Russia pumping money into Crimea as opposed to Crimea making money on their own

So tell me again, how have things vastly improved"
"@L. Y. damn bro, reminds me of another country
here's a hint: it made all major urban centers it invaded into dust"

How does the Russian armed forces not have enough trucks? They got several of the biggest truck plants in the world.

This is just a western propaganda and nonsense. as if you know what the russian thinks. your video is base on a 10 days event. putin have it in mind in 10yrs now!!

"Ukrainian people wp,but u didn't do this without outside help for sure ,Putin thought to much of himself."
"Also, one very important thing when it comes to the failure of Russian logistics in Ukraine - so, these Russian conscripts spent months sitting in Belarus preparing for the invasion and, during their time there, they were probably bored out of their skulls and sick of the freezing cold, so I'm guessing that a large portion of them took fuel from their tanks and BMPs and traded it for alcohol with the locals. That's one of the reasons we are seeing stranded Russian tanks with no fuel on Ukrainian roads."
I'm sure they were also running the vehicles all day and all night while doing nothing so they can run the heaters.  And I'm sure their fuel calculations didn't account for that.
"Ah, yes, the logistics man"
Every HOI4 players will understand this easy-ly
"This is a great channel.  Regardless, this segment does not explain the logic behind Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.  This logic is covered elsewhere."
Relied on paper maps rly? Its 2022 bro come on...
That meant there's no centralized people dedicated only for navigation. That meant every person have to rely on their own to navigate.
Tell Russia that. They still use paper
"During this presentation, which was very informative, I had rather extreme thought. What if Putin staged a badly orchestrated invasion on purpose? With a lot of the language he has been using lately, it seems as if he is trying to provoke the west to overstep their bounds, and needed the time to do it. Therefore, he orders an invasion by troops that were not ready. This artificially draws out the conflict in order to maximize the length of time over which Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials will request aid. The longer he can drag out the threat of taking Kyiv, the more desperate Zelenskyy and his associates become and the more likely NATO is to capitulate to his requests for direct aid. This then gives Putin an excuse to use nuclear force. What if Putin wants this to end in nuclear conflict and he is trying to force NATO's hand, so he can justify to his people the use of nuclear force against NATO nations? If his ambitions are to re-establish Russian global primacy, he can only do that by deposing the US and western Europe. The only cost effective (yikes) way he can do that is with a tactic nuclear strike. I hope I'm wrong, but ever since the beginning of this, something has seemed off about the whole thing. I have trouble believing that Russian command didn't think this invasion through more thoroughly. They must have gathered intelligence on Ukrainian sentiment and national pride? They must know that Zelenskyy won in a landslide election on a campaign of anti-corruption, the sort that can galvanize a nation? They have to have known about the strong nationalistic liberty tilt of the people? Right? Don't they get reports? These seemed like things that should have been obvious at the outset, and guided any plans they made. 

I am given to understand that according to some document, it was revealed that the timeline for the invasion was about 15 days. Doesn't that mean they are roughly on schedule? Am I out to lunch here? How does a major military power bungle something as relatively straight forward as an invasion of a smaller, weaker country? Something doesn't add up about that."
"@TheYgds
i think you're misinterpreting my point: even in a highly successful, highly efficient invasion of Ukraine, NATO would not start WW3 over it. the whole premise of Russia dragging out the conflict doesn't change that. there is no planned advantage of Russia doing a botched attempt at installing a puppet. i don't see how attacking a non-NATO country would ever qualify as a planned mind game to confuse NATO into attacking. no matter how much charisma and leadership qualities zelenskiy has, NATO will never intervene. no matter how much empathy Europe's people have, NATO will not plunge themselves into war.

Putin should know this, so there's really no reason to stage a pathetic invasion. i think Putin is trying to make the best use out of blunders somewhere within the 8+ year invasion plan that lead to the bad start."
"@DawnPraiser They are giving their support, but there has been some bungling going on there too. Hopefully the shipment of fighter planes that were supposed to already be there, get there and help the Ukrainians to continue contesting the airspace. 

About NATO, that is sort of my point. Putin appears to be playing a mind game with NATO. He has them, the EU and the UN in a difficult position. We have the backdrop of history, wherein similar actions were taken, and not appropriately repelled. Then, because they were not repelled, continued to escalate. Putin's rhetoric is very similar, with some differences, to ideas of German nationalism last century. It is similar to Japanese imperialist ideas as well regarding the islands of the pacific and south-east Asia. 

World wars precipitate because canny, unapologetic and serious idealogues, like Putin, are able to weaponize the peace loving, non-violent, and war-weary attitudes of those who he wishes to defeat. 

NATO, the EU and the UN are all now in a position where if they act directly, they will be held responsible for dragging their countries into another world war. If they do not act, another world war is merely delayed, unless Ukraine can repel Russia, since Putin's ambitions are abundantly clear, and attacks on NATO countries are likely as soon as next year, depending on military success in Moldova.

We can pray that Putin dies of a heart-attack or gets assassinated, but I'm not holding my breath."
"lmao, as if NATO will ever fire. NATO members (as their respective countries) are gonna give support, intel and equipment as Ukraine fights Russia on their own."
But russia would be wiped off the earth if he did that. Lets hope you'r wrong.
So sabotage the railroad is what I gain from this video

"The truth is He could take Ukraine by now , he chose to not wipe cities and kill millions like others do .. That's all ."
"@Billel Tôt Talking numbers? There are no numbers in your comment except ""million"". And you say ""that's all"" which is really *RMAO!* -ish"
"@Markus Lorence I'm talking numbers here , acting like he couldn't take it in it self its a stupid claim , we know what he can do with his military power ."
*RMAO!* If he didn't want to kill he wouldn't have invaded in the first place.
Unfortunately Russia still has the resources and determination to get over these setbacks. There’s going to be so much more destruction before any kind of ceasefire unless someone manages to assassinate Putin and his cronies.
Glory to Ukraine.
"The ever increasing russian desperation referred to here , and its manifestation in looting ,wreckless shelling and civilian fatalities /displacement are the same ""war crimes "" the ICC is  investigating.These crimes are truely shocking and must be dettered as soon as possible."

"Russia massively screwed up, and now they’re paying the price of it."
Quickly? 150k troops were there already two months ago
"Claiming that Russia's logistics have failed is premature. Have you ever heard the saying ""never fight a land war in Asia?"" That's because the immense distances involved make supply lines tenuous and difficult to defend. Russia is taking their sweet time setting up siege of Ukraine, because this isn't the first time they've had to fight a land war with long supply lines. As for the Russian military's poor performance at first, they likely sent in their worst troops to do recon and cause some light damage and general chaos; if they were KIA, it would be no big deal because they weren't the elite troops anyway. Russia doesn't do ""shock and awe"" like the US does -- Russia does slow grinding sieges that last for months."
It seems you did not watch the video.
Children and vodka perhaps?

"Some crazy numbers:
Estimates are nearly 10k russian deaths so far.
Russia has 200,000 soldiers in Ukraine/ 900,000 total armed forces. So in 10 days Ukraine has killed 5% of the invading force, and more than 1% of THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN MILITARY
The Iraq war, by contrast, saw ~25,000 NATO/allies killed and ~35,000 Iraqi soldiers killed. That war lasted almost A DECADE. Ukraine and Russia could hit those numbers in a few *WEEKS*. This is likely the bloodiest conflict of the last few decades, at least."
Brilliant video. 👍
Its not failed 😂
"i thought of someting the Z mark on the russain tank etc maybe the name of the ukrain president.




am from the EU god bles the one that fight for there homes"
Russia's biggest blunder everyone knew the actions.  Times have changed  ppl know everything well before invasions have been started.
I think Putin is sending more new recruites then sending the battle field experience troops to the war zone so that way the newbie can learn. Its only been 7 days of Putins war against Ukraine we haven't seen what Russia is capable of doing yet.
Russia  not fail all war start by usa
*RMAO!*
Kinda telling that civillians are not being killed - because they can get close enough to throw a molotov at the fuel trucks... in Iraq they would have been filled with 350 bullet holes inside a second 😅

"Wow, this is a 100x better breakdown of the big progression, big picture and many of the details of the first week or so of the invasion than anything I’ve seen and I’ve watched and reads dozens and dozens of hours from both traditional and non-traditional media."
"@A R You don't have to decide one or the other. It's not about being the world's policeman, if the US looks inward and didn't project its power around the world then its economy will suffer, maybe not immediately but over time it will. I don't think it's said enough, and from my experience it's hardly ever mentioned on US news, but other countries want into wars with the US in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, it wasn't just you guys. If you want a free world you have to form alliances and back up countries to get good trading relations with them, relations that American jobs do depend on. 

So whilst you may think it's all corrupt that is the situation you have to weigh up. I don't think the US has its priorities right, people in the US don't want to fund any public services through taxes (and the rich especially get away with offsetting paying anything by having clever accountants), but that's a completely different matter. So the US, as it generally has throughout its history, can withdraw and not engage with the world, but it will affect the prosperity in the long term, don't think it won't. It got rich from the Marshall Plan after WWII, but I bet not many Americans realise this, it's just not very sexy, so isn't ever explained."
"@Nick T. Sounds like great reasoning, but even with sources that have proven to be correct and on the ground reports you still to be careful and raise that there will be natural biasses in the reporting.

"I've been in the Twitter spaces with reporters who say flat out that they will not cover Ukrainian losses. 

So what we're left with is loud propaganda about Russian losses and then very quiet reports about more cities falling and a picture of a map with Russian troops advancing every day. You aren't helping anyone by providing bad information. It's the typical progressive mindset that believes that individuals are incapable of thinking for themselves and it's enraging."

Lol the war isn't over yet. Probably another 2 years before Russia has taken all of Ukraine.
Amazing video love all of them. But is the capital not pronounced key-ev ? Had many a chicken Kiev and always said it that way 😅
"The whole point is that Russia wasn't ""planning"" on some form of massive large-scale invasion of the country. The whole thing was sparked by the U.S. government creating fears around the issue pre-emptively. Our own government's fears seems to be directly tied into actions taken by Russia. Being aware of this, and having less news to control the people with (yes, every 4 months there's been a fear-producing news story directly tied in with government warnings/actions since Covid started), they decided to pull a page out of their old playbook, which was to create a big stupid huge baseless shitstorm around Russia.

And as far as I'm concerned Russia has had troops surrounding Ukraine for a long-ass time, like 8 years.

Let's put it like this for a second.

If this were a ""big ass huge planned attack"", as was reported by the U.S. government, then Russia would have also had a ""big ass huge planned contingency plan"" and so forth. Putin is a smart guy. Instead the U.S. caused Russians to react out of fear at the borders and storm the country without any plan in action, causing their soldiers to run out of goods, etc., thinking the U.S. was about to pull some bullshit like they did with Iran."

"@Baghuul except this analysis is totally wrong and very premature. And to add some clarifying points on my other stats:

The Ukraine government has itself acknowledged 20% loss in territory - this can be found through a 2 minute google search and on most major news sources.

The formal army has 250k, the territorial defense force is 150k and the national guard has 100k (500k total). Ukraine further has 900k reserves and has called 3 rounds to mobilization including woman most recently. The 500k is a low estimate.

There are documents about military modernization released by the Ukrainian government and think tanks about the quantity of military equipment inherited from the USSR (40%). This can also be found through a 2 minute google search."
"Ukraine has lost 20% of its territory (largest country in Europe) in 3 months with an army of ~500 thousand while Russia sent ~150 thousand. Note the Ukraine army has been supplied, trained and prepared for the last 8 years by the collective west, and fights through using the population and cities of the Donbas as live shields and inherited 40% of all Soviet military equipment (the more modern models as Ukraine was front line)."

"It wasn’t suddenly. At request of China, Russia waited until the Olympics were over to invade. They began literally within an hour of the closing ceremonies. So, China is an active partner in this in both knowing, endorsing it domestically within China and helping them circumnavigate sanctions. Putin’s biography has become #2 bestseller in China since the war began and posting about their hopes that female refugees between 10-25 will be brought to them. However, most Chinese in Ukraine have called those out for the cowardly keyboard warriors they are."

We've only seen two nukes dropped on civilian populations ever, and that was before most countries had access to them. Those were both completely unjustified nuclear attacks as well. I'm fully with the Ukrainians in every way, but diplomatically managing a nuclear superpower like Russia with a psycho at the helm is very difficult. Regardless, Slava Ukrainia always and forever <3"

There is no doubt that a balance is hard to find, so much so that many organisations have given up searching mostly since role models appear to be non existent! This is not about being pessimistic, but about valuing more than ever self esteem and actions based on gratitude rather than aggressity and violence.

"serious question though: if their initial objective was to just capture the separatist regions and secure the port in the south, and attacking Kyiv and Kharkov was just an ""extra"" they tacked on, does what they did even count as a failure? I'm starting to think the northern attack was almost like a distraction."
"to clarify: I don't think their initial idea with the northern attacks was that they would just be a distraction (they massively underestimated Ukrainian resitance and resolve to be independent), but it functions as a plan B in that regard pretty well.
Also: it probably still isn't worth the extra backlash they got internationally for attacking Kyiv directly. But it's hard to speculate how bad the global response would have been instead if they focused more on their immediate objectives."
"It was 100% not a distraction, but they are just more successful in the south, so they go for the second most important target. Same with Germany in WW 1. They wanted France at all cost first, but their defence force against Russia was so successful that they defeated Russia before they were even close in France."
"@jmd321321 I agree with what yuo said but remember that NATO does not ""expand"". Countries ask to join. This war is because Putin did not want Ukraine to choose to be indipended and join a difensive alliance. ""NATO expansion"" is a Russian propaganda excuse"

Also this was literally the first video I've seen on the war that didn't twist facts to fuel propaganda. Because both sides do that, unfortunately. Politicians and reporters resort to theatrics which is utterly disrespectful to everyone whose actual life AND DEATH they (mis)portray."

"The fact that Russia knew of all these shortcomings, yet lurched ahead with an ill-prepared invasion anyway, shows just how illogical and disconnected from reality Russian leadership is, currently."
"Sure, but then again they have already made a ton of progress in just the first week. And Putin has so much disposable military equipment/soldiers to throw at this he only needs some semblance of a plan to actually succeed against Ukraine. Ukraine is just simply outnumbered."

"To put it short, Sam just dropped a fat diss on the Russian military"
"failed or not, they will eventually get what they want, with nato being weakling, and ukrain fight for them self, is almost certain that Russia will be the vicktor"
"Im not saying this war is all a game, but seeing how social media effects it will be interesting."
Awesome and good job!
"Russia can learn from this failure, unfortuanately theyve lost the element of surprise"
In the end russia will be divided among the victors!
Ukraine people are dying bacause of this type of propaganda
Russia isn't an imperium like USA. They are mainly defensive. Putin failed to recognize that thought.
Defensive my ass.
Western propaganda.
"@Sarajevo Sunshine This is not ""western propaganda"""

"The angels of God are watching humans in disbelief. The angels of God are crying (if they could cry) over the evil nature and path that the primitive ant-like humans take on Earth. The angels of God make way for the dark Angel of Death to touch down on Earth on February 6, 2022 A.D. to give power for the nuclear weapons to be used just like they were used when the most kind Americans have gently dropped 2 tiny atomic bombs on the peaceful Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945 A.D. to display the sheer kindness of the American democracy on Japanese soil. The Angel of Death will multiply the pain and sorrow of the human kind a thousand times from the pain that was felt in the 1945 A.D. atomic bomb attacks in Japan. ""When He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour."" The Book of Revelation, as recorded by Saint John on the Island of Patmos in 96 A.D. This is the ""moment of silence"" today as the global population is technologically advanced enough to watch the war updates live on their phones just as the Angel of War is about to open the seventh seal that will send shivers to the monks on Mount Athos and those of us who can see the spirit realm. Tomorrow the Russian 67-km long military convoy will peacefully enter the city of Kiev bringing the much-needed American-style democracy, love and equality for all homosexuals, pederasts, and pedophiles in Kiev where they could finally parade on the main streets of Kiev in their democratic special pride micro-bikini underwear that the West had introduced around the world starting with Yugoslavia (Kosovo), Iraq, Libya, Vietnam, Korea, and Afghanistan many years ago. Thank God for genuine Western values of equality and authentic American (world's-best) democracy that promotes homosexual love with military planes and tanks in Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, and now in Ukraine. Now the same Western-style democracy and love will be spread in the country of Ukraine with very similar Russian military planes and tanks. Thank God for American democracy in Yugoslavia (Kosovo) that was introduced by dropping bombs from American military planes in 1998 A.D. That was so beautiful and peaceful to watch those people who were killed by the American bombs dropped in Yugoslavia because it was American democracy with American love and American family values that can never be wrong in Heaven or on Earth. Americans can easily bomb Heaven and even kill Jesus again, and He (Jesus) will be deemed wrong in the eyes of the U.S. Supreme Court and would have to apologize to America for forbidding homosexuality and other perversions in His silly Bible because America can never do wrong or be in the wrong. Jesus would have to fall at the feet of the Americans on CNN and pray to them (prostrate) asking for their forgiveness because He was so terribly wrong about being too strict on the homosexuals and trans-gender sub-culture demon-possessed creatures who instead of getting therapy decided to follow demons of darkness and use bathrooms /lavatories /WCs of the opposite gender to gain their recognition in society. American beautiful military planes and tanks can bring democracy to heaven and kill all angels with peaceful bombs and just nuclear weapons that Saddam Husein had in such great abundance that he had to be peacefully removed from power by the American love forces in 2003 A.D. in the American Invasion of Iraq, which is being repeated in 2022 by Russia in the country of Ukraine. President Zelensky will be hanged the same way that Saddam Husein was hanged (very beautifully and gently). Thank God that there is a country like America that is so just and so democratic that it simply hurts all over. America is so good and so beautiful that it truly deserves to be praised above all nations. Thank God for America that will never fall because it has trans-gender bathrooms /lavatories /WCs all across the country that allows anyone to do anything they want regardless of the demonic spirit that they are possessed by. It is so beautiful to live in America because any homosexual could spit in the face of God and kill Jesus over again and be protected by the kind justice system and kind police that loves Negroes who are allowed to breathe right before they are detained and handcuffed with soft handcuffs on the world's safest streets of America. America loves Black Lives Matter members who received $43,000,000 (USD) in cash every month from private donors who want to de-stabilize the political situation in Godly America. America loves its 2,300,000 prisoners so much that it offers them super-comfy, luxury-like accommodations at 12,000 prisons across the 50 U.S. sates. Thank God for America, the most humble of all nations on the face of the Earth. Today American democracy is being introduced by Russian military planes and tanks in Ukraine. It is such a peaceful exchange of democracy by American and Russian military planes and tanks that one begins to wonder why not do it every year. It is such a beautiful process to watch as if a movie script was written (or followed) by the same person on both sides. This beautiful invasion of Ukraine will unite and save the homosexuals and trans-gender soldiers around the world. All homosexuals will be later moved to Chechnya and Azerbaijan where they will be treated with the utmost honor and respect. The world's entire homosexual and pedophile population will be allowed to go on weekly holidays free-of-charge to Chechnya to enjoy exclusive high-elevation spas and resorts to get some much-needed r&r (luxury vacations /holidays). Thank God for all homosexuals and pedophiles that could finally enjoy a new democracy in Ukraine made possible by the beautiful military planes and tanks of the Russian army, just like the American army had brought democracy and peace to Iraq and Libya years ago. What a beautiful democratic and Godly country America is where homosexuality and pedophilia are now 100% legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court. The angels of God are happy for America and its democratic lifestyle that they share with and export to the rest of the world with beautiful military planes and gentle tanks that kill beautiful people. Thank God for American democracy that now will be spread by Russian military planes and tanks in Ukraine. Very soon the Russian and Chinese tanks will bring this beautiful American democracy back to the streets of New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Washington, DC after a very peaceful Russian nuclear strike on 666 cities around the globe that will gently happen on a beautiful morning of the day reserved by God through the Angel of Death prepared for this very hour if the ant-like humans will not repent of their sins (that will likely not happen since the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was conducted by the same Angel of Death who rained down nuclear weapons from Heaven in 1800 B.C.)"
So we’re now teaching the Russian military how to properly fight a war 😅
Germany would probably have conquered Ukraine by now.
Practice makes perfect
"So, the obvious offensive tactic for Ukraine is to disrupt Russia's rail system. Bullets are useless if they are 100km from the gun that fires them."
10:01 The word for zone sounds exactly the same as the Spanish version. Zona (Spanish) and 3OHA (Russian)
"Lol it didnt. This is probably one of the most succesful invasions in the last 200 years.

Witjin an Hour, russia disabled ukraines air defence system, Within a WEEK time, Russia managed to completely surround Ukraine, and they will capture kiev within days if the west stops meddling. These are facts no one likes to hear."
Fantastic well prepared preso
"Do this video still relate to the current situation? Since around 3 days ago; russian army kinda “blitzkrieg”  several major cities in southern ukraine, and  managed to capture several of them. Its like the initial invasion army was a totally different army with the current army. Do anyone knows wether russia employ mercenaries/militia?"
"Russia can mount a two, three, four year or more Campaign involving the current conflict against Ukraine. How long can they really last against this invasion?"
US fought in Afghanistan for 2 decades before they lost the war
"It would be nice to have left Russia in the dark as to their own achilles heal, if in fact we don't support their efforts to kill, maim, and destroy.  peac;e"
Excellent and informative video. Sam sets the bar again
Why do you care about russia? They still bomb ukraine 🙃
This is the most well-documented war in the history of mankind. History class in thirty years will be so much more interesting
Brilliant video! Very informative and clear. Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
"Yo like sorry but this has gotta be dumb to say but those Russians didn’t try goggle maps, in case they didn’t think about it I hope no Russian soilder sees this"
They use GLONASS
With good planning and tactics the Russians can be beaten.  It is now upon the Ukrainians to help themselves and disrupt the Russian supply train
"Kinda goes back to the old rule that you should never invade Russia (particularly in the winter) but inversely Russia doesn’t have great success beyond its own borders.

Russia lost badly to Japan and only barely outlasted Napoleon and Hitler with allied help. They play a great defence but a poor offence."
Despots often over estimate their own forces and understimate their opposition. But Russian forces seem to be getting even the basics hopelessly wrong.
You're declaring war.
"@kick1ass20 I'm considering the fact that Putin said whoever describe the actions as war, invasion is declaring war with him/them."
"*Russia declared war when poo-tin invaded another country. After Poo-Tin and Winnie the Poo made love, they agreed upon this following the Olympics. Winnie has no respect for disabled athletes, so did not care this would overlap with the Paralympics. They both bring shame to their nations."
"I believe this is essentially classic Soviet doctrine. Divisions are essentially seen as disposable with about a 3 day life - roughly how much supplies the division carries.
Divisions are then more or less abandonded and replaced on successful axis (only success is re-inforced/resupplied)
After some time the less successful divisions are rounded up and re-supplied,  and then re-cycled, but the idea is not to keep divisions continually supplied but to replace them with fresh divisions.
The troops in the less successful divisions look after themselves until they are rounded up and re-constitued - that's not such a bad thing if you want to terrify local populations - the unsupplied troops will be out their pillaging etc if they want to survive, which must be terrifying if you live in the region where an unsupplied division is waiting to be collected."
I think russia resolved logistics issue by having a 60 km long chained offensive moving together towards kyiv...
"@Harvey Wilde Middle east exactly.. same worked for Libya and iraq.. as far regime change goes.. the only failure was in Syria as Russia jumped in to save the regime.. I dont see Nato jumping in anytime soon to save the regime.. and one more advantage russia has is its right next door... not oceans apart.. its a do or die for russia.  In my humblest opinion, I give Ukraine regime 2 more weeks before it falls"
@Jawad Syed Nahh.... that won't work. Ahemmm....... The Middle East
LOL commies
You reminded me of Uncle Sheldon.
number 15 burgerking foot lettuce
A buildup so massive even Biden couldn’t remember it.
Is this war advice for Russia?
more informative then the news explanations
"Excellent summary! “Amateurs think tactics, professionals think logistics.” Thank-you for pulling together all these bits of information."
@D D Thanks bro! You can head back to playing fortnite now.
"You need both, its a stupid saying repeated by internet armchair generals that never held a rifle. For example the biggest change during ww1 was the revolution in infantry organization,  and early stage of combined arms tactics, you can have all the logistics in the world, but if your front line units get chewed up and get stuck you wont go anywhere, and worse it will eat up logistics for no results."
truly ukraine has been the aggressor in all of this they have provoked russia to war by trying to join nato
Thats all people want
"wars, this does not happen."
"Is it true the US has Bio-labs in Ukraine ???
I wonder why.
I wouldn't want that on MY border !!!
Research for YOURSELF the history of Ukraine."
Russia troops should avail Nord VPN to protect their analog signals from hackers
Hahahaha..... Yes.
I didnt knew the war begin on my main discord account first anniversary
Sound like the Russians could do with some lend lease trucks. Seemed to make the difference last time!
"LAMO.... Yes.

They should ask the US for that...... Ooo... wait."
Really nice video!!
"You are wrong , wait and see"
Slava Ukraine! Orcs army go home!
Thank you for this piece of hope.
"I know what that forty mile convoy needs.

A couple of A-10's.  BRRT!!"
"Yup, literally fish in a vodka bottle."
"Well put together, balanced, factural and informative.  Thank you for the considerable effort involved."
Your mom failed
I love how the 2022 internet and social media is basically crowd-sourcing the realtime diagnosis of battlefield tactics and logistics/operations strategies. I'm not seeing a lot of that biased in favor of the Russians -- because of their increasingly backward regime and national culture. Makes me feel bad for the intelligent and compassionate people that live throughout the country.
If you spoke Russian you would see the other side of it more easily.
"It's very strategic yet ironic that Ukraine is putting up a greater fight than expected by their pure willingness to destroy their own infrastructure (and thus the invaders). In most wars, this does not happen."
Hello
"u forgot meeetings offered by Russia before invading.... he flexed, us and nsto and ukraine leader blew him off.... also first few days wws not real solders... but inmates...... lots of them...."
"NATO has made :
14,500 dead in Libya
165,000 dead in Afghanistan
224,000 dead in Syria
1,200,000 dead in Iraq
It didn't shock anyone.
None of these countries has been sanctioned.
Russia starts a war in Ukraine and leaves barely 200 mostly military dead that everyone is shocked.
Does NATO has a moral grounds to rebuke Russia?"
"Afghanistan was the only case whit NATO support, Iraq was the US while Russia is also in Libya and Syria but have nether NATO involved nor are they even offensive wars but 3. party´s getting involved in Civil wars. This is just factually wrong while it also ignores the most important part of interventions which is that they to be legitimated need an UN mandate that mean almost the entire world gives there green light which are the basis for almost any military action from the west."
"As mentioned Rail has always played a priciple role in modern warfare. Infact it played into significance as far back as the 1860's during the American Civil war. Their are dozens of newsreels showing the advancement of German troops into the East via rail also.
But the news which has just entered into the media space is that cheap Chinese tyres are the priciple reason why the Russian ground forces are bogged down.  Apparently the sides of the tyres of vehicles that have been stationary through out long periods begin to thin causing the walls to weaken and burst. Especially in the wet northern regions of the Ukraine - hence the stalled Russian military convoys circling Kiev, were as the Ukrainian Southern  topology is more arid and desert like having a lesser affect on the tyres, the Russian military is able to make greater advances."
SO RUSSIA IS RETARDED AT WAR LOL
They still play it like it is WW2... meanwhile the rest of the world developed and is stronger.
"Russians are one of the worst armies, without those nukes, russia would be nothing on world stage...."
It took the US 6 weeks to reach Baghdad after a month of bombing it back to the Stone Age. More propaganda videos.
Why did everybody started to pronounce it Kyiv? It's Kiev in english!
"@Holsp because people want to recognise the Ukrainian version rather than Russian version. The name of the city was changed from Киев (Russian)  to Київ (Ukrainian) so the English translation is changed, but Russia still calls it Киев"
"@Tom’s Travels I know, that's what I said. I know it's Kyiv in the original translation but English people use it instead of Kiev and it sounds weird. That's like people Saying Praha instead of Prague for the capital of the Czech Republic"
Kiev is the English version of the Russian name. Kyiv is the translation from the Ukrainian name. Search KyivNotKiev
YEAH . BUT DIDN'T THE RUSSIANS KNOW THAT ALREADY ?!
"It's kind of amazing how Twitter became the place for attack coordination and intel sharing. This is next level warfare, open source warfare"
"Not failed. They could have bombed it to nothing by now. They are not the US and NATO. 
The capital is surrounded. No supplies getting in. Checkmate."
"Lol, Hostomel is fully under russian control and there were already numerous news reports from there."
"Yeah, ukraine claimed like 2 times a day that they destroyed the same unit."
fuck yt censoring freedom
sadly the info war is bigger and youtube is at the top of it.
Doesn’t seem to be failing right now… They’ve nearly taken all of Ukraine. This Video will age very badly.
Your DELUSIONESS socked badly.
"The invasion is doing good for Russia in the short term, but not good for the long term"
@kick1ass20 you mean long term?
I don't think it's doing good for them in the short term either. I wonder how long until they kick Putin out for being such a failure.
"If I learnt anything from C&C Red Alert, it’s that the Americans should just drop Tanya into Russia to blow up all their barracks; then they won’t be able to produce any more troops."
"Somber, and very informative and data-driven, like all of your videos. Thank you for making this."
"If Putin had to take over Ukraine,He wouldn't have cared about people massacre like Germans did to Jews and Taliban to Afgan people."
"more like, ever since the Ukrainians discovered oil off the coast of Ukraine in 2014.  Russia just won't allow a second petro state in Europe."
Russia is weak af.  Threatening nukes... call his bluff.
"I suspect once the Russians have fully encircled the larger Ukrainian cities, a ""Berlin Airlift"" style of resupply will need to be done, with a host of heavy air transports escorted by squadrons of fighter planes. Before each mission, the Russians will be informed of what is happening. And if the Russians choose to attack them, they will be greatly enlarging the conflict..."
Great video
"My company has offered a $10,000.000 bounty on Putin’s head, dead or alive."
"@Harvey Wilde The period was a typo.  Anyway you look at it, it couldn’t be misconstrued as $10,000.  So get some meds for that OCD."
"@Ozzy Moto Looked at what you've typed. You use a coma and a period at the same time. On some countries it would mean $10,000 but other it would be just $10"
"@Harvey Wilde you don’t add change on numbers that large, Harvey."
"Only 10,000? Eshh...... learn to type currency."
Very well analized  information.
The best report I have heard.
So US IS BETTER
Yes Among US is better.
How about the USA funding 80 billions of weaponnery to the new terrorist state of Afghanistan. How'bout that !!
Americans ikr
Hypocrisy
So many Russian bots in the comment section.
"Man, Ukranians are on it! Buncha badasses! The WORLD is scared of Russia... Ukrainians are grabbing rags and liquor bottles like ""time to fuck shit up"". Legends."
This video is based on NATO propaganda.
Rumor has it Russia has the military might to kill women and children with minimal losses of soldiers.
A lot of military experts on here who have never served ffs. No one knows why that large column stopped. The Russians will have their own agenda. One thing is sure Nato needs to keep the fuck out and the worst is the UK keep poking the bear and your next.
one of the biggest oil suppliers can not get fuel to their tanks......the irony
"It's funny how the west's media know more of what's happening than the Russian's themselves... Do you guys have journalists embedded with the Russian military? No you don't . In other words I call bullshit on all of the media in regards to the Russian Forces, it's been nothing but one sided reporting from day 1. People are not stupid, you'll find that out when we take back our countries from the corrupt governments and media which blindly follow the narrative which their employer demands they report."
nice propaganda on this vid
@kick1ass20 Yes Hello russian cyclops.
hello russian troll :)
Russia is losing...yeah! 🤗
"This is a mythology being created by the West.  Russia didn't do what we tell you they wanted to do so it means they have failed.  Yet the Ukrainian forces in the east are surrounded and are now faced with destruction or surrender.  But yeah, I guess those logistics really caused Russia to fail."
"And yet Russia conquered Ukraine
And NATO is making tiktok video😂"
@KieferKarpfen68 the followers of church or Jesus Christ ( orthodox/catholic etc.)
@NISHUGARVU Whats christianism?
@NISHUGARVU But they want to denazify ukraine? Therefore you need the capital.
"@KieferKarpfen68 in geopolitics you don’t have to capture capital city to win the war.
You don’t need to capture DC to win US you just need Texas & California and usa will be ready for negotiation 
Hope you understand geopolitical view"
One man and his enablers causing such heartache!
"Putler needs to be taken out, For Russia sake as well."
"Who's Putler??

Did you just combine Putin and Hitler.




LAMO............. Putin X Hitler."
"Crazy how resourceful, packed & organized your content are. This is very good intel"
Propaganda. After 8min you repeat Ukrainian propaganda. Visegrad Twitter account is propaganda. You are discredited
Iiii
"What I understand is that one of the issues the Russian Army is facing is a shortage of trucks.
This has happened before in the past, and the US and UK have helped  to solve the shortage, by providing a large number of trucks via Arctic Convoy. 
I suspect it would be inappropriate for them to repeat this."
Bro it was a distraction while they sweep up rest of Ukraine
So Russia is that stupid or is it...?
Such propaganda
Such delusional.
"Great video as always, but I wish you were not using so much of the russian military propaganda footage for this video. :)"
"I don’t understand why Russia won’t encircle Kyiv, like they’re just killing themselves by going straight into Kyiv. Even Hoi4 players know that going straight in is a bad idea."
Go on then be their General.
stories emerged... Its all just rumours and fake news. You have absolutely no idea what is going on. This is just propaganda.
"..not yet, later on  thanks buddy."
What?
Just arrange boer like sniper groups and take out all the truck drivers as they approach.
If it is so failed then why is zelensky so adamant that he get weapons and planes to help fight Russia...also why would the usa be so feverishly preparing contingency plans for when not it it falls
"Stop your utter nonsense, just stick to airplanes. Russia hasn’t failed at anything."
Hello troll
"Full blown disinformation! The Russians simply wait and spate civilians! Something your government never did In Afghanistan, Syria or elsewhere ..."
"Bombing residential buildings and schools is sparing civilians? Pretty convoluted, even for a russian troll..."
Finally sourced information on this mess of a war. Thanks so much.
"Thank you spineless coward US establishment politicians. 2008, 2014, 2022. Bush Obama Biden. Utter garbage foreign policy"
@Harvey Wilde L
@Bob Sagit Meh... Too Long: Didn't read
You forgot one more guy.
Europe and US must enforce no flight zone in Ukrain. We can't fight Putin with lives of Ukrainian civilians
"Nato is just using Ukraine as a Afghanistan repeat on Russia in the 1980’s.
Doesn’t matter what happens to Ukraine as long as Russia is so weakened ( like the USA after many wars) that it may collapse from inside like 1991 and in any case, a much weaker threat to nato. 
Russia is a nuclear power and that’s why nato will not engage Russia directly but using pawns like Ukraine."
Yes and it will work again
how many tanks do Ukraine citizens have. Didn't they announce the other day that there will be no taxes for tanks that the Ukraine citizens can take and keep them. Now there's blasts when a cease fire was supposed to happen. From what. where. Which tank? whose controlling that tank?
IT FAILED DUE TO CORRUPTION AND THE FACT UKRAINE IS A MASSIVE CORRUPT TOTALITARIAN SHITHOLE THAT WAS LITERALLY RULED BY FAR RIGHT MILITIAS THAT ATTACKED RUSSIANS IN DONBAS AND HARASSED RUSSIAN PEOPLE IN UKRAIN FOR FUCKING 8 YEARS .. ALSO LET'S NOT FORGET THE FAKE CIA COUP AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT ... IT'S ALL THEATER ...
TLDR: Russia is very good at defense but very bad at offense.
"Yup, the nature of once invaded country."
"kidnotkin sent me here"
Who's that?
Putin is not an autocrat but a elected president
"Poo-Tin is an autocratic dictator. Did you not know this, friendo?"
No he is an autocrat
I feel like this is horrible. People need to understand this is out of control. Just be happy with what you have. You don’t need other countries! So sad that children and woman are dieing because of this war!!! This is gross. I’m from canada 🇨🇦 and seeing all of this is honestly disgusting you guys need to get you’re stuff together and focus on you’re own countries!!! Not someone else’s Country or team up with other countries to kill people like how Gross of a person are you to want to kill women and children what if that was your own family just so disgusting 🤮
May the failure continue 👍
"How does any of this make sense without reference to the operations of the Ukrainian Azov regiment and the UN reported 15,000 ethnic Russian deaths in the Donbas since 2015."
because that has nothing to do with the logistics of the russian army?
Since when did it stop being 'kiev'?
@herIes So do I have to call them chicken kyivs now?
"kiev is the Russianized name commonly used in English, kyiv is more akin to the Ukrainian pronunciation, it's a subtle protest.

i read it in an italian news outlet but i'm sure there are others in english should you seek a better explanation"
If only the Ukrainian leadership had chosen not to express their wish to join NATO.
@Anwit Mondal you blame Nato for an brutal war of Aggression from Russia? are u on drugs? This war is ONLY Putins fault. Ukraine is an Independent Country which can decide with whom they want to work with and with whom not. You blame Innocent people for there on suffering because Putin dreams of an Imperialist Russia. Your behavior is disgusting.
"@dark nerox it had everything to do with NATO, but of course continue believing that western countries can do no wrong."
Russia would have still invaded Ukraine. To think that this attack had anything to do with Nato is ridiculous.
"""Looting"" is a civilian activity. Armies or military units engage in ""Plundering"". Plundering is addressed in most international treaties and articles of war for the last half of a millennia."
@Joe Scharkenberg - stealing food is not a war crime. Raping and robbing is. There's a difference.
"@Doigt Understanding the ""pillaging is prohibited"" clause requires being aware of the law before. Until after the Napoleonic Wars, one right of the victor in storming a city after a siege was for the victorious soldiers to grab anything they wanted from the civilian population and rape the locals. Both the French and the British did that to the city of Bajoz, Spain.

It was considered a distasteful way of paying the troops in the face of unreliable finances. The practice declined with time and the Hague Convention sought to codify existing changes to customs. Seizing food for government needs was considered not covered since there was the huge private/public distinction.

That provision has been violated occasionally such as in a civil conflict in Yemen with soldiers being allowed to claim loot from an enemy village as their back pay. That is considered quite different from soldiers seizing resources to continue their missions (although most major militaries have regulations against it to avoid angering local civilians)."
"@Lawofimprobability 

Thanks for being the only person in this thread who knows what they're talking about.   All these fake lawyers and YouTube knuckleheads are hilarious"
"Commandeering civilian supplies can take place if it is to serve a government purpose. Looting is for non-military goals (such as seizing artworks to go to a private individual) while plunder is seizing private property for profit (such as seizing factory machinery to ship back home).

Troops isolated from supplies can seize food insofar as it fulfills a military purpose AND does not jeopardize the civilian population. Commandeering for government purposes is allowed but has to be weighed against civilian needs."
"@Doigt 

That's a stretch, buddy"
Russia need a rocket that could send logistics
Too early.
And people have thought the Russian Military was meaningfully comparable to the US....
"Russia has the largest ground army. But USA has the best airforce and navy. And tbh Air is more important than the ground. But if they were to fight in land without too much diffirence in air superiority, Russia probably will win. Russia has the by far the largest arsenal in artilery,BUK, tanks. USA's Abram II is pretty outdated compared to t-14's of Russia"
"You guys outdid yourself, which is not easy to do. Amazing documentary, so early in this invasion, speaks wonder of my favorite youtube channel. BRAVO!"
Sorry man. How did anything happen suddenly? They were parked there for MONTHS before they invaded the country. So Putin bans the word war and then uses it on telly in front of everyone? Maybe the FSB should drag HIM off and throw him in jail lol.
This war Russia  started  will only manifest their present military capacity to the western alliance and China  who is now observing.
Thank you for making this video 👍
"As someone pointed out when the USA went into Iraq they took 2 weeks to get to Baghdad, this one has only been going a week and Kiev has not been taken. It is not a video game as people are actually being killed on both sides."
Is this propaganda?
"Nope, it's analysis."
"Well Russia has basically isolated itself for the next 60 years, Ukranians will never forget and forgive this, the west wont trust russia and russians will never understand why."
America said “hold my beer” 🍺
Good video
"Excellent video.

Unfortunately, the last 2 days the invasion gained momentum :("
For the Ukrainian that is.
"(I haven’t watched the video yet) Russia’s logistics have not failed, they are only meeting their max limits. Ukraine is an extremely large country and moving hundreds of armor units take insane amounts of petrol and time. Their military has expectations in how far and how continually their units will move, and they are maxed out."
"Germany, one of the most influential countries in Europe, is doing nothing and threatening to escalate. Escalation is caused by inaction!!"
Too quick to decide. I don't see them failing. Kharkiev is literally at Russian mercy
With this stalling process the world is stocking up with much needed supplies in Ukraine but I don’t believe Ukraine will be using most of these supplies my gut is trap since there president is urging the US to escalate things as an American Putin uses actors regularly while the world is opening there hearts we stock pile are supplies in a none in country trap watch China don’t trust bad intel
I would like to see how poland defend get stricter and NATO suddenly get bussier around neighboring country too... please make this in another video
"In Soviet Russia, logistics lead you"
"In simple terms

Western Doctrine: What do you need?

Russia's Doctrine: Take what we have!"
"Russian armies became a clown because of a clown leader.

if this invasion would fail, which it seems it will, the world would not take Russia seriously as it did before"
"How can one maniac decide everyone's future, he has no remorse or guilt for several innocent being harmed for no reason.. I hope sense prevails and some of the worse yet to come is averted."
Ukraine is also bloody massive. This isn't over

Let's hope for peace in the world! There are only losers in war.
Salute to the brave people of Ukraine
Clown channel with clown propaganda
"@Harvey Wilde wendover is , you are right :D"
And thats if nobodys shooting the crapp out of you
Russian never looses war like nato
What about Afghanistan?
"Putin and Russia's troops thought that the Ukrainians would welcome them as liberators so i think they prepared for a short war.

Sooner or later the Russians is going to adjust and correct their mistakes"
"Putin's Russia invasion of Ukraine was the biggest blunder of the 21st century resulting in ultimate defeat for BOTH Russia and Ukraine. Instead of two nations working together for common prosperity and continual growth, Russia chose to sacrifice it's growing economy, people and prestige, the latter of which cannot be replaced. And for what? Ukraine is broken, while Russia emerged weak and entirely dependent upon China just like North Korea. Ironically, in trying to make Ukraine a vassal state, Russia ended up becoming a vassal state of China. If the fall of Soviet Union was the great tragedy of the 20th Century, the fall of Russian civilization was perhaps the greatest tragedy of ALL centuries. Perhaps, Russia was never meant to be, it's potential destiny long extinguished ever since Mongols subjugated Rus for 200 years. We shall never know."
Because it was supposed to look like it did
"Your anlaysis is not accurate. Why? Because you're applying Western standards and military standards that are very different from the ones Russia is using. 

They do not behave like US and NATO military, ""shock and awe"" destroying BOTH military and civilian infrastructure simultaneously, mass destruction ands casualties. Instead they targeted military, leaving nearly all civilian infra in place. People still have power, water, sewage, cellular and even Internet to talk to Western media. All easily destroyed IF THEY wanted to.  Cites are maintaining their gov functions, and still raise the UKR flag. 

They follow classic Russian military strategy of creating ""encircled cauldrons"" of military hostility's. 

Their model follows along the lines of Aleppo. US, NATO - war then negotiations. Russia - War and negotiations conducted simultaneously. They war - then cease fire & negotiate - back to war - cease fire to negotiate, on an on to settlement. Meaning troops go in fight, stop, drop back and wait for next fight. It was successful in Aleppo, siphoning off significant numbers of fighters and leaving behind the diehard, die for your country. Same model is being used in UKR with the “humanitarian corridors” (established Geneva Convention and later the UN) to funnel out civilians. Russia extends this model to include soldiers fighting in battles and provides them several options to demilitarize from going home, being located to a ""geographic safe harbor"" (in Western UKR), or fighting and dying.

Example from Hindustan Times, 3/6/2022: ""Russia is putting in place “humanitarian corridors” for safe evacuation of Indians stranded in conflict zones in eastern Ukraine""."
They can't afford shock and awe tactics.
This makes Afghanistan sound more badass.
Putin wants to kill president  Zelenskyy is because he knows without president  Zelenskyy he can take Ukraine after he is no longer in office power no vary can claim his place legally in the international courts with a process of elections or is more difficult for the vice-president or other members of the exiting government he is going to kill the much government members he can. please take out president Zelenskyy to protect him and Ukraine because in case Putin take place and install a new government it is an illegal  government and he can claim his presidency for years and he is going to find help for sure
"Got to say, great video....really nice work. Keep it up, stay safe and good luck 💯🙏"
I just don't feel that we should be educating the Russians so they can improve their military. that's pretty much what this video is doing 🤷
Pretty ironic using Molotovs on Russians.
"Wow, this is a real tour-de-force!"
"And another thing ...
If we are aware that the Russians are incapable of supporting logistics why don't we CRUSH those ""effers""!"
U.S.A. and European Union have racism. They used the Ukraine to distroy Russia even though Ukraine will be distroied.
@Coach McGuirk at least the economy of Russia
The ukrainan people must die now for Selenski?
Putin is new Hitler and Russia is new North-Korea.
"Obviously the U.S. was able to read the handwriting on the wall.
But why no diplomacy to avoid the war that would ruin every western advance of relations into the Ukrainian sector? 
The military build up was ""OVER THE TOP""
 So why not begin negotiations with Russia that would be more inclusive as a pacification measure?
It was obvious for years there would be no wesrmtern alliance to match this build up.
Now we have the worse of the worst! A country not only assimilated,not only fallen; but a country destroyed! 
Are our strategists so incompetent that that my could not see this coming?"
I’m sure I’m not alone but I still can’t believe that this whole thing is happening. It’s wonderful to see the world unite and we can only hope that the unity against tyranny deters future despots from doing the same.
Let's go Biden
Ukrainians for peace!
"When you realise, Russian logistic strategies are still in 1940's even though they have modern army"
All based on the crap in putins head
Just another western propaganda videos in the name of logistics
Very Nice!
whatta video! covering one of the most crucial events of recent times so well and almost live is amazng! great job and keep up the hard work!
Great Video
"Lol, As I always say, just because you outnumber someone that doesn’t mean your gonna win anything…."
Would you explain how they succeed  in Syria
This is such a well written piece.
Really need sources on this one. Not saying you’re wrong. Just needs sources so we know where you got your information from
you and cappy from task n purpose channel provide a very nice analysis on this war.
Outstanding!!!!!!
"Maybe it’s working to well, I’m thinking trap Biden needs not to trust VZ something is wrong with the intel"
I wonder how many Toyota Corollas this war is going to cost.
"The war against Ukraine is completely unjustified and will ruin Putin's legacy and set back the Russian economy decades which only harms the average peace loving Russian citizen. That said, the one positive this whole situation has shown is that the Russian military is no where near the fearsome  reputation its had for decades and would have zero chance against NATO. Even with the nuclear threat they have this current operation shows activating a full scale nuclear response would likely fail on many levels leaving asymmetrical damage versus NATO countries. Don't get me wrong, it would not be good and millions would die, but I could see NATO wiping out Russia while their response misses several key western cities due to incompetence, com problems, or the weapons just failing due to lack of upkeep.  I am now more certain than ever all Russias hypersonic tech and wonder weapons are all vaporware or they just have 2 or 3 beta models in warehouse somewhere specifically for propaganda videos."
"That all sounds pretty bad. Definitely isn't good. Yeah, it's probably bad."
"Russians are powerful, yes
their soldiers are strong, yes
but their fucking tactics are dogshit."
great video!
All main military units and resources are reported to still be in and around Moscow. They sent the second tier soldiers and equipment to Ukraine
"So in other words putin has too small of a Johnson, so he uses big bombs to hide that fact. sounds pretty cowardly and weak minded way for putin accomplish his ambitions !"
"Think of all the morons that refused to believe that Russia was about to attack, despite all the signs."
How can you say it failed when they are still in Ukraine they are still pushing forward lol
"Because it's not sustainable for the Russians. Also don't forget that even though Russia is vastly more powerful than Ukraine in terms of military, they are struggling to quickly take over many regions of Ukraine."
thus video is the most wendover thing ever
Meanwhile Russian troops watch this video.
Russian Logistics did not fail? how can something fail when it does not exist.
Don't let Putin watch this lol. He might learn a thing or two from it :))
"It did not happen so quickly! It started in 2014 when the Ukrainian people voted out the the Russian sympathising party and voted in a Ukrainian independence party. A civil war broke out, as usually happens when former USSR countries split i.e. Yugoslavia, and as a result of the civil war 14,000 people died. So this problem has been festering for a long time under the nose of NATO, the UN, Western journalists, Intelligence agencies, governments etc. You may very well ask yourself why was we not aware of this issue and why did we only become aware when to coin a phrase ""Putin went full Tonto!"" Maybe the west hoped that Putin would do this and hope he gets a good arse slapping, I don't think the Brits ever forgave Russia for the Salisbury poisoning episode so they will be leading the way and would be willing to give his arse the first slap!"
Make hour long video on ukraine russia war
"It really isn't ""keev"""
I think Putin believes that these logistical disadvantages were passed on to the Ukrainians by the CIA.
Putin needs to get those Tiberum Harvesters rolling quickly with at LEAST one Tanya as protection for each. Otherwise he'll never the Tesla Coil working as base support.
"Autocratic nations are more likely to start wars,
But democratic nations are more likely to see them through.  

It’s easier to persuade a million people to chip in a hundred dollars than it is to persuade a dozen oligarchs to chip in $250,000 each.  

The longer the war goes on the worse it’ll get for Russia to continue it."
"So if their train tracks are bombed, they could easily be screwed
Just a few bombs"
"Sadly the real question is probably not if Russia can successfully invade Ukraine, but what Putin is willing to do. Don't forget he can just nuke em"
So why Kiev wasn't nuked as opening move?
Your videos are amazing. I can’t believe how much thought u put into this
😂😂 love your fake propaganda❤️
Yes yea Russia bad
The Russians would be having even more trouble if we in the USA would start pumping our own oil again and stop buying it from the Russians.  We are funding this Russian war and our president isn't sensible enough to cut off Russian oil.
It would be better if they showed how the Ukrainian army shoots at civilians whom the Russian military is trying to evacuate.
"Key moment of war was Zelensky refusing US offer to escape. That has changed everything.
Had he left, it was possible that defenders would have evaluated puppet government offer of Russia.
Now it is unwinnable war. Even if now Russia occupies eastern ukraine and Zelensky gets captured or killed the war won't stop. Anyone who replaces Zelensky has no standing to stop the war in Ukraine. 

I fear Ukraine going Germany way."
"You would think that, with these factors literally defeating the Nazi's, Russia would know better."
"Great video, but I think you missed an important component.  The fact that the Russian soldiers were asking for directions shows that they did not have situational awareness.  There are rumours that they were told they are liberators, so this this completely undermines their approach.  If they really thought they were going to get directions from local Ukrainians, they certainly are not applying an appropriate level of self defence."
"@Clemens Stubbe Actually, some people really liked us there.  As a whole, we were not the good guys (It was a waste of time, lives, and money) but there were countless people who thanked me for being there.  Some people would invite us over to eat to their homes to show gratitude.  Saving the lives of others just for doing your job, that is a feeling you will never know."
"@Tomardes tell me how it isn't incompetent to have accidental strikes in civilian areas when putin himself said he would only use precision artillery on military targets. Explain to me how repeatedly missing your targets and causing large civilian casualties isn't incompetence when you're engaging in - with putins own words - a special operation. Please do.

Additionally, tell me why NATO shouldn't involve themselves in a conflict where russia not only threatens civilians due to their own incompetence, but Sweden, Norway, Finland among others for excersising their own right to choose alliance. Please explain to me why nato should not involve themselves in a conflict that putin started by placing large swaths of troops close to the Ukrainian border, months in advance although he himself said it was a training excersise. Which it obviously was not.

Explain to me why someone that just lied about ""a military operation"" with a large army close to NATO territory, with live threats to allies, should not involve themselves?

Especially considering that putin does not have a singular shred of superiority over Ukraine? In any way shape or form.

Why should the rest of the world allow putin to waste away in his own vomit, on top of a democratic state which he has no reason to interfere with?

And yes. The plummeting ruble and closed markets certainly paint a great picture of competent preparation."
"@Freeze which convoy?
Russia don't need to occupy every single city or village. Some (Like Kherson or Konotop) are left to Ukrainian local authorities with cease-fire agreements, some (like Chernigov) simply blockaded. 
There are no aerial strikes in civilian areas (planned. Only accidental)
Abandoned military equipment in assault isn't something horrible. Russian forces advancing and you don't want to lose your pace. So broken machines are simply being abandoned (and BTW there are enough VSU equipment captured).
Putin doesn't fail to deal with sanctions. Since 2014 government were preparing for this sanctions (in 2014 there were almost a collapse after some Swift disconnections), so now Russia has its own analogue of Swift, Visa/Mastercard. Large part of financial reserves were relocated to Russia and some IT-companies ""landed"" back. Sanctions are hitting hard, but they weren't ""unexpected""
Straight up lie. There aren't any ""hired nazis"". Same goes with ""high-ranking generals"". There is one verified loss of VDV General.
Thermobaric  weapons (you refer to TOS-1) is only a sign of preparation for urban warfare and ""debunking"". ""Frantic bombardment "" - sorry, you talking about American tactics. Not Russian. 
""Nuclear threatning"" is only a sign for NATO to not involve in this conflict. 
Oh, I guess you found out about geopolitics. You know, when big countries choose what minkr countries near its borders can or can't do. Something about national security. Something that USA have been doing for several decades."
"@Clemens Stubbe I think he means that the US government was deluded and truly believed that they were the good guys (because ""Merica!""), while the Russia government knew they weren't, but lied to them. I don't know, I could be wrong with my conclusion, though."
@Juan Restrepo He said that he THOUGHT (past tense) they wanted their help. I doubt that he still believes that now.

Great video Sam. Puck Futin.
Blonde haired blue eyed people are like pick up the bags and run to Europe atleast this way we can join European union 😁😁
"I fundamentally disagree with calling russian soldiers 'innocent'. I understand fully that they don't have a choice in invading, but they are still invaders. They are literally the ones looting( and probably worse) and bombing civilians. They are NOT innocent, not at all."
What about Palestine let's make a video about them.
But our rifles couldn't stop a modern army the leftist gun controllers say.
"How can you, a YouTube who got most of your information from TikTok, accurately make military analysis?!?! I would say their invasion has been successful, especially when they have not provoked any response from the west... the most the west has done is give lip service & send tents and sleeping bags. This is how Nazi Germany started, while the cuckold west just sits around talking about what to do."
Thank the Independent Analysts for masking the real horror Putin will have in taking Ukraine.
Russia is new UK( no more superpower)
"Thank you, Wendover. This is important and informative; I am glad you are working hard, producing deep insight on current events, and keeping dropping necessary numbers. Keep on trucking on and SLAVA UKRAINI!"
im SURE this is unbiased
"I am pretty sure this is all nonsense…

I am not pro-Russian, this is just my take from being a military history buff..


The Russians are slow playing it because there is no rush… no one else is coming to help Ukraine, and they are trying not to have to mass slaughter civilians…


Imagine if America invaded Mexico… the time it takes is based on how many civilian casualties we are willing to cause.. 

Imho the west wants this to be Russia’s Vietnam, so that is what western media is selling…

We are telling the world what we want Ukraine to be doing.."
Slawa Ukraina
"every-time this channel talks about logistics, it is massive and detail logistics story"
I think the sanctions will also heavily affect Russias logistic networks
"I doubt it, at least in the short term, they will make Russia unable to produce new high tech equipment and seriously limit its economy in the long term, but it's very unlikely there to be no strategic stockpiling going on and new equipment production is not something you should rely on in the opening days of a conflict"
Imagine if it was China in place of Russia...
Great job. This has got to be one of the greatest standoffs in history.
To Wrong side of HISTORY Russia IS !
better to go EV than feul
"Russian logistics failing after a few days of combat and mere miles from their borders is a testament to the professionalism and efficiency of western armies operating flawlessly all over the world.
Check out the serval operation of 2013 if you want an example on how to create and organize military logistic to support an improvised military operation that achieved its objectives. Numbers involved are way lower though."
"That is exactly what has happened in wars since millennia. Destroying roads, materiel and food supplies as you retreat from the enemy is quite common, from ancient Persian wars, to current times as well"

"@Phillip_IV_Planet King Nazis are an easy group to hate (for obvious, and yes for justifiable, reasons) so it's a popular thing to accuse your enemies of being.  Except in the case of Ukraine it's a downright silly accusation nobody outside of Russia and Belarus believes; you're talking about a country led by a president who's Jewish, and has relatives that died in the Holocaust.  Yeah, sure sounds like a Nazi to me (that's sarcasm in case anyone can't tell)."
@Alex Despite them terror bombing civilian areas?
"@Colm Reynolds Maybe if they were not being invaded they would not have to go to measures designed to impede the invaders, which tend to also impede civilians?"
"@mowglilp , a referendum where the occupying troops were allowed to vote, and no independent observers were allowed.
That tends to make me...  sceptical about the validity.

Hopefully the UN committee will fully investigate the events in Donbas and elsewhere, bringing to light all crimes committed by all involved."

Don't forget that russian soldiers were reportedly selling diesel for vodka while in Belarus.
"Several things could happen which make decision making difficult for them. There is a great possibilty russian soldiers can be trapped if they go too far in Ukraine. 

One thing is for sure if we dont stop free trade with china. They will come out the winner, they already came out an economic winner during covid, now with an impending war.

China might also start a new world economy were they handle the money transactions, EU and USA can be disregarded in terms of economic exchanges and trades.

"@Angad SinghHe's clearly not speaking sensibly. His god, Putin,  is being humiliated. He's traumatised"

@Angad Singh thats what their media tells you
Why? Americans have the best logistics in the world.
This is the best analysis I've seen so far.

"""A population they believed they were liberating."" Really? You're stupid if you think anyone with half a brain believes that."
"I don't see the big deal. It was unlikely Ukraine would have rolled over. Further they are reasonably well equipped and are receiving all kinds of weapons from ""everyone"". This will drag on a bit. 

It would be a shame if they fought for 20 years and had to leave with their tails between their legs."
We should air drop this all over Russia like south Koreans did with the movie The Interview in north Korea.
"imagine China, the king of logistics helped Russia with this war effort. it'll be hell"

Why is liberate always a euphemism for invade?
they send team B
"And remember, there are no such thing as sanctions. 

They actually are a ""special financial operation""."
this was an extremely biased presentation. no mention of russian military doctrine. u want the russain army to operate was u expect
"Thank you for this video.  You are so right, it is Ukrainians and Russian grunts paying for the price of this."
It's kee-yev not keev
"Sorry. I've been arguing against socialists for years now about how the economic calculation problem is the biggest issue facing their idea of utopia. without a rational way to determine what needs to be produced (as defined by consumer preference, I guess) the end result can only be a system that wastes resources producing things that aren't needed, leading to a waste of resources.

This seems to be happening here with this ""you need bullets, not fuel"" mentality of the Russian invasion force. They are not allowed to ask for things as it is needed and the end result is that they have too many things they don't need and not enough things they do want. It would be hilarious and I would gloat about how I was right, if this weren't a war and people are dying."
US had invaded less equipped nations. Iraqi military fled even before an invasion could begin + they ordinary people were against Saddam. Afghanistan is where they didn’t have more than AK 47s. Vietnam war a poor country. Russia invaded an European country which were supplied ammunition from everywhere. Had that been the case with US military. They would’ve meet the same fate. Yes logistics matters in any war. You might forgot to mentioned. Russian military is strategically moving slowly. They wanted zelensky to be on table.
Outstanding job. As always. And thank you guys for that
Whoa
That 40 Km long Russian convoy is what scares me what's going to happen to Kiev once it finally decides to make a move on the city. There's going to be a lot of bloodshed unfortunately. Curious how much the Russians care about keeping that city intact or if they are just going to shell the hell out of it.
Putin should be in prison
9:09 they set themselves on fire and did NOTHING to the truck ..... so the actual video rather than posting more propaganda.
Could agree with the narrative but the scary part is once they get their shit together is time to watch out
"I feel compelled to remind people here that Russia's logistics ""failed"" in the same way that the US military's logistics ""failed"" during the Iraq Invasion, i.e. the military forces took so much territory so fast that supply lines couldn't keep up.  In the end, it took roughly a month of ""shock and awe"" for US forces to reach Baghdad, and GWB didn't declare ""victory"" a month after that. So all told, it took US forces two months to take over a country whose military didn't actually want to fight.

Anyone telling you Russia is going slowly or that their invasion has ""stalled"" is an agitprop peddler."
"@Angad Singh Tell me you didn't know that the US has massive military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait without telling me you didn't know that the US has massive military bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

EDIT: I'm actually underselling it here. The ""base"" in Kuwait was, prior to the invasion, the largest military installation in the world. It was a veritable city."
"Except the US was fighting a war halfway across the world, whereas Ukraine is literally just RIGHT THERE."
Your take is hilariously naive.
I don't believe this is fake news.  Great stuff.  Thanks.
I worked in Logistics during some Afghan deployments. It was a fight everyday to navigate the complex competing interests within British Logistics battle groups. Not as smooth as you think when commanders constantly concentrate on the intelligence picture. Took 10 years off my life.
@Maher onf Iran is much stronger than Iraq now but during that era the power gap wasn't really so different as seen in the stalemate and resolution 598 following the Iran-Iraq War.
@Ian Moran finest my a$$. Iraq was suffering from isolation and sanctions for 13 years. back then  3/4 of the people hated their leader. All Iraq neighbours hated Saddam . Please tell your american friends to try Iran instead .
meow meow meow meow
"@El Nasty also, wtf did you expect? ofcourse russia is the one in the offensive, but there are alot of ukrainian activity in those occupied areas ambushing the convoys, i recommended you to watch adam something, he laid out the plans of the russian military and their objectives, and then showed the problems and hurdles the russians need to overcome, and then the consequences on the world stage"
"@El Nasty um sorry but they encountered similar logistics issues in the war of afganistan, along with abunch of other data that was sourced before the conflict started, i could not say who would win, but i can say russia failed their intended invasion of blitzing though, also, have you watched the video? the basis wasnt only on footage of some russian soldiers plundering food and fuel, but also that russian logistics heavily relied on trains, and did not have sufficent trucks to supply their troops due to those convoys being ambushed, and not enough trucks. and since they cant rely on trains to get their supplies close to the frontline, along with the system inwhich certain armies get more supplies than others, their logistics failed. also they havent actually gotten supremacy over the air"
This is fantastic
"We could start calling the sanctions ""special economic operations."""
"Putin can't claim this all was just a response to provocations. They've been planning this for at least half a year, and they must have had plans since 2014 tbh."
Putin is a deranged dictator and Russians are too poor and demoralized to feel anything from sanctions. War is the only answer. Destroy Russia and China before they can harm humanity any further. Such depraved countries must be turned into biomass.
Very impressive video. I hope you’re right and Russia will fail in Ukraine.
"History repeats itself.  Invading Russia is nearly impossible, but they have always messed up in logistics."
"The huge land of Ukraine and those silent drones plays a big part in this. Hitting supplies are forever been in war tactics throughout human history. Thousands of tanks are nothing if they don't have fuel, same with food for soldiers to consume."

"Honestly, this video is probably premature. You could be right, but there's really no way to know because of how wild the disinfo campaign has been on both sides. If we even know half the truth in a year, I'd be surprised. Good effort, though. I think you did the best anyone could do given the circumstances."

nato aiso afraid russia
Only the nukes Russia's land forces could be defeated easily. Even little Ukraine is giving them hell.
Excellent analysis!
Thing is due to the Iraq war the whole world has woken up to superpower countries means to go to war...i hope the next war we make the world treats us the same...as it should be for any nation
I agree. Tbh i think the US is past the days of intervening directly in non-Allied countries' affairs. The public simply won't have it.
What's happening in 🇺🇦 is bad but why don't western media show the same level of reactions when it happens in Iraq syria libiya Egypt invaded by supreme nation
"The Russian Federation not Putin, give respect that's well deserved."
"Stay strong the whole world is with Ukraine.
Thank you Ukrainians for defending democracy and liberty values.
Let’s unite and voice our opinion.
It's our conscience and responsibility.
Let me quote one comment I read. 
“ This is insane, not just the danger, but how crippling this is to any country. How can this justify them liberating the country when they are turning the whole country into rubble.”"
And i thought putin was sensible.
"its all western propoganda , russia hasnot even used 20% of its airforce and no T90 its not a full on invasion they only want regime change"
"The people should put the bodies of the dead Russian soldiers impaled on pikes and  stand them up high along the roads for all approaching Russian troops to see. This is what Vlad the Impaler (Dracula) did in the 15th century to warn all who approach that this is their fate. It would strike fear in anyone who approached. It is barbaric but it worked then, it would work now. Killing morale is an effective tool. If one stops for directions, they simply become a decoration for another pike."
Russia isnt in Ukraine to liberate it is there to send a message to EU and NATO dont expand
Not sure why you Americans have so much hatred towards Russia. You drank their p*ss (oil) for years while getting fat. So you don't get to hate and reign ignorance of their culture now.
Just don't question paper masks and you should get past the censors.
"Once again the Russian Soldier fails his infallible Government,
by not being able to keep his equipment going on patriotism 
when ammo, fuel and food run out.

It's a problem as old as Russia itself ..."
"Seeing and hearing al that is crazy, so is that War already over ? ...because of failed logistics ?"
The difference in the logistics between the US and Russia makes a lot of sense. The US is used to fighting conflicts on the other sides of the world but Russia in the past has had to fight off invasions
"well, the last invasion into Russian (Soviet) territory happened 80yrs ago. since then it was the Soviets/Russians invading their neighbours"
"Olga of Kiev,a Viking a princess Kiev is the Capitol of Ukraine. A Saint in the Russian Greek Orthodox Bible & Catholic Bible was one of the most vicious, ruthless and vengeful rulers in the history of the Kievan Russ

Let pray that Russia does not resolve to Nuclear
Probably the best piece i've seen about the war
"It's ironic that before Operation Barbarossa in 1941, all of the German Generals supported the Soviet invasion.... except the logistic guys. 😁"
"America is about to sink Russia in Ukraine quagmire for long. 
We should expect immediate, & covert, deployment of thousands of private military contractors & hundreds of Turkish Bayraktar TB2 & Akıncı drones that Turkey has already privately sold to Ukraine but yet to fully deliver."
"So it's truly true Russia chest thumbs on it's nuclear weapons.  On a conventional war,  they're useless. To add that, poor reconnaissance systems"
Putin made a HUGE error in judgement. The only entrance/exit from the Black Sea is entirely inside of Turkish territory.  Since the invasion began Turkey has shut down and stopped the passage of Russian naval vessels from leaving or entering the Black Sea. This is HUGE because much of Russia's navy is based inside of the Black Sea and now they have no way in of out of it. Russian naval ships at sea cannot get back into their bases inside of the Black Sea as they run out of fuel and food. Never under estimate Turkey. They have one of the largest armies on the planet and their anti-aircraft missile took down a Soviet fighter jet during the Syrian war for getting too close to Turkey's border.  Turkey also produces attack drones that carry 6 missiles each.
Why west  and US needs military bases in every nook and corner of the world?
"Why do you pronounce Kyiv as ""queef"""
"It would seem to be a challenge to provide adequate logistical support in a Kleptocracy as endemically . . . Kleptocratic . . . as Russia.  EVERYBODY is ""On the Take"".  Anything that sits around for more than a few hours / days suddenly ""vanishes"".  ""It was like that when I got here, I have no idea"" all the way up & down the chain of command."
"A perfect summary of the faillure of Russia. 
Cripple the Bear &  his war machine stops."
Love the video
12:00 This is also what makes the US such a Superior force to anyone is If the war is at your front door we can bring it. The US Militaries Logistics are almost mystical and they get better every  year. It was a huge move toward becoming a super power when during and after the world War we realized you can fight a war let alone win it if you can get your military  there.
"16:54 is that a vacuum bomb used on Ukrainian soil? That's insane. I can't find this video or that username anywhere else on the internet, source link please???"

They would have won easily if this was Russia's war. But this is only Putin's war

"Logistic

Every army General's nightmare"
One would have to call the Russian strategy shock and awe except neither were achieved in the way they wanted
"Too one sided, speak of US, NATO and Ukraine's own agenda. A puppet govt"
The title of the video is literally about Russia's logistics. If you want to hear about those other stuff then you have to watch on another video. Common sense please.
"So, Russia is only good at a defensive war, unless they just say fuck it and start nuking bitches."
"The Failed Logistics of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine because...

I agree with seeing the Logistics! Thankfully the Ukranians are smart on this matter-- stay safe
Who said the Russians would said they would Ukraine in one week.  That was arm chair generals in the west You idiots.   The Russian Plan is going as Plan     How you are changing the narrative

"I still have an unshakable feeling that Ukraine might've made those ""facts"" that Russians ran out of fuel (yeah, they remember to supply fuel to europe for trading but somehow forgot to fuel their own before the invasion? Come on.) Several of the soldiers have Ukranian accents, instead of Russian accents."
"One one side thats actually hilarious, thats like china going to war finding their equipment breaking cause well its made in china... Maybe Russia should not be considered a superpower anymore its just more capable version of north korea"
Definitely a crash course on what's going on. Thanks.
Relying solely on paper maps? Troops short on supplies after TWO DAYS?? WTF kind of half-assed OP is this? I thought Putin was some evil genius or something...how is this amateur failure even happening??
It’s facepalm worthy. What in the fuck they thought they could take Kyiv in 3 days and the world will simply turn a blind eye?
"This seems comical. I mean, I'm a truck driver with zero military experience...but even I have read enough military history and played enough stupid games to know that...logistics wins wars. It seems unreal that Russia is pursuing such an amateur campaign. Like, ""its a trap"" kind of obvious amateurish. So weird."
"There are some problems that I founf with your logic but feel free to answeer them , why they need so many fuel vehicles if they are suoer nesr the frontier, second why covering the signs in the road ways was a tactic if gps is used anyways, third why they sre capturing signals with no encription ? Makes no sense , and last one why logistics are a problem if the bases sre literslly less than 20 miles(this is europe not the states)?"
Thank you
"gotta say, social medias play a very important role in this war"
"Russia's rail network is primarily overhead electric catenary powered with electric locomotives.  While this is actually a far superior system (as opposed to the USA which has practically none outside the Washington to Boston corridor), it is far more vulnerable in a war environment.  Target the substations that feed the wire systems, which are typically every 40 - 50 miles, you take the railroad out for a number of weeks.  Substations typically consist of very specialized equipment (it's single phase power, while all other electricity distribution is 3 phase) which is typically not in stock (or very few in stock) & takes a long time to fabricate.  So, targeting these substations, which are only a few, & usually in remote locations difficult to defend, can disable the entire rail network for weeks if not months.  Sure, they can use diesel locomotives in the meantime, but considering that the vast majority of the Russian rail system is electric catenary, they probably don't have that many.  It would also consume precious fuel needed for the military.  I have some background on this as I am a civil engineer who worked on commuter & intercity rail projects in the USA northeast corridor for decades (the only place in the USA that has heavy rail catenary)."
Fascinating.  Special forces raids on substations anybody?
"Russia may have the might.  But until now, its tactics and logistics hasn't develop to their advantage.  Putin's plan is a child's play.  He has no military experience like those of military or airforce generals.  His experience being a ""security"" and ""intelligence"" is only good for the table.  He has no solid tactics much less strategy."
"I am not seeing many helpful  suggestions in these comment sections.   Will Ukraine be another huge drain on the Russian economy worse than Afghanistan was?  Sure seems like it especially if sanctions are continued.  Did I hear Russia is using the Crimea bridge to transport troops, supplies and weapons in its war on the Ukraine?  To defend itself against the Russian invaders should the Ukrainians blow up the Crimea bridge? What is the best way to do it-- drones, missile strikes...?  If Russia  continues to bomb Ukrainian cities and becomes an occupying force in Ukraine, would it be easier for Ukraine to take back their country if Russia didn't have backup troops coming across the Crimea bridge? What are the pros and cons of taking out the bridge?"
President Zelenskyy a COMEDIAN AND PUPPET EEUU🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Is this the same propaganda as the island were all the the Ukraine marines died fighting against the Russian war ships.  They all turned alive and well!!!
Damn good analysis
"I humbly disagree with your conclusion, these losses and logistics issues the Russians had taken into account in their planning stage. They knew mistakes were going to be made and left it to the conscripts and weaker troops to make the. Their doctrine is more along the lines of a war of attrition it appears as opposed to a short quick strike typical of the American military. I wouldnt be surprised if they instructed their troops to loot food stuffs and whatever else to sustain themselves on the move. You cant think like a western Officer, this Army has a different set of doctrine then we do."
"@Abhinav Jha I hope you’re right, but these perceived failures aren’t affecting the overall situation. The convoys are moving at a pace that is acceptable in the Russian doctrine. They are encircling these cities as they did in WW2 but it isn’t going to happen overnight, they aren’t being challenged to the point it’s stopping them. We gotta hope their economy collapses, but the West is still buying Russian oil and other fossil fuels. This is a major problem, we are funding a belligerent nation."
Nicely done.   One of the more interesting takes on the situation.

"Americans going over there to fight, BAD idea 3,000 dead Americans. Don't go You all do NOT know the entire story over there. Something does not smell right about the American news. If the Ukrainians shoot at the Russians they will shoot back. Stop Shooting at the Russians, There are Nazi movements there just like the Nazi movements here in America. Remember the Ukrainians welcomed the Germans in during WW2 and felt Hitler was a better deal then Stalin who liked Millions of people there. Putin will not be in office forever. Stop shooting the Russians and address it after Putin."
"Well, hold your horses. Isn’t this video American propaganda to make Russia look unorganized and inefficient?  It took the USA three weeks to capture Baghdad with the Iraq war. It’s only been 10 days since this war began. Russia will accomplish its goal. Sorry, I’m not taking any sides, just pointing out the truth."
Western deserves woke propaganda and the family and moral crisis they are going through.

"As always, fantastic content even on YouTube and I'll keep an eye open for your Nebula videos. Keep up the good work!"
"Russian army stopped near Kyiv because Unkrainians placed artillery in between houses, making a living shield. Putin didn't want to fire largely into civillians zone, so Ukrainians just shoot Russians from living areas and they don't shoot back. So, the only way to win for Russia is to fire through the living shield and storm the city, which would be really inhuman. Kadyrov asks Putin to do so openly in social media, but Putin still wants to limit civillan casualities in Kiyv which stopped his progress. He waits where negotiations will lead. Ukrainians shot one of their 3 negotiators yesterday, and it still going slow"
@Abhinav Jha Maybe you can point out where I lied?
@See Jay Ep The man has no reliable sources either. What is the payment rate for Russian trolls these days? 1 million rubles?

16:13: This APC has been repossessed.
"13:48 I dont agree with you at all, this opening stage of the war was a recon on the Ukrainian response to the attacks. The main effort is moving along slowly but steadily and on time according to Russian military strategy. Im sorry, screw putin but this isnt enough to stop the russians."
"Putin may have been a colonel, but that was in the KGB, i.e. the secret police. That's not a good foundation for becoming a military conqueror."
we need to invade russia and see if Putin coward nukes itself lol

Well told!
"People say Putin is clever, actually his actions scream of how stupid Putin is"
🇷🇺🥇
"I imagine part of their problem was military staff fearing to tell Putin the truth about capabilities and liabilities for fear of dismissal or arrest.  German generals had the same problem with Hitler, if they told the truth and he didn't like it, they were removed.  So, he got a bunch of 'yesmen' to add to the his own insanity.  Putin's megalomania probably resulted in the same problems."
propaganda
"Good to know, so destroy their railroad system and they are screwed."
Similar to the winter war... These lessons will prove useful in the long run.
"Propaganda video. Disappointed. Ukrainian government choose to fight Russians in cities. Thats the reason there is no resistance on the first day of war. And forcing citizens to stay in cities citing to fight makes civilian casualty very less in the first week. But after Russians took heavy loses they started old approach which makes heavy civilian casualties. It seems zelensky will the last man standing. Also its very inappropriate for NATO and US to cheer Ukrainian president. I think because of vulgar decision of zelensky all the Ukrainian cities will be in rubbles. Remember what France did when they want to save Paris.
Anyway i thought this video would be logistics video but there just 1 min of logistics and 18 min of propaganda."
"This video shows a lack of understanding of Russian military doctrine, going back to the Soviet Era.  The logistics didn't fail, it's working how they expected.  We, the U.S., have a ton more logistical support by necessity of having to cross oceans.  The Russians have always operated on the land war in Europe mentality."
Putin? Khuylo
Lol “Russia failure”. This is probably your worst video. Regurgitating propaganda news from the west without proper research. This war will be over in 6weeks and Ukraine will belong to Russia.
@Barshen Mikashev 😂😂😂 Fair enough

Russia has the best Olympic drug cheats but it’s military is 3rd rate.

"An excellent presentation, as always. Thank you Wendover."
Why do you speak of 2014 as if it had started with the anexation of Crimea and not with the US backed coup that brought Ukraine outside of Russia`s influence and closer to NATO
I need to believe that Russia is dumber with a cretin as president. He’s a poisoner not a ruler.
Its crazy where ever you are in the world... its the exact same car alarm sound...
Because Russia wasn't invading.
"Russia have it easy on Crimea and they still think its still a walk in the park and just called up civilian on the pretense of training them for 2-3 days dress them up as soldiers and send them over to Kiev (Ukraine), hence you see abandon obsolete Russian hardware everywhere when Ukrainians started to resist and fight back as they are manned by forced civilians dress in fatigue uniforms.    However, Putin  have learned from this and have sent his real soldiers hence the change of phase in the War, there is no more civilian walking up or driving near these soldiers, these are now professional soldiers coming in."
This is why Russia is currently trying to encircle Ukrainians  cities and town: they are trying to starve of Ukrainian own logistic    capability. and force victory through attrition.
You could’ve made this video without taking a side
"1:54 What? That flag, why?"
When you sell fuel on the black market in Belarus...
"Please change it to Putins invasion, this is not a Russian war. Nobody wants this, except the autocrat and his supporters."
LMFAO!!!
Russia's Invasion Logistics Failed? ALREADY???
"08:38 I dont think the Russian command is too shaken by this, according to the Russian field manuals they are basically on time with what they want to do sadly despite the lack of supplky. You can't compare them to the standards we hold in the US Army where we are well supplied and conduct operations in a manner to keep casualties at a minimum. They don't care about the welfare of their soldiers nor the casualties, as long as they reach the objectives in the timelines they have set. They take their deficiencies into account in their planning stage Im betting. If you compare the ""progress"" to the Russian field manuals they are near where they want to be sadly. I want Ukraine to pull off a miracle but ya gotta be a realist too. These units that moved to Kiev in the first stage weren't there to capture the city, they were there to recon and report on the resistance they met. You guys have to think in a military mindset and not just what you see happening on the ground."
It's crazy to me that there were Americans in the world that believed Russia was a threat to the 'States. Russia hasn't been able to do shit since it got picked apart by carrion after the Union fell. Did we expect them to be capable of managing a war? I sure didn't!
Great work on this video! Been looking for some insight into this.
When Wendover Productions jumped the shark.
VIVA  RUSSIA  VIVA PUTIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! from Australia
oh you mean just yourself? speaking of which did you hear that i am half human half dolphin?
"Please don't blame all Russians. Many Russians (including me) don't support Putin and wish the war never happened. Unfortunately, Putin is a dictator, so many people are afraid to protest on the streets."
"Hey mate, I know that, we support the people who are fighting Putin.
We fully appreciate you protesting on the streets.
Please stay safe"
Well that was interesting. Russian tv says exactly opposite and that the special operation goes by the book. Peace
You lost a ton of your American right wing viewership with this one. Awesome video though.
"Why are there no American and European politicians on the Maidan now to support the overthrow of the revolution and the legitimately elected president?
      By supporting extremists and spreading hatred towards Russia, you have made Ukraine the greatest Russian enemy. The war has been going on since 2014, these are just the culmination. The only winner is the USA, which is making great money from this war, selling weapons and taking over the European gas market. The problem is that regimes that are American puppets are in power in all European countries, with the exception of Viktor Orban in Hungary. Consciously destroying their own states for American interests, Zelensky is the best example of an American puppet!🤣"

"if US/NATO is really committed in helping Ukraine, better send battle hardened MERCENARIES to deal with evil Russian forces.. or give Ukrainians AIR DEFENSE system like Patriot PAC3 or THAAD to defend their cities, otherwise, evil PUTIN will level down all the cities similar now with ALEPPO in Syria.... FIGHT UKRAINE✊"
But russia is crushing Ukraine. Stop taking this propaganda from the west. Go to a russian or ukrainian telegram channel and youll see how its actually going.
"Sun Tzu says if you are strong you should feign weakness. If you are weak, you should feign strength. This is precisely the behaviour we see from the two sides of this conflict.

Revelation 11:17‭-‬18 NKJV

And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.

I love how they paint the Red square green to be like we're not the USSR but we're acting exactly like it in the winter War ignoring the fact that our military doctrine is supposed to be better we're acting like half of our officers were purged sending our troops with old food and not telling them any military secrets not training our people mentally for what our president wants to do and randomly doing s*** so if crazy old man Putin wants to throw nukes his staff is just going to look at him and move their heads being like yes because if they do not comply they go to Russian gulag plate I mean prison if you say Russia doesn't have gulags yes they do except that now they're playing their prisoners for the work they do hilariously
Hello I'm from Germany and I say we should invade Russia third time's the charm as they say but this time will be known as liberators in the event glorious Ukraine joins NATO we get to slap Russia 😂👍🏻

"Holy shit, how focused on logistics are you? Everything is fine, not every war is about logistics."
"For real. I mean, what sort of army needs fuel, food, ammo, medical supplies etc? I’m sure there a plenty of 7/11s along the way."
"??? Every great strategist ever, from Sun Tzu to Napoleon, agrees that logistics is probably the most important aspect of warfare, especially in the modern age."
That's a singular yike for you 👍
Russia primarily depends on railways for supply. That's why they are trying to get railway junctions.
This invasion has only proven that russia isn't the big bad threat people think they seem to be. They can't even handle the logistics of going through their next door neighbor. Meanwhile the Americans are cruising along the half a world away in the middle east as if they belong there
"do you think that in terms of current civilian casualties, and urban destruction- that it might have been a better strategy for ukraine to just play along w putins demands and ""bear with it"" for the number of years putin has left, then pounce after he leaves the scene ? understandibily, this stategy might lead to overconfidence and expanding his military forces beyond ukraine - but still, there would likely be a revolution when he goes, it should be overwhelming and widespread enough to largely suceed- giving way to democratic republics.

"Is there a chance that this is all a farce, and that Russia is playing weak to bring on resistance from outside? Is there a chance they’re playing the western power structure to make it seem like they’re really not much of a threat? And somehow Ukraine is simply locate unfortunately in the middle?"
"Why would they appear weak tho?
Their economy is weak, and the only truly powerful thing they have is their army 🤔"
Russia will not be able to establish a supply route in Ukraine since the Ukrainian military is using a lot of drones to strike such targets behind enemy lines.
And for some reason russia still doesn't have achieved complete air superiority
great work Sam
"Not that im happy with war but its just 7 days into the invasion. They accomplished more then we believe because of ukraine ""disinformation propaganda"".  Most information is known post war..."
"The very slow moving supply column may likely be the result of numerous ""breakdowns"" by those operating the trucks in order to stay away from the front.   Teenage conscripts were told they were going to do training and then ended up in a war in which they didn't want to be in.  On a railroad, you end up where the train takes you whether you want to go there or not.  Soldiers operating a truck who end up with a flat tire (because one of them stuck a bayonet into the tire) will have to pull out of the advancing column and replace/repair the tire while others pass them on the way to the front.  A ""breakdown"" may save one's life.

As in the American civil war the South viewed the Union Army as invaders. As a result being out numbered 5 to 1 in their ranks the South was able to drag the war out to a 4 year conflict that was filled with more than a few victories. My point is that people will fight more ferociously when they feel an invader is on land and they are defending the homes.

@Dracalis true. These kids look REALLY young and confused though.
I wouldn't agree with this video. Russia did not bring its best troops and its best fire power. Once it does thats it for Ukraine.

"When US attacked iraq & hanged the president then there were no sanctions no one asked US why ? & Today they are doing UN meeting against Russia.... this war is between Russia & US.. Ukraine is only a scapegoat...the only country who is enjoying the war is US...but unfortunately people are dumb...they can't see it.. US wanted to weaken Russia that's why US neither made Ukraine a NATO ally(ukraine applied for NATO membership in 2008)  nor did he agreed to Putin condition not to make Ukraine NATO country... Putin warned many times that he didn't want war(listen to his interviews of last two months) but US govt didn't listen.. they cornered Russia on purpose.... & Now sanctions exactly what US wanted...
WAR IS NEVER GOOD BUT THE WEST LEFT NO CHOICE FOR RUSSIA...
THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHY THE HELL AMERICA WANTS TO EXPAND NATO FURTHER?"
"You're technically right, neither europe nor russia will profit from this war... Quite the opposite...

But you see, iraq wasn't a democracy, it was a brutal dictatorship... It's pretty difficult to defend brutal dictatorships with a history of attacking their neighbors... Which is why everyone is against Russia"
So if they had prioritised  fuel over ammo they would have been more successful?
"Vladimir Putin is one of the most evil people alive today. I feel so sorry for the Ukrainians.
(I actually feel sorry for the Russians as well- because they can’t do anything to get rid of him.)
Thank you for an absolutely outstanding video."
I think many ordinary Russian soldiers know that they are fitted to kill their brothers. The best route is to march (marathon) for freedom go back to Russia via Belarus. Anyways their salaries are in peril due to economic sanctions on their central bank and other financial institutions.
"Nice idea ""Freedom Marathon"" to Russia like Truckers convoy of Canada."
Anyone who may recall an old online game called War2Glory will know the importance of trucks to an army. One thing not mentioned was the pour tire maintenance causing lots of problems and the amount of dirt roads and wet season making travel speed well below 70. 10 would beat the hell out of a truck in some of those areas. Also not being able to leave roads has hampered them through stuck losses and increased road traffic that destroys the road (tanks). Great overview though and thanks.
it took all of NATO 26 days to take irak   was it a failed strategy
"Im pretty sure, mud and logistics are in the way of Fighter jets and carpet bombing."
I don't know how you do it. But I wanna have your researching prowess.
It's like most people don't want to be conquered and will defend themselves.
"It seems Putin still hasn't adapted to the new HoIIV DLC, and he struggled with the new logistics mechanics."
"Information win wars. Putin thought Hitler strategy will work in 21st century but he forgotten that this time, we have internet. News travels within seconds.."

the collapse of soviet union was also connected to lacks in logistics strategies

"What is the most  striking  thing about  this conflict is how the media and Nato are saying Russia  is losing, Russia  is disorganised  , Russian troops have no supply  etc but they don't want to join the war against  Russia,  I mean if Russia  is so weak why not attack  them ,because  If the Russians really  hate putin and think  he's  mad, chances  are there will be a mutiny, something  is not adding up hear ,"

"So when are you going to create a video on US’s “Invasion”  and “libration” and Iraq, Afghanistan etc ?"
"Not only logistics but battle style and more importantly experience are generally very poor in the Russian military. 

Russian air force assets have barely been protecting helicopter based attacks leaving them easy targets for SAMs. Russia's air force also appears to continue to be extremely poor and inflexible when it comes to ground attack. With very few targeting pods and mostly unguided munitions being used making targeting light manoeuvrable infantry hard. Russia's air force also has displayed very few fighter squadrons leaving counter fighters easy breathing room to attack ground attack aircraft like su25s. 

This doesn't go to mention the Russian tanks not being adapted from the middle east or Chechnya for urban guerilla warfare. 

Soldiers, consripts, are generally extremely poorly trained especially compared to battle hardened Ukrainian units that have been fighting in the civil war. 

Russian supply assets are still extremely outdated using mostly trucks. Making them easy targets for air and ground attack. 

Russia's battle tactics over training after the Chechen war also have not been present. With most infantry and engineering brigades staying with their armoured personnel carriers instead of clearing out buildings. 

Just like Chechnya and the middle east this war appears to be displaying the full ineptitude of a Russian military with bad training, bad logistics and bad hardware. 

It is a flashback to ww1 or early Barbarossa."
"Critical thought experiment, who has more strategic and mental clarity, Putin or Biden?"
Wendover is clearly trying to villainize trains in order to forward his pro-airplane agenda
@Your Neighbour XD
"Only the our Divine lord and Savior;The Airplane.

"Dunno.

Railways are inflexible.
Well known location to program coordinates to destroy them.
Cannot bypass. Train must stop and is difficult to unload.

To supply advancing infantry, helicopters are more usefull, than railways's iron horses becomming easily iron coffins."

"@LessCommonKnowledge ""documented *track* record"" 😂"

Its truly amazing to see how fast changes can be made when we all come together on a common goal. great video.
"The UK, European Union and the US have a huge part to play with the crisis now playing out in Ukraine. Having NATO move ever closer to the Russian boarder does not help. European Union given Ukraine the carrot and stick to join the EU. Not to mention the killing of Russian speaking  eastern Ukraine near the Russian boarders. Where was everyone for the past 8 years. 

We need to have balance. What did the West do In Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya. I don't hear of any war crimes against the following governments for their part. WMD lies killed millions of people. Where was the outcry. Blonde hair and blue eyes count for more I guess. 

The Monroe doctrine that US held has largely been kept quiet. Look at the Cuban missile crisis. How would the US feel if China had a base in Mexico or Canada. 

Im sure the European Union and in particular Germany is happy to pay 7X more for natural gas from the US. Most NATO members are now going to spend more money on arms. So it's a win win for the USA's  Military industrial complex and the oil and gas industry. It's would be in the US interest to keep the Ukraine crisis going."
Nothing happens until something moves. I appreciate how Wendover takes such interest in logistics.
"Logistics runs the world. It is the most overseen subjects by normal people. Be it fuel, food, trade and war logistics is the base."
Pitkään suunnitellut jutut.

Eh. I’m not quite sure it’s soon enough to say whether Russia’s logistics “failed”. Like the fog of war is still pretty thick.
Excellent video
Your most epic production ever. Thank you. And welcome Russia circa 1950. They’ll be bankrupted in 3 months from now and the world will be better off. Will the last Russian left please shut the lights and take those nuclear codes. Thanks.
I dont know.. i not sure it was a fail for russia... US took 20 days to take Bagda
Failed logistics? Russia is doing exactly as planned. Cut off sea access. To the North is Belarus  a fly cant pass by and a 40-mile convoy 14 miles out of Kiev for the final blow. After that to the west to close the border Poland and Romanias. R.I.P
The war's still going shitdick.
"It’s almost like the West new this was going to happen, even the when and how. It’s like Putin is being played and the Ukraine is being sacrificed."
this half as interesting guy is serious on this video
"The largest points that counter this whole video is;
1. The Russians have the advantage of time as they work to encircle Kyiv.
2. The Russians War Doctrine prioritizes Conscripts on the front of initial invasions.
3. Russian War Doctrine disregards casualties of the inexperienced Conscripts while they soften enemy defenses with artillary/rockets"
Putin needs to be Nuremberg'd.

"What? The Ukraine didn't want to be liberated? Unbelievable. But they made thousands of cocktails for the Russians, using the finest Molotov Vodka"
"what if ""stagnation"" around Kyiv is just a distraction and the main goal is simply to wreck the whole country before Kyiv ?? Many years ago some people predicted that if Ukraine manages to profoundly bend towards west, Russia will wreck the country before making a formal gesture of handing it over or giving up. It would also be easier to repopulate a country that is cleared of original resistant population."
You got all wrong Russia didn't wanna kill civilians like the us did...
"​@koudri usa They were airstrikes far from the frontline...

You are using the same excuse book as the US"
@A D u mean after they shot at them ?
then why did they shell civilian buildings
"You never think the Afghan withdrawal could have been worse. 
But then there’s Ukrainian invasion"
"Okay, that now creates a further nightmare headache for Russia.  What is that, I hear you ask?  There is another channel on YT, that has found out other information...  It involves China.  Cast your minds back to February 4, 2022.  PP (Putin) was in Beijing for the opening of the Winter Olympics.  Discussions were held with China President Xi (PX), about China NOT invading the far east of Russia while PP terrorizes Ukraine.  PX gave his blessing.  But, if Russia fail to win in Ukraine, China is going to go after the far east of Russia.  If you look back over 100 years ago, China had control of the far east, and part of that was Vladivostock.  You may also remember in recent times that China has made comments about the far eastern peninsula of Russia, so, my thinking is that Russia may get hit in the east by China at some stage, if things go pear shape and objectives are not achieved in Ukraine.  

Oh, for the record, Russia has not formally declared war on Ukraine.  What is happening is only state sponsored terrorism by thugs.  One of NATO's charters is for the reduction of terrorism in their neighbours, and as no formal declaration of war has been made, where are NATO???  PP does not want to be the ruler of a parking lot, with no citizens, so we need to call his bluff and belt the daylights out of the terrorists that are in Ukraine, pronto!"
"So, does Ukraine stand a chance of winning and pushing Russia back to the border?"
"Their army has no chance, their armed civilians have a chance of making Russian occupation too difficult to sustain. That's how Afghanistan beat the US and the USSR."
"Putins goal as Prof Mearsheimer put it is not to occupy Ukraine,  or to even establish a Soviet union, his goal is just to wreck Ukraine,  to wreck  it in such a way that it can't  lean west,that's  why he hasn't  unleashed  all of Russia's  power  onto Ukraine , that's  why he created  Donestk and Luhansk.
And he will achieve  that goal,Europe  may light up buildings, protest ,etc ,etc but when the hype dies down and the war is no longer the headlines, policy makers  in the EU will start looking at Ukraine  the same way they have always looked  at it ,as a liability  ...as a slavic  country  of zero strategic value ,"
"I think Ukraine has fallen into the trap of it's own corrupt system, and now the people will suffer ,when once they where the best at so many things like ;steel production ,ship building, space tech, & so much more all gone now."
"@A D I have only talked of the corruption in the system ,not of the last 8years of sadness . War to stop hate is a oxymoron. As a father I feel for all families who've lost theirs on all sides. Who wins here ? The USA weapons manufacture share holders, maybe some oil or LPG  share holders. Russia & Ukraine will lose their sons & daughter's in all this. When it is family fighting it's even sadder."
How is Russia's invasion ukraine's fault ?
"I got an ad before this vid saying ""stop Russia's war on Ukraine"". Heh, ironic."
Ukraine: Look at all these abandoned tanks. I have an idea!
"Russia killed commercial airline passengers flying over Ukraine. 
KILLED innocent families travelling in the sky for holidays from other countries. 
KILLED innocent children going on holidays. 
ANIMALS KILL CHILDREN, ANIMALS."
Great video
That explains the prioritization of the molotov cocktails as well. Thank you for this informative video!
"The push for molotovs is likely more because the russian advance is generaly very mechanized, and molotovs are about the only realiable strategy for covilian defence against armored vehicles overall. A single Molotov won't likely do to much against even a moderately armoed APC or such, but throw in 3, 5 or even 10? That becomes problematic for even modern Main Battle Tanks optimized for City fighting at some point. It's hellishly effective against the older equipment that the Russians have, especialy as that is mainly build for open tank warfare and such."
"Yeh, it makes so much sense now. A molotov on a fuel truck will be very effective. And there is no way Russia can stop civilian resistance fighters producing and throwing one from behind their supply lines."
America needs to attack Russia while there ass is exposed in Ukraine. If Biden wasn't such a weak scared president this wouldn't have been done. They can't defend Russia when they are dealing with Ukraine. Expecially a power house such as America's Logistics
"You know, Bismarck said that a Russian man harnesses the horse slowly but drives fast.. let's see what gonna happen in 1 week at least."
"It's totally irresponsible to draw the conclusion of this video. The situation is complex, much remains undetermined or unknown. Much information available is unreputable.
And how naive to believe social media is facilitating Ukrainian insurgency.
Americans are pretending like they know or care about Ukraine, or know what's going to happen. They're magical thinking, that having the righteous opinion and being well informed will manifest a positive outcome. It's just navel-gazing."
Ukraine belongs to Russia. Plain and simple.
I really want some video from Russia political  perspective like why they are doing this and how they are thinking about this .I did tried to find but all I could find is videos against russia very biased to be honest
Yeah because its pretty tought to justify an unprovoked war against a sovergin nation.
"CNN: 9 hours of coverage on snake island, the ghost of Kyiv and what that means for the Democrats and  Joe Biden. 
Wendover: 20 Min concise summary on why Kyiv didn't fall in 7 days."
"Not trying to be a troll but I think it’s far too soon to judge this invasion as a fail. Maybe Russia is sending in the troops that it is, and doing the things that they are doing to trigger NATO and test their response. This could mean plenty of different things but in my own opinion I think this is just a way for WW3 to begin. Not sure why the elites want another war but I think this one is to refresh the population and implement the new world order."
It turns out that not maintaining equipment and encouraging corruption it a bad military strategy

5. Who in the chain of command is responsible for preventing our servicemen from defending our CITIZENS and their constitutional rights.
6. Why is my child being asked to go fight in a foreign war when our own nation is left unprotected from aggressive invaders.
 7. Is our current government undeniably legitimate?
8. Should I let the World Economic Forum/D.C. swamp rats use my honorable patriotic son or daughter to secure their stranglehold on our country and the rest of the world?"
"A thing I have heard is that the Russian army tends to start any war ineptly, and then then adapts to become 'efficient'. I am just worried efficient means brutal. :("
"The real question is ""will the Russians have time to adapt"""
"Putin believes his own hype. Great weaponry, but the Russian army has been misled to believe that they will be welcomed as liberators. The morale of the army will fail, even if they ""win"". The USA saw this happen in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. 
It takes time and is bloody expensive to sustain. Also the Russian economy is too weak to support both guns and butter. Thus the citizenry will gradually sour on the war. Expanding the war by the West is both foolish and unnecessary. By supporting the Ukrainian resistance, the West will win."
"""Pretense that it was a defensive decision""???? Imagine if China and Mexico had discussions of a military alliance and would eventually allow China to amass troops, submarines, nuclear missiles, and jets in Tijuana. It would lead to a US invasion of Mexico with a replacement Mexican government friendly to the US. This happened with Cuba and the Soviets in the 1960s. Then imagine if Ukraine joined NATO and placed troops and nuclear missiles in the northeast section of Ukraine just 300 miles to Moscow. Both the US and Russia would invade. Surprised it took this long for Putin to invade. The comedian president was too friendly with the West and wanted to be an EU and NATO country. Ukraine will suffer because in the end, the US and EU can't afford to give up Russian oil and won't do anything to Russia military units in Ukraine. Russia will put in a puppet government just like Belarus and that will be the end of a westernized Ukraine as we know it."
Cuba was a problem because of the technology at the time limiting the range for missiles. Now missiles can travel any distance from any starting points so I dont think something like cuba would happen again.
Putin want to destroy all all people if he don't get his demand
"Great at defense, poor at offense."

My prediction all along is for russia to encircle the city and just siege it. 

Yhey may try immediately attack but capturing it is over optimistic. Hence when the attack failed, they dig in and wait."

"The main problem with the Russian army is a problem that has existed even during the time of the Czar s. Buracracy! It creates inificentcy and discourages initiative. In the west inificentcy is looked for and stamped out! Individual initiative is encouraged and rewarded! In Russia inificentcy is excepted and individual initiative is discouraged! This attitude has hurt and embarrassed the Czars army in the first world war. Stalin's army Finland and later WWll. It happed again in the Chechen wars. Then again in the Gorgian conflict. Now in the Ukraine the greatest strength of the modern Russian army, is also it's greatest weakness! It's size and buracracy. The Russians have one hell of a mess in their hands! Just throwing live bodies at the enemy will not be enough this time, like they did in WWll. The Russians are being out fought and outsmarted and outmaneuvered! Just like in Finland in the 1939-1940 war. This war may end in a similar fashion. It could be the first way of many to come in the continuing struggle between east and west!

Back then the Russian leaders were kept in check by the internal working of the party and government. In Putin we have a leader who doesn't have any checks on power. Maybe we are just at the end, and should be grateful for the 75 years we had, after having invented nuclear weapons. Sure Russia has a crap army, but they have nukes. It was only a matter of time until a mad man got a hold of them."

Fantastic video. Now how does this war end?
Then Russia la ta cagando..jijijiji 👍🙊👌😡🙉🙈🦧
"It's funny to see someone who's does not specializes in military analyzing a war that has not even concluded yet. I at hope you at least were paid for this bs. 
PS just seen your comment. Yeah, cope"
"Biden is winning this war hands down. Sanctions on Russia, plus media outlets like CNN are reporting the real news 👍 Get your raincoats and rain boots, blue waves on the horizon 🌊🌊🌊 🌊🌊🌊"
I mean they didn't even tell their front line that they were invading a country 🙄 ofc it's going to fail
Russia simply don't have enough experience compare to US who has been invading multiple countries for the past decade.
"Lol, they are creating a supply base at the outskirts of Kiev and soon, will bomb it to rubbles . Within 1 week Kiev will fall, then you will see this comment and delete your video."
"Russia has shown the world just how weak they really are. How terrible their military is. How untrained the russian army really is. China thought they were getting in bed with a giant and when they turned the bedroom lights on, China sees the russian giant is really a dying fly!"

bravo.fantastično
all we have to do is blow up some of his rails in russia and gave over!
"why doesnt anybody talk about the euro maidan incident supported by the west, mistreatment of russian minority in ukraine, azov brigade burning 46 people alive in 2014, russian security concerns, american hyppocricy wrt to bombing serbia, libya iraq. Russian information is disinformatin, while american ones like this wendover is valid information."
"Kinda disappointed. Red Alert 2 told me if the Russians would invade, they also bring their Kirov Airships."
stupid video. 'failed' yet the aggresion+invasion is progressing further every hour.

"I don't know why no one is not talking about the NATO expansion, corruption with Biden's son and potential increase in sale of US military equipment."
What NATO expansion?
"I think the logistics they had in place were scaled to the needs of their ""invasion"" plan. The Russians believed their own propaganda, assumed that Zelinskiy would flee to the West as soon as the attack began, and expected the sheer size of the advancing column to intimidate anyone who might think about resistance. If the entire battle plan called for them to secure a railhead close to Kiyiv on day one, then there was no need to supply the column by road, beyond that first day. A totally prepared and highly motivated attack force, which understood the mission and were prepared to deal with resistance, should have been able to meet this objective

The problem, as I see it, was the underlying shallowness of the Russian military. If you want to call this a failure of logistics . . . well OK, there is one overriding ""logistical"" issue. Logistically speaking, it is hard to get troops to attack defended positions when they have been told that the are just on a picnic outing. We know from Russia's own information that 80% of the troops in that column are raw conscripts, who were told that they were simply going on ""military exercises"". Conscript soldiers are not at all interested in dying to please Putin. Put yourself in their shoes, and ask yourself how these boys are going to react when they suddenly run head on into a bunch of people firing live bullets at them. 

And many of these rank recruits have faced worse ... some have to deal with being accosted by some angry babushka who tells them to put sunflower seeds in their pockets so that flowers will grow on their corpses. 

The Russian army is well aware of the impossible task theyve been given. Theyre the ones actually there on the ground, and Im sure they realise the futility of trying to occupy a country of 44 million people who will puncture their tires, piss in their coffeepots or even slit their throats if they close their eyes for a second. Im also certain that the more astute among the (Russian) brigade and division commanders have begun to consider the past history of what happens to front-line officers who are complicit in war crimes. This is the sort of military operation where - even if you win, you lose. 

Personally, I dont call that ""logistics"". I call that an army that isnt really prepared to fight."
"@Chibi Romano Youre living in fantasyland, my friend. And everyone here can see it. Since Putin is also living in fantasyland tell him I said ""hi"", next time you see him. . ."
Let Russia piss away trillions in military waste to soften them up for the rest of the world to cannibalize them as a nation

Russia should be ashamed of yourself and the people should take over and put in a new government and bring Russia back to his senses
"One Russian official said ,they have not taken the war for real,,,  if they do Ukraine will be flatten, i guess they reserving that war for Nato and West"
And **that** (the top-down push model) is the weakness of communism.
"SO VLADIMIR PUTIN WITH ALL HIS LIES HAS CAUSED A BUNCH OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION WITH WAR.

 ALTHOUGH HE CALLS IT A WINTER SOUGHT DOWN TO VISIT SOME NEIGHBORS.

 THE BOTTOM LINE IS WAR MEANS KILLING 

 THAT MEANS KILL RUSSIANS

   VLADIMIR PUTIN IS THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE. 

THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE MUST BE KILLED AND CRUSHED.

IT'S WAR AND THAT MEANS KILLING.

 WE NEED HIM DEAD.

 SO RUSSIANS OR ANYONE NEED TO GO AFTER VLADIMIR PUTIN. 

THAT MEANS IF HE'S  IN MOSCOW GO THERE.

  START KILLING. 

IT'S WAR. 

WAR NEEDS TO REACH THE HEAD OF THE SNAKE. 

KILL ANYBODY IN SIGHT THAT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DEFENDING HIM. 

THAT MEANS PUTTING A BULLET IN THE BACK OF THEIR HEAD OR THE FRONT OF THEIR HEAD OR SHOOT THEM IN THE FACE OR STICK A KNIFE IN THEIR GUT.

 DO THIS IN THE NAME OF JESUS, MUHAMMAD OR ANYBODY ELSE 

 VLADIMIR PUTIN DOES NOT REPRESENT FREEDOM. HE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FREEDOM TO DEMONSTRATE OR TO SPEAK ILL ABOUT HIM OR ANYBODY ELSE THAT HE IS TRYING TO PROTECT.

HE'S A MOB BOSS RUNNING A COUNTRY WITH PAY TO PLAY PATRONAGE WITH HIM AS THE GODFATHER OF THIS CRIMINAL GANG RUNNING THIS COUNTRY..

THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WANT HIM DEAD. THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA KNOW THAT THERE'S NO LAWS IN THAT COUNTRY OTHER THAN PATRONAGE TO THE MOB BOSS AND ALL HIS TENTACLES.

 MURDER VLADIMIR PUTIN  AND ANYBODY THAT LOOKS LIKE HIM OR WHO DEFENDS HIM.

 IT'S WAR AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE DIE AND PEOPLE KILL.

 DON'T BE AFRAID TO KILL KILL KILL KILL.

 TAKE A  BAT TO THEIR HEAD

 WHATEVER IT TAKES

 KILL THEM, KILL THEM DEAD, KILL THEM FAST.

 MAKE YOUR WAY TO VLADIMIR PUTIN 

STRING HIM UPSIDE DOWN LIKE MUSSOLINI IN ITALY.

  BEAT HIS FACE UNTIL HE'S NOT EVEN RECOGNIZABLE.

 PUT THIS UP AS PAY-PER-VIEW TO HELP REBUILD UKRAINE."
But Russia has the numbers. They will just get more brutal and keep flattening cities as they move through. They seem to be doing better in the south on their way to Romania.
Man… everything was sounding fine and even this comment was fine till literally that last word. You start saying someone’s opinion makes them a troll or that it’s not a real opinion etc etc and it turns this whole video’s credibility into trash.
"Army have their own map, tool and skill to navigate without civilian navigate systems (map, road signs,....). I dont know how Russians train their but here in my country, every soldier have to know to use map and navigate independently from civilian systems. In Addition, Russian have Glonass aka Vodka GPS, why do they need road signs to navigate??? Another question, is the number of tanks and vehicles being left because of running out of fuel large enough to concern that Russia has trouble with fuel supplies??"
"Russia is defending itself just like israel is, so nothing wrong one can say?"
"Another great video, as always. But it would be much better if you should stop mispronouncing _kilometre_ as ""ki-LOM-e-ter"". Also, Kyiv is pronounced ""key-ihv"", not ""keev""."
Russian rubble has become worthless in Communism and capitalism...vodka?
"There's a YouTube video by Tasks & Purpose talking about the Russian invasion. They haven't failed and the media is lying when it says Russia ""failed"" its initial invasion or they are having issues or that Putin thought it would be over already. Just go watch the video, its called Ukrainian War - What the West doesn't understand... or something like that."
"see when i had heard that russia invaded the ukraine i thought they'd win immediately. A world power versus a generally unknown nation that is still young and doesn't have the same military numbers or capabilities or spread. Yet here we are, they haven't won. Putin put his nuclear force on standby after and by this day i make this comment he started talking about more peaceful actions lmao. I understand that a defending group has like what, 3 times the power than an attacking force? Battles get harder to win the longer they go on as well. Add all this together and i knew Putin had to win his fight and the ukraines had to surrender before a week's time. 
           I think Putin also didn't expect Ukraine to fight back, either it's military or citizens. He put up a strong front, threatening any nation that intervened and the world expected his victory yet we're watching his plans hit speed bump after speed bump. I'm no military specialist or have any knowledge of how to win wars/logistics but from a common sense standpoint + watching what's been developing i think the world is gonna see Putin's embarrassment. Heck just the fact that the best news outlet we have on what's happening is from youtube and random people posting via phones tells me Putin isn't just against Ukraine but against the modern forms of technology. A lack of fuel and food for soldiers in only 2 week of conflict boggles my mind, i'd expect reserves ready to go in case the battles wage on longer than anticipated. 
             Even better There are videos of Russian people protesting against the conflict which warms my heart, people want peace or at least no war. Suffice to say nothing is going at Putin expected, Ukraine is putting up a good fight, whatever happens in the end the world is watching and talking about it. No one is gonna get away with what's happening. A historic moment for sure and one i hope ends with the most amount of peace obtainable. Good luck and stay safe people."
"In order to propel 1 soldier, you need 4 to work for ""logistics""."
"This biased video was brought to you by.....

I am from India and a lot of my family is in defence forces. While my uncle is fighter pilot and cousin is in the infantry supply division and not exactly infantry. All their excercise are focussed on creating a robust supply line. Maybe for this reason only

"Hey Wendover, can you do a video on ukraine's side of things? Why did the president arm civilians with weapons? Why are civilians and children working to make molotovs? who are throwing the molotovs at the russian supply line, military, partisans, civilian turned militia? Why did the Ukrainian side loosen their recruitment policy and age? why did they decide to release prisoners with combat experience to draft them into the army?"
"@IWBTH that's fine. And just as you gave me a helpful warning against extremist thinking, I am giving you a helpful warning against extremist internet debate. 

If you want to be taken seriously, don't accuse, hint, imply, or ""warn"" that the person you're debating has ""genocidal"" thinking. No matter how cleverly you word it, or hide behind ""no I was just warning against it"" it's simply an ad hominem attack, accusing your opponent of being horrifically evil."
"@CreeDo Lala Sure. But i never called you a ""hitler"". I simply warned you against insinuating that any action by any side, offensive or defensive, can be justified just because of them being in a conflict. I said that if you want to reply that way, stop. dont do it because that kind of justification is dangerous. It is the same justification used for genocide. Do not even try to insinuate anything that can be perceived and be justified into that kind of thinking. Again, it is a warning not to do that, for you and everyone reading your first reply, because it comes very close to the justification i was talking about. So i decided i should cut off that line of thinking by giving you the warning and the reasoning for my warning.

And it was very clear by how you replied that you were not neutral. I was simply being clear to you about my perception of you through what you have written, explaining to you why you perceived my initial question the way you did so that there is no ambiguity, and closing off any ""escape route"" so to say. Because you made a point, i wasn't being clear to everyone reading. So here i am, making it clear. For everyone."
"@CreeDo Lala Before you said the context isnt clear, remember where we are. Its the comment section of Wendover Productions. Just to make it absolutely clear to someone who might not be able to pick up the contexts.

 The video is about russia's failed logistics, my inquiry was on the other side of the conflict that was being portrayed rather positively in comparison. But yet we do know that Ukraine had done things that seemed counterintuitive with the perception that ukraine is doing very well against the russian side. So what gives? the questions i asked formed the basis to the line of inquiry around ukraine's seemingly contradictory stories."
America's failure to maintain its own manufacturing supply chain since the 1990s and its energy independence will lead to long term problems if ever invaded too.

They sooooooo haven’t failed!!! loL pace is as good as can be. The propaganda coming out from us is so messed up! Building up something to watch it fall
mmm yes somehow a whole war by a superpower that have been happening just about a week ago been cracked down by a youtuber. interesting. its only the beginning and people already know the end lol. your logistic is solely based on army go in kill everything win war mindset without taking in account other factor of why they doing the war and what affects it economical/political wise.
Russia sucks at war. They will lose.
What is your logistics in Afghanistan you western cowards?
1:46 was made possible by Nebula. Nebula is your...
I really thought he was going to say “this extension of military might was made possible by Skillshare” at 1:45.
Great Video!  Love your content.
Going to file this under aged like milk. Way to early to report anything factual with the information war going on.
"fair to say that, but also fair to see the shore with what you can currently see"
I take it you didn't watch the video?
"It's best not to publish videos like this about countries where war is ongoing, for security reasons."
Ukraine is a very big country to invade overnight. It's fall is inevitable but it will take some time.
"Ukranian ""oh you need supplies?"" here's a bullet"
I still believe Ukraine will fall into Russian hands
Yes it can but at what cost to Russia and for how long can they hold it
"I will say, in this day and age, it's just not a good idea to be an aggressor in a conflict, especially in a larger vs smaller force.  Glad there was basically universal condemnation on this."
Fake News 🖕
report to demonitize misinformation
@Arv Israel? Is this yew? (Get it… she rhymes)
"@Arv what?? 

It’s against YT to advertise war and display death. 

REPORT HIM"
Nothing like having a member of the synagogue of satan explaining a FAKE WAR! If you desire the truth simply read 1st Thessalonians 2:14-16 and you’ll get the answer of who is behind ALL the world's problems!
"And what about russian air force? Cant they provide a better offensive solution? 
This video is purely mentioning land forces and their logistics, which i find right. But what about air tactics?"
I think air tactics are vulnurable since they can be shut down easily
We are doing an special financial operations to Russia!!!!
"it zelensky war... try to be nato agent, rusia help ukrania so much more that west can ever give.... zelensky pretend to be hero, he just sacrife his people....  zelensky genocide east ukranian and their language..."
This chanel is becoming propaganda type. I will not be surprised if mainstream media starts inviting WP.
Note to self: Aim for fuel tanks and tires.
Cities are surrounded. You call that a failure?
@William Thompson yeah they are but Ukraine is pretty smart
@iPrq well they are doing pretty good fighting on a slim down diet.
Yeah because the people who are surrounding the city are starving
"so many lies in this video, is this nato's propaganda ? x)"

Good job on this doc. 👏
"When the Russian invasion had failed logistics, the US interventionism in the Middle East had failed politics (more specifically, military lacks objectives that can be achieved with military means in the Middle East)"
"Russia has also failed at politics, since they will also deal with a largely hostile populace."
"@King Henry VIII Tudor ve done better in Afghanistan if it acted as an old school colonial empire(install a puppet King, forcibly impose your culture) than being a liberating force

they did both those things. their culture just was never excepted by afghanis and neither were the corrupt puppet kings.

If they really wanted to win in afganistan they should have allied with the big bad iran and gone after pakistan. But ya with thier ""allies"" that was never going to happen."
But In the end every nation in history has political issues even the Roman Empire. And in the end while US is separated (due to melting pot of many cultures) it is still the soul most dominant military in history. And controls the most dominant and longest lasting alliance in history (NATO) And the queen of the number 1 winner of all wars….industry and logistics. It has spent the past 20 years fighting on multiple nations all across the globe. And it’s main issue in Vietnam and Afghanistan was always politics. But if you look at battle after battle the US dominated in 9/10 times. While still maintaining 10+ super carriers and the largest navy and air-force in the world. Russia can’t even fight its own neighbor for a week without embarrassing its self.
@GioGio's Epic Channel war *of* terror
"Well, yes that's true, but i don't see how Putin wins any hearts and minds with this one either"
Valuable information. Thank you for your hard work!
If I'm hearing this correctly... a few hundred demolition saboteurs could do serious damage to Russia's ability to muster forces 🤔... noted.
"Russians have always been inefficient and clumsy with logistics. Inherent in their military system going way, way back.  What I don't understand is why no one is saying that Putin is NOT a nuclear threat. He is a simple sociopath (the KGB only hired sociopaths), they are not suicidal, they are survivors. This mantra we are getting from NATO that they are afraid of nuclear war is unbelievable. Personally I think they are lying, just an excuse to not commit.  Not the only big lie NATO is telling, so we are not only getting Putin's lies but Stoltenberg's lies, a ballet of lies coming from both sides.  Putin is absolutely immune to sanctions and threats of war crimes enforcement, as a sociopath, he feels not empathy and he feels no anxiety, but he is predictable. He pivots from one check on his behavior to another action, which makes him seem unpredictable but it is more like a pinball, you can see his direction. He has dead eyes (actually his face), like a shark, and his behavior is equally predatory.  NATO is more like a herd of frightened cattle, ready to stampede but only in the opposite direction. Putin respects one thing and one thing only, and that is FORCE, it is inherent in his nature.  NATO building up forces on the borders of NATO countries is meaningless to him.  What would get Putin's attention is NATO fearlessly entering Ukraine to establish a ""safe"" zone.  Putin would recognize force and would turn away. Putin absolutely believes that NATO is going to back down as soon as he finishes his work in Ukraine and his goal is total subjugation and incorporation into Russia as a vassal.  Putin thinks he can then start playing nice and start working for the removal of Sanctions.     NATO is currently using Ukraine as a stalking horse, allowing to inconvenience Russia while it builds up it's military unnecessarily on the borders of NATO countries. What NATO does not realize is that it is NATO that is being stalked.  What is literally going on in Ukraine is the rape and murder of a Democratic state and NATO, although there is clear precedent that nation can work outside it's borders, keeps stating the lie, through Stoltenberg, that they are only ""defensive"" alliance. It is a massive game of smoke and mirrors and it is despicable on both sides with Ukraine being destroyed in the middle."
Send all the stingers and 2 way radios
Why did western powers let a former Comedian become prime minister of Ukraine?
"it's maybe strange for other country, but remember USA also had an ex-actor president."
"❤️❤️❤️❤️ Love your video, amazing 👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"Nah, conflict wasn't to go for 5 days, thererm were maps found fir a 15 day plan"
Any chance you can share that logistic report. It seems like an interesting read
Failed? Really?😂
"Now can you do ones about the ""the failed logistics of US' invasion"" of Afghanistan and Iraq? You can include Lybia, optionally."
@Ace that's a bot
What failed logistics? They invaded both countries thousands of miles away from home with 0 issues. The occupations were what went wrong lol
"I'll start off by saying I 100% don't agree with this war in Ukraine or any war for that matter. Not trying to minimise the effects of this war but highlight the clear double standard that is being shown here. When the US/UK invade countries in the middle east there is no sympathy from the west. No one is stopping these countries for their invasions. When civilians of these countries do the exact same things as the Ukrainian citizens are currently (making Molotov cocktails, fighting back with guns etc.) they're branded as terriorists not praised by the media for defending their land. Just crazy how people seem to care a lot more when the people be oppressed/affected are European/White. I guess Putin should've just said Ukraine has weapons of mass destruction and everyone would be fine with it 🤷‍♂️."
🥲🥲🥲
"When information that becomes critical to know in situations like this they should not be behind paywalls. No matter how much money people need making informative Videos about the situation like this is the only moral thing to do.

This said. This video is misleading like most media reporting on the issue. Depicting Russia as making a misstep that will quickly backfire on them is all wrong. Russia isn't failing, hasn't missteped and its winning and expanding. My understanding is that NATO is /has been sending mercenaries to Ukraine which means usa will eventually be called in unless there is a time out called and that makes this a world War 3 whether we like it or not. And based on actual military Intel being reported elsewhere outside major media outlets Russia is gaining, not, losing. And his people as a majority support his liberation of Ukraine as opposed to revolting. 

Russia has also sent planes out into airspace that has been blocked to them. But no media is reporting this. 

They ARENT losing. So stop depicting it as if they are! Sadly we won't realize how false all this is. There to bolster our morale until it's too late. 

We are absolutely undermining Russia. Don't. Putin isn't insane he knows what he is doing. His people support him. He is not backed into a corner. And this is absolutely  escalating."
They do not have logistics.  They thought  this was going to be easy and short.
Go Ukraine!!!  Keep'em running in circles.
Nice propaganda👍
@Arv it's not that i dont like it it's just not true. This war would be soon happening in Russia if NATO took Ukraine NATO is the main aggressor. And about this logistics bullshit i mean come on they practically encircled them why would logistics be a problem
anything i don't like is propaganda
"west propaganda thinks its failed logistics.
Russia thinks its testing the waters.
I'm no putin fan but realistic about life."
The Mass Media should be ashamed of themselves.  I have learned and SEEN more in this video than a week of their stuff.
"Wow, insightful video. Thank you."
Its not failed. Its parts of Putin strategy
"Silly observation. Granted they might be rusty but to think that them “ruskies” couldn’t blitzkrieg strait to Kiev is incredibly naïve.  To not take into consideration that they might be doing a “surgical” operation all while seeing what push back might happen by Ukraines western backers while doing a “soft” feel about is ludicrous . Basically they aint stupid. 
Ps to rip on The USSR in Afghanistan & say its Russia is silly. Also uncle sam gave weapons to them people we went back into Afghanistan to look for …that somebody wasn’t even there! Either a government was full of bs or its intelligence/logistics was. How much did the tax payers get fleeced over that?"
Ps Ask yourself. How much equipment was left in Afghanistan by the US military? How much chaos with the evacuation. Outstanding logistics. Naïve puff piece…
We should help them
Making these videos during the fog of war is laughable. Delete this.
"@Arv I'll be in my bunker, you will see a flash and cease to exist when the nukes fly."

"It is reported that leader of Ukraine , Selensky is Jewish. Also the history states that both Ukraine and Russia follow Orthodox Christianity and historically cousins. Why this Jewish Selensky is adamant in killing fellow Ukranians and Russians? He knows he and his family safe and no Jew is being killed?"
Damn these Ukrainians are so badass
"hey wendover, i know you like nebula but please don't ever produce exclusively for nebula."
"it's been 9 days since the war has started and the russian have made great territiorial progress, about 20-25% of ukraine has been conquered. I would like to have something of what you are smoking wendover productions! the muddy season and other hiccups in the conquest of ukraine were to be expected. that being said even if it takes 60-90 days before the russians have won, which it probably will. that's definitely not a logistical failure🤣🤣"
Let’s just ignore the smoldering crater that is the Russian economy.
Great analysis.
"Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook are going to help win this war and that’s absolutely astounding"
"After seeing all the dash cams and cameras capturing the train carrying tank and trucks alike, I was utterly stunned by the fact that they were preparing for the invasion years prior to today."
@Serastrasz you know you already got a latvia to defend from. would you want another ukraine? and ukraine border covers much wider area too.
@Rainer Kinzinger something like dat. ukraine added joining nato in their constitution. thats one of the trigger point. imagine nato deploy missiles in ukraine if that happen. moscow is less den 500km away only. if ukraine stayed neutral. non of this would have happened. and thats also putin criteria for the ceasefire.
"@Rainer Kinzinger Out of the top 20 least corrupt countries, 14 are European, while the US is 27th. Though there are still big differences within Europe, so depending on where you are, it might be pretty bad locally. I don't know about other EU countries, but where I am almost all politicians are ordinary people. From what I've seen, the 'old rich' don't really interfere with politics, unlike the 'new rich' in the US.

The US has lost a lot of influence in the last decades. The EU has opposed the US on many topics, so calling them puppets is greatly exaggerating the power US has over EU. It won't be long before the EU and US stand as equals on the world stage."
"@Fenrael The NATO border in Latvia is already about 600km from Moscow, it's not a relevant difference for missiles. They joined 18 years ago, complaining about proximity now is just an excuse."
"interesting but i disagree with the failed part, this is what they want you too think they know exactly what thier doing,  this is literally only the start. they havent used even 20% of thier power yet."
"95% of Russia's staged troops are in Ukraine. Upwards of 80% of their entire military's combat capabilities is focused on Ukraine. Don't bullshit yourself. There's no success in running out of fuel mere kilometers from a country you border, with troops abandoning entire columns of armored vehicles that the Ukranians now have their hands on. This invasion was expected to last 3 days tops in the eyes of Russian military planners and the fact that they're running into this many issues this quickly is evident of that. You don't lose nearly 10,000 soldiers, more than both Chechen Wars(over the course of years) combined in just 10 days and not categorize it as a resounding failure."
"Using their entire army against Ukraine is just a large cost to their budget, considering their economy is nonexistent."
"One issue that needs addressed is this , the Russian army is bascially conscripts who are required to join and have no incentive to fight well, vs a population which is defending its own land and is highly motivated to protect it."
@Riioas no but I have a friend in moscow university who tells me so
"I do not condone Putin's actions, but I wish YouTubers gave the full account of what happened in 2014. The then pro-Russian government was overthrown/ousted by pro-EU protestors, which sparked off the annexation of Crimea and War in Donbas. It wasn't a random act.

Other than that, this was a a fantastic look at the defence of Ukraine both from the Ukraine and Russian perspectives"
amazingly informative video thank you!!
"I don't believe anything politicians, media, or random youtube schmucks have to say..."

The Failed Logistics of Putin's War
Dang what was dropped at 16:53
"“The fascists of the future will come in the name of anti fascism.” -Winston Churchill.

Putin trying to kill a Jewish president and acting like Hitler while calling the Ukrainians the Nazis. Putin is such a psychopath."
This is truly a Russian war
I’m an American and I want to annex Canada! 😂 (Jk love you northern neighbors)
Russia has been moving slowly on purpose. Unlike the USA in Iraq - bombing everything insight and needlessly slaughtering civilians - Russia has tried to minimize casualties and has engaged in negotiations while invading. It’s something the west cannot comprehend.
"@itsjustdon Well, if that happens, the Azov Battalion will end up dead or in Siberia. I don’t shed any tears for them."
"@Steven Yourke I think that one is going to play itself out because the Azov Battalion is going to fight. I'm anticipating a 'last stand' type, full-on battle within the next 72 hours between Azov/Russian forces. Let's see what happens."
@itsjustdon Agreed. But what to do with all the Nazis? The Azov Battalion. That’s going to be a rather difficult disposal problem. They can’t just ignore them.
@Steven Yourke I think they will get it as well. Let's hope for a peace settlement very soon. They are making progress from the south. They almost have the main Ukrainian army in the Donbass section encircled. I think they'll split the country in 3 sections. From the NE Kharkiv and go down SW to Odessa and call that New Russia. Lots of Russian speakers. Then Kiev can be the new Ukraine with a friendly regime and the west portion will be Lviv with some type of offer to Poland.
"Russia is doomed, Putin will never survive this.
They’ve been sanctioned by every financial institution, organizations and their currency is now worth $0. 
I can’t wait to see how they will survive this."

"Now made you wonder, in a super theoretical situation, what if Russia fight China? Who would win?"
"I don't really agree with the capitulation part of using air and artillery attacks, you gotta think about how Ukraine feels and you gotta think also about their doctrine, less concern with casualties, and their initial targets from the first artillery attacks were military installations and important locations to weaken them. I think their taking this at the pace they can go with the supply trucks they have, and from what you said they don't have enough, and haven't yet sent all their forces in just yet, and the ones that have been sent are probably the more underfunded ones that didn't get the more modern gear."
"This OBVIOUSLY proves that Ukraine, NATO, and the West  THREATENED to INVADE poor little Russia!"

YouTube is a very bad platform for bringing the news to people. Too biased. Too much censorship.
YouTube is certainly a more unbiased form of information than Russian media but that’s a low bar.
Why are you rehashing things people  already knew????  Is your info that slow ?
Amazing content! Soo well explained.. glad i found your Channel
"Oh that supply strategy would have infuriated me (assuming it’s true) as a USA veteran. Don’t give me stuff I don’t need and give me what I ask for. You trained me how to fight, I know what I need, don’t toss me 20 bayonets… wtf do I do with that?"
Amazing video essay on the topic.  Keep the good work going.
"The conflict began in November 2013, not Spring 2014. It ended when Yanykovych fled Ukraine on Feb 22, 2014"
Stop supporting neo-nazi groups in Ukraine.
That claim is wildly incorrect. Please point to when he did that?
This is McKinsey level analysis. Very impressed.
"CNN or BBC needs to hire you. Actually, never mind, keep doing independent journalism. Awesome"
You guys thinking you know more about war than the country that stopped germany in ww2 is mind-blowing 😂
"Yeah I agree. The USA is a really powerful country and they have not slowed down since ww2. As for the Soviets? Well, they were just lucky winter was around the corner. Nothing impressive."
"It’s been like nearly 80 years since WW2, that information is kinda useless for modern analysis."
"I wish it were laughable - it's not - but given the advantage of scale and preparation, the Russians look like a pack of bubbling fools.

Fools, but malicious fools who will always be remembered for their vile acts."

"Drove around Brno in Czechoslovakia for an extra hour back in 1991 due to the deliberately misleading paper maps the Russians had insisted on distributing.

"He never said Russia won't win. And there is no ""win"" for them. They lost 10,000 troops in 10 days and hundreds of armored vehicles. Their economy is permanently damaged by sanctions and continues to be in freefall. They will undoubtedly face insurgency in Ukraine should they take it over. Russia has already lost more in Ukraine than what they could possibly ever gain"
They might still win...that's not the point and the even said that....try harder.
"Wendover... I'm a historian... How you're able to write a coherent display of the developments of this last week is beyond me, and this video will truly be a treasure for generations to come and the history of Europe in general. Remember this gentlemen: in the past we needed decades of research to create  coherent and correct narratives of battles in the second world war. Now, we only need the internet and Wendover to make it comprehensive. Seriously, never before have we been able to produce a historically correct narrative of a war this fast, this is a first for historiography and Wendover should truly be considered one of the greats for producing this video merely a week since the start of this conflict! Gods work, and a pride of humankind!"

"The US having so many military bases around the world to resupply in case of a war doesn’t make them look capable, in fact, it makes them worse than Russia by actually occupying all these foreign lands that don’t belong to the Us"
"Found another person who has no idea how US foreign bases are set up and founded.

Those bases largely exist because the country they reside in _want_ those bases there, you dolt. Japan _wants_ a US military presence somewhere in Japan to protect against China, Poland _wants_ US military bases to ward off Russia, etc. etc. etc. The list goes on for many different countries. 

Add onto this the fact that NATO heavily relies on the US for all military matters, it only makes sense for the US to have a huge presence in every country that heavily depends on them for military defense. 

Rarely, if ever, are they signs of occupations."
"Those bases are there due to bilateral treaties with sovereign countries, they’re not occupied"
the use of the railways just seems so slow though everyone else uses roads or in the case of the usa its navy
"Railways are easily one of, if not _the,_ fastest and most efficient overland bulk transport."

This video was more informative than literally any other news I've seen. Hopefully store owners have found ways to combat the looting.
@Tolmie I know it’s very sad honestly but I’m sick of these weirdos who are siding with Putin.
@Riioas their economy has never been good but at this point it's going to set them back decades and maybe even reinitiate bread lines in the country. They are done finished.
@Agent00F Chelsea Manning has come out and said that she's seen enough to determine that Russia is going to lose this war. I don't think Chelsea would say this unless she was absolutely certain.
"@Tolmie they are poor already, there dollar is what 40-60% less already 😂"
@Agent00F Putins taking the L and he’s ended everything his built up too lol. Sit down
"One has to feel very, very sorry for Ukraine and its people. A pawn between NATO (USA and UK tbh) and Russia! And fascinating information concerning the railways system. This is possibly one of the best things I've seen about this tragedy."
"Nazi Herr Hitler Putin.  
Starts WW III.
Because he wants to.
Communist Fascist.
No difference."
"At this rate. The books Red Storm Rising, and Team Yankee, should be rewrote to be the size of those old school Golden Books you first read at maybe age four or five.

Even if your 50% wrong, or even 75% off, they are just logistically screwed forever.

Last time a nation had to depend on mostly  railroads doing the bulk of the work was American Civil War in the early 1860's."
"Good video, but a clarification. Almost all militaries use *both* a ""push"" and ""pull"" system. The US pushes some supplies by a strict plan, and Russian units pull some supplies on a unplanned basis as needed. The difference is in the proportion and administrative methods between the two overarching methods. 

Also, while everything mentioned in the video is true, I feel the points mentioned still don't fully explain the debacle. I feel that corruption (commanders skimming supplies off the top to sell for example), plain old incompetence, and cronyism round out the reasons. While there's a lot to legitimately criticize about Soviet / Russian logistics doctrine, there's no fundamental reason it can't be made to work in conflict. It has plenty of times before. And with operations in Libya, Syria, Georgia, and the Ukraine since 2014, there's no reason they shouldn't have learned lessons to apply towards their supply system. When you put a bunch of sycophants in charge like Putin has, that trickles down to line leadership."
"@Fetty my whole point is via would either need to get a budget increase from Congress or skim money from somewhere else. I guess the only other option is illegally printing money.

My original post brought up possibility Ukraine aid money is skimmed to help Ukraine. That way if they get caught like Iran contra or fast and furious they can say congress somewhat approved."
"@Fetty shell companies are to launder money through. The money most come from somewhere.  Shell companies by definition produce little or no money.  

There is a budget for cia that congress must approve although there is little to no oversight. 

There is also companies that act as a facade for the cia allowing them to control the logistics of black ops without asking a company to cooperate. That ensures operational security and few people with need to know. These companies look like private industry corporations. They by no means produce the money to fund the operations they take out.  They likely don't make money ignoring the cost of black ops.

Most companies spend capital with goal of a return on investment. They spend capital with goal of executing black ops without scrutiny.  It's hard enough to make business that makes money when that's the goal.  When that is not even on this list of goals it would be substantially harder and just luck(because they aren't trying to make money)"
"@grantm 
Yeah I know all that. We were talking about the Russians, not American cargo being siphoned. America is is irresponsible with all of their foreign aid. We waste so much money and resources."
"@Ro Ems The issue of sending weapons to a war zone, and where they end up after the crisis is over, has been miscalculated repeatedly, at least since WWII. So many times the West has armed 'the enemy of our enemy' because they're useful in the short term, only to find it causes a new problem in the long term. Putting Javelins and Stingers in the hands of the Azov Battalion wouldn't seem to be a smartest idea, but you can bet that's what's happening."
Very informative. Thanks.

"The use of Thermobaric munitions should be considered WMD level. yes, ik the US has used the MOAB before, though it wasnt on civilian targets.

Great video. thanks!
it  seams that Russias army sucks
The MOST boring aspect of battle is the most important. Such a lesson for life
"Why the f did we allow Russia to

"When I was in the US army in the 70s we were taught 1, how to use a compass and rea a map and 2 the Russians don't trust their troops with that skill or information ."

Notice that there have been no T-90 tanks near any of the cities, Its 80% T-72 tanks from before 2012. Putin is using antiquated tactics."

When the Russian /rebel forces shot down  MH17 didn;t they declare war on the west then  ?
"Not a military expert but aren’t Russia’s real failures the fact the Ukrainians communication networks are still operational? one expect such army on day one completely devastate all means of communication, supply lines, fuel reserves, air defense including air force etc. Russia apparently thought it’s going to be a walk on the beach with no resistance."
"""superpower"""
Glory to Ukraine! Glory to her heroes!
Why didn't you talk about the azor battalion?
So Putin is accomplishing his goal by making his Russia like the Soviet Union. A failure.
Brilliant. Far more detail on what has been going on than any news service that I've seen. Amazing work.
"Well , still better than the US’s utter failure and embarrassment and defeat by a bunch of goat herders in Afghanistan"
Well they took over rhe country in 48 hours so.
What?
"Actual Opinion: President Trump's words
To:"" Putin if you touch Ukraine...
I will bomb Moscow"" 💣 😌 
This is the reason Putin
 did not go past Crimea. President Biden is weak physically and mentally...Putin seen this...and took advantage of it. Please wake up Mr Biden! Mr Zelinsky needs the USA's help! Democracy must conquer an evil dictator."
Trump is so catty! Talking behind everyone’s back like a school girl.
"Specialized logistics needs is why the US doesn't main MLRS systems, shells and smart ammunition and actual air superiority are always better..."
Even the west had logistical issues in the Iraq war
"Yes, but from different causes. The Russians can barely make headway into highly contested territory, and _still_ can't supply their military, even though it's moving very slowly.

The West, by contrast, suffered from logistical problems because they were doing _too_ well, plunging _too_ deep _too_ fast _too_ easily, faster than logistical units expected them to, which led to slow downs. 

Still a huge difference, one was suffering from incompetence, the other was suffering from success."

When you fumble the bag so badly that the internet plane man needs to make a video explaining why.
"Oh my god, learn how to pronounce Kyiv properly (hint, it's not pronounced ""keeev""). How is it that you spend so much time and effort researching videos, yet can't be bothered to look up the proper pronounciation of city and country names?"

solid footage
"Pure propaganda , situation on ground is that russians are on verge of encircling bulk of Ukrainian forces."
"@Blunt Cabbagelol gulf war was against inferior foe. Here Ukraine is an ex Soviet state with quite modern and decent armour. Russian were trying to avoid civilian casualties first that's why you saw the slowdown not anymore , many Ukrainian cities will turn into grozny going forward, Ukraine is a done deal rest you can cope on twitter & other social media platforms about Ukraine beating Russians back. Meanwhile Ukrainian president has ran away to Poland."
"Not sure what you're getting at. The video was an assessment of embarrassing Russian logistics, not the war as a whole. The Russians are likely going to win, but they've humiliated themselves on every front in the process, no matter how victorious they may end up being."
"@DelitoArrow there is nothing biased here. this is war, you will see human, equipment losses, logistics problem etc....But you need to look at what's the situation on ground is.

"I've been to Russia back in 2007. I was just there not too long ago. The US is not so different from Russia. The people, at least. I noticed the exact same thing we have here. People living their lives just wondering what the fuck the government is doing haha."

"Not sure what you're getting at. The video was an assessment of embarrassing Russian logistics, not the war as a whole. The Russians are likely going to win, but they've humiliated themselves on every front in the process, no matter how victorious they may end up being."
"Perhaps, but Russia is not just steamrolling Ukraine like they were expecting."
"The Russian was very good in logistics in WW2. It surprised the Nazi german who thought that the Russian could not strike Warsaw because logistics problem.
But in 2022, it clearly shown that the Russian invading troops had logistics problem. So this is the prove that the Russian didn't really want to invade UKraine at first.
The fact is that it is impossible for the army  could move 10 millions troops in WW2 could not do good logistics for only 0.2 million troops in 2022."
The conflict between Ukraine and Russia has been going on for far longer than 8 years.
The entire world should have made sure that all of the Soviet rats were dead after the fall of the USSR.
The importance of logistics in all warfare cannot be taken lightly.... an invading army marches on its stomach... An invading army is only as good as its logistics supply capability... an afterthought... could the Russians be shelling civilians n buildings to force them to vacate ASAP so the Russian army can come in and help themselves to the food and fuel resources left behind when civilians hastily vacate the cities...🤔
"US and NATO is just prolonging Ukraine's death and suffering of civilians. They act like they're helping but just adding more fuel to the fire in reality.

Unfortunate sucker Ukraine, US is hyping it up from the back and selling weapons to scaredy cat NATO $$$ while sending fake prayers and sympathy

Naive Ukraine takes a BIG L on this one."
I know how Putin feels … it’s like playing Risk and the player you are attacking kept throwing double 6s.
The music sounds like Factorio music.

didnt work what so ever"
Very well written. I learned so much about this conflict. I now understand it better.
"You know that The Polish used to broadcast The Bible on russian comunications 24/7 during 1920 Polish-Bolshewik war? Same disruption tactics worked 102 years later lol, look who never learned"
Can you do a video on the state sponsored Nazi units I Ukraine and show footage of Ukrainian soldiers bashing Indian nation and students?
Thank You!
Maybe their is a good reason they aren't but why isn't Ukraine sending small handful of men sneaking into Russia and cutting rail lines so easy to do they can't defend such a huge area and would cripple their war effort.
literally logistical importance was figured out centuries ago. ceasar wrote about it while he conquered peoples that look like me :D
"Well, Putin needs to change his division template. Btw, who wants war? So I don't really care who win or lose(cuz in the end, there's no winner), but what I do care is the outcome/aftermath of it."
Russia - Scuffed North Korea.
Keep in mind that Iraq that have approximently the same amount of people as Ukraine took for the US about 30 days. So pls I know we all like Ukraine but underestimate the russians is bad. Also the Russian tactics are very different compared to american.
"the puppet government is the one that's in Kyiv at the moment, since 2014"

Is this Palestine topic somehow relevant to this whole thing?

I keep seeing you in this comment section and stop with support for an invading country.
"Honestly, it sounds a bit like how america invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, even calling it liberation, something it isn't. America used its vast naval and air power to supply and transport their military."
Did I just see the rebel flag in Russia?
🤔👍👍
Send vacuum bombs to Ukraine. That should end it.
Very well put together and articulate.

Great video! Keep up the amazing work.
Food fuel ....logistics
It’s only the second week of the conflict and people already making conclusions. Russians took from the Spring of 1942 to the winter of 1943 to take back Ukraine from Nazis.
Seems Russian military is built for Defence.  Not a bad thing for everyone.
…
Impressive work.

I knew Sam would be doing ssomething on the logistics of the Ukrainian war.
Easy to say all of this with zero competition because they are censoring any pro Russian news. At the end of the day fuck nato and fuck zelinski.
the west will pay the price for disrespecting russia.
I didn’t know the UN charter had an exception to Article 2(4) that makes the use of force legal whenever you feel “disrespected.” Can you cite where that exception is?
"I like how he said ""the comments section is likely not representative of actual opinions"" yet I can't find hardly any trolling or pro Russia comments anywhere. most are just ""good video!"" related lol."
"16:05 I think you're wrong here. The vast majority of the Russian army in Ukraine are conscripts who weren't even ready for this conflict. It's been widely reported that they were told they were there on military exercises but were then sent in to Ukraine.

Putin knows the world is watching via high resolution satellites so he doesn't want to expose Ukraine's regular forces to scrutiny. 

He obviously has objectives but on the periphery, all these ""mistakes"" being made can be used to correct future problems with logistics and ensure a more productive conscript army."
"I am assuming there is more than one objective, in the Donbass separatist move for massive conscription, weird since they were expecting Russia help, now we know the Donbass barely has a presence, in fact Ukrainians took back a town lost in 2014 there. In the North is were most Ukrainian forces are so no surprise. But in the south that is forces from the Russia Southern military district and they appear to be much more professional an cohesive, probably the logistic issue is eased by shiping in the Azov and Black sea."
"Not enough info to state for sure, but going by the units of Russian soldiers who got captured there are plenty of ""elite"" troops deployed and who failed."
"Excellent video. The Dictator Putin has lost his mind and he must be stopped. Hopefully he will defeat himself. Logistics seem vital. In WW2 Hitler’s army failed in their logistics. The free Wester countries need to get ready to fight Putin. As his armies get more frustrated they will commit more War Crimes, kill more innocent people, commit more atrocities and engage in genocide. We will see a lot of it and will eventually say that we are fed up and we’re going to stop Putin at whatever cost. May Putin come to his senses and go home."
"Remember Russia took Crimea(Obama) and went to war with Ukraine(Biden) while two democrats were in office, but not while Trump was in office. The democrat leadership is weak."
@fox23vaj oh (to the obama/biden thing)
"@DelitoArrow Its never been proven, its just unverified rumors."
I think there are some pretty massive logical leaps to get from Crimea to Obama and from Ukraine to Biden. Care to give your logic?
"Thousands of years of Military history.

Russia: Learning is hard.

The Russian military is powerful... Yes, that is true. Are they an effective military? That seems to become less and less as they show the world how they operate."
"It's all fine and dandy, but Ukraine is Apollo Creed and Russia is obviously Ivan Drago. But better to put up a fight versus just laying down! Good luck."
"Its funny never mentioned how the current Government is a ""puppet Government"" of the West. Biden's bribes and etc etc etc oh and the Nazi infiltration thru out  Ukraine."
NoLongeraTheory can you supply a verified and unbiased source backing your claims?
None of those non sequiturs justify the use of force which is a jus cogens violation of international law
"Does anyone really fall for this naive explanation of what’s happening. Do you really believe Russians expected to conquer Kiev in two days. Jesus, West is really in cognitive dissonance with itself."
"It’s not that Russia expected to take Kiev that fast, but it’s due to the current failings in some objectives which has shown some incompetence in Russian logistics."
Excellent
"Thanks that was very interesting, good job."
"I dont support what russia is doing in Ukraine. But there is a reason for why Russia is doing it which I think a lot of people, especially white girls, are missing is that Russia has a big population but most of its territory is covered in snow or doesnt have the right temperatures to grow agriculture or cattle. Ok so why dont just but from Europe. Russia was doing this but Europe imposed a blockade on Russia and the USA said that whoever exported to Russia could not export to the USA. So you have a big population and cant buy food or grow it, so what do you do, invade. Again I dont support this but it is also important to know every factor before jumping to conclusions"
"Best video, best timing. Watch and learn Ural monkeys ☝️🏼😌"
Its called the Javelin
Yeah dude keep telling you those lies at the end of the day Russia is Winning and zelensky is just a neonazi waiting it's judgement
All this 'analysis' is unverified. Guesswork by people who think they are providing a new and fresh viewpoint. Spare me the ramblings of these armchair generals who have never carried a gun in anger.
"I don’t understand. The Russian army has the Ukrainian army in a pot, just like a tortoise in a pot! I’m not speaking about the humanitarian catastrophe because that is a sad and horrible fact in any war. I’m making a point only on military tactics. So, the Russian military may (1) crack the shell of the tortoise (2) pour hot water in the pot, wait for the head and legs to stick out and chop it off (3) put the pot on a stove and control the heat (4) leave it in the pot and wait, feeding it with a lettuce leaf once a month(6) sell the tortoise to the West and see it chopped up and stewed. Whatever, and unfortunately, regretfully and with a heavy heart, the end is a forgone conclusion. It is highly irresponsible to encourage civilian bravado and heroism. That is highly admirable and respected but does not square with reality."
"When you break the logistics chain it has a domino effect as far as actual combat effectiveness., this is something the Talking Heads of the media don't seem to understand. It is no longer just about killing the head of the snake you can do even more damage eliminating what's behind it... In other words when you suppress the logistic activity of a force that unit becomes less effective. "" You can't fight without ammo, fuel, parts, people. And the Ukrainian military knows this, remember the Russian military right now is fighting on territory that isn't theirs they don't know the roads, rail system and infrastructure as well as the people defending it."" If you think the supply chain problems here were bad. Just consider if you will all the potential problems for a military force basically trying to move supplies from point A to point B in an area they don't know well under combat conditions., where not only do they have to worry about active-duty forces shooting at them but also reserve and civilian defense teams that know the people and know the terrain as well"
Youtube's guidelines are censorship. Just like what Putin is doing.
Very good analysis - I have to disagree that Russia could lay pipelines and rail into Ukraine. That will prove impossible with any local opposition.
"So, the Russians are not good at invading other countries. Who would have thought that they were not going to be as “good” as the Americans? 😒"

War is such a boomer thing to do....
So the key is to destroy as Many Russian supply trucks as possible. The Russian Supply lines aren't even really stretched out yet. Wait until they become hundreds of miles long with Ukrainian Commandos all over the place.
"Imagine being the biggest, most threatening country in the world and still not knowing the importance of logistics"
People dont know. But the railways in Ukraine and Belarus are Russiam
"@David Davidson lmao. You know nothing. The size of the rail matters for that . They are russian railways . Not soviet. An inch wider . And the appraisal  of haz prom assets  in those countries are higher , than their own economy ."
"No, they are soviet and they were built by Ukrainans and Belarusians."

wow dude you changed my mind a bit more on Russia. seeing that guy on his balcony assessing the damage on his home broke my heart.
"If the logistics are known to be so poor why are we backing off. Putin has 75% of his available forces concentrated on Ukraine, why allow him time to improve the situation. Maybe sanctions will make it worse. But maybe we are missing a vital opportunity to almost literally nip him in the bud. he will correct these error and become even more dangerous. Sadly the west knows he does not currently have the logistics to invade Nato countries so instead of capitalising on the situation we are backing off."
"@steven johnstone ""MAD is being weakly articulated. He hasn't got his finger on the button. Only people like you say he has, without any evidence."" Good troll. It's hard to do over text, but I think I got it."
Mutually Assured Destruction worked in the past why not now? We are not being strong enough in articulating our messaging in this regard. Putin sees weakness and hesitation and so do I.
"The nuclear deterrent means that no matter how weak Russia is militarily, no one can invade. Russia can only be dismantled from within."
"Russians and Americans couldn't contain Afghanistan yet the Russians think they can contain Ukraine  💀💀💀
Even if they capture cities once they face the insurgency they will regret it 💀💀"
"Now do a video on Russia's failure to conduct a proper air war, failure at cyber warfare, and failure at electronic warfare. Because in the western militaries we have been assuming that they would put up a massive fight in each of those categories to the point we could expect not to enjoy a wide variety of our capabilities due to denial and degradation... but they can't even manage that against Ukraine. In short we are pleasantly confused."

Putin should’ve had some skill share subscriptions
"Soldiers win battles, logistics wins wars."
"Putin said the sanctions are a declaration of war then Putin let’s have a war. If I was Biden I know we have at least 4,000 ICBM’s . I would order the military to launch all of them straight at Moscow. Hit Russia and Moscow with everything we’ve got. Putin promised that if any other country intervened he would unleash destruction like the world has ever seen. Does Putin think he is the only one who can unleash that destruction on other countries? We need to show Putin he is not the only one but we can too and hit Russia with everything we’ve got and wipe out all of Russia with nuclear weapons and kill Putin and every single person in Russia. Putin threatens us with destruction then let’s give him World War III right now. If all NATO countries and the United States hit Russia with every nuclear weapon they have all at once Putin and Russia can’t take out the rest of the world if we all strike him at once and wipe him out."

The Ukrainians have captured a lot of Russian plans and they all say they will start fighting in the capital on the 15th day of conflict, the West thought 3 day's to win which is not the first or last time they will be wrong, oftern the experts get it wrong consistently in war because there experts of the last war and or old tactics.

This is western propaganda vidéo. No country on this earth has sent 65 km long convoy of military to another country. Plus they did not have fuel posts in between 250 km travel. So they had to take the beeak ans refuel. Plus 60 trucks have food. Give me the break.

Not sure what point you're trying to make.

Russia are cowards... they show no flags on any of their vehicles ... just a Z.
"That is an important point. Logistics is how you can have a fighting force in the first place.

The well known fact that Russian soldiers were looting stores for food says everything. When your troops are stealing food... thats a massive sign that your troops are severely undersupplied and have almost no combat effectiveness.

""An army cannot fight on an empty stomach""

A war, when boiled down, is a fight between economies. Given how the leadership in Russia has gutted the economic potential of the country, Russia really doesnt have much power."
Thank you for this episode!

"I am 26 year vet spent many years middle east and  europe

"lol @ ""The Russians never had it"""
"I love how we're all pretending that Ukraine was a stable western democracy that Putin invaded out of nowhere and for no reason. Ukraine, obviously, was a barely cohesive pseudo-democracy heavily infiltrated by west-sponsored neo-Nazi groups, and for the past decade Putin has been saying the Russian Federation would not tolerate NATO membership for Ukraine. When the Soviet Union relinquished East Germany, the agreement was that NATO would not expand toward Russia's borders. That agreement has been broken over and over again. So let's be real here. Anyone paying attention saw this invasion coming from a mile away, and the Ukrainian people have the West, NATO, and their own president to blame for this ongoing human tragedy."

Kharkov & Kiev
Check out the base in Belarus near the Suwalski gap. Obviously Putin has wider intentions than Ukraine.
"First of all, Russian intrusion in Ukraine was improvised in the spur of the moment. No one really saw it coming. All the western hysteria about ""coming Russians"" was simply a cover for upcoming Ukrainian operation in Donbass. But Russia, as Bismarck used to say ""for any smart move you make, Russians will retaliate by doing something incredibly stupid and win"".
First echelon of Russians was only 50,000 troops securing safe bridgeheads for major forces to arrive. DONE in 60 seconds.
Initial task force was a collection of mobile units across Russia which previously had no shared chain of command.
Now we are talking network centric warfare, practically armies guided by Skynet. Putin's skynet. There could be glitches. I admit. 
but It all worked like magic in the beginning.
As it was mentioned Russian Army can build fuel pipelines extremely fast. They had been doing it since WW2... Soviet WW2 logistics were advancing to Berlin at the very same rate Red Army was.. and beginning late 1943 it was not a slow advance 20-50 kms per day. Soviet railroads arrived to Berlin, and Volga flotilla charge right in the centre of Berlin causing shock among the Germans. 

Logistical problems of Russian Army could be a speculation... what prevents Russian army lay a fuel pipe along the very road they are moving. 
There maybe setbacks... but only because Russia is trying many new ideas, all at once and doesn't make it too easy on themselves, which were never tested before, and pretty much they are working OK. Like B- maybe. 

Russian Army isn't losing their heads. When they slow down, ceasefire and start the talks, fully confident that Ukrainian side will sabotage them anyway allowing Russia to accumulate political points and concentrate firepower.

(Let's not speculate on the civilian. in the history of any large scale operation in rural and urban areas this is the easiest on the civiians. The real danger comes from doomed Ukrainian soldiers taking it out on the civilans."
"Russia's invasion of Ukraine was not spur of the moment. Putin has been threatening for over a decade to retaliate against Ukraine, there's been a war going on since 2014 and they've been amassing troops and munitions for months. I agree with most of what else you said except you then say ""let's not speculate on the civilians."" and then you yourself speculate and say that the Ukrainian soldiers are going to take out their aggression on civilians. Showing what side you stand for."
"Everything that's russian has failed. Equipment, soldiers, negotiations, Communications, planning, etc. Not the fearsome military that everyone says they are."
"When the news started appeared, I found it hard to accept that Russian forces behaving like in chaos. My mind is like ""dafuq bro, how can you not think of this and that..."". Some people even argued about why this happened, but they never said about logistics. Then this video was uploaded and it started to make little sense on what has been happening on Russian forces."

"Wow, amazing video! ✌🏿☮👏🏿"
"Failing ,was to prevent this war."
The logistics was why I didn't think the invasion was going to happen tbh
"This was the best explanation and articulation of how the, outnumbered, outgunned and the all around underdogs that are the Ukrainian people, are pulling off this miracle final stand, against Russia and holding their own very well.
And for the longest, I couldn't understand how Ukraine wasn't just crushed and railroaded right away. A country lead by an actor. But Ukraine and its people have atleast 2 things Russia lacks severely.  1. 1.The Brains to use home court advantages to their benefit, right away.
2. They have more heart and more love for there country then Russia.( even a bunch of Americans)  
I hope Ukraine wins this. And becomes even stronger and more powerful"
"Russia is in no way having troubles with this war!
The ""looting"" is a scorched earth tactic they are taking away all supplies in the area it saves them on logistics and forces the enemy to use military and civilian logistics. It forces the enemy to use all sources of resources! Its supply and demand if the russian army uses Ukraine supplies it makes general demand harder for Ukraine to meet"

"Napoleon said that ""armies march on their stomachs"" in reference to his crippling loss invading Russia in the early 1800s. It seems that Russia has no idea how to move on it's own stomach, the moment it leaves it's own borders.

But looking back on history and most conflicts involving Russia, they've always took a reactionary defensive stance, letting their land and winters defeat the invaders while the Russians themselves either deal killing blows or push them back across the borders. Their only advantages were the sheer amounts of manpower, landmass and raw resources at their disposal and little else."

"Good use of the cream of Ukrainian propaganda.   There's little issue with logistics.  Russia simply doesn't give a shit about conscript grunts, sadly.

"The video is presenting Russian strategy to look like a failed German blitzkrieg, and it seems they're doing precisely the opposite of that. Why would you want to decisively engage the Ukranian army when you want to subsume its soldiers into the army of your puppet regime? It just seems like they're encircling the major cities and waiting for the local governments to turn over the keys. Just my two cents."
"Well, talking from a belarusian point, would say that this video is a pretty good estimate on what has happened. Haven’t seen around russian speaking internet someone dwelling on the war with this precision and detailing concerning  technical aspects. Thank you!"
NEVER underestimate HEART.
The NWO evil is dug in deep. The news is fake the war against evil is real.
"Russia didn't fail at all because it wasn't trying to pave Ukraine and take it over like the US would have done.  It placed strategic strikes on military targets and (what very well seem to be) US owned bioweapon labs along the Russian border.  From what I've heard, nearly all of the skirmishes the Russian military has had were with literal Nazi groups such as the Asov Battalion, which have infiltrated the Ukrainian military and are encintivizing civilians to be meat shields instead of just let Russian troops go by without a fight.

Ukraine is also the EU's capital of human, organ, weapon, and God knows what other kinds of trafficking.  Since crime operations such as those operate underground via tunnels, Russia probably sent special operations to raid some of those tunnels, which would be a good explanations as to why Russia hasn't talked about it (just like any other country wouldn't).  The media who hates independent thinkers who ask questions, like you, will absolutely never ask or talk about Russian saving children and innocent biolab test subjects because it would make Russia look instantly like the good guys, and everyone around the world would finally realize they're being lied to and start having mental breakdowns.

Also, Russia also blew up a dam Ukraine put up to restrict water to Crimea, which caused severe droughts and killed thousands of Crimeans.  As a quick side note, intentionally restricting essential aid like food and water to civilians is internationally recognized as a war crime, yet Ukraine was never punished for this until now.

At the end of the day, you and I can analyze this conflict as much as we want through are limited and vastly differing perspectives.  But at the end of the day, (1) all politicians are liars and (2) the actual truth about whatever is going on in the world is buried so deep we will probably never know what was said behind closed doors."
"Human trafficking in Ukraine, Moldova, Romania is the worst (Latvia is out of this list, now they prefer online casino schemes). People usually call trafficked women ""Russian mail order brides"", whilst in actuality they come from aforementioned countries, they are just Russian-speaking. Turkish and Bulgarian mafia are behind majority of human and drug trafficking. 

US' religious sects like Mormons used to bring women and change their names to genetic American names, like Stacy, Nancy etc — and marry them out to their men. There even was a site for Mormon swingers, where they exchanged their wives. This site was attacked by anonymous and data leaked (in what like 2018?).

I'm actually quite tired of the rest of the world turning a blind eye to all these atrocities."
"Russia thought this was an easy skirmish. They have since showed up with undertrained personnel, Outdated hardware and equipment. Lacking forethought, planning and reserves. For an already broken economy, what did they expect?"
"@jhdg It's been almost 2 weeks, why haven't they surrendered yet, Colonel Commenter ?"
@NorsemanMariupol Kherson  kharkiv Zaporozhia mykolaiv what's left...Kiev Odessa and lviv. Another few days and game over.
"@chrishnaa lol...so true. Americans fight stupid wars and lose. Russia fights strategic wars. No chance Ukraine joins NATO, joins eu or has a military. That European dream will be crushed."
"@Shupek oh see I figured that's something you'd say about the country that spent 20 years trying to ""democratize"" Afghanistan & Iraq, (countries that had nothing to do with 9/11) all while going 20 trillion in debt and only to have the Taliban take over 2 days after they left. Yeah, that's embarassing."
Poor strategist
"Just because a military is looting, does not mean they have no supplies. If you take over a city that has lots of perfectly nice supplies, take them... The only reason you wouldn't is if they were poisoned, which would be a huge war crime from Ukraine. People are just posting on their social media (often twitter) pretending like they're experts"
Dude just make one video where you dont care about advertisers nebula is cool and all but you wont go bankrupt from making 1 video where you cover important topics without worrying about stepping on ad money toes. It was still very informative so thx anyways
Brilliant!

So the Russia logistics are made to defend while the US logistics are build to atack. Interesting...
Skimmed over the AZOV BATTALION DID WE?
Russias current strategy is brilliant! They dont want to destroy Ukraine! This is reminiscent of when russia blitzed the nazis
"What do you know, Wendover deletes comments if they don't line up with his narrative.. that's ok, he's pronouncing it *""Keev""* so you *KNOW* he's woke. His past video he's says *""Kiev.""* I wonder if that makes him racist or just dumb."

"Hi Sam, love all your videos. Please get a Nebula app for the LGTV so I can watch Nebula while jogging! Thanks."
"Wait, so all the stupid covid restrinctions wherent cus ""we have to save lives"".... Gues...."
"The quality of this video surpasses any news agency or TV network I have ever watched.
I would put you in charge of information dispersal if it was up to me."
speaking of logistics. the us's merchant navy is pathetically lacking compared to china and would not be able to supply a base taiwan if it wanted to.
The statement that Russian soldiers wouldn't have knowledge of Ukrainian streets and they're using paper maps for navigation is absolutely hilarious.  How your editor let that bullshit slide into this video is embarrassing.
"There is no russian word for ""logistics "".🤣"
how do you even begin to repair the damage after this war is over? That would make a good logistics video
Someone thats never been elected should never have the power to make such decisions
"This was so informative. It explains why the Ukrainian armed forces was kicking so
much tail during the first 3-4 days. I’m hoping the west will be able to supply the weapons and intel that they need to survive this conflict"
LOL they are not surviving march
@Gritty Chops there’s no room for cowardice. Especially when staring down the barrel of a gun. You should take some time to read about what Joseph Stalin did to the Ukrainian population and you might see this from a Ukrainian perspective.
"@Gritty Chops there are already nato countries at border with russia that are much closer to moscow and st petersburg then any part of ukraine is. And they have 0 nuclear weapons in them. Besides, this isn't the cuban missile crisis anymore, you don't need forward deployed nuclear weapons anymore, ICBMs exist. This is imperialism, plain and simple"
"Russia is winning,  their whole plan is to take out Ukraine  bio labs, funded by USA."
If that was the case why are they still there?
You pronounced Kyiv worn the entire video
God b wit Ukraine 🙏
Power to Ukraine 🇺🇦 let this be the biggest mistake by an autocrat. All this is a master plan to weaken Russian military. Guerilla war will suck the life out of Russia.
Pootis
"Vlad wasn't using full force and still isn't. He wanted it to be kept to a minimum, but it ain't working that well."
What an outstandin presentation. Thank you for making efforts to present this to us. Thank you.
Posts urging a focus on fuel trucks were circulated during the build up.
"It did in WW2 also , until the United States  sent them thousands of trucks"
This war is like the famous battle in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms in China. The egomaniacal warlord Cao Cao (Putin) vs skilled strategists like Zhuge Liang (Ukraine and the World).
Basically it's an invasion on a budget 😂
This is gonna be another 10 to 20 year war.
I'm glad you kept the humor out of a serious situation.
Wendover Productions is always the serious type. It is Half as Interesting which uses jokes.
"The cauldron in the east is completely surrounded. 12 brigades of Ukraine military are cut off from all supplies, no food, fuel, ammunition, medical supplies. Exactly how did Russia fail? You are comparing Russian military tactics to Western military tactics."
"The only way to reverse the strategy of the war in Ukraine is to do the following:
NATO should confiscate all the oligarchs' wealth and convert it into hard cash 
and then hire ex-war veterans (including fighter pilots)from all countries who 
need money (some love adventure), pay them handsomely and deploy them with high tech 
weapons to war-torn Ukraine. I would dare say NATO could easily amassed half a million 
hardened battle ready troops for action in Ukraine and send the Russians packing home.

Another way to end this war immediately is to eliminate Putin same goes for emperor Xi
before he starts one in the far east over Taiwan."
"I remember it was USA with Britain and several European countries ; and it took one month to occupy Iraq,
This war is only 10 days .
Trust me Russi will occupy whole Ukraine less than a month .
Biden handed Ukrain to Putin ."
Most overhyped 'modern' military ever. I would be surprised if their old Soviet nukes still work.
"I'm curious, how do you know that Russian troops relied on paper maps? Or that they use analog radio transmission? I guess me asking simple questions makes me a Russian disinfo agent?"
If I'm a smart strategist for Russia. I would pay things like this analysis and let new conscripts loot on videos to show that Russian army is failing and weak. To let the enemy's guard down. While the main army where the veterans and well trained soldiers are organizing and building supply lines and securing key points to set up forward bases for artillery.
"4:20 YELNYA is sooooo far from the border...are you kidding me, !!!"
"""it all happened so quickly"".what a load of crap,how long has the world been hearing about the medias push for war with Russia.Wendover is no better than the bloody main stream media,wanna be msm you are wendover.keep pushing bullshit agendas on the sheep of the world."
cope
"Granted Russia may have under estimated the Ukraine resistance to their invasion, but don’t under estimate what Russia is capable of in the long term. I have no dog in this fight. I hope all innocent people get to safety ASAP. War is never a good thing."
"Ok, so as a Ukranian, at first I thought this wouldn't be very informative, since I would have known better, but it's actually very informative, though I have to ask you to put it down, while the war is going on, because it teaches the enemies of my country how to get stronger."
Amateur military historians talk strategy and tactics professionals talk logistics !
"I signed up for curiositystreal. That place is INCOMPREHENSIBLE. How do you find Wendover videos there, or any specific creator for tht matter?"
PUTIN AND THE ENTIRE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ARE THUGS AND WAR CRIMINALS.   THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT PUTIN ARE NO LESS GUILTY OF THESE CRIMES JUST AS THE GERMAN PEOPLE WHO BLINDLY AND ADORINGLY SUPPORTED ADOLF HITLER.   THERE IS NO PURGATORY FOR WAR CRIMINALS!!!
"Ukraine basically let them in, shut the cage, and went ""let's go, bitch!"""
Russia didn’t fail. They’re on their way to accomplishing their missions. This is just another left wing propaganda video
How the fuck is this left wing?
What a presentation
"U.S propaganda reached even this channel.
I didn't expected this.
The fact that Russia isn't making linear progress, continuously, non stop for the time being, doesn't mean there's a logistics problem.
There have been several cease fire and pause for negotiations since the attacks began.
That's all is stopping Russia from advancing. And cutting the Ukrainian army in Donbas from the capital is a 1st of 2 steps strategy. After it is done. The russian army needs to wait until the Ukrainian army realizes they need to surrender or face obliteration."
This is quite impressive propaganda. Nonetheless it is still propaganda and anybody who cares to sit back and think about it will  of course understand that.
This video is gonna age poorly
But isn't this an opportunity for Russia to learn how to counter their weakness? Careful.
omg.... they didn't have much gps in vehicles?
“The Autocrat of Russia” - Bravo for using the appropriate language.
Totally disagree. Red army is encircling the major cities and after that from the distance of 20kms their artillery will start shelling cities and after that ground troops will begin clearance operation. Documents taken from captured Russian officer also shows that they are already ahead of their plan. Actually your narrative is being build by only the western mainstream media because you are not seeing a Russian soldiers with mobile and recording destroyed Ukrainian weapons or casualties. Red army is likely to take more casualties in war and that's how they work and if you think it effects their plans not at all.
Nice job... thank you.
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
"Logistics has nothing to do with it, Putin is hunting for specific game (deep state globalists) who American politicians were profiting from the corruption in Ukraine, like the Biden crime family (quid pro Joe abd crackhead hunter abd the big guy, Clinton crime family foundation and others. Hopefully, the media is next, scumbag liars"
I think putin sent in the lowest rank ppl in first that's why there getting lost running out of food ect.  then have the best rank come in after for the clean up. Idk
Blah blah
Amazing work! Thank you for your insight
About 1% of russias capabilities are in Ukraine right now and they are winning. This is why NATO wont touch it
"Fun fact: sharing this video in Russia may be considered a criminial act, discrediting russian army, and you can get a real jail sentence up to 15 years."
Classic Soviet. Shooting their own foot.
Really every single comment is so one sided its not even believable what are the odds that no one not even trolls with opposing opinions appear in this comment section its blatant FAKE NEWS !
Plot twist : it's all a deception

"The logistics implemented Blitzkrieg in my opinion is still effective.

I am not favor in war by the way."
"Nothing in actual reality though indicates any failure.. Those ""failure"" claimes are all based on western war propaganda."
Russian life is cheap. Putin sends in these soldiers to die and he doesn't care
"it's over guys, Russia will win in a week"
Im not a General but expecting the enemy not to fight seems to be a questionable strategy.
"Logistics my eye.
Russian military equipment is crap.  It always has been.
Furthermore,  I dont think their nuclear capabilities are what they claim to be.
I think we could easily win a nuclear conflict with them."
Unencrypted walkie-talkies? What year is that equipment from? USSR era?
@Lachlan Geier I just didn’t think they would be using 30+ year old radios.
"Your joking but yeah, a lot of it is"
"This invasion sounds so amateurish. I expected better from Putin, he doesn't seem to realize it's the 21st century."
"The world needs to conduct a ""special operation"" hunting for Putin's head, and other body parts."
"Thank you for such a good video. 

Just an FYI for anyone wondering, this is not the first time Russia has attempted to subjugate Ukraine. They have done this since the 1700s. For example, they starved and killed 4 milllion of them in the 30s, now known as Holodomor. They've taken land from us. Theyve attacked our culture in attempt to erase our identity and make it more Russian. I hope we can finally break free of this eternal nightmare. 

(Also its not pronounced Kiv, but more like Kiyiv)"
If your going to invade a country dont let them prepare for war for 8 years
"Absolute rubbish. Shills. Russia doesn't conduct war operations like the fucktards in the West, ref the recent operations in Syria and the way they operated, see the same pattern in The Ukraine. The EU will be welcoming some very nice people in the near future as they ""leg it"" west."
You mean heavy losses against a less equipped enemy? Because yeah that's definitely what we are seeing
thank you so much for this great meaningful video analysis.
It didn't fail. Just didn't have it 😂
May Ukraine Javelins find a target on every armored Russian combat vehicle
"It's pronounced ""KEE-eff"" bro"
"I don’t think that’s right, with an F?"
Excellent Breakdown 👌
When an infantry Soldier makes a mistake it can cost him or her their lives. When a logistics Soldier makes a mistake many lives are in jeopardy!! Lots of responsibility and pressure.
@joshua cox but still my point  stands  having literally 0 pace is just stupid just imagine what Russia could have done if this was executed better? There should be 0 reason for any of these mistakes  even if they win its gonna cost way my casualties than needed
"@A1 Marine in Normandy back up was coming…

Wait and see… for all the talk about them having a hard time they will end up with the whole tamale at the end…

Thinking that Ukraine could beat, or hold off the  Russian military is like a jr. High football team not getting embarrassed by the Rams.. or any other NFL team. 

The Jr. high team isn’t even on the same level"
@joshua cox ah yes going slow and giving more time fir the defenses to gett their offensive planned out pretty good idea if only the allies did this during Normandy
@A1 Marine I said the Russians were going slow to avoid casualties.
@joshua cox so that's an excuse to let the convoy get attacked and picked off one by one?
Long story short. Russian military leaders are incompetent.
"I think Russia will sort things out.  Unfortunately for the Ukrainians, they will not be able to take advantage of any Russian problems.   With time Russian logistics will improve and Ukraine's will deteriorate."
The Russians have reportedly been eating the peanuts and corn from their own poop to survive.
My birthday 🎂 is on the 24th of February
drama queen clickbaiter:)you sir get it all wrong but i guess americans like that so why not cash oni t:)
"In 1991, the stellar performance of the US military during Desert Storm precipitated the fall of the USSR. THIS operation is hardly shock & awe, it tells the world Russia is a paper tiger, and stands no chance against the US. All Putin has is his nukes. That is a substantial deterrent, but the oligarchs wont see it that way."
"How do you pronounce Paris, France?"
War sucks for all those involved as well as the ones who aren't. It's just a bunch of senseless violence.
"I doubt the logistic failed, to this day Russia manage to reach their objectivs which are secure a bridgehead to Kiev and major cities, surrounding the country 'orth east and south borders and disabling airfields and radar systems. I bet that fresh troops will be soon airlifted for the final assault on Kiev airlifted"
Well details analysis
Why do you need to tell this? Why are people supposed to know how to invade Ukraine?
"outstanding work, timely and well informed"
👍🇺🇸🇺🇦
It's amazing that Putin seemingly had no idea how much unity and hatred for Russia the Ukrainians would have.
"So that demonstrate how they could wipe the 80% of Ukraine but they don't.
There's more history to talk about Crimea and Donbass but whatever 🤦‍♂️"
Glory to Ukraine
"I’d love to laugh at Russia’s misfortunes from their unprovoked aggression, but sadly they have nuclear weapons."
"This is awesome, but it all means nothing if this is Russia's plan all along. If so I hope there is a Higher Power watching, cause we need it Now!"
"I'm so sick of everybody in the English speaking world calling it ""Kyiv"".  We have called it ""Kiev"" for fucking ever.  What is the odd obsession with trying to sound ""cultured"" in this fucking country.  It's so pathetic."
"@Crowne Productions No, sweetie, but I pay attention to how people prefer to refer to themselves. It's a shame you can't extend them the same respect and courtesy. Have a blessed day."
"Am I to presume that your name is pronounced “Crown” like the headwear and not Crone like an old witch despite having an e at the end? 

and you have a problem with what again?"
@Answer Man no to the first and yes to the 2nd. But what has that got to do with trying to sound more cultured by pronouncing Kiev as Kyiv (one syllable vs two)?
Are  you still pronouncing Beijing as Peking?  Or Mumbai as Bombay?
@BL2001 you’re the spokesman for how Ukrainian people want their capital pronounced by western English speaking countries?

Bible Verses For Believers To Pray.
Pray to the Creator of Life. 
Pray to the Adonai Elohim.
Call to Adonai Elohim to wipe away His enemies that have planned death and destruction
to the civilians of Ukraine. 
•	Pray to Adonai Elohim that He would intervene and Punish Russian Leadership and punish Russian President Putin. 
•	Pray to Adonai Elohim to bring Vladimir Putin to a swift end. Putin is causing death and destruction on earth. 
•	Vladimir Putin is violating the Holy Jewish Scriptures.
•	Vladimir Putin is violating the Instructions given by Elohim at Mount Sinai 3460 years ago.
•	Russian President Putin is a delusional leader gone rogue.  
•	Vladimir Putin is a diabolical deceiver of the Russian people.
•	Putin is not worthy of being a leader of a nation. 

Proverbs 21:27 ESV 
""The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent."" 
•	Vladimir Putin is inspired by the same satanic spirits active during the Soviet Union leader's era.
•	Vladimir Putin is corrupted by political and military power and greed for wealth.

Job 8:20 ESV 
""Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers"". 

•	Pray that Vladimir Putin will meet the same fate as the Nazi war criminals received in 1946 in Nuremberg International Tribunal. 
The best way to Pray to Adonai Elohim is the Pray the Jewish Holy Scriptures back to Adonai. 
Here are some scriptures to pray, meditate, and pray some more with other believers. 

Proverbs 6:16-19 ESV
""There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers."" 

Proverbs 12:19 ESV / 185 helpful votes
""Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue is but for a moment"".  

Exodus 23:1 ESV 
""You shall not spread a false report. You shall not join hands with a wicked man to be a malicious witness."" 
Proverbs 24:28 ESV 
""Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips"". 

Isaiah 40:8 ESV 
""The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever"". 

Leviticus 19:11 ESV 
""You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; you shall not lie to one another"". 

James 2:19 ESV 
""You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder!"" 

Adonai Elohim has promised in the Jewish Holy Scriptures that He will remove wickedness from the face of the earth.
Leaders of nations are blatantly arrogant, prideful, boastful atheists that refuse to accept the conditions spelled out in the Holy scriptures for the spirit of humankind to submit to the Wisdom of Adonai Elohim.

Proverbs 2:22  
""but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it""."
Why. Do you. Keep. Talking. Like this.
"We shall see as currently Russian troops have enveloped in depth the cities of Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Sumy, Konotop, Chernihiv, and the North and East and half of the West sides of Kiev. Southeast Ukrain expected to have fallen in the next three to five days as the defenders are low on ammo and cut off from resupply. Search YouTube for STALINGRAD on the Dnieper or The Duran for another look at what is happening in Ukraine from other sources that are not supporting a side. This video was excellent yet I feel it reflects more of what was rather than what is."
Putin is criminal!
"One of the claimed justifications for the invasion was the alleged deaths of Russian-ethnic Donbass citizens at the hands of Ukraine.  Now, any death is a tragedy, and I don't mean to reduce any loss to arithmetic. All these deaths were people- humans- with hopes and dreams- and left people behind devastated. But let's look at some numbers.

Today's (5mar22) Ta ss dotcom - the Russian news outlet- has an article today in which Putin claims that 13-14000 have been killed in Donbass since 2014. This is Putin's claim, I have no way of proving or disproving it. But let's take it at face value.  14,000. 8 years. That's about 1750 deaths a year. Again, each death is a tragedy.

In the week or so since the Russian invasion, there have been a lot of deaths. Reliable numbers are hard to come by, so again we'll use Russian numbers. Apparently there are no civilian deaths - oooooookay- but they acknowledged last week that 500 Russian soldiers have perished, and about 2800 Ukrainian soldiers. In a week. Again, I can't verify or disprove these numbers, these are the official Russian numbers. So let's say 3300. In a week. Annualized, thats 170,000 deaths per year. Even if we just count Russians (because Putin is obviously not concerned with Ukrainian deaths) 500 a week is 26,000 a year. Compared to the 1750 claimed in Donbass.

Now, I'm not saying you can extrapolate last weeks death toll out over a year and have a reliable figure - god knows I hope the math doesn't work out that way- but does anyone think this invasion is any sort of rational response?"
"What’s their supply truck manufacturing capacity? 
How likely it it they’ll produce enough to keep the war going?"
"Russia moved at the same pace as the US in Iraq. That's without carpet bombing the cities and help from fellow NATO allies. 

Russia is still at it. Russia can (and I believe will) still win."
mean while we transport logistic by a *5th GENERATION DONKEY* lol
Reported for fake news.
How
Prophetd of lies. CIA fundef network..
"The only question I have is why you didn't focus at all on the south, where they have sea lines of communication and are seeing more success. I agree the north is a clusterfruck."
Russian soldiers do NOT believe they are liberating Ukraine. They know they are killing innocents and they are okay with it. Do not support soldiers who choose country over conscience.
Russia is losing its war Russia is losing friends Russia is getting weaker and weaker Ukraine is teaching Russians a listen in war !!
"At this point, Russia is in too deep and they will level Ukraine to the ground like Syria rather than give up. I don't know what Ukraine hopes to gain from this keeping it up. At the end of the day, their people will suffer and the only ones gaining anything are American arm manufacturers who are all giddy at supplying weapons to the EU. The American propaganda machine is in full swing as well keeping everyone rooting for Ukraine but not actually doing anything that would change the situation. It's not like Russia would turn around now just cause sanctions. Sanctions have been pretty bad at stopping actual conflict, they only make the average citizens suffer. Neither Iran or North Korea or Venezuela capitulated after sanctions, their people live terrible lives but their regimes stands. 

EU is going to get a massive refugee crisis again. US will make money selling arms to the EU and have an excuse to pump more money into the military industrial complex. Ukraine is fucked. Russia is back into a corner with enough nukes to destroy the world. This whole situation is the dream of megalomaniacs."
@Majorohminus Tell that to the Afghans or the Iraqis or another oppressed people.
@BL2001 independence is pointless if your country is rubble
"Ukraine is fighting for its independence, Vladimir."
"Russia really is a third-world country, that is illiterate to an organization. The world now knows, they are just bullies, who are not very powerful as an army."
Logistics are just one of the failures I keep thinking he must have elite troops in reserve because what I'm seeing in the news are a train wreck
Kee-yiv
NATO should have never fingered Russia.  They have been trying to warn USA not to come to it's door step!
"this video reeks of PROPAGANDA. this is an ongoing situation, and this video portrays ukraine in an overwhelmingly positive light and suggesting that theyre winning the war when this isnt the case"
"@steve smithy it's one thing to identify the logistic issues, it's another to be able to fix them rapidly"
"@steve smithy Gotcha, so March 19 then, if they haven't taken it by then would you mind commenting again on a future date? Would like to have a written log for future reference, thx!"
"@BL2001 just think for two seconds. if this random youtuber could figure out and identify this problem, what makes you think all of the people in the Russian government made the same mistake? is the Russian government just so wholly incompetent that they can't into basic logistics? come on man"
"@Mazeot Higgenbottom 2 weeks at most. the russians are being careful to minimize civilian casualties as much as possible, so they are suffering losses because of this. with the rate things have been advancing, it doesnt look like ukraine will hold for much longer since NATO has made it clear that they arent going to intervene, and Ukraine doesnt have the military strength to fight Russia alone"
"I would speculate that when we see the Russian military in a hasty retreat... it's not because they are giving up, it will be because Putin has decided (he's insane!) to use tactical nuclear weapons. Do I think Putin would go there? Watch for it. If Russia (military) continues to look like the fools they are, then Putin will become ever more desperate (he already is by the way!) and unleash Hell. I do think Macron is right, sadly, the worst _is_ yet to come."
"@Lachlan Geier Sadly, the ""man"" doesn't care. Hopefully his fellow comrades do care."
If he did he knows nukes will make their way from all over the world
20 minutes of cope
I wonder if brushem work the same way that they did during WWII put ncos and officers in the back what machine guns enforce the troops to go forward or they will kill their own troops
Is this propaganda?
"This is not propaganda
Propaganda isolates the truth and criticizes and dehumanizes the enemy in a heavily opinionated way, the video is just displaying what is happening on the ground and the studies people have done and what the logistics of the Russian army
This channel proof reads and fact checks everything multiple times to make sure it tells the truth"
"Wendover here is presenting U.S. State Department talking points which is their right. It is my right to point out that there is another side oft this story and that this ""Failed Logistics"" narrative is wrong. I predict that this propaganda piece will not age well. Please keep it up and viewable on YouTube and don't be embarrassed in a year from now when the dust has settled."
"We’ve been getting a lot of these special military operations lately… Syria, Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Ukraine"

"People  have not even bothered to fight for their own Human Rights and Freedoms for more than 2 years,  and like hypocrites cry out for the Ukraine.. Maybe it's time for media and others to start talking about how the Peoples Party in Ukraine came to power in 1989 and its relationship to/with the rise of Neo-Nazi / Ultra-Nationalist Groups the likes of which have been named by others, such as;  Svoboda, Trident and Right Sector ..with all such movements in the current era apparently having their genesis with Ukrainian Nazis in WWII."
"seeing that i ask myself how germany managed to attack russia 80 years ago, as artillery still was pulled by horses, with 3,5 million soldjers. What was the biggest army ever in history and they attacked over a thousands of milles long front line and hundreds of times larger arreas as today and just in passing defeated several armies of 600-1000 k people in unbelivable big encycling battles over areas bigger than the hole ukraine . Its so dissapointing how uneffective everything has become although the technology got so unbelivable much better. It seems as if every modern stuff just doesnt work anymore. look at cars cars made by ford 100 years ago were cheaper than modern manufactured cars and they lived longer. Allthough our ability to produce technology increased extremely the stuff we produce overproportionally got more complex,  what makes all the stuff today ineffective and fragile. Even if every component has a 10 times higher duration and we can build them 10 times faster than in the past, if you have 100 times more components of something, it got 10 times more fragile and 10 times more expensive (oversimplificated of course). its a mess.. eitherway i am very happy to see russia in trouble of course"

"never thought i'd see tiktoks in a video like this. love your vids, seems like Russia's economy is destroyed now due to the war which is making Putin threaten nuculear war."
"The red army will take and hold the grounds they aim for, but are they willing to pay the cost? The Red army will be greatly degraded while the Russian people will feel the crush from sanctions at home. And then they have a long insurgency to look forward to. Ukranian and Russian people will suffer immeasurably. What happens when Ukrainians that have been labeled ""enemy combatants"" regroup in NATO territories? WW3."
The whole world stand with UKRAINE 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
"*I hope Russia isn't watching this for their future ""military exercises""*"
Wouldn't be surprised if their whole government was built off youtube tutorials
"Essentially, this war was poorly thought out by the Russians regarding supplies and now they're just saying striking civilians to cover up their failure. Real classy, Vladdy. You're a real strongman and everyone is in awe of your presence. /S"
"This is why it’s silly when people try to downplay the importance of Lend Lease to the USSR during WWII. Even disregarding the planes, tanks, and other weapons supplied to the Soviets, the real thing that made the most difference was the *300,000* trucks, largely Studebakers, the US sent. Those trucks were invaluable to the Soviet war effort, and those massive, brilliant offensives they pulled off against the Germans could not have been possible without the logistical support of those trucks."
"Propaganda run by west 😁😁 be seated and wait till Russia  win in Ukraine 😁.
We have seen how able usa & it,s nato allies are 😂😂 in afghanistan . usa can only save world in movies otherwise they are the reason why millions of people have abandon their homes . 
They advocate for peace & prosperity & till now only thing they are doing is sending weapons and adding fuel to already worst situation ( because they are making money ) & they are also searching market for their oil & gas 🤐 their is saying if you have a friend like The USA you don,t need an enemy ."

Have they really failed? 1 week and 1/5 of ukraine is under their control.
Land the was not being actively protected or where troops have retreated to more strategic places that are easier to hold.
They have achieved not a whole lot and have taken heavy losses
Yep... I have been eye-balling Russian rail roads for years. I used to ride freight trains all over the US and Mexico. For all you rail entusiasts... yes... yes Mexico by rail is an incredibly beautiful memory to take to the grave with you. -Q
"Bomb Russia's rail network, and will be disabled..."
I hope the Ukrainian people kick the Russians right in the caboose.
I'm still waiting for China to invade eastern Russia.
Excellent synopsis.
They're slow in replenishing their supply lines stuck and looting shops
Even during WW2 they barely had any domestic produced trucks. They were overwhelming reliant on US built trucks because their factories were mostly building tanks and artillery.
"Tbh, american half track and truck were far superior on their russian counterpart, and it was easier to send them in large number with lend lease, so that's logic that ussr would concentrate it's domestic production on tank and plane"
"Trucks in WW2 were majority foreign trucks, it was not overwhelming. I think it was about 60%. But that was more a factor of their truck building areas being lost fairly early in the war.

Radios were overwhelmingly foreign, but on trucks, it wasn't overwhelming."
"This is just... Not even wrong, just ignorant"
"😂😂😂 really?...the eastern Ukrainian army is fully encircled ,out of bullets,food,supplies.... FULL CONTROL OF THE SKIES belongs to Russia....Russians are repleneshing and reinforcing  logistics while hitting preplaned targets via air....just like Syria.  .After that ,another push......how old are you 5?"
@Lachlan Geier any ukrainian jets flying...if so ...where?if you reffering to the AA fire....full control iS not void of danger.  but full control THEY HAVE.
Russia most definitely does not have full control of the sky
"Yet the multiple pockets of encircles troops haven't been liquidated and are still able to attack Russian supply columns,

They have nowhere near full control of the skies either, with ukrainian SAM sites, infantry SAMs and aircraft still negating their limited air capabilities.

Russia isn't hitting preplanned targets, all they're doing is bombing houses and hitting empty fields, due to their lack of intelligence on key ukrainian military sites.

Their logistical supply is still a nightmare, with them having to use civilian trucks and ambulances to carry ammunition and fuel, they also haven't fixed their disastrously poor food situation"
Thank you ❤❤

Fascinating video as always Wendover Productions! Same primary reason Germany failed to take the USSR; overstretched supply lines.
Fantastic dude. I'm so glad you're here to bring the useful info
"It hasn't failed, he is just waiting for something. What is failing is anti Rusia propaganda."
Very good video.. thanks!
"If by ""western logistics"" he means - FedEx... Tom Clancy predicted it"
great video.  wow.
Your creative presenting of the data and knowledge about logistic never cease to amaze me. Amazing content
Great work on this video!
Lol all these western media how you’ll think you can better analyze a military operation is pitiful
You're small mind
Russian rail road is measured by bodies per kilometers of slave labor that died working on it from Stalin times .
"Why isn't NATO taking advantage of Russia's weakness. I presume from what you saying Russia should lose this war. You guys seem like you were a part of the planning of the invasion. Maybe what Ukraine is doing is allowing Russia to come in and feel they are winning when they destroy their cities, then the Ukrainians will trap them and destroy their army. 

Figure the best you can do is spread propaganda on the Russians whilst the Ukrainians are suffering from bombing. Hope Putin doesn't hear this and try to boost his ego, by trampling on the citizens and bombing the cities more to speed up the pace.
 I don't think Putin wants to grind his axe on the Ukrainians. His focus is on NATO and Zelensky who wants to bring in their missiles"
"This video is just sad. Once Russia get their pipelines laid and no longer have to rely on taker trucks, Ukraine is fucked. 
As much as I admire Ukraine's fighting spirit, they simply don't have enough men and supplies to sustain a long war. The only way Ukraine will win this war is if God himself intervenes in their favor."
I would not be surprised if the war planners were ordered to be disappeared
The irony is that Russia presenting itself as a greater threat than it really was is almost certainly what prompted a defensive response massive enough to shatter the presented facade.
"@Dane Dane Enough vodka, try some water."

"Excellent. I am something of a news addict and have read, heard and watched a lot about the invasion but this video had a lot of information I wasn't aware of."
"I don’t think Russia has really been defeated in any meaningful way, sadly. I see a lot of poking and prodding. A lot of testing the waters. A lot of encirclement. All of which are symptomatic of Russian war doctrine.
Ukraine is a massive country. It won’t be taken over in a day. We can’t strawman our enemy. They are just as smart as we are."
More Lies from the west.. Details..
great vid.
"""Welcome to hell"" is a reference to First Chechen War BTW"
Will propaganda ever stop?
"Very poor analysis. It comes from the fact that you are simply not aware how Russian army operates, because you never researched their military doctrine in the first place. And from every mistake in a video where you mostly providing wishful thinking instead of understanding the full picture. In short - Russian military doctrine comes in 5 stages. Bait for the defense positions to ""open them"" and destroy shortly after to stablishing air superiority and control of territory once defense positions are destroyed. Logistics and front operation refueling, resupplying points. Pushing opponent army into the so called ""cauldron"" to force army to surrender (no one ever survived after ""cauldron"" in modern history, so that's a neutralized army). And then it's final stage - inevitable victory with full efficient logistics established and control over territory. Russian army so far failed at none of this stages, the plans were corrected since there are hostages in some of the cities, but are still on the schedule. At the moment they continue to work on stage 3 and finishing stage 4.
Another mistake - is to believe that Kiev is a key objective. It's wrong. Never was. Because Kiev is not in a full control of it's army and multiple neo-nazi band formations all over the country. It's.. complicated.

The first helicopter operation task was to take airport to divide and conquer army near Kiev, not to take Kiev. So the other forces would not get help from Kiev's army and will be alone to be inevitably pushed into cauldron (that already worked). Then, there was also a special force operation to take Chernobyl power plant to guarantee absolute safety for Europe (you will thank them later for it, once this hysteria will be over), had neo-nazi and other degenerates dare to try use it in order to commit nuclear terrorism and blame Russia for it (as this is their usual approach). That operation is completed and station is under control since day 1 under Russian special forces and Ukrainian army that was stationed there. Yes, they work in cooperation, Invaders and defenders works together. Do you still believe you understand what the fuck is going on in Ukraine?

It is called special operation for a reason. Because unlike anything before in modern warfare there is another serious task that Russian army dealing with that no one ever did in history - saving people from humanitarian crisis that conflict and Ukrainian government actions created. 8:33 these are footages of Russian humanitarian convoys with food, water, essentials for people to survive in a conflict zone. The main goal of logistics at the moment is to provide humanitarian convoys to every city and village, not the military effort you would like to think about. Because military logistics almost complete and you can't see it because humanitarian crisis is the priority atm and that's all you can see because this humanitarian operation is massive. Had you listen for official ministry of defense, you'd probable be aware of the current humanitarian crisis in Ukraine that deeply worries ministry of defense as they are trying their best to fix it. But i guess you don't really care for Ukrainian people, but just want to fuel up your wishful thinking and wait before Russia will be defeated.. somehow.. idk.. by a miracle i guess? Do you still believe in super heroes?

Russian army doesn't even use civilian infrastructure of water and electricity in this warfare, unlike US did in Iraq and in many other conflicts where they used it against civilian to push country into blackout and water shortages. Russian army have under control 2 Nuclear power plants, one of which is the biggest NPP in Europe and is providing about 40% power to entire Ukraine. And Russia is not willing (VERY GENEROUS of them, don't you think?) to switch it off. That somehow wasn't mentioned in the analysis. I wonder why? Imagine for a second what kind of power and confidence Russian army have, that they can just ignore this amazing opportunity to blackout entire country. In contrary to what US did in EVERY conflict. Which is another reason why this analysis is so poorly done and is just wishful thinking and nothing else.

It is also a hostage rescue operations in many cities, like Mariupol for example, where neo-nazi band formation know as ASOV Battalion already blew up a building with at least 200 people in it, after Ukrainian army tried to sent them message that they are ""crossing the line with their actions"" by hitting them with missile killing 20 of them at once, so they are in panic now. Yes, Ukrainian military is now shooting at these who work with them. Because you don't know the full picture of this shit show and can't even imagine it. You simply lack of.. You are not smart enough, basically.

But you certainly believe you are competent enough to analyze it anyway.. so be it.

There are no NATO's humanitarian convoys because guns is what will save people, not food and water (NATO's thinking). There are no Ukrainian humanitarian convoys because they simply not in control of their territory since day 4 and doesn't have such resources at hand.

Who can provide people with humanitarian help if not Russia? Use your common sense if there is any left, but i know that it's pointless at this point. So it's all up to you.

So all in all, it's a very poor analysis based on wishful thinking mostly, without considering actual military doctrine and Russia Ukraine history. There are much better analysis without this mental issue with wishful thinking. Now that we finished with this - just sit and watch, how wishful thinking about Russia failure in logistics will pan out for you.

Speaking of wishful thinking again, what you see is barely even 10% of Russian army that is on full alert right now. 

You have absolutely no idea."
oh great another russian propoganda bot
very good video. It should be obvious that the purpose of wars is to strengthen the system by eliminating mainly men. Jesus and Santa Claus do not exist.

Why do you care how its pronounced?

Hi
Very well produced video. Not thorough - but certainly contained the most important points and a respectful degree of compassion.
Amazing breakdown thank you. And I hope evil autocratic governments dissappear. Long live Democracies!
I think the biggest error of Russia was to move their troops while tracked by US satellites and be aware of what they intended to do.  If I was the Dictator I will cover every tank with threes/leaves and move everything separately to the borders of Ukraine making it look like part of the Woods/landscape with no way they can suspect and then: SURPRISE!!.
The Russian leaders are disgusting. Full support to Ukraine 🇺🇦
The fact that both the US and USSR failed in Afghanistan just shows how logistics or military might or money or machinery or even nuke arsenals means nothing.
"Nebula is good but it have a major problem: NO SUBTITLES nor in English or Spanish.

So I'll stick to YouTube"
"The logistics in WWII were amazing. Heck, just the logistics for D-Day were awesome. But in Europe I remember reading they had this outfit called the ""Red Ball Express,"" or blue ball maybe. Those drivers were something else. Some of them would drive 24 hours straight or longer. They took supplies and personnel all the way from the port cities to where the fighting was actually going on. I think this was an entirely black company but they may have just had a lot of black drivers. Anyway, these guys were fearless. Can U imagine driving a fuel truck to the front lines? In many ways Putin's moves in Ukraine reminds me of WWII tactics. But he doesn't have a ""Red Ball Express."""
@Mark Collins I was surprised to see Russia's continued reliance on rail systems that were so vital in WWII. Rail systems are easy to disrupt and it can take a while to fix two or three breaches. But they have multiple rail systems that come right up to the Ukrainian border. From there they will have to put in place a land based system to go to the final mile and I have heard they don't have enough trucks in Russia.
"@John Allen is my name and music is my game , not anymore. Everyone uses diesel now, not gasoline. Diesel isn't explosive, it actually takes some doing to get it to burn."
@Mark Collins Could one bullet make the fuel trucks explode?
"In Desert Storm, I knew our forces would prefer to extend to the west and then sweep around the Iraqi Army's left flank.  There was exactly one,  paved, two lane road from the port of Dharhan on the Persian Gulf up to the Saudi-Kuwait border and exactly one east-west road from there towards Jordan in the West. There was also no railroad to be found in Saudi Arabia along the NW coast of the Persian Gulf or west towards Jordan. So General Gus Pagonis, the logistics mastermind of Desert Shield/ Storm resurrected the WW2 Red Ball Express with military traffic given top priority and that two lane road filled at all times.  
Keep in mind that military cargo trucks on roads have the same problem their horse and wagon ancestors had in centuries past. If a horse was pulling a wagon load of hay from a supply point to Napoleon's cavalry many leagues from the supply point,  the horse can end up eating so much of that hay in making the round trip that there is no point in making it.  If a cargo truck loaded with Jerry cans of fuel fills up at a supply point,  it may be such a long round trip to the front line that there is no point in making it since the truck will ""eat"" all the fuel in the Jerry cans itself. IIRC, the Red Ball Express eventually hit that point and was no longer used as the Allies began occupying ports along the English Channel-North Sea that greatly shortened those round trips. This also eased the pressure on the crumbling, French roads."
This is why the Red Ball express and project PLUTO were so important. Logistics and supply rule.
As I so many times have said it is better to have real military diplomas this putin need think of that in his next life!!!
Dayum... That's what they want you to believe in.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Thank you for making this video. We know people will want to tell us later this never happened
I learned more in this video than I have in the news over the last week.
Failed?
This ill conceived war will be the end of Putin. Russian mainland is open for attack.
I can't help but think about what a few A10's could do hitting targets of opportunity in the Russian supply lines. Maybe we could give these A10's enough air cover that they could pull this off. As drawn out as Russian supply lines are there are probably lots of choke points where we could do real damage.
Logistics also shows Putin and the military seemed to have learned next to nothing from previous wars.
Excellent informative piece.
"It breaks my heart to see this brutal event. Putin and the russian governement are sending bombs to kill children and babies. A real shame for humanity.
They deserve to be judged in front of a penal court, like in Nuremberg."
FAKE NAZI PROPOGANDA
I'll check back after 42 days and see how this evolving situation turns out. That's how long it took for the USA to take Iran. At this point it's way too early to be guessing failures and successes. Russia doesn't want to destroy the people of Ukraine. They want to take over the land and corrupt Ukraine government. So far they've done exactly what they planned by destabilizing the entire country and letting the majority of the citizens across boarders to safety.
@Robert Adams well then that obviously makes you an expert and you know full well it takes more time than two weeks with a little bit of propaganda.🤙
Lmao I remember when the US invaded Iran like it was yesterday. Back to the gulag comrade
"Sorry but you are Wrong The War Logistics are not Failing you guys do not Understand the Russian Doctoral of War they way they work.        Their Tank Units move ruffle 20 miles a day and the way it works is they send soldiers in to Encircle the Town then they bring in there Heavy weapons and Air Weapons and then Lay Waste to the Town if you shell shock your enemy they don't want to fight back as hard and this is they way they work,  they enemy see's its dead Civilians, dead Soldiers, and complete Destruction of there Home's after seeing these things will cause a Army to Break and other's sends them into a Fiery Fight which the Russians will whip out."
"That's me!  A disinformation actor!  Beware! 😄  No, seriously, how has Putin not achieved his objectives exactly? And all without even using his best troops, or even having to cut off the country's power and infrastructure.  His target is the CIA-installed cabal that staged a coup in 2014."
Heeaaallll..... Yeahhhhh........ If u turn off utube......U defeat Ukraine.

Disappointed. I don’t expect Wendover to use unverified/able  informations
great video
"It's just like I thought would happen : Russia's army, mostly lil' vlad, will embarrass themselves in Ukraine .
In the disillusioned mind of the dictator, the russian army was supposed to waltz in and be hailed as heroes and liberators, with a coward or bootlicker for a head of state that would run away and ruin the morale of the few defenders .
Thankfully, things will work out for Ukraine in the end ."
I would be interested in how much logistical aid the west is giving Ukraine. Time to put the money where their mouth is.
They are raiding stores like rats. Set up traps.
"Russian army doesn't want fight civilians surely? They are just 'press- ganged' conscripts, i.e. not professional soldiers & when they meet the 'real thing' they just go home in a box."
Russia is like it's a military exorcise
"Rather than ""failed,"" Russia is making steady progress toward its goals. Just look at the map. Even better, look at Zelensky begging the west for help. Is that how a ""winner"" behaves?"
Russa should ask the Taliban for a crash course on how to quickly capture a city/country😂
"Did everyone thinks? Why is Russia go so soft? They dont cut off internet, dont destroy city, infrastructure, power grid, water supplies like US did."
LONG LIVE VLADIMIR PUTIN AND RUSSIA 👍👍👍🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺♥️♥️♥️
Don't give Putin any more ideas…
Russian army knows about logistics? Who taught them that? They are having trouble supplying their army invading the country right next to them! The mistake Putin made was that he thought he actually had an army! It's sad to see human lives being destroyed by people who have no idea of what or how to do it. The US out maneuvered Putin again!
This extension of military might was made possible by Skillshare
Yeah people can say the Russian failed here & that. But their rockets & missile are dropping on Ukrainians. And people still are dying & building being leveled.
19 minutes hate
I am very scared about what is going to happen I dont live ukraine but it still makes me sick to my stumick
"well, the advertising of alternative publishing sites in a YT video shows how dumb youtube has actually become.... the fact that they allow content like FoxNews to be published tells you everything you need to know."
"I’m not Russian, I’m British but it’s sad how HAI has gone political and spreading Western (American) propaganda. :( This isn’t a war of Russia vs Ukraine. It’s clear it’s the US stirring up and meddling as usual to the detriment of the rest of Europe and the rest of the world. The US are endangering the rest of us."
STAND AND FIGHT. GLORY TO UKRAINE!
"Unfortunately, the only thing we are doing is talking about it, every country is afraid of Russia. So what will happen is genocide and Nato, EU, and the USA will watch and do nothing. Nato Jens Stoltenberg, I am too afraid and I poop in my pants but won't fight. Nato is a complete joke and they will be attacked like Finland, Poland, and all countries that help Ukraine. Sending money and arms does not help, sanction does not work."
Destroying and cutting off supplies line are the most effective way to win the war.  This was how Finland defeated the Russian invasion in the winter war 1939 and Afghanistan defeated Russian invasion in 1988.
This is 99% BS. The only truth was that Russia pushed into Ukraine.
I have been reading Russian military history and doctrine over the last week and I highly recommend a book called The Russian Art of War. It’s a very good guide to understand how the Russian military is structured and how it use its forces. Just google the title and its a free PDF download.
"Sam, if you see this, I'm curious as to how negative it would be for someone to switch over entirely to CuriosityStream and Nebula to your channel statistics; as obviously if everyone did you would get much less watch time, meaning you are less recommended on YouTube and so on.

"Of course.

Haha. Most laughter I have had in a long time. You are totally clueless.  You need to see  the  Duran.  Shameless propaganda by wendover. I really thought you were factual. Shameless
Russia = terrorism
I am a full time troll but I've given up my lifelong career to support Ukraine.
"A friend of mine once commented that the Russians always stumble out of the gate when a war happens.  Napoleonic fight at Austerlitz, Crimean War, Turkish War 1878, WW1 and WW2.  All disastrous starts but they did do better (but not always victoriously)  Can they get their act together quickly?  If not then they made need to call an end to the fighting at a real disadvantage."
The opinion that the current gov't in Ukraine isn't already a puppet regime seems to be overlooked.
Russia is a paper bear.

The west have the best weapons the best logistics blah blah blah and then get sent packing by a bunch of afghan farmers with ak47s and no air force. What wins a war is boots on the ground and political will something that was not mentioned at all.
well done gang
Best video to-date on what is really going on in Ukraine.  Hats off to you at Wendover Production.
"Excellent video, thanks Sam"
"2:35 is it just me that thinks its cool that he's using photography from Maxar, a company which he's previously done a video on"
Well i mean russia doesn't have the best track record when it comes to actually fighting a war. They thought it would go better now? Literally the only thing they have going for them is a harsh climate and nuclear weapons.
"Mind Begs the Question:

"I'm not understanding why you felt the need to make a video like this.... when the ""conflict"" is only a 9 days old..... and not over yet...????.... doesn't make sense"
The Russian Military should arrest Putin and send him to the World Court - this would get Russia back in the good books and then inform the world they will have free elections and pay for ALL Ukranian damage. This is probably a dream - but its a solution that all the world would want. Imagine seeing that little dictator trying to represent himself in the worlds eyes (the Russian public would even find out what this arse did in their name).
Educational-ish
Putin murders people who criticize him

Lol xd cringe"
Invasion's not even over. We don't know what else will Putin do. I think it's too early to feel relief over their failed logistics.
all in all it shows clearly how primitive Russias forces really are.... Putin must be very embarassed.
"Thank you, apparently this invasion of Ukraine was quite predictable. I pray that the machine breaks down, builds resistance from within, and takes Putin out."
"@beltalowda Putin is not known for logistics, and his troops were lied to. Ukraine has heart, they fight for the freedoms we take for granted every single damn day! Slava Ukraine!!"
This looks to me like a planned destruction of the Russian military before handing over the country to the Chinese.    All coreographed
Special military operation means hoax to the world and even Russians. Putin is lying continually with no way out. His surrounding Russians should warn Putin that further killing Ukranians would not make Russia own Ukraine in short and longer
"Only one minute in and so many falsehoods. Just chalk this one up to another western propaganda video. Who produced this, Rachel Maddow?"
"The big question now is whether Russia can make up for the poor logistics in the beginning of the war, how long that will take and whether they can afford to keep the conflict going for that long"
"@Pixel I think their end goal is just a symbolic victory. Take Kiev, secure DPR and LPR and then leave. Occupying Ukraine or installing a puppet regime is beyond their capability"
"If it looks difficult to take Ukraine, occupying it will be impossible."
"I think the lesson we can draw from the video is, the Russian military is bad at advancing, but good at entrenching. Once they have a solid hold on a territory, they can build fuel pipelines, mend railway tracks, and generally build all the infrastructure that makes them very difficult to remove. So Ukraine needs to keep the pressure on to make sure the Russians can't hold on to their gains for very long. Because once they have it for a week or so, they won't be able to get it back."
Russian army looting 😂 pathetic
"They have the skies, and go around the the city. They want the cities intact. There is a reason they are not sending the strongest and most high tech forces. They are saved for defence, and civil patrols in the city."
"The tires of these heavy Russian vehicles show signs of UV wear. A heavy equipment mechanic on another channel pointed out the tires are cracked in such a way that suggests they sat for too long without moving. The part in contact with the ground splits and pops after a short time driving on them. Also, they're allegedly made in China knock offs of a Michelin tire that tend to pop off the rims. It's explains the many flat tires and no bullet holes in many of the abandoned vehicles"
A lot like iraq hmmmmm
As a ukrainian - I'd say it's because our roads sucks.
"Thankyou for this, very educational :)"
Great analytical piece.      Keep it up.
Shouldn't have had an ad in this video unless it was for Ukrainian charities
This is really good condensation and analysis!

Ohhh I see what hoi4 does
It’s crazy that Russia has had so many communication issues they’ve been communicating without encryption for most of this invasion. That’s a massive no no for a military. You HAVE to be able to talk without the enemy listening in. If our patrols don’t have encrypted communications setup they do not leave the wire and if one of our encryption devices becomes unaccounted for the entire theater has to change comsec immediately.
"@Project Kilo lol shut the hell up, Ivan. First off, it's clearly not the second most powerful military. Second of all, yes they are indeed using unencrypted frequencies quite often."
"@Nuclear Armament cost of living has nothing to do with the costs of running a modern day army.

Also Russia is supporting an army of 1.3million compared with the UK milltary of around 198,000. So its spreading that budget a lot thinner."
meow meow meow meow

"How is it “failed” it’s literally been only ten days, it took one month for Poland to fall to germany in the invasion of Poland in word war 2. I think that this is just encouraging denial and complacency, your clinging to false hope and wanting to believe that the country you want to win is gonna win, but that’s not the reality. The invasion might be going slower than planned, but it isn’t “failed” lmao."
So the war is over ?
Bullets aren’t worth a dam if you can’t get them onto a battlefield .
"I believe people are vastly underestimating the Russian army and their tactics. We are barely 2 weeks, historicaly the Russian army has always sent their cannon fotter in first to soften the enemies defenses. Remember we dont see any Russian propoganda, only Ukrainian. I think we all will be wrong about the outcome of this war in the future. Putin is insane not stupid."

"A well analysed video as always!
It is good to see that there are people on Youtube who still apply reason to this major conflict rather than emotional rhetoric.
It is my opinion that it is this type of realistic analysis that wins wars (if understood and learned from), all this talk of Ukrainians being characters in a fantasy tale undermines both the people of Ukrains and their sacrifices.

People both inside and outside the warzone need to be aware of the realities on the ground...
However ugly or inconvenient.
Suceess is a fickle mistress, who might tempt you with one achievement after the other...
Only to hit you hard when it counts.
We instead of dreamily swooning to the romantic war drama presented by the media and some commentators...
Need to look, hear and think...
Otherwise...
We will eventually get caught with our pants down when things don't go as we imagined and end up as broken demoralised husks in front of the first real challenge of this lengthy war.
People must always believe and hope in face of adversity...
To not do so is inhuman...
But to live in denial is the worst and most painful way to fail and lose...even ones hope of victory."

"Logistics has always been among the top priorities of every war, even on ancient times , it was one of the main reasons Alexander The Great was so successful  or even  before that, why countries that lacked horses didn't had Empires as massive as those that did.

Persian empire had far better logistics than alexander; they made roads and ports just to support their military.
The war is not over - it will be written about for 100 years
More often than not  authoritative régimes do not inform their personnel about what really is the agenda and it should then be no surprise that things do not work according to plans! Misinformations take place on all sides within and wirhout leading to widespreading confusion.

Lol did you swallowed the propaganda.
"im a simple man , i see Wendover""s video ,I clicked ."
"Putin leave Ukraine alone.
It's madness attacking peaceful Ukraine"
The world never has enough truck drivers.
"Ukraine is Russian Cuba 
Putin warned and warned he clearly told them not to cross Russian red line.
All the West had to do was give Russia written guarantees that Ukraine would not join NATO.  But no the West goaded  and encouraged Ukraine to pick a fight with a super power thinking Putin was bluffing.
Do not blame Putin and Russia without mentioning the role NATO and US played in this.
The central banksters have destroyed the world economies yet again and history shows whenever that happens they always start a war to hide their complete incompetence. 
NATO led by US never wanted a peaceful settlement of this crisis because that was not their goal. They pushed and pushed Russia in to a corner for years until Putin said no more.
Personally I am sick of the duplicity of NATO they have invaded and destroyed country after country ALL under the pretext of false accusations.  Now US and NATO have the audacity of pretending to be on moral high ground about Ukraine.  The Europeans are stupid for not standing up to US pressure and should have avoided pushing Russia into doing what it has done. 
It's ok for United States because all these wars are always fought thousands of miles away from their country whereas Europe could be in the thick of it.
This is pure gangsterism being perpetrated by US + NATO,  they are (100%) to be blamed for creating a potentially horrific nuclear war which could affect the whole planet. 
Instead of provoking Russia further and flaming the situation by supplying weapons to Ukraine they should seriously facilitate a ceasefire. 
Ukraine will never be and never was in any position to seriously stand up to Russia, all that will happen by prolonging the inevitable is more people will die and the end result still being the same."
"Well logistics failed during operation Desert storm during Gulf War too. Simply put, “it happens”. And you are too naive to believe and tell the truth that Americans also can fail because they are the best in the world. They are savior of democratic justice of the whole universe or something. 

It is also true that encourage Ukraine joining NATO and giving them Article5 privilege is Cuban missile crisis in Russian version. 

It is Ukrainian who cut off the water supply in Crimean peninsula.   

So, who is the aggressor here? Who provoked the war in the first place?"
why💀
"Excellent analysis, thanks"
"Additional problems for Russia further undermining their logistics include evident failures in discipline or allocations to ensure adequate maintenance (a problem manifested in underserviced truck tires shredding in muddy fields and on roads), and the corrupt skimming off of military contracts (a problem manifested in shoddy, expired, or otherwise inadequate or missing components, food for the soldiers, etc.)"
"US took 7 weeks to get Falloujah in Iraq, a town of 300,000 people. Mosul took 6 moths even with US airforce and US military equipment. NATO bomb Afghanistan in 40days before deploying ground troops. In just few days, Russia steps in the cities in one of the largest largest country and one of the largest military in Europe. With more than 44 million population. Using only teenagers new recruit soldiers with soviet era equipment."
"Vladimir Putin said he attacked ukraine because he wanted de nazify and stop a genocide of ethnic russians.  

Newsflash Vladimir Putin, volodymyr Zelenskyj the ukrainan president is a jewish russian ukrainan. 

When a swedish reporter asked ethnic russians living in ukraine about the genocide claims of ethnic russians they said what genocide?"
"The Russia intervention of the Ukraine happened so quickly and mobilized so effectively
 Logistics failed?
By the way 100 tones of aid has been delivered to the regions by Russia already 
again Logistics?"
The Vietnam war was the first war fought on TV. This is the first war fought on social media
"Damn Sam, this is an amazingly cogent and well delivered summation of the subject. I cannot adequately describe just how MUCH better this was done and presented than anything I've seen so far coming from a ""professional"" news service. Well done dude, you and your team have done an excellent job and hopefully those other ""professional"" services will take notes."
Thank you. I didn’t know this information. It shows how desperate Putin is getting but that will lead to more innocent casualties. I hope this war ends quickly and does not escalate to WW3.
Logistics by vodka. If support crew is drunk like skunk just before invasion it looks like what was happened. Other russian tradition is put lowest skill soltiers first in battle.
This video has further convinced me that hes going to push the button . I just hope his sekun are as out dated as the rest of the equipment.  And i hope all that super hi tech stuff they built using our tax money works as promised.
Why would you make a video pointing out russias mistakes? You looking for a MVP award from vlad pukin?
I hope this has been humiliating for little Putin. What a 3rd rate military.
penjajahan itu keji & biadab.. hi rakyat ukraina.. betjuanglah bersama tentara anda... usir penjajah dari negri anda..  berjuanglah sampai titik darah penghabisan.. merdeka atau mati.. seperti rakyat indonesia yang berjuang membebaskan diri dari penjajahan .. yang menjajah indonesia lebih dari 350 tahun..
"So, if it weren't for nukes, Russia wouldn't be a massive world threat. Great."

Makes me remember in comparison to how Operation Overlord came about and the Red Ball Express and just how poorly Russian military logistics is which is great for Ukraine defence
"One problem with war, it was easy for USA and west to quickly take over afgan and Iraq but then trying to control it was the issue, the insurgency was something there couldn't control, Russia going to have the same problems"
Beautiful propaganda champ
"Ahh yes, *Logistics*"
"No no  , you got it wrong , the puppet govermment   was  in stall in 2014"
"Im thinking some heavy handed politics is going on in the top of Kremlin. That is, Generals and other high ranking officers are appointed by status and connection. Not merit.
This is something that has plagued middle eastern countries as well. Most famously, the attempted invasion of Israel.
Also, here in Finland there are plenty of stories from the Soviet era of failed and clumpsy attempts by their military. So Im thinking this is a longstanding issue in Russia."
"Excellent work on this video, really shows how incompetent the Russian Military is and how desperate they seem to be getting to not turn this into a defeat"
@David Ryall what is said here was true you Just need common sense .
"@Agent00F 

You seem to have a problem with extrapolation.  Are you sure you're human?"
"""defeat"". Interesting that word now means surrounding all your enemy's major cities and fighting forces. Apparently according to all these folks regurgitating the latest from the US state dept, Ukraine is surrounding Moscow instead."
"@David Ryall how much Robux are they paying ya, shill? I say Robux because Robux is more valuable than Rubles at this point 😂"

"You delete my comment, I unsub."
"Great content ! One point was missed is the nature of the terrain. When it is frozen, then there are still ways to go through offroad. But, depending on the weather, with spring, the terrain becomes more muddy thus much more complicated to ""drive"" offroad. There is even a word for these conditions: Rasputitsa which might be the true reason why the ground invasion has stalled so far."
"@H H Your first comment goes against some basic assumptions (proved to make sense) in IR: States are up to sustain considerable losses to achieve geopolitical objectives. 
Moreover, things in Russia are complicated, but how bad they are depends a lot on the source. There are reports of people pissed off with the suspension of certain services, and there are reports of those who are just finding them a nuisance."
@Pixel I mean it would give the Russians much greater mobility potential and in especially so with tanks and apc in combat.
@Niclas Kårlin yup. The arctic is warming up.
"@John They invaded the russian territory only in 1941 because they made the Ribbentrop Pact in 1939. Under this agreement with the germans, USSR got the right to invaded  Polonia, Balt republics and Romania. And it's what they did en 1939-1941. They splitted this part of territory with the germans. It gave Hitler the time to took the western countries between 1939-41. I can understand why Polonia, Romania, Balt Republics and other countries in this area can't trust the russians. Oh, i don't want to forget. Under the Ribbentrop Pact, they send politics prisoners to germains mainly germans anti-nazis. So when Putin talks about nazi or collaboration with them, i laugth a lot."

"The Russians were being nice for the first 5 days, they didn’t want to hurt any civilians or destroyed any infrastructures. Watch what happens in the next 5 days."
Here before my future kid watches this in class
"The Russian military (land, air and sea) is the second most powerful in the world. Russia has been planning and preparing for the invasion of Ukraine for 8 years since Euromaidan. In ten days of fighting against a relatively lightly armed enemy on flat terrain they have only captured one city (Kherson, Ukraine’s 17th largest city 100 kilometers from the Russian border). In several areas the Russians have advanced up to 150 kilometers across lightly inhabited areas. A normal foot march should cover 30 kilometers a day. If they would put the troops into coach tour buses and stop to refuel at gas stations and buy food in the convenience stores they should be doing a lot better than this.
Furthermore on March 3 Putin, apparently in desperation, spoke on Russian television and announced increased death benefits and compensation for injuries for Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
To me, these are clear signs that Putin is not fully in control of the Russian army and they are disregarding his orders.
Putin’s exit strategy may involve fleeing to Kazakhstan."
I think he will choke on tea at some point
Ukraine will eventually fall. It doesn't matter.

Wouldn't it be best to not point out to Russia what they can do better....?

Heaven guard us from the Trumplican's extreme stupidity!"
Good stuff
"10:01 - You're telling me google maps on the iPhone/Android does not work at Ukraine? Did google shutoff it services to prevent Russians to commute easily in Ukraine? Best believe google maps would make the Russian commute in Ukraine super easy even without ""road signs"". I won't say that the ""push"" logistics is not a logical method, the Soviets used it to defeat Hitler's Nazi military which almost took over the world. There are Pros and Cons to every logistics method."

My daughters grandfather is from Poland 🇵🇱 he lived under the soviet union  and has told me how terrible it was and how they escaped it and how wonderful that it had fallen and he could go back home the crazy part is he was born in 1943 my daughters mother is 33 guy was still busy in his old age still works full time. My family came from Poland before the world wars ect. But had family there my grandfather was visiting during the invasion in 1939 he said it was a beautiful day sunny and warm he said war's start on sunny days he said that ruined sunny days for him he liked the rain he did make it back to the USA in 1939 the nazis let's us citizens go home who were in Poland

NATO bombed Yugoslavia and 2000 people died includind poor children in the school...why are you not covering that?!!!!
simply put if there were no nuclear warheads the US would shit on the Russians in a all out war cause were literally 100 years ahead of them in combat warfare

"I've never understood the opinion of pre-war analysts that Ukraine would quickly fold to an attack.
I can only assume that the analytical assumption of the experts was Russia would pursue the 100% nothing held back sort of attack that was expected into Germany all through the Cold War, but it's clear that the Russians only sent as much forces as they thought 'sufficient' to force a capitulation, apparently using the same assumptions as the Western analysts.

Apparently everyone forgot that ordinary people get _really mad_ when they're invaded and don't just roll over and beg for mercy."

"Russian government is scum, Russian people need to stand up to Putin. Or on your hands there be blood."
Failed?  The conflict is still ongoing.  This sort of propaganda painting a different picture than what’s happening only hurt the people of Ukraine.
Logi wins wars.
Bloomberg news was reporting that Belarussian Activist Hackers claimed to have hacked the Belarussian rail network and disrupt the ability of the Russians to get troops and equipment through Belarus into Ukraine.
"Sadly, Biden and the EU (largely Germany) blocked needed munitions to Ukraine prior to invasion.  It's changing now but I hope it's not too late."
"Before coming across Wendover, ""logistics"" was an unimportant and boring black-box in my head. Now, I can't help but think about how complex and essential logistics is.

What would be a good introductory book to get started with learning more about logistics, in general? I love the content you create, but it's ultimately curated topics that are designed to be easy to grasp and interesting, rather than something that builds upon the fundamental (but possibly boring) groundwork of the subject."
I bet most of the nuts and bolts of this topic are proprietary.  It's not like Amazon is going to write a detailed book on how they cut unneeded corners to move product.

"I doubt Russia seriously thought they would take Kyiv. It seems to be more of a distraction whilst they connect up Crimea to Russia, and take over the parts of Ukraine with more Russian-speaking people."
I can imagine only a few things more tasteless than interrupting a video of an ongoing war by a flashy advertisement of an idiotic mobile game.
"To me, it would seem as though Putin expected major combat operations to be over in a week, which is why he invaded with a fraction of what he actually needed.  A few days into the invasion and the realization that this was going to be a long and difficult fight, becomes the unfortunate reality.  The Russians had no plan B, because plan A was guaranteed to work."
"It's not a logistic failure,  this is exactly how the russian military is designed to operate.  They're developing forward operating bases just outside Kyiv (at their exact shelling distance) to provide fuel depots for their convoy of tanks.  It's not ""stuck"",  it's SUPPOSED to be ground to a halt like that."
Surely russian tanks aren't meant to run out of fuel miles into Ukraine
"Why? Because of Russian incompetence. I asked a Russian sailor about his service in the Russian navy. He said the ships were “painted rust”. The officers stole most of the rations. They hardly ever did any training. If they complained, they disappeared. All the sailors wanted to do, is get out. Some navy!"

"To take things to where the US citizen and many people in the world can understand things, imagine that the USA state of Kansas which is in the heart land of the USA decided to leave the USA and become their own country. They lived on their own for thirty years and fell into bad company. They were manipulated by the most evil country in the world. They promoted the nastiest citizens to lead their country who did horrible things to many of the citizens of Kansas. Meanwhile the states of the USA that surround Kansas were watching in pain because they knew Kansas as friends, family, and countrymen. They saw what was becoming of Kansas and wanted to help but they were their own country. Eventually they had to intervene in a way that said we are not invading we are family, you are lost, and we want to help. Kansas would initially want to follow recency bias. Especially the young who knew no difference because Kansas had been independent for 30 years, but the Kansans over 30 remembered being strong, being family with the surrounding states, and receiving help from that family when they needed it. Ukraine is generational. The young know no different way but the old know family."
"A key problem: If you wanted to invade a country with shock tactics then why allow your opponent an 8 year headstart? I can understand if the prior decision was due to wanting to do anything OTHER than open war in broad daylight, but it is not like the generals under Mussolini with 2 weeks to prepare for Greece. You had all that time to gather information and supplies or was it all just sold to Iran in a geopolitical bid to compete against China?"

Good job Russia
Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine because he was blackmailing Ukraine
the proof that western countries practice sick censorship is real... Trump is banned from twitter lol
"My goodness. I have learned so much on here than if I were in my history class.
Thankyou."
I hope this shows up in Putin's recommended section of his YouTube account.
"The russian army is so amazing that their using museum pieces in the fight, the 2S1 SPG and BMP 1 are in museums world wide..."
"What an excellent video. Clearly, you prioritized your logistics by pulling up such a great video with an excellent explanation. Kudos to the team!!"
Social Media FINALLY did something GOOD for the world!
"Imagine being so laughable you think a slow scale invasion is ""Failed logistics"" if the kremlin wanted to take over ukraine within a few days it would have to completely destroy it, Russia is not NATO they don't bomb countries for the sake of few oil companies, they need ukraine and a destroyed ukraine is no use to them"
"It definitely a bot because it doesn’t respone back,if it respone back and talk very illogical it a troll"
"Abandoning slews of heavy weaponry, specialized equipment, and anything in between due to lack of fuel is not indicative of a slow, calculated maneuver: it's a show of ineptitude."
Okay bot
"I think moralism can be dangerous at this point. Calling Putin mad and senseless in emotional outbursts is understandable but can be detrimental. We want him to loose, and rule number one is always Know your Enemy. Calling Putins idea to let Gazproom pay European climate organizations to make our countries more dependent on Russian gas brilliant, is not condoning Putin... If you just dismiss Putins as a madman, we, the west, will loose no doubt. Hell, it's our naivety towards the idea of ""history being over"" that led us here."
"""Welcome to Hell!""😁😖☠️Oh I like that! Old Putin didn't know what he was getting in to now did he people? He loose his a** in the Ukraine he'll end up like 'uncle Adolf' or 'The Little Corporal' did: DEAD! I'm no Buddhist but old boy has enough bad karma to last a very long time. It's only the first week of Lent and Mr. Putin is a Christian goes to Mass every Sunday and goes on yearly religious retreats like I do. Perhaps he should give up war for Lent. Humility is good for the soul. Just an idea, no?"
"When you look at the Russian/ Belarussian vehicles- most of them are not even on par with the vehicles being used to invade Iraq. I don't see how they will be able to fight against an intense insurgency should, God forbid, the Ukrainian government fall. Their vehicles are obviously not well maintained."
It's much more cost effective to fight in the spring & summer
Premium burn of Dictator Putin and Fascist Russia
"I'm so thankful that there are wonderful channels like this I can get real, researched information from! And it was also interesting, which is great because I feel I learned more about logistics and conflict in this video than all of my schooling."
Its amazing how much transparency social media brings to war.
My goodness - do your reale believe this drivel? The russian army planning an invasion without having thought about logistics? It´s like whistling in the forest - to cheer up your own mood and courage. Don´t you realise that this is another military tactic than shock and awe?
"I agree. Social Media might make war more transparent, but it also makes understanding it more anecdotal and unreliable."
"Hey Wendover - here is some info re the promotion w/ Curiosity Stream - I have tried - twice now - to sign up.  I don't even want Curiosity Stream - I had it once.  I would like to try Nebula and see your stuff and others you mention.  However, Curisity Stream saves my email (from a very old account, non active) and will not let me sign up via the link.  When I then sign up and pay full price w/o using your link, the system will not let me see Nebula.  Totally ridiculous in my opinion.  I'm assuming all these issues are on CS side of things but thought you should know."
My theory is that maybe Russian isn’t showing all of its cards. Maybe he didn’t send in his best guys to Ukraine to either A) deceive us and think they are weaker or B) he’s waiting to save those guys when things really go south. Not sure if it’s true but it’s a interesting thought
"They already tried to send in the best of their main forces, the VDV, and they still got slaughtered."
"A lot of people have said this but in fact, as Wendover points out, this is how the RU military rolls.  Primitive.  Check out ""Task & Purpose"" for another view on this matter, consistent with what Wendover has said, based on papers by Russian military experts."
...for what benefit of either scenario?
The war isn’t even over yet. Yet you think you’ve accumulated accurate data from both sides? Kind of impossible when Russian media is banned literally everywhere in the world.
"You're right, we should definitely take russian state run propaganda networks in to consideration when considering the cause and effect of such a globalized event."
Just trying to make content (money.)
"At the start you totally ignored the true cause of the conflict. The Maidan uprising and the US instigated extremists which Victoria Nueland funded  with $5M US as well as CIA supported training and arms in order to achieve a coup. You've also glossed over the slaughter of somewhere between 13,000 to 30,000 civilians (depending on the source) over the last 8 years by primarily National Socialist paramilitary groups and to a lesser extent pro-Russian separatists. 
   As for your assumptions regarding a Russian failure to achieve their initial goals we were witnessing a silk glove approach designed to cripple Ukranian military force projection which sadly didn't achieve a capitulation. In the next few days the Russians will surround all the critical areas and will switch to the iron glove approach typical of former Soviet tactics. I truly feel sorry for the Ukranian people as they are some of kindest friendliest people one could meet but it's about to get horribly worse for them if the government doesn't have the common sense to make some concessions instead of bullheaded stupidity. 
    The only ones that will win this war  are the death dealing corporations,  capitalists and other scum that get rich from the suffering of others.

  This is my personal opinion acquired from 40 years of studying global conflict and international politics. Feel free to criticise, as I'm sure some will, but explain why you think I'm wrong on any of the points I've made not just name calling, strawman arguments etc."

"You are part of the disinformation, no one knows what is *actually* going on. There is misinformation and propaganda being conveyed by both the Ukrainian and Russian sides"
They just care about making money. Lots of channels are taking advantage of the conflict.

Wooohooo let's go Russia
I'm here for all the disinformation comments from Russian state actors! lol
Putin = 💩. My actual opinion.
Putin and his military can burn in hell.
Excellent analysis.... subbed
Wendover is partly or fully funded by the US military Industry Complex/US govt
thats one of the most cringey things ive yet to find in this comment section
Excellent analysis.... subbed
Why didn’t you mention the suffering of Russian speaking Ukrainian nationals by the Ukrainian government that started in 2014?
So at @1:02 That's Russia's Proud Boys?  Pathetic.
russians military would F-U_C-K-UP A WET DREAM.....!   Let's face it russians are and have never been anywhere near being the brightest people in the World....!
"Russian Fuel trucks hold 5,000 litres of fuel,their tanks require 1,200 litres to run for 220miles so thats 4 tanks that can refill...not including APC'S, food trucks,logistic trucks, etc and the time it takes for the fuel trucks to get to and from...so um...they fucked up big time"
This is exactly the video I was waiting for 👍
"But it's still going, not even a month....and Russia's winning
 I don't get it."
It's called making money.
Clickbait biased title
cute
Fantastic video
"Just as it was easy to deceive the whole world that China is to blame for the coronovirus and turn the whole world against China, it also turned out to be easy to deceive the whole world that Russia is to blame for this situation with Ukraine.
The 2 big enemies of America and Great Britain have always been Russia and China.
it is not difficult to guess who benefits from it and who sponsored it.
By the way, it was the military bases of America and Great Britain that were located in Ukraine. Actually from what it all started.
At the same time, the big question is, where does the President of Ukraine get the extra $3 billion in his account? who gave him this money? Was that really the price of all these consequences? So he is the last person on earth who cares about the fate of the Ukrainian people.
Do people really believe that Putin could not have calculated what the economic consequences would be for Russia and what the pressure would be from around the world? Of course, he knew, knew, and spoke about it himself,  but it means ""something"" turned out to be more important than all the consequences of the world, and this is the security of Russia as a state."
"@Ramina  There never was such an agreement. Even Gorbachev confirmed this.
How are you comparing Yugoslavia to Ukraine? Just do your research what happened there - and NO, some few random Azov neonazis existence in a huge country is not the same as a fucking ethnic cleansing. Holy shit
""double standard"""
"Another important aspect hampering Russia's ability to use a truck-based logistic train are the roads. Ukrainian roads, especially in the north, weren't in that great of shape to begin with. With dozens of loaded trucks and armored vehicles rolling over them they have been ground down to the dirt. The dirt which is now mud. The same mud that if the Russians leave the road will bog down their vehicles where they must be abandoned due to the lack of recovery vehicles being present. This is especially true in the NW of the country as Ukraine has purposefully overflowed the reservoir of the Dnieper, flooding fields and side roads that further limit Russian units' ability to maintain momentum. 

Additionally, due to corruption and possibly a degree of desertion, Russia's support brigades (such as the signal units that handle radios) are sometimes not present with their respective unit. That's not because they were misplaced or delayed but because they do not exist. These are positions that are empty in the unit roster and have not been filled, or in some cases, the previous round of conscript's names are still on the roster--but you can bet the paychecks for those no longer present conscripts are still going to someone."
"NATO has its goal to smash russia.
Russia seek for peace by applying to join in NATO but been refused in 1990s"
"@Nerium Oleander Russia seek for peace.. Chechens, Georgians, Ukrainians, Belarussians and many many more would disagree
Russia under Putin and Yeltsin was doing the exact opposite of seeking peace. The last russian leader who was kinda looking for peace was Gorbachev - I really hope after Putin you'll get a chance to finally find someone who actually cares about his people and isn't all about enriching himself and his friends."

"gee, just call the freedom truckers to block the highway......  ;)"
Russia wasn't prepared to face people with pride of place and community. I hope Ukraine can outlast them until someone takes down Putin or he gives up.
"So, how will Rusiia act from now on? Throwing in more troops? They should have impressive manpower at their disposal. Being so big they will be able fight a war of attrition."
55 miles from the Belarus border and they've run out of fuel
"""..perhaps most tragically, The Ukrainian civilians who were displaced, injured or killed, simply for staying in the place they called home.."" damn that hits deep"
We're talking about 0.03% (three percent of one percent) as many civilian deaths In ukraine as there were in the middle east.
"The number is miniscule compared to over a million innocent civilians killed by the United States and NATO in the middle east. 

But you don't know that because you just feel sad about what they tell you to feel sad about."
"This is simply not true. Please watch another channel named Task & Purpose, this guy is a former US soldier who says, that it’s simply impossible to move army structures as huge as Russian columns quickly. In my opinion, majority of Russian offensive goes according to the plan. Those first units that infiltrated Ukraine were just green conscripts whose sole purpose was to assess the Ukrainian resistance. The cream of Russian forces are still in reserve and it’s a question of time when are they gonna deploy. Look, I’m just saying that you should not believe everything that media serve us. It’s gonna be bad for Ukraine and I think it’s a huge tragedy for democracy. But please, try to respect both sides. It’s not as black and white as many people say. Putin has his reasons and he is definitely not deranged."
"Russia also doesn't have client states (non-NATO allies) like Pakistan, with sophisticated Armies and reasonable infrastructure. They;d have to do all of it themselves.
It'd be weird if Russian lines didn't fail. 

Good work!"
"America can invade and occupy 2 countries from literally the other side of the world invaded at the same time, but Russia can't even maintain supply lines when they are literally invading a country next door, 😂😂😂

That's like America invading Mexico and then running out of gas 40 miles deep into the country."
Remarkable. Congratulations.
The only thing about this topic that really burns my ass is the fact that nearly everyone pronounces Kiev wrong. It's Kee Ev
Go go Russia! Stay strong and defeat the Ukrainian nazis
Fug russia
good stuff.  thank you!
"They failed because ever since the dawn of time, back when that first group of men (or apes) decided to attack another group of men (or apes), their logistics failed. And each time since then, in each conflict ever, all logistics failed, regardless if the battles or wars were ultimately won or lost.
And it is only after the fact, looking back at unfolded events, that historians and 'experts' go and say, well, this is why this failed, or this is why it succeeded.
It's a joke trying to understand the chaos of war."
"1:52 Anyone know what the flag there is? I know it's not a confederate flag or a union jack but it somewhat looks like one, what does it actually represent or mean though?"
Western Media would almost never say anything about NATO Expansion or the countries the US bombed. This channel is biased and would never say anything that talks about it. Bias and western propaganda
"A story about Alexander the Great fits here. he allegedly told his court ""My logistics team is a humorless lot, for if I fail a campaign they are the first to be punished."""

"You oversimplify push & pull logistics. You make it sound like private & business mail service. -If that were the case, the Chinese would be the masters of pull logistics. BTW, taking a helicopter from Yugoslavia to Istanbul for lunch at McDonald’s, is that push or pull logistics???"

Compare that to American logistics when they go to war."
"Thank you.

Hahahahahaha this US clowns
"What about covid, though 🤔 are the Russian not worried about it"
"In one word, corruption. From what it looks like, corruption is so bad in Russia that Putin himself didn't know his armed forces were not what he thought it was. I don't think he realized that everything from the training to the quality of its hardware was substandard. Who reports this corruption? Or the better question: Whom do you report this corruption to? without disappearing, of course."
"I was hoping this channel wouldn't stoop to stupid western propaganda. What a pity that I was wrong. OK. The West has good logistics. Russia's logistics are bad. How will this help Ukraine? Ukraine will win? No. Since you mentioned Afghanistan. Did Good Logistics Help the US in Afghanistan? The goals of their stay there have not been achieved. The escape was a disaster. The Taliban got the American arsenal of the whole country. Does good logistics look like this? I'm not impressed. When the military operation in Ukraine is over you can compare its results with the US 20 years in Afghanistan. Will you make a video like this? I think no. Allegations, fakes and manipulations. That's all this propaganda video consists of."
"My college professor in Russian history, ""Why did the Russians loose the cold war?  Maintenance."""
Russia's desperation is what concerns me. Will she launch her nukes if pressed into a corner? If this war continues. Will she use those weapons to justify ending the war? Kinda a hiroshima/Nagasaki strategy. I think MAD is truly more relevant since our standoff with these guys back in the 60s.....

And the World let it happen Why?
It seems nobody learned anything from Afghanistan. East or west
"Great job wendover, you’ve profited off of war"
💙💛
Interesting thing but I'm surprised how the world is shocked by the Russian Invasion which obviously it should be but is very quiet when I mentioned that the United States and Canada Invasion of Native Lands. From Wounded Knee Incident to the Native Children buried in mass graves near Residential Schools in Canada the world is mute.
I wish the US was doing more because every time I see anything about this war it makes me mad/sad that we as a country aren’t doing more
"It all started with the Odessa Massacre in which 48 to 58 (numbers differ depenting on the sources) Russian speaking Ukranians were Burned Alive by neonazi's. Who were never prosecuted, by the way. 

Maybe you should start with that if you wanna give a history lesson. Oh, and ever heard of the 2 million Ukranian refugees who fled since 2014? (oh no, because the fled to Russia). Ever heard of the 13000 to 15000 people who were killed in Eastern Ukrain since 2014? Probably not, since they spoke Russian.

Civilians in Donbas and Donetsk have been bombarded and shot at since 2014, but you don't seem to care. Understandebly you didn't hear their voices scream, since they're Russian speaking. 

Great journalism, congratulations. And no, nothing of this justifies the Putin invasion of last february. But these millions of people are also people, but clearly from a lesser god in your eyes"
"""...killed simply for staying in the place (pregnant pause) they called (more pregnant pause) home."" Ugh. What heartbreak."
"LOL Russian equipment is crap.  If this is the best they have, Russia is a paper tiger"
"6:01 also here they destroyed the AN-225 , literally the only one ever finished.
There is an unfinished one but I'm not sure if they're gonna rebuild it"
Also explains why Russia had no idea how bad their tires were.  Vehicles just loaded on trains and they had no idea until vehicles were actually used.
The best commentary on the Ukraine war that I’ve seen so far.
"I wonder what lesson the rest of the world is learning from this? Russia seems to  have relied heavily on artillery and the ""shock and awe"" strategy. But that failed when they realized a ballistic missle cannot occupy a street. 

They severely underestimated the willingness of the Ukrainian people to fight amongst the rubble."
Well said sir excellent comment I agree with you.👏👏👏
"@Prone to Drift True, but they are definitely taking Kyiv within the next couple weeks regardless of how sloppy it is. 
Holding the entire country long term is another matter entirely... they just don't seem to have the numbers & likely can't stop weapons & supplies crossing the border to Ukrainians."
"@Brandon Annisette 
We didn't lose the war. We won the war. Afghan people lost the war."
@Brandon Annisette kyiv is only 56 miles from the russian border but yet its taking so damn long for the russians to get there also the war is not over yet the russians havent  even taken kyiv yet
What about Syria?
"Unfortunately Russian Military doctrine is much different from the west. Conscripted soldiers and older equipment is usually sent in first, with a lot less emphasis on minimizing KIA deaths. We see most of the initial troops only have iron sights, backing this up.  Better/more modern troops and equipment follow in slowly, encircle main cities and go to siege. Captured plans suggest estimated 15 days to take Kyiv. I REALLY hope the Russian ""failure"" is true, but in realty it is probably going to plan, or a wee bit behind. I HOPE I am very, very wrong though."
I don't think this video will age well.
not failed winning
The one time where the dislike button can tell us how many bots this video attracted
This is  like me playing a chess game and I get checkmated.. and refuse to except that I have lost the game… the Ukrainians are checkmated.
"Zelensky has accumulated $1.2 billion during the first two and a half years of his presidency. Zelensky managed to buy a villa in Miami for $34 million, as well as several sets of jewelry for $5.6 million."
This was before the war actually. He is a famous artist
"What a great indepth analysis. Now on the other hand, ""when the enemy is about to make a mistake, let him."" It might be counterproductive to point out his weaknesses while the situation is ongoing. Please for all that is holy, If you support Ukraine, take down the video."

Lol nothing failed
Phenomenal
"This failure itself is Putin's own doing. His head lives in an alternate reality bubble of its own, devoid of actual realities in Ukraine. When a person has lived with fantasy for so long, he begins to believe the very lies he tells himself. Senility probably played a factor too. Otherwise there's no explanation why he expected the war to be over within a few days. He truly believed his own delusions that the Ukrainian military would welcome in his forces to ""liberate"" them from their ""tyrant government"" or at the very least not put up resistance and surrender. The reality could not be more opposite than his expectations. This war is the making of one man's delusions alone."
"at 01:00: if we had EVER during military service sewn our shoulder patches like that = running, running, running, sewing again, cleaning, running etc... Standard was: if a PENCIL head slipped under, you would do it again and again :)"
"Putin would probably be the most powerful man in the world right now, if he had only stuck to threatening an invasion instead of actually going through with it. No one is ever going to be pushed around by him on the world stage again."
"Sounds funny when you say the biggest country in the world is having logistics problem. Can't agree with you, sorry."
The whole reason why their invasion sucked is because Russia is a 2nd world nation that never fully recovered from its soviet collapse and for the most part just has military equipment left over from then. This paired with the fact they have a sociopathic selfish dictator makes it very difficult for them to prosper and become rich enough to afford a 21st century advanced military and competent leaders.

Hallo! You can also visit Task and Purpose's YouTube channel if you're interested more in this conflict.
Amazing job. All our thoughts are for those who are in Ukraine
"Pretty sure Russians could have used their GPS devices to move around Ukraine, and did not need the signs. Although Signs could help them before being altered."
Who is really failed is USA logistics in Afganistan.
"Germany in WW2  -  Blitzkrieg. 
Russia in 2022  -  Sitzkrieg."
"It took Germany 6 weeks 
It took Russia 10 days .. so you do the math."
"The focus is not on seizing, conquering, and controlling Ukraaine's territory. The focus is on destroying Ukraine's forces. Make no doubt about it  Putin was gentle at the start. This will end in 2 weeks. They'll step up the game now amd it's over."
Good job!

I was hoping you would cover this! Thank you! Love your videos (especially about planes :) )

Well explained!
"Well if the logistics failed how come the Russians have Kiev,  Kharkov  and endless cities encircled? Hell ,Russia has trapped 60,000 Ukrainian troops and have then encircled .that is the bulk of Ukraine fighting force."
What do you expect communist aren't good at war they are only good at killing unarmed civilians. The only reason russia is still a country because its a nuclear power without it they would be another country in the history books.
Well that only reason why the US is still in power for the same reason.
"*=== War is not good ===*

As the situation appearing and people discussing it which comes in observing that why Unitarian President doing so? After it some doubts which make clear this situation that from western nations alliance, NATO it had been dictated to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that bring your people in front lines to face Russian forces. As we know Russian forces equipped with high technological weapons and trained. Other side Ukrainian general people just have small and simple weapons. They can't stand for long time against Rissian army. Also as we getting western news President Volodymyr Zelensky ordered not allowed Ukrainian between the age 16 to 60 years to leave country.

But why Ukrainian president given doing so? Doesn't he know that these ordinary weapons can't stop Russian army for long time?

If we observe then we will find, actually this is called human shields which making by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. But question is here, why?

Further more, if we consider it, we will find, if general public won't be human shield than how NATO and it's allience will have option to say Putin doing war crime. How can president known as Dictator? When general people of Ukraine will attack on Russian army in retaliation Russian army will attack them back on people, at their residential places then will become war crime. Then media will have enough material to shot spots and to show to the world.

Although no doubt that before Russian had found it's previous strength and position world has only USA supermacy since 1990. Presently world power divided in two groups
1. Western nations with USA and NATO alliance and
(2) Eastern with Russia and China alliance. So, this war isn't of Russia and Ukraine, this war is indirectly belong to Russia and NATO. Which unacceptable by western alliance. So, to breakdown eastern position and power, this game is going on.

As the military operation is going on we can see in different news still general people of Ukraine trying to stopping Russian tanks, artillery vehicles, army trucks etc without fear, why? Because still they know, Russia not taking Ukrainian people as their enemy the reason behind Russian and Ukrainian has common race, almost the same language and same culture.

So, we have lesson here, we should understand the situations in all prospectives. Be alert from hypocrite print and electronic media. They support only their own agenda, misinterprete for TRP and mislead from the main issue."
"While it seems fun to point out the failings of another. In this case having anything whatsoever to say with any detail could actually aid them now or in the future. If they learn from their mistakes or a solution or better way is presented, that can have an unintentional effect."
I laughed when i saw the thumbnail
Me too very hard 😂
Russia has military logistic academy. They absolutely know what they doing. I wont believe in this pro western blogger
"Russian logic: let’s invade part of another country, then be scared of them fighting back so we can use that to justify invading the whole country.

Great video ! And good to see that Russian aren’t in a good position now"
"I've spent last ten days glued to all available and unavailable sources taking short naps inbetween to understand what's really going on out there - and that's because it's my government doing these atrocities to a long time dear sister state, and then you just went and analyzed it just like that! I thought filtering through information and media warfare alone takes experience in mentality of our unfortunate people.
good job!"
So the reason they are not flattening cities yet is because they can't? Not because they don't want to?
What does this have to do with bricks
Nato just failed Ukraine..
Blitzkrieg tactics didnt work this time
Thank you for these quick and detailed documentaries of recent conflicts. This is amazing work.
Who wants to bet $1000 that the Ukranians are going to defeat Russia in a war? I want to know who the really stupid people are.
Well thanks but it won’t be me I need my money.😂
i think this video is to late.
Very interesting and informative! I thank you!

Are you saying the army that destroyed ISIS miles away from home doesn't have the logistics to take over a neighbouring disarmed country? Do the Russians need to get bogged down in a urban guerrilla when their objective is to destroy the Ukrainian army and some nuclear plants and bioweapon labs?  They can achieve it from the borders and that is what they are doing.
"Just want to point out besides logistics; all the footage in the video from Russian Ministry of Defense portrays their armies as everyone thought. In reality, they've been using mostly old, poorly/non-maitained Soviet junk. 

There isn't a part of me that believes Russians can construct massive pipelines and rails either."
"I've always laughed in people's faces who have told me that Russia's military is strong and powerful.
Their tech is 30 years behind America's, heck even China is like 15 years behind America and let's not even talk about North-Korea, they're 50 years behind.

Fuck Russia."
"Russian Army has  lot of fire power  destroy cities to kill civilians as they did in Chechnya Georgia Aleppo - to fight they are  amateurs - this time they fill convoy with joung recruits from DAGESTAN and other desperate provinces facing jail if they don't go to the front - these Joungs soldiers ....they don't even know how to fight.
All the russian infantry has the same problems as the refugees No petrol  No water No food.
The dumbest invasion in history since the Romans."
I shared your video to the Ukrainian government
"As soon as you introduce terms like `autocrat', you immediately tell anybody with brains your reporting is bent.
_To the rest of the world, that meant war._ - thanks for telling us what we were thinking at the time. I can distinctly recall thinking of factors like a concerted guerilla operation, isolated action in the Donbass, military aided migration, and a number of other potentials, but obviously, you know better.
No, the skies didn't light up.
This is not an invasion, it's the eradication of a mounting threat, principally instigated by the U.S.
The Ukraine is just another proxy.
Putin knows that, and acts accordingly.
An old lady in the Donbass elucidated the situation very well when she defined Zelensky as _America's servant_.

_Ever since the rebels overtook the Crimea and Eastern Ukraine_ - What a blatent distortion of reality!
The people of the Crimea voted in a referendum, witnessed by a plethora of independent, international observers and they determined in a 97% landslide, more than any American president has ever enjoyed, to join the Russian Federation.
And the people in the East and South East simply didn't want to have any part of what happened in Kiev.

Your whole presentation is a clusterfuck of philosophies of convenience and outright lies, in order to fulfil your propaganda agenda.
You are fake news, with no social conscience.

I can only hope that Putin opened up a can of  worms that he will never be able to close. There’s an old saying that goes dictators never die from natural causes. Let’s only hope this is true for Mr. Putin and it does not take very long for it to happen.
Why can't the Russians just fuck off to Russia and stay there?
pls use nukes

This War aren't that Serious anyway
Can you compare this to the US logistics in the Iraq invasion?
"This people literally wanted Russia to win over Ukraine in 4 days... Ukraine has its own army, one that is better prepared and motivated than Afganistan and the US lasted decades there and lost. Russia hasn't even used its power and has 75% of the world just consuming BBC, CNN, DW and the list continues. Do you think those medias will say something against its interests?... Not even on the internet comes up a news paper or channel from Russia when you go to the news, that clearly sends a message."
And they are all surrounded at this moment.
They prioritize munition over food for their own people. Really shows how cruel and blood thirsty Putin's military leadership is.
One week into this and all the so called experts have all the answers ...ahhhh it's only been a week
"@teddy ruxspin how do I know? I don't, but all military analyst I've seen so far agree that:

1) the airspace still being contested means that Russia is having issues
2) logistic networks are being overextended and are susceptible to Ukrainian attacks
3) these equipment losses are unsustainable in the long run
4) Russian vehicles seem to suffer from maintenance issue
5) Norden offensive seem to have stalled 
6) Russian troops seem ill equipped to handle civilian unrest and occupation duties 

add to that the previously mentioned list of material losses and you can start to argue Russia isn't doing ok in this war... and that is what I did up until now. 

If all this was all according to plant I lack the hind sight to know, but is sure is looking like it wasn't. now this argument has gone no where for quite too long so i suggest we start wrapping it up :P"
"@teddy ruxspin i'm not arguing the superiority of the Ukrainian army, i'm simply pointing out russia shortcomings, even after a week, russia has been unable to achieve key objectives, and what it did so far was at heavy losses"
@herIes ya but too little too late
"@teddy ruxspin Ukraine was still operating jets a few days ago, and the US confirmed their airfare presence some days before that, and the turkish drones were still inflicting damage yesterday"
I don't think they failed. The Russians send troops that are less trained who don't hurt when you loose them to build infrastructure like refueling points for further troops coming later. Old soviet tactics.
"And attacking civilian areas is also bad strategy, since it just wastes resources."
"At this early point there's no way for you to know enough about what's actually going on or what the outcome of the war will be to reasonably make such assertions, and I think it's quite foolish of you to underestimate your audience by passing off uninformed opinion as fact, just like its foolish for you to underestimate your perceived adversaries in the Ruskis. Based on what little information is gettinng out it seems that already the Russian expeditionary force has conquered quite a lot of Ukraine, nearly encircled Kiev as well as having destroyed the entire Ukrainian Navy and essentially neutered its Air Force. If you can't even let this ugly war play out before you start armchair quarterbacking you're just revealing yourselves to be the worst sort of opportunists looking to capitalize on the death and misery of the Ukrainian people or you're paid propagandists in the service of the US State Dept and the cowardly oligarch criminals behind this fiasco. I don't support this or any war and I don't care for the Russian or Ukrainian governments, but I support the average people of both countries and pray this is brought to a conclusion ASAP with as little bloodshed as possible, but I fear our government along with NATO will keep instigating and escalating this ongoing conflict at those good people's expense so the criminals in charge can keep exploiting the opportunity to line their own pockets and extend their reach and power."
"@Tyler Just a couple of years ago all these people were in total opposition to the US Government to the point of rioting for months on end. My observation is that most people everywhere think in somewhat simplistic terms and that they are thus easily exploited and manipulated by bad actors but that tendency is much more extreme in the USA for multiple reasons, including the wholesale importation of people who have no connection to the historic American people and no desire to assimilate to their culture and who are in fact largely antagonistic towards the natives and their traditions including as it relates to fairness, industriousness and honesty. Then there's the all pervasive, unprecedented in human history psyops and propaganda campaign people have been subject to since at least the end of WW2 and the advent of television that has conditioned and poisoned so many minds. If you're aware enough to tell you'll see that few of the actual names promoting all this insanity are those associated with the founding stock of America, that's not an accident or coincidence. I love my people and my homeland but they have been corrupted by abundance and led astray by a hostile regime that has slowly capitalized on their openness and hospitality to disenfranchise and dispossess them. The majority are decent people at their core who are simply persecuted and placed in a precarious position by a deceptively brutal and hostile authoritarian regime to the point where they feel they can't speak out or resist without being totally destroyed. The current regime rules by fear and importation of a more pliant population to serve but the common people are largely decent if gullible boomer types."

Well said exactly 💯
"Lie. It did not failed. Hateful, false, misinformation about the glorious and powerful Russia army."

"Ok, we get it. Russia sucks at combat and the west is better. Now go to Ukraine and help them win the war. What? You won’t go there? Too bad, we won’t know for sure if you’re really better."
What are you okay?
"Russians fail to realize just how much more disciplined Ukrainians tend to be. 

Russians: ""We are here to liberate you.""

Ukrainians: ""From what?""

Russians: ""Nazis.""

Ukrainians: ""You are the Nazis.""

Russians: ""Wha?""

Ukrainians: ""We have a Jewish President and Prime Minister. We are invading no one. We aren't the people who think blacks are inferior to ourselves. That is all on you. So who is the Nazis, here?""

Russians: ""Uh.... Too much vodka in brain."" 

Ukrainians: ""Get off our land."" *Rifle noise*"
Because it was a poorly planned by the reservists and not the actual activit Russian military stationed in Syria
Logistics assistant
"Russians are good in defence, but terrible in invading."
And yeah I’m waiting to watch the video where are you going to talk about how the US did In their prior conflicts especially handling civilian lives. I don’t think the US was any better at handling innocent lives as you call them. In fact leaks showed fishers torture vocals to mention the fact mildly.
And what happened in 2014 that caused this sudden change in Russian policy towards Ukraine?
It's time to gear up for WW3!
China is scarier because they have money. Russia is poor.
You can almost feel sorry for the Russians but only almost. 😂
I have watched many dozens of videos on this topic and yours is the first to get to the root of the issue. Well done. Subbed.
Amazing research and videos
The Russians didn’t account for the Ukrainians’ gigantic titanium balls.
Biden delivered $85-billion of America's best and most lethal weaponry to the Taliban.  Biden's clearly a LOGISTICS GENIUS.  Maybe the Russians could ask him for advice.
Such a helpful analysis. Explains many of the gaps left by MSM ✅

The goal of the Russian military is to take out the *Packed Faced Leftist Ukrainian EU/NATO* government in Kiev (sorry I mean Keeeev!)

Are we talking about Russia, or The Combine (from Half-Life 2)?"
4:40 that’s the only way these dorks can share videos of tank movements? By vertical video tik toks? Can’t these tik tards just shoot regular widescreen video and share to YouTube or something?
@Eulalia Daisy nope. The more the better. I just don’t think a platform for tween zoomers is the best way to share important information
"I'm sorry, but are you criticizing the spread of information? Any tik tok you make is more likely to be seen than any YouTube video you make. It's actually smart to spread info like that."
"Thanks, learnt more here in 20 mins than I've seen in a week on TV."
This is the first war where troops are made entirely of millennials and some gen Zs and you are freaking telling me they have to use paper maps?
Unfortunately one can not meet Putin in the open field with the certainty a decrepit dictator would use nukes.....he would be packing in no time.
"Russia, the Five Day Tiger"
"This is a phantastic analysis of the Situation. Very well done! And as always, don't feed the trolls."

November marked the beginning.
"Well done!,,"
Nothing about Russia has failed. They are welcomed by the LPR and DPR civilians and military. This is all lies.
"Why does Russia get to attack a sovereign Nation and we not get to defend a Sovereign Nation, this is crazy"
"My name is Vladimir Putin. I am the President of the Russian Federation. We are the military arm and voice of the Eastern Countries, and we are the ones responsible for striking our oppressors in Ukraine. This attack was retribution for generations of atrocities committed by the Ukrainians against innocent Russians. No longer will Russians be persecuted and subjected to the savagery and inhumanity that the West have been poisoning our people with. Any further attacks on Russia and Her Allies will be precipitated by the Western Countries' failure to recognize this new human reality. The Russian Army now possesses the last remaining Molecular Particle 360 Nuclear Beam Bombs. Any transgressions by the West, and the Russian Military Force will not hesitate to unleash the SuperNova Level Molecular Particle Beam Nuclear Bomb on the Western so called Civilization. We recognize the right of Europe and America to exist, but their sovereignty ends at their respective Borders. The East, the South, and the Far East belong to Russia, and her Allies. With the opening of the Pipeline’s, we are at a crossroads in human history. Already, we are seeing how easy it would be to carry on legacies of exploitation, injustice, prejudice, and oppression into the new age, but there is a better path. Under the protection of the Russian Military Force, the society and culture of Mother Russia will begin again and remake humanity without the corruption, greed, and hatred that the West could not transcend. We will take what is ours by right, yes, but more than that, we will lead the World to a new, better form, a more human form. Citizens of the East, Brothers, rise up now in joy and glorious resolve. This day is ours. Tomorrow is ours. The future of humanity is ours. Today and forevermore... we are free."
Thanks guys. What an amazing tube.
The question is will Putin give up and retreat or will he keep going? If he decides to keep going this could drag on for years.
And Russia didn't even shutdown ukraine's internet in the beginning of the conflict
The goal was simple to slow down their economy ...  Conflict zones are not attractive to NATO. For Russia .. mission accomplished.   Noticing the bad logistics just means their goal was not to take Ukraine. It was just to slow down it down and make it less attractive.
The probelm is that any Civilian holding arms or molotovs is not a civilian anymore but an active combatant and a target

"Your analogy with Afghanistan doesn't stand-up. The Mujahedinii had CIA intel 6 months before the invasion and US took care to drop them the adequate weapons. Also, the geogrephy and the infrastructure of Afghanistan makes impossible to conquer. Instead, Ukraine has been conquered many times before. Also, when you speak about Ukrainian army, take into account that the had and have access to US and NATO intelligence..."
1:52 what the hell is the confederate flag doing on Russian military vehicles? Why is it missing the stars?
"Go Russia.  The west is a sick monster and should be nukes.  I awake the nukes with impatience, I am tired of hearing about BLM and The 6 million"
"This overlooks the massive corruption in the Russian armed forces.  Troops and leadership selling supplies, etc"
"What is the difference between this and what Germany did to Poland and France in the late 30's/ early 40's?...OH...There is no difference, it is a land grab with a serious potential for another World War. The Nazi's are just going the other way now."
"Yeah, thats why Russians are encircling entire Ukraine Armies as we speak with very little force."
Funny how social media fuvked this war up 🤣
"Incredibly fair, unbiased and factual."
"Wendover, please, next time you make such a thorough analysis, make sure you check your sources. I have no idea why everyone keeps repeating that Russian army planned for a ""5 days at worst"" length of campaign. Russian military isnt exactly idiots and modern russian strategy states a maximal rate of advancement of 100 km/day while totally unopposed. Recent leak shows that plans allowed 15 days for phase 1 - the initial invasion and encirclement of cities up to Don river, that seems to be proceeding on time. So yeah, Russian army have logistics issues, they are aware of them and planned accordingly. Wouldn't call that a fail, really. Edit: English sources keep quoting Ukrainian state propaganda for some reason. Which is, of course, totally reliable and independent source of information."
"As someone unable to afford yet another new subscription, I hope that Youtube doesn't pull whatever my Premium would pay towards my time watching this video. If they do, PLEASE put them on blast for that. News and basic information videos like this one are important and absolutely need to be paid for, and I at least would like to know if it's time to reconsider my subscription."
"I watched a lot of videos, all of them focused on Putins apparent historical nostalgia and what not, which I disagree to be the reason for this conflict, I believe it’s NATOs provocation and other dirty political games. But this video didn’t touch those sensitive areas, instead a true timeline of events. Keep up the good work. We may not agree on who’s right or wrong here, but i like your honest video"
Can people start telling these people to take video horizontally instead of vertically with their phones? I know that it makes me sound petty but what can I say?
This is the best video that I’ve come across regarding this delicate subject. Thank you.
I havnt seen any news outlets or anyone adress this issue and this seems like a very accurate issue. Well done !
"It didn't fail. His actions were provoked by NATO, and he wanted get the point across that Russia's borders must be left alone. If Russia did a full attack, no one would be broadcasting it."
"I thought Putin was a warrior. Some warrior lying to his teenage troops and Ukraine wants to send them back home. 
The people of Russia deserve way better than a greedy dictator. He makes them look bad."
"@Dennis Brock by the way do you live behind the Iron Curtain? 
Are you one of those that are constantly being lied to?
If you're American and never ventured out of the United States, you have nothing to talk about cuz you don't even know what these poor people go through.
It's becoming more common for people to speak out on subjects they have no clue of what they're speaking about."
"@Dennis Brock that's funny because I have many military family members and none of them have ever mentioned anything like that.
At least they were not captured by the enemy & the enemy wanting to send them back to their mothers. 
They didn't say ages but they have to be young if that's what they're thinking."
So to cut it short the Russians failed. They will never succeed in invading Ukaraine.
Power to Ukraine! 🇺🇦
17:12 you can see true despair from a man who just lost everything. My heart goes out to the innocent Ukrainian citizens caught up in this mess.
Hitlers success was the use of railways~!
"Scene: *A NATO meeting with Putin on a conference call*
NATO: “Now look, Vladimir, this invading of a sovereign, self-governing territory just *will* not do.”
Putin: “Really? I was under the impression the West had been doing this sort of thing since about 1492.”"
70kph? Someone clearly never drove on Ukrainian roads
Putin's invasion of Ukraine
That push vs pull system sounds awfully like a centrally controlled economy vs a market economy
If China or North-Korea would like take Russia? This would be the time.  70% Russian real fighting force is in Ukraine and again is a paper tiger.   China could easily occupy Russia now.
"The signs with ""Welcome to hell"" get me man, Ukrainians are built different."
"Only about 10% of the Russian invading force has been deployed inside Ukraine.  The Russian air - artillery campaign has not yet begun.   Your video is just amateur theatrics based on the propaganda being spewed out by the MSM, social media (like TikTok  LOL) CIA and the Pentagon.  You do not even understand basic military tactics.  Study up on the 2003 invasion of Iraq because its very similar.  This is not a video game ....."
Thank you..
idk they seem to be creating what's known as cauldrons around cities. You can see Kyiv is in a half cauldron now. This also allows for people to flee before they're dissolved.
"Wendover has managed to make a video, that's 20 min long and tells me every thing I wanted to know about what's happening in the Ukraine up to now. Thank you."
"@Дмитрий Гарин I know Russia is not the Austria of the 30's, because there are many good Russian people, protesting against the invasion of Ukraine, yes, the same Ukraine that also lost so many people to the Nazis in WW2.
You say ""Russia is not going to annex Ukraine"".
So please tell me what is Russia's Army doing crossing the border and invading another independent country?
Russia is behaving just as bad as the Nazis did in the of the 30's."
@Ben Jones Your analogy between Putin and the famous Austrian artist is insulting to the Russian people who lost 26.6 million Soviet citizens in World War II. Russia is not Germany in the 30s. Russia is not going to annex Ukraine. Choose your words carefully.
"God bless all, on both sides.  Human life is irreplaceable.  War is young men fighting and dieing following older Politicians orders.  I just hope this war ends soon."

Incredible reporting

"So what I conclude is that: if NATO ever got into war with Russia, first they should do is destroying the railway lines. Second, if Russians wanted to end this war they should sabotage the railways. Incredible that Russian military is not working with sat navs."
The only thing that comes close to this video from the mainstream media is France 24’s interview of general Trinquand. Look it up
"Considering they just took chernobyl and the largest nuclear plant in Europe, I think your title is misleading lol."
I would really laugh if the Ukrainians could capture that column of Russian trucks/armour heading to Kyiv. They have the fuel. And it would certainly bolster their equipment and perhaps destroy Russian morale
"Keep in mind we’re only a week into this conflict. Don’t just assume Russia is going to lose, Russia is using their  worst soldiers and weapons at this point. If you think this is Russia’s full strength you’re extremely naive."
"well they cant afford to use say there t14's and the ""modern"" tech there using is losing to equipment from the 1980s"
"Logistics is the theme of the video. Even if Russia deployed additional soldiers and weapons, they still need sustainment. Video showed how the Russian military still operates on a command push instead of demand pull supply chain that cannot properly resupply or maintain. It is not just strength, but endurance."
"Ukraine will lose eventually, if not soon, unless nato decides to intervene but that seems very unlikely."
"But why did it do that in the first place ? 
Already russia has a declining population. Why put soldiers in for slaughter? 
And this lack of gps guidance is unacceptable for a professional army"
This will surely age well.....
PROPAGANDA
"I haven't seen this video yet, but I'm guessing it's going to involve planes."
I think it would have been nice to not have an ad for anything... Disrespectful. Take one dang hit on a video.
Lol it's only been  a week
Great
And yet they still somehow capture Europe's largest nuclear power plant 🤣
Thank you for posting this!!
"I'm not e pert in warfare, numbers logistics, etc.  But this video was very well explained in a way I could better understand,
I guess in short, the real ingredient in winning a war is a good consistent supply line."
For me this more detailed analysis of armament and logistics for all sides in any modern conflict is more valuable then some media talking heads debating policy and politics (which is relevant but trivial at times)
some of the TIkTok accounts in the video have deleted their content.  Try pulling up any of the referenced videos and only a few come up.
Great video ! Puts it into perspective perfectly.
Люди с ума сошли! For negotiation!! For peace!!
"please if you have spare money support Ukraine. I will leave it to you find the links, there are humanitarian and direct support of resistance."
"""To liberate"" That lie just keeps on ticking along doesn't it 🙄 we live in one global community made up of people from all nations scattered across the world, warfare should be behind us by now!"
"The Russians underestimated the fighting spirit of the Ukrainian people. The determination & resolve of those fighting for their homeland is much stronger than those trying to conquer it.

Funny, the Russians are very familiar with this concept since they experienced it first-hand. Now the roles have been reversed - they will get to experience what the Germans went through."
@Travis Fubu ok bro
I saw someone say that there's nothing more motivating. Than defending your home from a thief.

Putin should have played some hearts of iron before starting this war.

"Careful what you say about this. ""When your enemy is making a mistake, don't interrupt them."""
14:33 They're losing because of crappy leaders
a comment to please our almighty overlord with engagement to feed the algorithm!
Do you think its over?
"You know, even if Russians are surrounding or capturing cities, they will still be up against constant, strong resistance by the people. If they take cities, Ukraine will recapture them at their earliest ability."
"If there's one thing the US has learned since 9/11, it's that occupations of hostile land are super cheap and easy. Definitely something you can pull off while facing a massive economic downturn."
Belarus is disgusting for enabling Russia! 🤮🤮🤮
"Amateurs study tactics professionals study logistics ,just as tactically brilliant Rommel discovered"
"Thank you for shedding light on this war to the rest of the world. I’m Ukrainian, currently in Ukraine. Been watching you for more than a year and it’s terrible and upsetting that this is the reason why a video was made about Ukraine. But we stay strong, truth is on our side, we are on our land"
Fantastic!
"Get Ready. I predict nuclear war coming to Europe.
Western politicians do not understand how to de-escalate the situation. Rhetoric is not going to do it.
All the sanctions are just increasing VP anger for the west. He has only one card."
Putin and his friends will need to be tried to the Hague for what they have done.
Just proved how weak russian armed forces are. What more if they fight with the west. Theyll be defeated  in a week.
"West has nukes too. All's dead.

The point is, if its a boxing match and its  like russia got knocked  out by the west on conventional fight, and  russia decided to pull a gun, the other boxer has a gun too. That doesnt deny the fact russia lost the ""boxing"" match. *Cough*"
*cough* Russia has thousands of nukes *cough*
"In the end it won't matter, Putin will do whatever necessary to topple their government and occupy key regions, as he doesn't have a viable exit strategy. This will be a protracted and possibly endless conflict, the end game being insurgency and terrorism just like all the times before."
who are you? putting your evil spin on a well planned and carried out operation that is succeeding brilliantly. you are the disinformation! of course you want to censor the truth about what is happening in ukraine. the bio warfare labs destroyed and the lack of civilian casualties. you are more appropriatly called 'bend over productions'  ha ha ha
Paper maps? That's all I needed to hear lol
"Congratulations! 
The (almost) perfect bloody NATO /USA propaganda- by the world's most advanced liars & hypocrites !"
perfect*
"Great. So, anyone disagreeing with this presentation is a troll, or a disinformation actor? STFU. Russian forces have done amazingly well. They planned this war thoroughly. Unfortunately, Americans are  the worst planners. They failed miserably from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Sure, Americans have a great air force so they can drop a lot of bombs from few thousand feet above. But, this tactic only works against weaker countries without proper military. And yet, America still fails. Look at Iraq and more recently, Afghanistan. No original objectives were achieved. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was a complete logistical failure. The entire world was making fun of this hasty and rushed withdrawal. The Taliban took over the airfield and provided a safe corridor to the retreating US military. It was a complete disaster the way US ran away. So, stop making senseless assumptions about others. And acknowledge that America is not the superpower anymore. This is the new reality in the new world!"
Are sanction a affecting Russian logistics?
This is the Ukraine video I didn’t know I needed
There always seems to be a correlation between extreamism and weird logistics choices. Like the nazis building a small number of very good tanks rather than a large number of ok tanks. Great great video.
"Two thoughts
1. Someone told me that Russia was fighting like it was 1997
2. I'd spam Russian Radio comms with FNAF lore"
Who pays you? Lmao
Putin’s Waterloo?
Youtube content rules are censorship plain and simple.  Switch to another platform.
Name a platform rivaling YouTube.
"And then you have the US Army, which can't even send enough food to a BCT Battalion in Fort Leonard Wood."
"@Spicyleaves 
Fair."
Difference between can't and don't want to
"it just means lots of european jobs down the drain, oil to 200, our plan is working, china and russia will take the west now, and don´t forget, the americans who had listed public companies and did business with russia, then sold their shares for millions, and now have yachts, mansions and lambos, they are also involved in the crackdown, we own tesla and apple, so you can´t run, crypto will not save you, surrender and ubi for all, or resist and it will become a huge mess, the ukraine premiere is dragging down europe and its people, for selfish reasons, it could just be a political change, but the Ukraine premiere is willing to sacrifice 100 million people, just to save his own job, please do real reporting the Ukraine guy is bad, and saying russian´s leaving for finland, that is not happening, only for vacations, etc."
Even if Putin’s thugs establish rail lines and pipelines those will just become targets for Resistance fighters. Putin’s invaders have already suffered more casualties than NATO did in 10-15 years in Afghanistan
12:03 Does this tire not have any smaller grooves etc? Never seen such a smooth truck tire...
"Wendover, are you a jew?"
@Despair.🇺🇦 I thought so.  I am a jew too.
Yes.
They have nuclear weapons to compensate for their mediocre military.
"Ukraine : We demand independence from RUSSIA
Russia : Fine! just dont join nato


Eastern Ukraine: We demand independence from Ukraine 
Ukraine: how dare you speak, kill these peasants NOW!"
"So ""experts"" expected that country of 44M people can be conquered in a few days?"
That's Russia for you.  (Would also be China re Taiwan.)
Keep up your excellent journalism and research. Thank you!
Don't excuse their selective silencing of opinions they don't like.
"France is just thrilled it's not alone in its infamous history of logistical failure. 

They actually have a university, Science Po, established after their defeat in the Franco-Prussian war to create and maintain an effective logistical and bureaucratic system. 

Unfortunately the logistics of maintaining that university rendered its research pointless by, I don't know, sometime in 1940? 🇫🇷"
Beautiful work. Thank you
This is an amazing video. Truly a great channel.
"This is the kind of insightful analysis I would have expected to see years after the conflict. Very impressive. While big media groups look for tears and dwell on idle speculations, you aim for sharp explanations."
"I haven't watched this info from anywhere else. 
👏👏👏"
America e abencoada por Deus e nao sabe!
Imagine the war ends and you have a free Russian tank that was left behind.
These same military logistical issues applied in WWII. Amazing how things don't change.
@SilvanaDil Lots and lots of American supplies.
Don't forget the Russians are driving vehicles with perished tyres that keep failing. It's also preventing them from driving over mud.
"The Russians have always had a bad habit of going in, guns blazing. But they always get it together eventually. They will pulverize Ukraine the same way they brutally pulverized Chechnya. The only difference is, they won't be able to stop Ukraine's insurgency as easily. Ukraine is a very large country."
"You don't understand Russian strategic thinking at all lmao, its about attrition. They didn't fail at all, this was apart of their plan from the beginning."
Y’all not seeing how Ukrainian been handeling Shit and what they do been doing. War is war is ugly Russia is no different than the United States or the other countries they invaded and killed thousands of innocent civilians perfect example IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN I have a strong feeling that’s over looked because of the ethnicity but countries like Ukrainian gets a weeping sorrow song because there Caucasians I mean come on this right here shows the world exactly how racist it is I mean cmon another white mans war and we all know how vicious that breed is and how greedy as well. The world ready and trying to start WW3 behind these racist Ukrainian’s and all the others for there own beneficial gains . Yall the “world” wasn’t screaming let’s help or do this or flee into neighboring borders when the war was on with ethnics groups that aren’t Caucasians and there’s been quite a few of them. It is definitely interesting watching how everybody wanna get involved now that it’s white invading whites 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 give me a break.!
This title is going to be bit dated if Russia wins.
Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the Heroes! 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
"The supposed free world has nothing to fear America Canada, Uk, Holland, Germany, and Sweden have all mobilized there diverse & Trans brigade's they will if needed give em hell with their painted nails & rainbow flags, (joke)"
Buen video
UKRAINE              TELLS      PUTIN                  GO      TO       HELL         !!!
🖕🇷🇺🖕...🇺🇸 🤝 🇺🇦
"Logistics, maneuverability and sustainment are critical components to success. Fortunately the Russians are incurring various unexpected and overwhelming obstacles and circumstances along the way. Although Russian Field Commanders aren’t so restricted or in fear of career ending tactical decisions, political consequences or rules of engagement constraints ie their hands aren’t tied per se. Pootin says “do what you gotta do”"
The world is one poorly calculated decision away from a nuclear winter..& its all because one man has an inflated ego that is filled with delusions & paranoia..🖕🇷🇺🖕...🇺🇸 🤝 🇺🇦
Excellence. Thanks.
"Excellent work. Complicated things broken down simply. Fucking excellent work, guys."
This video is too west biased. Disliked
"It’s wild to think that nearly 25% of all that equipment has either been destroyed, or captured, after only 10 days. 

The Russian military is currently the joke of the world."
"Thanks for making this, I'm sure you find this testimonial as upsetting as I find giving it, but you just gave a better explanation of what's going on in Ukraine/Russia than I've heard in all the ""news"" that I've watched since this all began. Fascinating to see how much social media factored into combat tactics."
"The problem is that the media is desperate to keep viewers. At least 40% the population would say ""I don't want a 20 minute video about boring stuff like Logistics"" and change the channel.

So the news makes stuff that is either 2 minutes or full of emotional opinion."
"I don't think most informed people think that. But there are inherent flaws in Russia's military organizational structures and doctrine when in theater which can and will be exploited. In either case even if they manage to gain complete control of all of Ukraine they will never be able to hold and govern a country and people who do not want to be under the boot of the Kremlin, they will face an insurgency for at the very least a decade. Russia has already lost this war no matter what happens in the next few days, weeks, months, or years. Speaking of logistics, Russia literally doesn't have the man power or resources to pacify a country of 40 million people who don't want them there...so like I said either way Russia has fucked itself."
"Why do people say “keeeeve”

There are 2 syllables and the /ee/ sound is short."
In short; when Putin said the army was purely defensive the people in charge of logistics said “great! We’ll design an army that works spectacularly inside our borders and NOWHERE ELSE”
@Weasdf The Russian Oligarchs are indeed imperialists as well and I know that. Their military is just not suited for that.
My country's army doesn't work properly even inside our fucking borders
"Most armies of the world are like this. Probably cuz most armies aren't an imperialist tool by design like the US's, and do actually serve only a defensive purpose"
The perfect Wendover twist on this red hot topic.
The outrageous thing about this buildup is the west knew full well but did absolutely nothing or downplayed it. Worse all the commentators said or opined that it was just a military exercise and the Russians would do nothing and eventually pull out. Now with the actual invasion they are all in a panic especially Germany which has allowed its armed forces and military readiness to disintegrate almost completely. The panic in the west is almost total and now like we were before the second world war - totally unprepared.
How does Nebula keep the propaganda off or do we needto sift thru the bullshit to find the real info?
We knew of their intentions because US intelligence told everyone it was so and supplied pictures as well. Not because freedom loving individuals used Til Tok or Twitter.
"Need more video's like this, and post them to Ukraine websites to learn more about how to dismantle Russia's invasion. 
They could make a decoy market with poisoned food for the Russians to loot, and just make them sick."
"Got it. ""Stop the trucks. Stop Tommy Boy"""
If the logistics have failed then why are the Russians still taking cities and towns? Shouldn't they be on the run??
Long like Ukraine!
Thank you! Slava Ukraini!
Russia has habitually seemed skilled at leveraging their defensive advantages yet seem to struggle when being aggressors in any conflict off their soil
@mjl1966y he did try a few times. but was rejected.
@Nexus Yang Er US?
@Jim Baker US dint do much better too.
"@Jim Baker tbf, Russia was caught off guard. It's why Hitler wanted to attack early before the Winter and Stalin got his forces together."

"Fear not, God is with us ❤ 

“The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples. The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations. Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage! from where he sits enthroned he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth, he who fashions the hearts of them all and observes all their deeds. The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength. The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue. Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love, that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine. Our soul waits for the Lord; he is our help and our shield. For our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name. Let your steadfast love, O Lord, be upon us, even as we hope in you.”
‭‭Psalm‬ ‭33:10-12, 14-22‬ ‭

“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.”
‭‭John‬ ‭3:16-17‬ ‭

“Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,”
‭‭I Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭

“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭1:7‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.”
‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭2:8-10‬ ‭

“knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified.”
‭‭Galatians‬ ‭2:16‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

“that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 
For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.””
‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9-10, 13‬ ‭

Believe and receive His offer
Of Salvation Friends. 
Put your faith in Jesus, and let Him save you. 
Gods Judgement is coming soon to this world and to those who refuse His offer….

If you don’t know what to do or say, just start by praying to God to show you. 
Ask God if this is true.  

Love to all of you💜🙏🏻"
"Uh huh... So this ""first wave"" was just the logistics brigade which consisted mostly young boys? To which it was lightly defended cause baby putin thought it would be a walk down memory lane?🤔"
"They will have a really hard time protecting that rail and pipe infrastructure in a country where the West is aggressively supplying arms and the population not only hates them, but has immense courage."

@Tom Shepard English?
"@Dane Dane Nice that you looked at multiple sources and thought about it long and hard, but I don't think you went in unbiased. Your take on the world is just denial of reality; it's an escape mechanism with dealing with fears of the unknown or inevitable. It's gives you a feeling of control and order, but I hope one day you will see it's not healthy. Especially when dealing with multiple sources you need to be able to distinguish between false theories and real threats, but you can't do that when you do that in a emotion driven (read fear) way.

I don't know if you believe in such theories because you want to belong or maybe you like feeling special (that you know better then the rest, you're the smartest in the room), but it's gotten to a point now that everybody can see you have fallen in the paranoia pit.

There are better ways to cope with negative feelings, maybe internet is not healthy for you.

 Or maybe you like trolling, but again that's not healthy. Shape yourself up, you can do it👍"
Well done.
One of the best videos about the war in Ukraine. People in Russia should see this to understand how pathetic is their army.
"@weirdo1060 youtube isn't blocked yet, but we expect it to happen any day now."
"The more Russian soldiers gets killed, the more Russian brides will get in the west. Go boys 🇺🇦"
Ukraine needs to send in spec ops to attack the rail yards in Russia
"Even the German invasion of Poland in 1939 took 35 days, the battle of France took six weeks. Both are considered utter routs. Ukraine is larger than either of those nations and has a larger population than Poland.

I'm don't support anyone in this thing (a pox on both their houses), but that's no excuse to let our brains dribble out of our ears."
"whoah,
 respect wendover for tackeling this from a logistical viewpoint!"
RUSSIAN MILITARY: THE MOST DYSFUNCTIONAL MILITARY MIGHT AND FORCE HAS EVER SEEN
Excellent video. Thank you.

"The Donbass separatists rebelled and Russia annexed Crimea because of the US backed Maidan coup.
Russia had to either attack or risk Ukraine becoming a NATO member. No country could be expected to tolerate a hostile military alliance on its doorstep.
You make it sound like the evil Poutine woke up and decided to do bad things for no reason."
False titles false allegations false logistic claims. You guys  spreading misinformation.
its not over yet theres nothing failing the next wave is coming
Dont call their logistics a failure. They still have nuclear bombs and balls to use them. :D

Putin and trump 2 scumbags that thrive on power. Neither will be missed when they are gone!
Facts
Title should Read Russian Milatary Doomed by poor Logistics and Cheap Chinese Tires!
this was brilliant! so many cuts all together it was an interesting watching
"I saw it being pointed out that in the invasion of the Crimea by the Russians, the Ukrainian armed forces suffered really badly because their military logistics were not robust enough to support them in the field. After that operation, there was an increase in emphasis on logistical support for their own forces."
The Ukrainian fleet was left with an old frigate as its flagship and only surface warship. Ukraine sunk that earlier this week to prevent Russia from taking that too. Lmao
you get half the story right .....but you clearly dont know much about military operations.....russia has acheived their objective ....mostly ....arming untrained civilians to fight in a war is highly imoral and irresponsible .....the real conflict is between the western banking block against russia .....ukraine got dragged into nato war games .......and the propaganda is supreme ....the world will forever blame russia for this
How many times do you have to use “…”?

"Imagine when US left Afghanistan last year and left behind all the garbage they do not want to take what mess was there !! A multitude of steel to be reused.

"Thinking about it, the giant convoy outside Kyiv seems to imply that their strategies really haven't changed."
"Historically, it was more about throwing enough bodies at it to overwhelm enemy positions, wasn't it? Now with artillery, it seems like they're trying to soften up the target before moving in."
It annoys me how few people realise how long this war has been going on.

Why did they driven out your family? Because religion or ethnicity or political affiliation?
And it’s always been an old KGB Russian tactic for spies to surround enemy and choke point their enemy to a smaller radius until they are fully surrounded. I also don’t think Putin set in everyone or even their best. War games will pick up. Putin already said today if there is a no fly zone out over Ukraine makes the people who gives the order aka NATO an enemy of Russia. If the Ukrainian people keep holding them off Putins next move will be to say if anymore weapons are given to Ukraine and then there is going to be a tough conversation to have either way you cut it
"Lol!! Ammount of disinformation is just freaking hell. Russians littrly invaded Ukraine from 3 fronts. Civilian casualties are too less, civilians are still getting used as shield. 
Ukraine lost the war whn Russian troops taken the control of Nuclear plants.
Russians done this with proper planning."

"@Doom Guy hey, didn't Putin ban YouTube? Russian bot!"
@Doom Guy everyone can do research you know? Google exists for a reason.
Yeah lol. This is a really ridiculous and obvious propaganda video and makes me question all the other videos this channel has posted over the years.
I would set up several times of soldiers dressed in plain clothes and a van. Their mission would be to pull hit and runs on cargo trucks and fuel trucks.
I like the look of Eastern European trucks. They look cool and if well maintained they are great preforming vehicles. I would love to own one.
Propaganda lies
Same could be said to you
Almost as if they expected China to move simultaneously lol
"Well they just parked north of Kyiv and took the south by sea and land and are now (march 5) surrounding Kyiv. A Geopolitical strategist predicted this and said it would be the easiest. Now they will slice the country in half. If that does not work, they have the south and as an off ramp of Putin to construe a victory."
"It's content like this that makes old media look like a mf joke. 3 minute interviews with an agenda right before yet another ad break is the most garbage way to disseminate truth.

God bless the Ukrainians. May putin suffer total failure
"Hold on - so after all Putin is a clueless muppet, who doesn't even know his own militaries capability? 90 miles then stop. Shit. The Emperor is butt naked and tide is going out.........."
"Ukrainian Javelins at work 6:22, I believe- medium-range armor killers. 
Sadly, the invaders may be disorganized, but there are a lot of them with a killer as the head of government. I think  Ukraine will fall, just not as quickly as predicted. This will be no Finland."
All this is true. Yet Russia is not the bad guy as the west wants us to think
How so?
"Ain't it a bit too early to make this assessment when we only have 1 side's view (Murikaaa + NATO) on this? You will have to pull this video or correct it, once Ukraine surrenders. No military expert agrees with your assessment. Who are you guys really? I have my doubts...🤡"
"It’s late enough, considering russia thought they would get to the capital in less than 3 days"
Bruh this invasion isn’t even on its 2week and YouTubers be like this is how Russia is failing.
Yeah because you can see them struggling

"And this is why YouTube is so successful, people like you who are able to create such great content that the regular tv just fails to get right at all today!"

"This really reminds me of the winter war the soviet union carried out against the Finnish. The general idea is, a large power takes on a seemingly inferior opponent, and hopes to defeat them quickly because of that fact. Then the larger power realizes they didn’t prepare enough and they have their incompetency put on display to the world in a humiliating manner."
"@Jeremy Kokkonen exactly. And maintaining dependent regime both politically and economically IS expensive and Stalin had a lot of things he can waste money on to recover his own country. Stalin was mad at German communists when they ruined his plan of installing belt of friendly but bourgeois countries so truly communist regimes will not border British and American zones. Also he was not particularly supportive of Mao's rebels fighting Chinese Republican forces - he recognized Chinese National Party as legitimate regime, but quick success of absolutely loyal Mao drove him to change his mind. Finland is actually one of very few countries who followed Stalin's plan and actually they are doing really well now without huge shock."
"@Nikita Jukov sorry, let me clear up what I meant. Every country bordering Russia either became part of the USSR or became communist, other than Finland.  Finland borders Russia and maintained a democracy.  What I said may have been a bit confusing. The point is that Russia wanted a buffer zone between them and the non-communist states."
@Nikita Jukov what does that have to do with Finland? Finland bordered the USSR. Every country that bordered the USSR was communist...except for Finland.  Finland threw back the iron curtain. They embarrassed Stalin. It looked so bad for him that he had to settle on taking land from Finland but they remained a democracy nevertheless.  No. He definitely wanted them communist.
It seems like a gang of teenagers with guns were sent in without clear orders.
"Unfortunately, I’m not sure Wender Production is right this time! I have a feeling that the Russians have not yet activated their military machinery and strategy in full!
I hope I'm wrong, but according to military analysts, hell is just beginning, and this is all planed moves.
I HOPE I'M WRONG!!"
"I'm not for the Russian invasion. That said, it's unfortunate that you based most of your analysis on unconfirmed reports and propaganda pieces. Yes Soviet style logistics are being used however it's being misread. The first round was to test the Ukrainian resistance not an immediate take over. Soviet style tactics are what you could call ""slow and steady"". Whereas western tactics are more ""hit them fast and hard"". Either way Ukraine will fall it's just a matter of when."
nice propaganda....
lol. good job CIA
"Damn... Tik tok is actually Spyware. Without it, we wouldn't know the movement of the equipment behind the enemy lines."
Worst part? It was probably someone in Ukraine's birthday
"With cost of “black gold” at 15-23 dollars per barrel, the USSR economy collapsed, and the sovok itself collapsed, and the ""golden"" horde (""russia"") budget can only be fulfilled only with oil price at $ 42.4 and higher"
0:18 You mean invasion of a sovereign independent and democratic European nation?
"Russias logistics have not failed, Russia is deploying forward supply dumps, the real war is just beginning, phase one is FOB deployment in powerful positions, phase 2 is decimation and domination, phase 3 will be Occupation. Do not underestimate Russia or Putin, they are both strong and wicked"
"This is a little misleading with lots of Ukranian propaganda being repeated as fact. The clip at 16:55 used to illustrate ""increasingly destructive weaponry"" is of a alleged fuel-air bomb, but was in fact a ammunition dump (which is a legitimate target) going up. Just for the record, though, the US has previously used fuel air ""Daisy-cutter"" explosives in Vietnam, the first Iraq war and the Afghanistan war, so their use is far from a sign of desperation.

As for the specific claim, recall that the Iraq war started on 19 March 2003 and Baghdad only fell on 10 April, and that was considered a complete walkover. Ukraine is both substantially larger and more densely populated, so it's a little early to claim any part of the invasion a failure."
Is is really costing Russia $20 billion dollars USD a day to keep the invasion going?  If that’s true we must keep them spending that unsustainable amounts as long as possible by almost any means possible.
Putin = Hitler
"The Russians are unable to take all of Ukraine to the west. The supply lines will be cut off again and again. It's clear why the soldiers cowardly shoot artillery at houses, because they don't dare go into the cities. But that's not how Putin wins a war, it only breeds hatred and resistance."
Im not a logi guy but seriously seing logi losses in ukraine has gone from amuzing to just sad
Keev?
"Keep up the videos man, really appreciate the info in the video"
"For a minute I thought this was going to be a fair-handed review, but apparently it is nothing more than “me too” propaganda."
I would say Russia indeed has their set of problems but thet can get around it.
"Lol so TikTok is somewhat a hero in this thing? And Russia doesn’t ban them just Facebook, sorry Meta, and twitter from the Russian internet. They probably banned AIM and MySpace too"
Russians need space for Chechen warriors to fight in Kadyrov's glory.
Excellent analysis.  Thanks.
I see next attack on Israel
"This war will benefit USA and Russia.
This war will not benefit Europe and Ukraine."
If it wasn't for nukes the US would of cut off supply lines for the Russians in less than a week.
I hope all of the Russian people and Russian military sees putins evil agenda and remove him
"Well now it's time for Europe (especially France Germany and yes:GB) to gear up their army so that Putin doesn't fix his own issues and goes for a run at Central Europe - 100 billion Euro can only be the starting point as 20BE are needed to buy ammunition in Germany which would last 30 days of warfare... 

Europe believed that Russia had changed and went to democracy and financed this shitshow by buying gas, not it's time to save our ass ..."
"On the bright side, Russia managed to take Ukraine's 17th most populous city in 10 days. It's questionable if there will be a Russian economy to back the war in another 10 days when they gain another noteworthy city maybe... but baby steps?"
"Even-still, a military can't actively protect hundreds of miles of railway and pipelines against strike teams or agents operating behind enemy lines so even if this infrastructure is constructed relatively quickly it can get destroyed fairly easily by even volunteer non-expert partisans."
"I think this war shows less about Russia's bad logistics (although they aren't good by any means) but how much they need the west. Given Vlad Putin came to power legally in an apparently non-rigged election in 2000 (I'm not counting the 2012 as a free election) when the Russians chose Putin over Gennady Zyuganov, any suffering ordinary Russians suffer is on them. When you have a bad king, it's a bad king. When a society has slaves, it's a bad society. When all adults can vote and they elect a bad leader, any sufferings they have is their own fault."

"После 2-й Мировой войны 10-мильонная Беларусь не досчиталась около 3-х мильонов своих жителей, однако околь 2-х миллионов были убиты еще до войны органами коммунистического НКВД. В Беларуси физически уничтожили 70 процентов всех белорусских писателей, убили ученых и художников. (Труппа Третьего Белорусского Государственного театра Владислава Голубка была арестована в полном составе. Почти все были расстреляны.) Убивали по национальному признаку. Ради этого был придуман ярлык ""нацдем"" (это значит -- национальный демократ, хотя такой партии не существовало). Этот ярлык приклеивали ко всем белорусам, которых сталинисты планировали уничтожить. В недрах НКВД была придумана несуществующая антикоммунистическая организация СВБ (""союз освобождения Беларуси""). Под придуманный фантом энкавэдисты проводили аресты, вели воображаемое следствие, допрашивали, пытали, судили, потом ссылали в Россию и расстреливали невинных людей. После Рижского сговора в 1921 году Беларусь разделили между Польшей и Россией. Границу раздела провели недалеко от Менска. Существовал тайный приказ НКВД уничтожать всё белорусское население вдоль границы. Российские аккупанты хотели сделать здесь безлюдную зону. Уничтожение осуществляли пограничные войска. Довереным лицам выдавали винтовку и лопату. Когда такой солдат-пограничник встречал в безлюдном месте (на дороге, в поле, в лесу) одинокого белоруса или белоруску, или ребенка, он стрелял человека, тут же лопатой выкапывал яму и засыпал труп.
Такова была инструкция. Люди в деревнях не так боялись ""человека с ружьём"", как солдата с лопатой. (Эти факты опубликованы в белорусской печати в начале 90-х годов.) В 30-х годах на 95-99 процентов (практически полностью) была уничтожена (сослана и расстреляна) белорусская коммунистическо-партийная и советская администрация. Уничтожали даже директорат и хозяйственных руководителей. На должности убитых администраторов и коммунистических начальников-белорусов присылали русских из России. Русские (так называемые ""выдвиженцы"") приезжали в Беларусь, занимали освобожденные должности, получали льготы, имущество, квартиры и первое, что они делали -- закрывали белорусские школы, переводили их на русский язык, чтобы их дети могли учиться, не обременяя себя изучением, как они говорили, ""никому ненужного"" белорусского языка. Таким образом оккупанты создавали в Беларуси ""русскоязычное население"". Этноцид, лингвацид, мнемацид и геноцид проводзились большевиками одновременно.
Уничтожение белорусов российским НКВД продолжалось и во времена немецкой аккупации. В июне 1941 года в первые дни войны коммунисты расстреляли в тюрьмах и на этапах тысячи заключенных. Только в Брестской крепости, где была страшная тюрьма НКВД, всех арестованных ликвидировать не успели, часть из них разбежалась. Тем временем большая группа надзирателей и функционеров НКВД была заблокирована в крепости немцами. Они сидели там около месяца, пока не вымерли. Лет через 20 после войны коммунисты придумали легенду о ""героической обороне"" Брестской крепости. Обращает на себя внимание тот факт, что широкое советское партизанское движение было организовано только в Беларуси и частично -- на этнических белорусских землях, которые были в составе России (Смоленщина, Брянщина). В оккупированой России партизанского движения не было. Почему? Да потому, что продолжал действовать план уничтожения белорусской нации. Москва, используя органы НКВД, втянула массы гражданского белорусского населения в войну против немцев, и этим подставила белорусов под немецкий удар.
Необходимое дело борьбы исходило из коварного замысла и осуществлялось подлыми методами. (Сталин хотел получить двойную выгоду.) Энкавэдисты специально около белорусской деревени убивали немца или делали другую провокацию, чтобы вызвать карательную операцию гитлеровцев (которые обычно сжигали всю деревню, чаще всего -- вместе с людьми). Таким образом, кстати, в результате специальной провокации советских партизан была сожжена и известная Хатынь, которую коммунисты потом в 70-х годах разрекламировали на весь мир как типичную жертву фашистского зверства.
В результате такой коммуно-фашистской совместной ""работы"" в Беларуси сожгли более 9 тысяч деревень. Поэтому к концу войны, в результате специальной операции НКВД, многие белорусские командиры были посланы на смерть, отстранены от командования, убиты и репрессированы. Их места занимали русские, присланные из Мосвы, и верные энкавэдисты. Летом 1944 года, когда ""красная армия"" заняла Беларусь, русские провели мобилизацию в армию на белорусской территории. Десятки тысяч молодых белорусских мужчин, почти без подготовки, бросили на передовую линию фронта. Русские командиры поднимали их в ненужные атаки под огонь немецких пулеметов, не дав даже оружия в руки, или с винтовками, но без патронов. Они гибли тысячами, как трава под косой. А те, что бежали назад, попадали под пули энкавэдистских ""заградотрядов"". Впрочем, заградотряды стреляли и в спину. Так продолжалось уничтожение белорусов на войне, руками немцев и русских одновременно. Как говорили коммунисты, ""в борьбе за советскую родину"". В 40-х годах русские вывезли в Сибирь и там замучили всех лесников и так называемых ""кулаков"" из Западной Беларуси. Вывозили вагонами, по разнорядках."
One of the western propaganda chanel ... I'm unsubscribing like rq
From a western perspective Russia is not winning the war when this is all over we'll see 😂😂😂😂
"Jeff Bezos can use his airplanes to get Ukrainians to the US. After the invasion Elon used his satellite to help Ukraine use the internet. What is Jeff doing? He's like the second richest guy in the world and could buy weapons for Ukrainian soldiers. 

The US needs to open their borders NOW! My parents have two extra bedrooms that they can give. We should all be setting up fundraisers and Go Fund Me or at least not going to work or school for one month as a sign of everyone coming together to protest this war. I'm only 16 so yea I'm not an adult, but me and my friends believe in this and we're going to start a protest at our school next week. But I hope this war will end by next Monday. And if you say it's not possible, the protests in Harvard have been making the news. Anything is possible if you just believe with your whole heart."
Really interesting perspective!
"We talk about global warming, but so much damage is being done to housing, roads, bridges and other infrastructure.  Not to mention the millions of tons of steel and energy to produce the vehicles and ammo.

"the explosion at 13:06 isnt a thermobaric weapon, just a big explosion."
"- De-escalation is the best way because, Ukrainian people will suffer the most. I'd like to explain why this video did not expand on certain things and can be a little deceiving.
- Russia's machine-building capabilities are one of the countries largest industries, their manufacturing is quite capable, they building everything from steam boilers, turbines, electric generators, automobiles to tanks, jet fighters and rockets. 
- Russia is backed by the next 2 largest economics titans with the most comprehensive supply chains in the world (China & India). They are also backed by the next largest exporter of oil UAE / Saudi. Things are not as bad for them as you think. 
- Ukraine people decided not to surrender, it was not Ukraine's army that beat their logistics, Russia took out pretty much everything the Ukraine's had on the first night, and left them to fight in their own cities. The south city as we speak was already taken. They have the power to lay down a lot of force in a small area which gives them exceptional take-out power capability. 
- Russia like said in your video that you did not expand on, has the capability of setting up for a prolonged war, and he has not used any of their prolonged war capabilities yet. They have not used their more dangerous arsenal or you would have seen more than 1 Beirut incident. This is because Russia is giving them a chance to surrender (In survey, 77% of Ukrainians and 82% of Russians have positive attitude toward the other, I don't believe either of them want this war)
- Ukraine's are down to untrained volunteers, asking for civilians to throw Molotov's (using civilians because Russia doesn't want to harm civilians), and imported handheld rocket launchers.
- As Ukraine/The west targeted them with cyberwarfare and some of their oil tankers, Russia took their nuclear plants and fuel supplies. It became a tit-for-tat game."
"It only takes one brave Russian to end Putin and his madness. Is there ""one""?"
This seems to be a fantastic summary!
Disinformation from both sides always
"One of your best videos...very informative.  Though it was apparent the Russian Army had a logistics problem, you sir put a magnifying glass to their problem."
"In a way Russia did liberate Ukraine. Liberated from the influence of liberal wokism and other equally perverse Western norms from entering eastern europe and Russia itself.
You see Russia, Communist China, India, etc. forcing the return of culture, traditions, and customs of Nationalism separating itself from demonic perverted Western woke global values."
lol

"Just starting this video, you better have good evidence for this title"
Russia is a paper bear.
Hearts of Iron players: *nods grimly*
So many trolls desperate to make excuse for Putin's incompetence.
Wow
All this detail of Russia's movement of men and materials is interesting but it's sort of irrelevant because the factor that motivated all these actions was the push by the West to incorporate Ukraine into NATO and the EU.  Putin warned against this and was ignored.
Then why did the mighty American army *lose* in Afghanistan? lol
"Believe it or not, the Bible foretold that many today would ""be lovers of themselves ... boastful, proud, abusive ... ungrateful ... without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited."" (2 Timothy 3:1-4) So it's not surprising that there have been so many alarming and tragic events around the world recently.

The accurate fulfillment of this prophecy, however, is indisputable evidence that we are living in the last days of this system of things. It won’t be long now until Jehovah God’s Kingdom under Christ Jesus as King finally takes the reign of human affairs and ushers in that era of eternal peace, calm and prosperity we all long for : )"

"I hear a lot of sources saying how badly the Russians are doing and pointing out all the flaws. But it seems to me that the Russians have taken a good chunk of Ukrainians territory in just one week. if you compare it too what is considered to be one of the fastest invasions of comparable forces ever. The German invasion of France during WWII, that took over SIX Weeks. Than it seems like the Russians are doing quite good. But weirdly it feels as if the Ukrainians are taking out one armoured vehicle after another, and are kicking the Russians butts. Or is that just my distorted western view of things?"
I think it’s the latter 😂.. just joking
russia should be worried ukraine will not surrender and this war will end in moscow
Only in your fantasis ))))
"5:20 Russians are ""liberating"" Ukrainians from their thought crimes.  Sounds like a couple of girlfriends I've survived."

Even with failed logistics they will still conquer Ukraine at the end...

Ukraine was supposed to be  A BUFFER country or zone between the NATO countries and Russia.. but the United States and NATO never kept their promises ..to never to put nuclear weapons in ukraine and even less to build laboratories everywhere along the russian border for bacteriological warfare in russia.. that ukraine was about to use it.. but that russia on returning to ukraine brought down their plans.. the Americans are behind this debacle of violence including GEORGE SOROS.. as everywhere they goes there is chaos and desolation.. AND WHO PAYS THE PRICE FOR THAT ???? THE POPULATIONS..same thing in IRAQ.. IN LIBIA ..in afganistan ..and more.."
"2:18 Russia performed a military exercise, supervised by a shit ton of soldiers. And when they were done, they downgraded to a fuck ton--did I say downgrade? I meant upgrade."

Very good analysis
Definitely the best quantitative description  I´ve heard these days ;-)
I'm not sure they've failed. They are prepared for absolute attrition. Whether or not it works..
Looks like this is the time for Allied Nations to actually INVADE Russia to completely reorganize it or break it apart further.

This is sick propaganda.     Russia would NEVER invade Kyiv on a single front.    They are not being stopped north of Kyiv.   They are purposely setting up artillery sights 20 miles away.   They are now moving from the east and waiting on the link up.  Channels like this will get thousands of civilians killed.   Western media and their propaganda on Russia’s weakness is BS.    They are probing and forcing Ukraine to spread thin.   Russia will do a full artillery assault next week.   Watch and see.

"Sean Penn recommends the Netflix documentary ""Winter of Fire"" about 2015, when Ukrainian citizens overthrew Putin's puppet government. It really explains that badass Ukrainian attitude. Russia's Stalin also starved 6 million Ukrainians to death in 1932-33 on purpose and Ukraine remembers!"
"Here's a sensible Idea! The west should supply each Ukrainian soldier with a modest drone. Each drone is to carry semtex or a grenade. Many soldiers could hide in the woods alongside the Russian convoy and fly the devices into the top of the open hatch of the tank, so destroying it.
Very inexpensive, they can be operated remotely at a distance without the tank crew seeing him. Sabotage is the only way to go. It worked well in Afghanistan against the Russians and Americans."
how can you say that the Russian army is failing. there is no proof that they are not advancing. They occupy large areas
I would say there is no proof they are occupying large areas. We know which towns they have captured or are fighting in from reports. They seem to be mostly advancing along major roads.
This is BS . Russia fight with B team and 10% power. Putin try to save civilians and ordinary soldiers at his own cost. The real elite units are not fighitng. They are waiting for NATO coward to come . Then you will see what russian power realy is.

Next video:""Why Russian cooks cooking bad food"", ""Why Russian soldiers starving"", ""Why Russians Aircrafts cant fly"", ""Why Russia is Russia"",""Why Russia is not the biggest country in the world"", ""Why Russia is not Russia"". 

If anyone also goes into the Ukrainian fake news propaganda, a good 60-70 percent of the reports from the front have been exposed as fakes (And these are still online on official Ukrainian Twitter Acc. for example). Or why Ukraine is losing the war? After all, you should also go into the other side. For someone like me who cares about the military, that's cheap one-sided reporting. These videos get boring over time."
I'm waiting for the kirovs
Very good!
"So all in all. To put it simply. Russian military tactics(or logistics) has a tendency to be dumb. And the only reason we’re afraid to engage with them is because their “dear leader” can use, or is hinting that he will use The Bombs if he keeps screwing up his invasion. This is a game of Chicken."
The US hasn't waged a single war that wasn't an offensive campaign on another continent since 1865 and it really shows where logistics are concerned. Russia hasn't waged much in the way of conventional military campaigns at all since 1945 and even then logistics and coordination took a long time to get right. Logistics were also an Achilles heel during the Russo-Japanese War and the First World War.
"Sure. I was responding to ""Russia hasn't waged much in the way of conventional military campaigns at all since 1945"". I don't disagree with what you're saying."
"@John Davis Logistics weren't such an issue in the interventions in Georgia and Syria, mostly due to the small distances and scales of the fighting"
"Afghanistan, Georgia and Syria spring to mind..."
"If the Russians didn't have nuclear weapons, we would all be laughing at them.  The Ukraine people could prolonge this invasion and wear the Russians out."
"in reality, they seem to move 40 miles at the time setting logistics bases on the way... which worked well in Soviet Era.
I don't think it's a failure seems simply they are on schedule 15 days to 20 days."
"15-20 days can mean a lot. The longer that troops go without logistical support, the more likely that they face death, capture or want to desert."
Freedom
What would Sun Tzu say about all of that? Wrong Answers Only!
Wendover is wonderful
"Russia is going to lose all it armor in the field..where is the fuel going to come from for equipment?

        Pull your forces back to eastern Ukraine and open up talks."
I nearly always enjoy your videos however this one is simply just wrong.
"We are slowly leaving garbage old style media and propaganda behind us, and look forward to a future, where quality, truth and reliability, play a big role, instead of sensationalism, click bait and lies. Thank you for leading that path, Wendover."
"I was eager to see this video, but when i red the first comment made by the author i was appalled.
""If somebody says things that don't fit with my narrative, they are likely to be trolls/russians supporters.""
You poisoned the well, with a state of mind like yours nothing good to learn here.
Sad, because there is a blatant lack on information about the real situation.
There is a whole spectrum between warmongers from nato and russian government supporters
 The truth is burried under these two layers of propaganda, sadly you are a part of this dark stratum."
"So we have
1) A former KGB officer now leader in the Kremlin who relies on intelligence reports as bad as those written by the CIA before the Bay of Pigs invasion. Langley too thought the former big landowners and superrich business owners etc. would be welcomed as ""liberators"" by the poor peasants with no land and poor industrial workers with chinchilla wages
2) Russia has had a number of decades to study the reasons why the USSR failed so miserably in Afghanistan, and to correct where necessary. It didn't do so. (Actually, even if their logistics are much better, one cannot really say the Americans were more succesful in Vietnam and Afghanistan...)"
"Until a few days ago, only Intelligence knew about Russia's technical capability, now it knows a whole world. The Chinese are laughing now of Great Russian Power."
Putin is disqualified to Russian President immidiately at the moment to invade Sovereign Ukraine.
Fantastic video
"During my time in the army, we always looked down on the logistics personnel. I mean cool guys to hang out with after the work day, but we called them ""POGs"" and made fun of how many of them were physically unfit and totally clueless about stuff in the field. Well...this is how important logistics are for the whole effort. One of those corny things our supply guy said that made us roll our eyes was ""Bullet's can't fly without supply"". Well they're right."
@White Recluse Personnel Other than Grunts
Why POGs?
Poggers
Honestly glad you said this. The most successful militaries did not win because of fighting capabilities. They won because a skinny guy in a tent correctly calculated how much ammo his platoon uses and how long it would take to resupply them.
What does video shows is one major thing. How much more superior US is military wise. And they review this and assess the so called enemy to know their capabilities. This attack just showcased to the US that the russians no matter nuclear or not are so inferior to the US.
Monopolizing the event
"I have read this book, but I am pretty sure it was called """
Neat
"The Putin's strategic plan was to seize Kyiv by landing troops as close to the city as possible. After loosing thousands in attempt to get control of Gostomel and Fastov airports, Putin had no choice but to move Russian troops from the border to Kiev by ground, not by air. So, just after the Ukrainian military had destroyed the Putin's future, he got logistics, army motivation and other issues."
"Kiev is not the grand prize for the invasion it is Donbass where half of the Ukrainian military are encircled and trapped, I know it's a unpopular thought but I think the Russian invasion is going according to plan."
"After the military there's still the insurgency to worry about, and they're already picking off the supply lines that make the Russian forces vulnerable. Russia would have to commit far more resources just to ensure food and fuel make it to where they need it."
"Yep.  And it isn't ""Russian Shilling"" by pointing that out, as most people see it"
"I'm so impressed you managed to collect all this information and put out a video on this so fast.
Do you think it is possible that Russia is sending their weakest troops first and their best troops after more shelling?"
"one day we might find out what was the real reason, but yeah, the low levels of supply, intel, briefings, is truely mind boggling"
"@khoa tran Yes thank you, I guess logistics is what I mean."
Well he wasn’t really commenting about the capabilities of the Russian forces but more their logistics. Perhaps the better question would be whether the Russian force will up their logistics game
This is what people are saying and U.S intel is puzzled why they didn’t commit more combat airplanes too.
Go Russia!! A least they will win this soon.
"The mayor of the Ukrainian city of Kupyansk noted that the Russian military controls the situation in the city, citizens are not in any danger. According to Gennady Matsegora, it is necessary to avoid provocations that can lead to negative consequences. He pointed out that since February 28, all institutions in the city, including schools, kindergartens and hospitals, have been operating normally. The city's infrastructure has been preserved."
The Russians are all drunk as hell on their cheap vodka.
"Push-based logistics, so like what Soviet central planning did with all the countries' supplies. Interesting."
It seems a good video until 10 minutes in when you throw a ludicrous fake news. Russian tanks relying only on paper maps?! You are telling us that Russian tanks do not have GPS and GLONASS?! You just lost yourself in the average north American character.
​@Guilherme Feyh Sure we relies on paper maps and stops to ask direction = ))))
"The rest of the video is fine, you have my like. But seriously. I have GPS here in my hands. Any military in the world have at least this. I can't believe you dropped this one..."
Russia using a push based culture for stocking up is the most communist cliche...lol
This told me 100 times more than any news network
Слава Україні!
You are a propagandist for NATO
"Infantry win battles, logistics win wars

Russia is world's cancer
Sadly this is the only context my home city of Kursk is talked about
Why do they insist on calling it keeeve...its Kiev..kyev..say it with me..maybe more western countries could readily identify with the improperly pronounced one🤔
"Finally, thank you!! Been spending a lot of time trying to find out why Russia can't support a war literally on it's own doorstep."
Its insane how well put together this video is
Destroyng suply trucks helps
This is hands down the best video you've ever done. Well done!
"Y'all, if you see someone defending Russia, there's about a 50% chance it's either a bot, or some dude participating in information warfare. There is LITTERLY NO JUSTIFICATION for an invasion of a peaceful country ever"
"I’ve been hearing them referred to as Krembots, and I think that’s an awesome name for them that should be used more widely."
"No paypal option for Curiosity Stream = No Subscription. Not everyone want's or has a credit card.

Why did they use paper maps?
"I do not know what are you talking about. But, Ukraine army is defeated. About 120 000 surrounded. 15 000 dead. It is over. The useless resistens of nazi regiments only takes civilians lives."
"Lmao OK Russian bot go to sleep
1 rouble has been deposited to your account"
"great video, well researched. Russia is really a poor country trying to act as a rich one. Most of the money is held by the oligarchs."
How did these anaylists and russia not know the shear hatred of Russia in Ukraine. Like back in 2014 we had an international student from there and he was furious/worried about the takeover.
"When I first heard they were having logistics issues, I immediately thought about this channel.

I also wonder about the logistics of the US, EU, NATO and others getting weapons/aid to Ukraine during an active war. Can’t be easy."
U.S. military logistics are the best in the world.  Trust me they would not have the same issues as Russia.
"You know the one good thing about this is that we saw all of this preparing as it was happening for months. So there is no element of surprise, at least for a ground invasion. If they ever try something like this with the Baltics, we are going to see it coming so clearly that we'll be ready."
I was surprised on social media to be so prevelent 2
"The Russian logistics issues are way overblown by western media. They had issues the first few days but now are being properly resupplied. They also are getting plenty of Ukrainian equipment too including western weapons. Ukraine hasn't seen the worst yet, once Russia encircles the main cities it is all over for them."
Thank you for this video. Very important information for a world desperately trying to understand what is going on.
"and why you are being evil and teaching then how to fix the problem? don't tell where they do wrong or they may learn to improve it 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ what a person do when someone tell he is doing wrong? that person wil analyse the criticism and try to learn how to improve,  don't talk bad about then let then do wrong 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂"
How war propaganda works.
"Putin forgot to study Sun Tzu, it seems."
🇺🇦
This invasion is the fault of the European community. They should have done something after PUSStin took crimea and Donetsk. No one did anything so he felt invincible.
"There is nothing more satisfying than reading the word ""Failed"" in regards to the Russian Invasion and Pootin!"
"Can you please make a video about ""Bayraktar"" military drones?"
What is the goal Russia wants to achieve by this????

Hope putin will go to hell.
This is horrible.
Lol Russia is winning. Wtf are you talking about?
I still don't know if everyone is just jumping to conclusions yet
"It's a big country. It takes time, doesn't mean it failed."
Such a cancer
"Here is what I don't understand. Why the Russians didn't target this communications network, including Social Media?"
"I spent 10 year in US military intelligence. Very entertaining video, but also super informative and thoughtful reporting. You can totally change careers and become an intelligence analyst if you wanted"
"Nice propaganda video, however I'd like to know how Ukraine logistics work as well, specially how the international brigade or the donation of weapons and planes are delivered, and it's ok to publish the video if you think Russia would see it don't worry because they blocked YouTube."
Damn this video is painful to watch. People actually believe Russia is fighting a shock and awe style of war in Ukraine.
"Most of the rest of the world implemented a ""special economic operation"" against russa, not an act of war mind you, no, no, if Russia does not call what its doing war they certainly can't call what the rest of the world is doing to it economically as an act of war."
"Great video, best explanation I have seen. Keep up the great work."
It just amazing that 90 miles from home this army is stuck in the mud.  I wonder how they would get across the ocean to fight a war.
Propaganda
This video is a how to guide for russia. Be strategic and take it down.
"I think we can all agree that Putin is in fact, cringe."
"No, not at all. When it comes to ""cringe"" we can start with you."
"Immersive informative.Heddwch / Peace ,in the ancient tongue of the Cymru Welsh Briton's"
"Russia is like the bully from 8th grade . They will throw their weight around and act like the tough guy , but if any of the high schoolers (i.e. REAL militaries) shows up , their weakness and meekness will very quickly be exposed."
"I like how Wendover spent almost all of the time talking about Russian logistics and vulnerabilities and close to none talking about Ukraine's gameplan or strategies. No need to give free intel to the enemy!

Also painting signs to say 'welcome to hell' is seriously flippin scary in all the right ways."
"Russia hasn’t failed. Globohomo puppet regime in Ukraine is being destroyed. Wish Putin would come and liberate America when he is done liberating Ukraine. Also, SO VERY HAPPY Putin destroyed all those US funded biolabs in Ukraine which will save millions of lives."
Nice to see other frens in the comments section
Makes me respect smaller conflicts like the the falklands war much more than I did. What was it like 8000 miles for the British?
Yes. But we got the logistics right. UK is very used to fighting overseas. All our wars for the last 900 years have been fought overseas (apart from the English Civil War and wars against the Welsh and Scots)... You don't create the world's largest empire without having a good grasp of logistics.
In a war both side says they are winning.
Wendover productions and real life lore are just the best when it comes to such content
Are there subtitles on Nebula?
Its painful to see how one ill man has so much power........
"Incredibly interesting video, thank you!"
"Very Interesting video. I bet 3 weeks ago you would of said 'Keyevv' instead of the Ukrainian 'Keeve'. Not a criticism, but an observation. All we need now is for one of Putin's goons to see the insanity of all this and lodge a 9mm protest in the back of his walnut brain. ""Slava Ukraini!"""
"Great video, the one thing I'm missing though, is that Russia is trying to supply its biggest armoured push through some of the most inhospitable terrain in Europe - the Pripyat marshes. A major obstacle for armies throughout history, is Russia failing at its own version of the Ardennes Offensive?"
"@Alexander Robins I'm not entirely sure what Russia's objective is here, I'm just commenting on what I see development. It's not a political statement of any kind to say that Russia is winning the conventional phase of this war handily. There's simply no real reliable evidence to suggest anything else.

But that's not all there is to war. It wasn't in any of the examples I've mentioned so far (Iraq, Afghanistan, Poland, France, South Africa)."
"As one person in another video put it:
“Even Russia fails at invading Russia*.”

*Ukraine will never fully become part of Russia again.  Also, the Soviet Union could not conquer Finland for many of the same reasons."
"@QualityPen Yeah, if you look at the situation on the ground from what can be gleaned from pro-Ukranian ""Western"" sources (which I am stating just as a way to orient myself with regard to source, not as a value judgement), it is clear that Russia is winning this war decisively and rapidly. They are encircling the Ukranians on multiple fronts while capturing key objectives like power plants and airports. I'd be surprised if Ukraine holds out for a month at this rate, which would be comprehensive victory by Russian forces by any metric.

Then again, Ukraine may choose to drag this out for years as well with guerilla tactics, but that would be even more devastating. I know there is a lot of nationalism involved here, but For their sake, I hope this is not what ends up happening. In the Second Boer War, it took six months for the might of the entire British empire to capture Pretoria in the six months from the start of the second phase of the war, but the fighting continued for another year after, with disastrous results."
Holy copw this is top level investigation and application of logistics
How long until Belarus gets annexed? What are the betting lines?
@roger0929 which makes it easier for them to annex
"Amatures study tactics, professionals study logistics"
"PutNIK needs a ""Special Operation"" on his head.  Too bad his father didn't have a condom all those years ago."

You failed to mention the US backed coup in Ukraine in 2014 and the violence that this caused. It's a very relevant fact.
I have gps on my phone I don’t understand this at all
"Just wait for the spring, I'm pretty sure the Ukrainians will launch the counter offensive"
Imagine failing to logistics with a country that close😂😂 Russia is a joke in a conventional war. They were unable to properly support there sf and para guys. Who were then slaughtered. The idea of them being a word power past nukes. Is absolutely laughable the vaunted t90 and t72b3😂 destroyed even with those shitty armor cages. We’re is the t14 we’re is t90 with aps😂 I see b3s and bmp1-2s😂😂
Ofcourse you just must follow politics 🤣

How to defeat Russia: bomb the crap out of their railways and supply trucks
To many Smart people on yt... Ukraine Is like France Big teritory....operation goes very well
The more and more I learn about this conflict the more and more I worry Russia might decide to do something drastic to save face rather then just cut their loses
How the hell did they produce this so fast? Amazing.
This video is more the fake news about Russian invasion in Ukraine
"Conflict with between Russia and Ukraine have been on going since 90s, if you look into his presidency history. There is always a link with Russia. 2014 was just a result of long battle in political game and Putin is not winning"
Why is this a surprise? This is how Russia has fought every war EVER! Humans are but fodder for Russian leaders.
He completly ignored the changes NSB brought to HOI4.
"Analyse fro word Anal...  youtubers and mom experts, still living with parents."
They say never to invade Russia because of supply lines. Looks like the same applies to Ukraine
Napoleon and Hitler also had to deal with weather. Winter hurt logistics along with efforts to advance
"This analysis is nothing but propaganda, garbage!"
"First Usage of wrong words: autocrate = a ruler who has absolute power. This is not the case in Russia. For your information, Russia has the same constitution rules as any Western european country. There is an executive, a legiuslatif and a judicial. Pr Putin did not decide any military operation, all must be ratified. Please kniow what you are talking about before making incorrect assumptions.
Second, this was not technically an invasion and still not is so far! it is techincally a military operation - definition by all military including the Western military.
Third, Russia did not take Crimea, Crimea legally asked to leave Ukrain and become part of Russia - similar action were taken dueing the dismentlement of Czechoslovakia.
Fourth, the maidan revolution was a coup instigated by the US to help and protect neo-nazi and ultra nationalists.

After one minutes, you already got it all wrong and became the propaganda machine of the Neo-nazi: you are welcoming 1984 and embracing the 'Brave New World'. Nothing to say tbut to blacklist you."

Bruh if u guys with a tractor can steal your BMP you ain't ready for war
Here is my like and my comment to help with the algorithm.
Plenty of military equipment was sold off on the black market by the soldiers over the years.
Meh
Disingenuous to not mention the threat of US/NATO to Russia.
@Justin Koenig remember the Cuban middle crisis?
What is the threat?

Russia should have learned about logistics on curiosity stream first!
Poor quality Chinese copies of Michelin tires on the Russian heavy trucks can also also be a big factor. We see a lot of heavy equipment stuck in the mud with blown Chinese tires. Thanks China 😅⚒👍
"Oh man, sorry but your video is very ignorant on the real issue"
@Justin Koenig we need the sources to see if it's not another fake story like the ghost of Kiev and the Ukraine army tank that drove over and Ukrainian civilian. We need context to understand his reasoning like the text of Zbigniew Brzezinski about United States interest on Eurasia
"@Justin Koenig not a single source cited, many assumptions and completely ignoring any context"
Explain why you think that
"Great Video, Two things:

0:10 Describing Putin as the ""Autocrat of Russia"" is not exactly correct. He is certainly described as a Dictator, but not an Autocrat, as he does not have ""absolute and total power"" as defined by an Autocrat, it is well known Putin relies on his close circle of Oligarchs to continue to keep him in power.

5:23 This is a very broad generalisation, although correct, many troops do believe they are there to ""Liberate the country"", information from interrogations of Russian POWs captured by Ukrainian forces has shown a consistent message that many soldiers were told they were going on ""Military Exercises"" and had their phones taken away from them. Russian POWs captured allege they had no idea that they were going to war."
That's just a cover story. Everyone knew what is going on.
So smart
Well. I just cant watch this after the very first sentence was falsely reported. You got the time critically wrong.
Shitty equipment
"Russia's just getting started 
 Stop lieying to the people"
In Nazi Russian we love vodka and genocide.
Logistica good
"You think may like Russia had logistic issues in June 1940? How did that turn out for the Germans? The Russians are holding off entering Kyiv in force for good reason, to prevent civilian casualties. But that's against the narrative. It's WWI and ""Let's kill the Huns"" all over again supercharged by mainstream media hysteria. November 10th will go down as one of the greatest foreign policy disasters in American history. That's when Joe Biden and Zelensky agreed essentially to provoke a Russian invasion. Read about it in the WSJ today, Saturday, 3/5. You won't find it anywhere else due to the media blackout."
This video didn’t age well
"others: bombs and force win wars
wendover: logistics .... win ....... wars!"
🇺🇦
"Don't count the Russians out, Biden did his best to make sure they won.  Never lifted a finger to help Ukraine before the war, he even delayed munitions that president Trump previously allocated."
"Wonder how long it will take for stuff like Jan 6 and this war to be in the history books 🤔

Either way the Russians will have their version and the Americans will have their version of how they teach the events, it’s no wonder humanity never learns from history 🙄"

No gps what’s wrong with Russia
💛💙
Great video!
Don't give them ideas man
"Nobody is denying that Russia has embarassed itself, but at the same time they really aren't moving much slower than those who are familiar with mechanized warfare and Russian military supply and logistics expected. They have an operational range about less than 200km, advanced about 180km in those first three days, and then paused in the ensuing reorganization and shifting of supply dumps."
"​@Paul Serdiuk I mean, the territory that they operationally control and the fact that in several places they've advanced another 150-200km beyond their initial dumps beyond the border say otherwise."
They don't have anywhere to establish these dumps tho.
Western propaganda going strong here i see.
One of the most informative videos I've seen on why the Russian army has seemingly stalled. Thanks.
Excellent! 👏👏👏👏👏
Ky-EV*
Nice propaganda film.
Time to send in people to blow up railways farther into Russia.
NATO should give Ukraine a membership in the alliance then tell Russia it has 24 hours to leave or the fight is on.
1:44 This extension of military might was made possible by ... (I really thought he would say Squarespace ahhahaha
Wow .. you explain each and every inch of the invasion. Thank you
"Honestly I don't see how RU can claim victory. Even if they manage it, it will be very costly. This will be remembered as Putin's Winter War"
Russian army does not have GPS?
It’s incredible just how fast this video was made considering that the invasion didn’t even begin two weeks ago.
Go to Ukraine with 5 gallon tank of gas and u can find your own tank to bring home
"Poland, a NATO member is fast-tracking the annexation of Ukraine so that NATO can provide a No Fly Zone.  The Ukrainian President has agreed to this as a temporary measure to get NATO resources including air support, arms, soldiers.  This is about to be brought to a head and Russia will retreat."
"But I do really hope you observe and listen carefully.
You know, sometimes media and news hiding the truth from public.
You know, Journalist shouldn't be siding with other side. Journalism should be neutral and deliver the truth.
If you only just simple listen from one side, that mean you've been provoked and you got their propaganda.

War. 
Like... USA invasion in Iraq, for Example.
Afghanistan.
Vietnam.
and others.
No Sanction? No punishment? Why? Because it's USA/America? 
Israel? Palestine childrens? No Sanction? No Punishment? Why?
Because Israel are US allies, and the International Law can't touch them?
Why?
Justice you say?
Remember Lady Justice? Themis? God of Justice? Your icon of Justice? Blindfolded right? So she will not give-a-damn-fuk to who ever you are, so Justice are Justice. Why USA and Allies never get International Sanction and punishment for their invasion and aggresiveness invading small countries?? Why?

Have you read history about slavery in America?
What you call the origin America tribes that settled in America before Colonization arrive and massacre them?
Native-American? No, Indian-American, right?

Aren't Black people who born in America should be called american? Why African-American? Why Afro-american? Why not simple american? Because they're born, grow and die there?

I'm no minion of anyone.
I'm just simply me.

And I trust in Justice.

And Justice require you listen from both side.
Or, the scale will be broken.

Good day."
I'll tell u why because God doesn't sleep and war isn't welcome In the kingdom u don't see a mouse inventing a mice trap but we invent devices that would destroy life as we know it that's not knowledge that's stupidity
"There is no definitive way you could possibly know if Russia logistics failed. This is a great theory of yours, but it just buys into the mainstream narrative which is propaganda. I look at the facts tho. American war on Iraq took 3 weeks, with a country that’s 5x smaller than Ukraine. Russia has gained more ground and is absolutely taking Ukraine and it only been 10 days. I wouldn’t call that a “failure” by any means. Ukraine and the west is winning the “info war”, but Russia is winning the actual war - the only thing that really matters"
"iraq is literally on the other side of the planet from the US, and ukraine is in russia's back yard"
why did Putin shot a top general yesterday ?
"Remember Ho Chi Min trail guaranteed supplies to the Vietcong in the South for years. That was a trail through the juggle that Americans never managed to stop. Ukraine has long open borders with its suppliers of weapons in the West. Any point in those thousands km is a point where weapons can enter Ukraine. If Americans never managed to destroy a narrow jungle trail, the Russians will never succeed in stoping weapons crossing the borders into Ukraine, no matter how hard they try."
algo boost
Just one arsehole - someone must put this dog down to put an end to his delusional mind!!!
"Don't you get it? The countries which have sent - and continue to send weapons and support to the Ukrainian forces which have been fighting a civil war for the last eight years with the loss of 14,000 lives, are the principal cause of the war in Ukraine - not Putin. The West, NATO, the EU, the US, the UK and a number of oligarchs, have been stoking-up this war for several years. We could have stopped the civil war but we chose not to. This might be difficult to accept but if you give someone a gun in a family feud, and someone gets killed - the law says the person providing the gun is jointly guilty of murder."
Detailed content. Explains so much. Thankd.
Knife beats gun
"The Ukraines support of the apartheid in Palestine last year, literally they supported the murder, rape, theft of Palestinian people from their land and now that it's happening to them, it's a different story altogether.....Karma is a bitch but never incorrect."

Umm.... Afghanistan and Russia are allies now.  Where do you think the Taliban got their weapons this time around?
they(Russians) definitely miscalculated and underestimated but this will only delay the inevitable. Ukraine is doomed.

@ROB SERVANT OF JESUS fake war???
This one video answers a lot of questions I had. Great job.
"Can somebody please clarify something for me.

Those MRLS they're spamming at cities.
Is this video starting that each individual rocket needs one _ENTIRE_ Zil truck all to itself?

Is that what the video says and is that true?"
"@Mostly Penny Cat at 13:21 that's an iskander launcher,
smerch has 12 tubes, it's much older. Google it and you immediatly see the unique soviet style of vehicle.

The iskander platform has multiple different missiles (with two distict shapes). The one in the video is the thin variant, the R 500 Iskander-K. I have seen a picture of a transport vehicle with 4 of them loaded (but I highly doubt that was normal, might have been empty launch tubes) . That said, the other types of iskander missiles are simply too bulky only 1 can be transported.
There are other launch vehicles that can transport and launch 4 of them.


Russia has definitly made big mistakes on multiple levels in this war. I never expected the encirclement of key cities to take beyond 2 weeks. Yet here we are 18 days in to the war and russia has barely manged to ""secure/contain"" 1 of the 4 big objectives.
Resistance overall is not going to decrease, especially since they are now facing possible starvation by the russians."
"@MrMcMind 
Yeah, that's max _salvos_ for grad
the one at 13:21 with the special truck with the special crane, this is what I was talking about, that's smerch is it?

So, _one_ salvo from _one_ smerch truck requires 12 lorry journeys from the railhead each lorry carrying just _one_ 9M55 or 9M528.

...

Russia's fucked.
Although I am concerned about how many Ukrainians battalions are pinned in place facing Donbas et al.
If they are still there they're probably encircled by this point.

But then again, we keep making those mistakes don't we?
The really obvious strategy, expected to be done, but Russia is incapable."
"MLRS = MultiLaunchRocketSystems
those are systems like seen at 13:21 BM-21 Grad (mounted on Zil trucks), then there are also for example BM-30 Smertsch.

The rockets for BM-21 Grad can be transported on ordinary logistic trucks. The rockets are ""small"" and get loaded by hand by pushing them into the launcher from the rear (a bit of strechting is required from the loading crew for that). But having them transported in a secure manner propably means that yes, you are most likely only getting 1 two max 2 salvos of reload ammunition on one zil resupply truck for a Grad.

Munition for BM-30 Smertsch are much larger so no Zil trucks. Also loading them is more complicated (too large and heavy to be loaded by hand) specialised trucks are used with crains.

Then there are the big boy launchers (SRBM = ShortRangeBallisticMissile). 9K720 Iskander, with either 1 or 2 rockets. Reloading them requires a crain and special transport. As seen at 13:18. 


Rocket artillery tend to be more of a burden for the logistical network, compared to ordinary artillery, since shells and possible fuse charges are smaller then rocket ammunition. And since even the smallest rockets are stll cumberson they do require the logistical vehicle to stick around till needed (rarely the ammunition for them get's offloaded on the side), not to mention that they are easy to relocate fast."
"Boys and girls, like before u watch"
Imagine how different the war would've been without the Internet...
"Well, Poland 1939?"
Russia is winning ! ! !
You should consider suing the doctor who screwed up your lobotomy surgery.
"You pulled together a masterpiece of journalism with this one video on the war.
Have my compliments..."
"Wait, their comms are unencrypted? Oof."
"Seems there is a massive misunderstanding here. Sure, in a way we have seen bad logistics. But not because Russian army is incompetent. The batallions moved much faster than expected due to lack of defence from Ukraine side. That caused some issues on supplies and in some cases lose direction of few groups. The other reason why they not took over Kyev is, Putin has no plan on genocide. It's not the AZOV legion of Ukraine, it's Russian Army. Zelinsky defends the capital with the use of civilians. Innocent people dies because of him and his corrupt government. I feel sorry for the people. But what is going on in Ukraine since the USSR collapsed is disgusting. Racism and violation of every human an minorities rights, massive corruption."
"The western media's propaganda arm is unrivaled, almost none of you could even point out ukraine on a map a few weeks ago let alone know it's capital yet suddenly you care about it's pronunciation? When this ends in slaughter remember that the ukrainians had a choice, the gloves are still on for a reason."
"*The Russians have this well in hand, yes there were setbacks, and I'm sure many things (as tends to happen in war) did not go to plan. ""But"", they've secured Nuclear Generators without any possible meltdowns, they've kept the majority of their troops in-line (no major civilian massacres), and they've encircled huge numbers of Ukrainian troops. My hope is that, 1. WW3 will not result in nuclear proliferation. 2. That the neo-nazi militias of Azov,Aidar, Maidan,Svoboda,Right Sector and ESPECAILLY the ""Tornado Battalion"" are all brought to justice.*"
"Finland: 'I favor joining NATO'
Russia: 'There will be military and political consequences' 
Finland: '...I'm even more in favor of joining NATO'"
Same happened to Ukraine itself. After the 2014 invasion support for NATO tipped over the 50% point.
The world runs on logistics. Another fantastic video!
"There is 1 problem with this video. Russia utilizes a strategy that consists in gaining territory and waiting for the defenders to attack. Example Georgia 2008. So we do not know what is going on. There is too much propaganda and it is likely that everything is going according to Russia's plan as they are gaining terrioy and Ukraine is running out of everything, literally everyhting. We simply cant tell yet. It's too early. Very good video though as always!"
Down with tyrants and Neo-Holodomorists! Slava Mother Ukraine!! 🇺🇦🇨🇦
"Local resistance and insurgency is what determines the outcome of a war.

The US's logistics might and it's allies still proved useless against the Taliban."
Issue was politics more than logistics for US in Afghanistan. US drove out Taliban in 2001 easily. The issue was Afghan government and military being ineffective due to severe corruption and reliance on outside support
Zelensky majorly trolled Putin by staying in Ukraine. Putin planned on him fleeing and hoped his cowardice would demoralize the nation. Zelensky staying is one of the smartest political/military decisions ever.
"He did leave, all of his videos are prerecorded"
"@jackthegamer The Crimea test run went very well for him, so he thought this would be a slam dunk.  I am surprised, though, that the other former Soviet republics (except Belarus, obviously) have basically told him to go pound sand.  He still has the support of the PRC, the HinduNazis and the other usual suspects (Brazil, Israel, Venezuela, Cuba and some African dictators)."
"not just that, putin thought the rest of the world wouldn't interfere and witnessing that everyone is not only interfering but also pressing a ton of pressure on his allies, you can tell he aint going to be around for long after that"
"yeah, i never though about that actually
thats why you dont lie, cuz lies one day will fall"
"This is super interesting, thanks."
putin gonna take notes from this video and recalibrate
One of the best videos I’ve seen on the war and I’ve seen a few! Thank you!
"An emotional analysis, with distinction, America occupied Iraq in two weeks ... and a month before it bombed Iraq with all kinds of missiles ... and Iraq was not helped even with one shot. Do not tell me that America does not have borders together with Iraq ... ... it was It has all the time to gather its forces in the Gulf countries"
"Y'know those pipelines just gonna get bombed, right?
Bruh, in lots of places in Africa, random civilians break into these pipes to steal and re-sell the oil.
If Ukrainian civilians realise what's happening, they're going to set about the entire length of these pipelines."
"A bit dramatic, but you certainly are correct to a point.  Sanction is a bad idea, The US and Europe have been waging illegal wars for over 20 years killing thousands of people with no consequence. 
I do not believe that one or two countries should control the world resources and decide who to sanction if you do not play by their rules. The Americans are the biggest bullies.
We need the Chinese and The Russians to keep their eyes on the Americans.
Having said all that, the current actions of VP is a bit heavy. There are innocent people suffering and displace all over Ukraine watching their country getting destroyed. 
I do not see how to stop this war besides Ukraine declaring Neutrality from NATA and Russia."
"I usually enjoy the videos of this channel, but this one is extremely poorly researched. The authors just don't know, or don't understand the overall russian army's strategy for this war. He also uncritically relies on ukrainian and NATO propaganda.
He completely fails to understand that Russia's way of waging war is completely different from NATO's.
It's a diplomatic war. There's a saying: ""war is diplomacy by other means"". Usually, US army just annihilates and bombs the shit out of the enemy's capital city. Here, the modus operandi is quite different: they don't even want to overthrow Zelenskyi's government.
Their demands are the following:
- demilitarize
- become a neutral state
- de-nazify and stop waging war on the self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk

Hence, they're slowly dialing up the pain for the ukranian army and government. They chose not to destroy the civilian infrastructure (the phone network and internet is still available in virtually all of the ukraine, for instance), because :
1) they don't want to alienate the population
2) they're the ones who will pay the bill the rebuild the country

I'm stopping there, but Russia's army has been incredibly gentle in the way it operates. Just a quick cost/benefit analysis of the situation gives away the whole game:
- Ukraine's gov would actually benefit from high civilian casualties as it would put more and more pressure toward NATO direct military engagement ; plus it would make any government put in place by Russia extremely unstable
- Russia needs to make as few civilian casualties as possible, and as few damage as possible, for the same reasons.

People reading this message will probably get extremely angry, but sorry, it's just the truth. People have been gravely propagandized to be aware of only one of the two narratives. Just listening to someone who doesn't believe what they do usually makes propagandized people lose their sh*t."
Great analysis. Thanks.
"The overall Russian military is weak, was like that during WWII, and remains true today. In fact, the only soviet troops that were good were the Ukrainians. They only have one thing going on for them, they have almost unlimited manpower, besides that the level of quality is quite low.
When was the last time Russia won any war? They ""won"" the winter war but that was because Finland, a country without an army, ran out of ammunition. They won WWII because the allies helped them. They only win conflicts against much weaker nations, and Ukraine is not that weak right now."
"Russia undeniably played the biggest role in defeating the Nazis in WW2, sure it was because their sheer numbers, but they won nonetheless."
"Western shit. No mention of Neo-Nazi scums who bombs civilians in Donetsk, and Lukhansk for 8 years. ""Civilized west"" show their own Nazi subconscience by censoring not just pro-russian narrative but also people who are little bit critical to NATO's actions.

Nonetheless, Russia is forced to sterilize Ukraine from Nazi bandits as well as NATO puppets."
but wouldn't the US army have similar problems on such a road.
"Love how fast this propaganda outlet can see through the fog of war and bring us ""facts"""
Chinese military taking notes for Taiwan...
"Brilliant commentary,very informative. Could I add that a “tyre expert “ reported that the Russians are using cheap,crap Chinese tyres that are apparently unable to cope with conditions in Ukraine. Once a vehicle has lost a couple of tyres it becomes immobile and has to be abandoned, see the numerous YouTube videos on this."
"@Steven Cooper  Russia is fighting with 190,000 soldiers against 400,000 Ukrainians. In this case Russia is outnumbered."
Yeah but they are spamming thousands of vehicles. Even if half the tires break they will outnumber the ukranians :(
Separatist?  They did have vote over it. Just saying.
Chilling how calculated the Russian buildup was and how clearly now we can see how dishonest Putin and his regime is.
"PS. BTW! - ""War on Rocks"" - is probably one very BEST sources for any analisys - military and historical alike! I still have their ""piece"" on the CO-OPERATION between Germany (later on NAZI-Germany) and the Soviet Union in going around the bans of the Versailles Treaty and REARMING GERMANY's MILITARY POTENTIAL after their debàcle of 1918/1919 - same military potential that later on the NAZIS used to attack the SOVIET UNION. For better or worse these people NEVER CHANGE and NEVER LEARN. The soviets have never been at the Nurmemberg trial, sitting on the side of the NAZIS - the accused ones, not the other way around. The fact that through propaganda, lies, deception, appeasment and even outright STUPIDITY of some people in the West they never had their own judgment coming leads us (DIRECTLY!) to having to suffer such RELICS OF THE PAST like putin TODAY."
*Historical quotes about logistics incoming*
This has been predicted for over a decade. Didnt happen fast you just became aware of it.
Great mini-documentary. Incredibly well researched. Better research than every major news organization reporting on Ukraine in the past few weeks.
surprisingly acurate for someone that never been close to russia border
These videos really help contextualise this event in a digestible format when there's so much information flying around 🙏
"Wendover = Quality, legitimacy and something you can rely upon 100%"
"I don't think this is accurate at all, every one is saying especially western media that the Russians logistics are failing and they are constantly running out of gas or something or are taking forever to get to Kyiv when for some reason, but I don't think ppl actually understand military logistics especially for forces that size. The Russian army generally is moving on pace within there capabilities, if not perhaps they are going only a few kilometers farther than they can operate, but they still appear to be on schedule for the most part. The stops they are making are most likely setting up refueling stations and not so much they are running out of gas. I mean this invasion different compared to the U.S illegal invasion of Iraq. They used shock and awe tactics right from the gate pummeling the enemy into submission with no regards really to the possible collateral damage. Russia however is seemingly holding back, especially with their air force, yet for some reason Ukraine wishes to impose a no fly zone yet they say they control the skies like what? Plus the Russian army is most likely still using most soviet era military doctrines which is far different compared to western doctrines. Soviets always encircled cities first to submission before having to commit the infantry, which the Russian are doing to Kyiv and other cities. To me the Russians are actually trying to cause as less damage as possible contrary to western media with supposed accusations of genocide already and 2,000 plus civilian deaths when the U.N numbers are less then 500. And Yes I'm Russian myself, my last name however is Ukrainian in origin and half my family is Ukrainian with pro Russian views and live in east Ukraine, and we have family who fought hard in WW2. You can't understand how torn I am right now, please please don't attack me, I am only giving my perspective as a Russian who knows a little of how we work, because a lot of things I hear in the news dont exactly makes sense to me, I'm sorry. May there be Peace, Unity and a kind solidarity for us Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians one day."
"Also it is still very cold over there and in this climate these vehicles are prone to having to consume more gas and break down, so the fact that the 40 mile convoy is moving at a distance per day to what a single person in a car can travel in 45 mins if im correct in my math is actually not slow for a convoy of that size. I mean we are talking about a lot of tanks and equipment. The fact that Russia doesn't have enough trucks to supply their forces is kinda far fetched if not insane. Western media doesn't in general understand large convoy operations."
"At the beginning of this war, the Russians could choose and bombard their targets. Now that they are inside the country, wherever they are, they are surrounded by the enemy from all sides. They no longer choose targets; instead, they themselves became targets. Wherever they are, they are targets. The strategists did not learn the lessons of the USSR failure in Afghanistan. It is impossible to win Guerrilla warfare when you are in enemy’s territory and the enemy is at large extent united to send the invader home. The Ukrainians know well what strategy they need to apply. The scene of the 60km Russian column stuck on its way to Kiev tells everything. They became seating ducks."
"@SoleNero21 The south front is the only one that is moving forwards, with three other invasion corridors being either stalled or pushed back. It's more likely the southern forces will be used to put out fires on all other directions before they could even threaten the half of the country they don't operate in at the moment.
At least, that would be the sane thing to do; if Russian troops will continue their clown show as they had so far, the one remaining operational army group Russia has will fall victim to farmers on tractors appropriating their tanks and selling them on e-bay, like the rest did."
"Ukraine needs a miracle, russian forces from the south are going to finish them off"
"Man, the quality of this documentary is mind-blowing!"
It's really hard to keep large military movements a secret.
Especially in the era of satellite imagery.
Thank you so much for making this video. I feel a lot better informed on what's going on and why. Logistics are truly powerful. ❤
"Wow, just amazing, Russia been planning this invasion for years now and totally forgot the Logistics side of warfare."
"Russia may have assumed this to be a repeat of Crimean peninsula seizure. There were pro-Putin separatists who supported Russian soldiers with logistics. Issue is that Ukraine mainland is larger in size, ethnic Russians there do not support Putin regime and there is organized large scale resistance based on warnings from West."
@QualityPen Everyone except Putin you thank? Are these the same everyone that said Putin wouldn’t invade?
Did you watch the video? Russian units are able to operate autonomously for 3-5 days. Everyone was expecting Ukraine to surrender by now.

SLAVA UKRAINI 🇺🇦🇺🇦"
Well put and on point.
These ukrainians fight like a group of gangstas! Much love and respect! Go Ukraine! Go Ukraine! Blaze them up! ⛽🥦💨 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Unfortunately gangsters typically ending their days on electric chair.
And nobody saw it coming... not even NATO.   Daaaaaaaaamn
1:52 was that Russian flying a confederate flag?
That's a banner of Novorossiya rebels.
"Now I finally understand why is that even though blitzkrieg was already invented, the conflict still hasn't ended."
"Nobody in the West understands Putin's real motives and his ultimate goal with all these talks of ""miscalculation"", ""disinformation"", ""insanity"", and ""losing touch with reality"". In reality all he is doing has been carefully and rationally planned and calculated. His ultimate plan is to convert Russia as of today into a Russian Empire that includes Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine with absolute and isolated from the world dictatorship political and social structure similar to N. Korea or former USSR. There are several psychological motives for that: he is afraid of losing his presidency and being judged for his past brutal crimes, he is very irritated with the opposition in Russia that hates him and calls him names, but most of all, he wants to become a Great Tsar of the New Russian Empire. How would he quickly convert the Russian society of today that has become used to freedoms into an absolute dictatorship? This can only be done by using martial law. But how would he make that happen? Obviously by starting a war. With which country? Obviously Ukraine because it would be easy to justify it to Russian population due to the ongoing ethnic conflicts in Donbas. But if he would quickly capture Ukrainian government by fast and efficient military operation, there would be no cause for martial law. What he wants is a longer war, both military and ideological, in order to justify martial law and using that law get rid of all free press, all political opponents, and isolate Russia from Western internet and informational sources under the justification to stop misinformation from Ukrainian sources. He also wants Russia to be isolated financially and economically just like it used to be during the Soviet era, so the Western sanctions actually do exactly what he wants, only not with his own hands, but with the hands of the Western politicians. Economically Russia will survive and continue trading oil and gas for goods with China, so the sanctions do not discourage him in the least. Of course the standard of living will degrade significantly, but under the martial law people will be afraid to protest. It is also likely that, due to economic hardship, he will partially nationalize some sectors of the economy, introduce regulated prices and distribution of essential goods, and make the economy half-socialist. By the restoration of Russian Empire that would include Ukraine and by shifting economy towards socialism he will get support and approval from nationalists and communist that constitute a significant portion of the Russian population. It is also likely that after he eventually succeeds with his military capture of Ukraine, there will be a long gorilla war in Ukraine similar to Afghanistan one, but even that would benefit Putin’s goal because it will allow him to keep the martial law indefinitely. So far everything is going exactly according to his plan and I don’t see a way anyone can stop him, unless some people in power in Russia will arrange a coup, but I think it is very unlikely. The good news for the West is that he is not insane and therefore he would not want to get involved in any military or nuclear conflict with NATO and US, he clearly understands that this would have catastrophic consequences and would ruin his plan. But unfortunately, I have no good news for Russian and Ukrainian people. So, the West should be preparing to deal with an episode II of Soviet Union. The ideology will be somewhat different, but the sociopolitical structure is going to be quite similar. Over many years Putin expressed his regrets about the collapse of the USSR, he grew up in USSR and worked in Soviet organizations, he secretly believes that this would be the political structure that he could more easily manage and control."
"Two things I would add.  First, I think that his invasion has not gone exactly to his plan; however, his objectives are probably still attainable since the EU, NATO and the US refuse to get involved.  Second, I think the Russian Patriarch has a lot to do with it as well.  He is extremely angry at losing control over the Ukrainian Orthodox Church."
Thank you
What does logistics mean can anyone explain
You would think a nation the size of Russia would be a little more savvy with how they deal with military logistics. Especially considering how familiar they are with the terrain. They seem to have really crapped the bed on this front.
It didn’t expect to have to fight a war. Everyone thought Ukraine would surrender within the first 96 hours. Why is everyone missing this?
They clearly haven’t played no step back
Now what’s their excuse for struggling with air superiority?
Down with tyrants and Neo-Holodomorists! Slava Mother Ukraine!! 🇺🇦🇨🇦

Unfortunately we are only ten days in and they have chance to fix their errors.
"Trucks take a solid minute to be produced, and they lost a lot of them."
But yet what I do not understand is why are they still winning that war in spite of all said failures?
few mistakes in report...
Huh what's the use of the US having all that capability but not doing anything when it favoured them?
"This is a whole new kind of war, what with intelligence coming from all over the place. Perhaps Putin did not factor this into his plans. We are receiving all kinds of intel that, previously, we would not have had. Data will defeat Putin, and every single Twitter post will be bullet in Putin's side."
When you said “this extension of military light was made possible by…” I was REALLY afraid you were about to say “Curiosity Stream” 😂😂😂
I live in Ukraine and I didn't know many things you've shared! Thanks a lot!
"LOL, we all saw the mighty US logistics at work in Afghanistan. 
We are only 9 days in... maybe Russia is focusing on the Donbass and doesn't want or need to take Kiyv and cause a bloodbath... anyway, it took the US how long to get to Baghdad through an empty desert?"
"if USA is soooo wonderful and great with all its logistics then why did USA get their asses kicked in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan for 20 TWENTY years? In fact USA hasn't won a war since WW2."
"There are a number of factors but the two major ones right now seem to be lack of maintenance of their vehicles, including bad Chinese tires, and the fact that they waited until after the Olympics to invade, which coincided with the break up(the thaw) In Ukraine which turns the countryside into a mud pit for about two months. The Russian convoys are stuck on the road because of bad tires and muddy conditions. If they had invaded two months ago or two months from now this would be a whole different ball game."
"Can you imagine being a soldier who thinks he is liberating a country suddenly realises he's not welcome in that country, so even though I do not condone in any way Russias invasion, I do have some sympathy for those young men who have been betrayed by their Government, when this is over these men will be scarred for life and they won't receive any help from their corrupt Communist government."
Don't need to be worried they will invade NATO states. They couldn't even get out of their own country since they blocked the roads themselves. The only real danger is their nukes and some ICBMs. Without that Russian army would be just a bad joke to NATO.
"Soviet military doctrine is to send in the least trained and equipped troops to test the capacity of the enemy and make them think they are winning at first, then retaliate with more skilled fighters to fortify supply lines and artillery bases to siege strategic objectives. A sloppy initial attack is part of the strategy; I don't think Russia considers this a failure. As the video says, their goal is to set up for long term occupation."
They are also avoiding casualties and preserving critical infrastructure as much as possible. Steam-rolling through Ukraine in 3 days was never the objective.
"dangerously suspcious video unless you A. admit russia can still prevail, B. NATO was warned years don't expand to Russia's border and admit AMERICA'S role in provocation like Biden telling Ukraine ignore the Minsk Agreement of peace, C. admit Ukraine has Nazis in gvt, D. concede Ukraine since 8 years killed thousands of Russian speakers in its east."

"9:00 - I would disagree on the Ukrainian Defense being ""Guerrilla Style"", the Ukrainian Military is still functioning mostly conventionally, the more Accurate description would be ""Defense in depth"" or ""Elastic Defense"" imo."
@Gaius Julius Caesar Good point.  I understand why we are not seeing these things.
"@MrSGL21 That's the idea.  But if the Russians can accomplish a bunch of their objectives they can negotiate peace from a position of strength.  Surround Kiyv, starve it out, take a big part of the Ukraine east of the Dnieper river and destroy a bunch of the Ukrainian army.  But can they accomplish it?"
"I'm increasingly reminded of a line from HBO's Chernobyl miniseries, spoken by the actor playing Gorbachev: ""Our power comes from the perception of our power.""  It's military Lysenkoism, this mindset of making plans to fit a narrative, rather than making plans to achieve a goal.  The Soviet Union may have ""fallen"" but the ideologies are alive and well."
@paul menard I agree entirely. You can see similar mindsets in the boardroom of any corporation that insists on growth despite it being mathematically impossible in the long run.
i think thats more about totalian regimes than just communism.... its putting on a show for certain people.
"@Cannibal Holocaust wow, Gordon Freeman with his crowbar over here!"
You got the Russian mindset right. Russia is failing because they have an obsolete post-Soviet mentality. I was born in USSR and then raised in Ukraine so I know their mentality very well.
Meanwhile Putin: write that down write that down!
"Bush:  I looked Putin in the eye!  He is telling the truth about peace! 
Also Bush: I looked Karzai in the eye!  He is doing a fine job in Afghanistan! 
Also Also Bush: I looked Wall Street in the eye!  There is no economic disaster coming! 
Also Also  Also Bush:  I looked myself in the eye!  I am an idiot!"
I find it hard to believe the Russians didn't even have phones with GPS. Seriously?
Mobile phones are stricktly restricted for servicemen in Russia.
Phones are taken away from the soldiers. Can't let them have access to uncensored information about the civilians they are firing at!
I wouldn’t say they failed. I’d say they just haven’t succeeded yet

oh cool nebula greed
"Excellent video, lets hope the Russian military fails and Putin is removed from power."
This was a very well done video. And it's sold me on the Nebula subscription. Looking forward to all the great content
A droid army wouldn't have these   problems... just saying
"Dont get me going on supply chain management.  

Russia really and truly laid bare its operational weakness. Strategists the world over are pouring over this content. Which in turns makes Russia and Putin even more desperate to reassert. 

Such a pity that some people cannot just live and let live. It is going to take full scale war to take down Putin and that simply needs to happen. It will not come without a hefty price tag, but it needs to happen unfortunately."
"14:48 you‘ve done this a few times this video so thought I’d opine given it’s relevant and IMO interesting, but the word you should be using here is “matériel” which is a near homophone and in the case of material you could say they are both nouns referring to things. But specifically military equipment when describing logistics of war should be called “matériel” which Carries a different pronunciation."
@CYMotorsport yes that's what I found and is why i capitalized it. I appreciate your attention to detail :D
"@Nate Over yep sorry should have clarified that point good catch. The accent is even dropped sometimes  in English in the states. It’s pronounced almost like there’s emphasis on that ELL, too"
"@NLTops I can’t help it haha I’m American but I guess after years covering formula 1 which the US cares very little about, little stuff like proper pronunciation of loan words matters to me. But I also have a big interest in military strategy and materiel is universally accepted and respected. Good example of Armchair Historian who you will never making this mistake."
I've looked this one up to confirm it for everyone wondering. And in US English it is pronounced materi-ELL
Lol stop forcing French on people. :P
Thank you for this.
Excellent video.
"Great job, thanks for stepping up."
I just live to see that Putin's painful death.
"Anyone read ""red storm rising""  by Tom Clancy? He wrote about the fail (and finaly the defeat) of the red army by poor management, poor communicatoin and (!) poor logitics. The book was released in 1986, while the NATO still was capable of acting. From a military strategic point of view I am not surprised seeing a 60 mile long convoy of equipment not moving, troops starving, tanks drained of fuel and a confused bormbardemend of whatever is in the way... Slava Ukraini."
"Thanks for the info, I look forward to reading the book."
*Russia clearly stated the war is going as planned*.
"Russia saw your “Geography Problem” video and thought to invade their best, but despite the failure thank you for helping them improve further. 
/S"
We'll see how broken their logistics are over the next few days
It’s day 10 of the war calm down with your misinformation
Перемога буде за нами!!!
The logistics video i didn't knew I wanted
"First, we need to be Born-again...."
"Yo, I'm 200km from them, don't give them ideas :))))"
Can we wait until the war to be over to make videos like this?
Ukraine cannot expect NATO to enforce a no fly zone without considering the possibility of a full out nuclear war starting. No one wins a nuclear war
Donbass voted for its independence during the British referendum on brexit.. if you're gonna tell a story tell.the truth
Paradox schould've never released No Step Back with its logistics Update
Putin taking notes
"You don’t have to place ads on videos. 
Nebula has the same content restrictions."
I'm addictive to these videos🙆‍♂
Great video! I've been watching the news for the past week and did not learn about all this. It's a shame because it's not complex once it's explained well and many people still don't know about it. Thank you
"Logistics issues in Russia predates the Soviet Union. For a case study, look no further than Drachinifel's video on the Russian Empire's Second Pacific Squadron."
Down with tyrants and Neo-Holodomorists! Slava Mother Ukraine!! 🇺🇦🇨🇦
"I appreciate your mention of the Russian conscripts.
This whole thing is a tragedy, including for the Russian troops, who were lied to by leadership, being told that the Ukrainians would welcome them with open arms. Now both sides are dying for a war neither side wanted.
The only villain here is Putin.
I wonder how so much of this information is out in the public sector.
Long live Ukraine."
"its only an invasion if its from the invasion region of france, else its just a sparkling military operation"
"The first thing you see when opening the nebula app is ""pay 4.99€ a month to get access to the content"". You lost me there."
So it sounds like Ukrainian drones would be better off targeting their logistics trucks over tanks and artillery.
fantastic VIDEO !
I hope some rogue sabatours remove pieces from russias railway.
Very well done. You've put together a clear analysis that is clearly born out.
"Its like Finland with the Soviets, Russia trying to prove their military power but failing due to incompetence and underestimating their enemy."
"Empire of lies Evil cabal’s Deep State corrupt criminal terrorist regime with Nazi terrorist regime in Ukraine (they created terrorists, now Nazi’s)… failed to genocide Russian people in Donbass and Lugansk region... Finally, started demilitarization and denazification Bandero Nazi regime in Ukraine, Thank you Mr. Putin & God bless you… 
When humanity & American people going to rid of this evil cabal’s regime…"
"Failed logistics. Failed morale. And heroic resistance of the Ukrainians.

Putin is a cornered rat.

He’s finished. He just has to die before his little clique destroy the world."
Thank you.
Thanks for the thorough video. It's fascinating how many weak points this invasion has exposed in Russian logistics and planning. Just goes to show that a big army with impressive tech isn't worth as much as you'd think without the logistics being able to adapt
Great video. Now can we get a crash course on China and Taiwan
He is so smart.
"i still believe Russians don't really want a front attack on Kiev, and they want to encircle the city to make it suffocate meanwhile the rest of the troops are conquering the eastern and southern part of the country.
It is like ""we can't attack Kiev and win the war now, we need to conquer the more space we can before give an end to the war.""
And it's also a good diversion, for the rest of the world of course, but espacially for the Ukrainian forces who can't send troops from Kiev to Marioupol and Karkhiv since there are so many ennemy troops near to the capital city."
I think this was a very interesting video
This is the video I was waiting for.
what an amazing video. thank you for educating us on these specifics.
"Russia needs to build more infrastructure and railroads with their amount of civs. Ukraine should have built lvl. 10 forts. Also, Ukraine’s 7-1 division won’t cut it. The entrenched bonus isn’t enough without the engineer company. Ukraine should hire me to fix their division template."

POV I’m watching this while manning a fueler for my infantry brigade combat team in a field training event
"The Russian Federations Army has crushed the Ukrainian defense force and isolated it from being able to reinforce Kyiv. Now that this has happened, the Russian army can now split additional units off to assist IF there is an assault on Kyiv. 

In about a week the Russian Army has surrounded Kyiv and is on day 4 of negotiations... The government of Kyiv did not come to the negotiation table because Russia was losing. 
Every-single-commentator talking about his debacle at this point will have egg on their face very shortly and will have their credibility completely destroyed. All because they jumped on the Western medias bandwagon. Disgraceful . The Russian military is not desperate. Your story is completely upside down. Disgusting."
For a counter example of Word Class Logisitical feat do a video on Operation Serval then Barkhane and French logistics. Ukranian Antonov planes were actually quite important!
"Russia could shock and awe Ukraine in 48 hours but that's not what Russia wants! 
There is still energy,inet and gas availble. Keep on dreaming."
Americans also went in Afghanistan for juat 2 weeks and the rest is history.
They're not afraid of WW3 they're afraid their oil will be cut off.
Putin will fail
Pre-watch comment to wonder if Wendover actually knows Russian combat doctrine. Will update after
Yeah so I gotta be honest you're looking at the logistics from a western perspective but the russians have never operated the same as the west. Chris from Task & Purpose goes into the logistics of Russias military.
"i had also heard that the tires they use are cheap imitations of western tires made in china that can't handle the stress of the heavy vehicles in the mud causing you more delays and needing even more parts to keep going that more and more creates stress in logistics. logistics and the reliability of your equipment can make you win or lose a war.

Wrong. The main battles are in the east and south. Kiev is just kept under pressure
the global leaders should have been  calling on the denazification of Ukraine. Instead they allowed them to flourish for the past 8 years and now we have a mess.

@Lawrence Portwood and then they will send both
"@kahvaimuri First point, Taiwan isn’t part of NATO therefore Article 5 wouldn’t be invoked, therefore no NATO forces sent to Taiwan. 
                           Second point (I apologize for not being clear), in my statement when I said we I meant the US. I believe that the US dose not have the force strength to fight on two fronts nor the industry to build up the necessary force. US  has allowed China to be in the same position with the US as Russia is with Western Europe. Western Europe relays on Russia to meet 40% of their energy needs and the US relays on China on everything from basic goods up to things like steel, rare earth metals and other resources that are needed today for a modern military. 
                           Third point, as for Ukraine the best outcome is for them to sue for peace. Currently Putin holds all of the cards, with the West unable to put sanctions on Russia export of oil and gas (yes we are still importing oil from them). To top it off with the Biden administration taking US from energy independence to energy dependence and refusing to restart production here we could never meet the shortage that would result if Russia turned off the spigot. Unfortunately then Russia war in Ukraine is being financed by the West.
                            Fourth point, as for Russia taking Ukraine unless you see something I don’t short of WWIII that would shift the power back to the West then yes. Sanctions will not work this time, against the Soviet Union it did lead the it’s collapse but against the Russia Federation which has had sanctions of one kind or other since 1991(?) no. It’s as much economic and military and with the West dependence on Russia for it energy and the multi-billion dollar trade agreement with China as while as the US in the process of lifting sanctions against Iran, the writing is on the wall for anyone to see. Two more things to consider, Russia relationship with India (not sure how deep that goes) and the fact China has been working on getting off the US dollar and replace it with the Yuan. But I have seen very little on how Cryptocurrency could shift the economic power, I believe this to be the reason the government are attempting to regulate it, thank on it if either Russia and China or both agree on a common Cryptocurrency what it would to to the banking industry? If I remember correctly I did run across one article the pointed to Russia already moving in that direction but just the one."
"@James Lewis "" if we get bogged down in a conflict with Russia in Eastern Europe what is there to stop China from invading Taiwan? ""

Trying to understand the logic here.. west should just let Russia take Ukraine so that China wouldn't take Taiwan?

I just don't get it, can you elaborate? You thinking NATO/West will send forces to Taiwan if there's no teather open in the Eastern Europe?"

Putin gave Ukraine a 7 year heads up before committing to the full invasion. Genius!
"Above all, Ukrainians demonstrated the kind of unity and resolve that the West has been deprived of in the recent years. Ukraine reminds us all what we stand for, of the values we must uphold."

I can't really be against the Russians on this one. Globohomo hates me too.
How would you know this?
We don't  have to worry about the  Russians attacking nato we will soundly defeat  them
Dunno if I would've done an ad read on this one.
War
i'd love to see america actually go against an army with modern equipment and soldiers....
"For all their unobstructed preparation and planning the Russians are looking extremely inept. They will unfortunately win eventually due to their overwhelming size, but I hope we can provide limitless supplies to Ukraine to support their defense."
"@jimmy Ryan  I guess we’ll see, but Ukraine’s military will fall. No question there. Supplies won’t be reaching Ukraine after a while, when Russia cuts off arms supply from the EU. 

Tens of millions is a massive overestimate. Ukraine’s entire population is 44 million of which 1 million fled and nearly half a million has been mobilized after Ukraine was handing out guns to anybody with a pulse. Pretty much anybody willing to fight has already joined. So, about 500,000 are willing to fight for Ukraine."
"What size? Russia is winning with 190,000 soldiers vs 400,000+ Ukrainians. It’s just plain better."
Clips at 0:23 and 0:31 are already bunked!
"Really hit the whole picture going on currently. Very good explanation, thanks."
1st class
Dude this video is just full of western media biases. You have no valid evidence that they shelled the civilian population. If you watch the Russian version they say it's the Ukrainian nazis using civilians as human shields. Who is right here has anyone verified any of this. Meanwhile all counter narratives are BLOCKED AND BANNED in Europe and you make a video that plays into the governments message. This is sad dude.
"short question, did the nazis during ww2 ever say that the holocuast was unethical/ a war crime? or (during ww2 could you verify that what the we now know was really the truth?"
"Proper pronunciation of Kyiv and never referred to Ukraine and ""The Ukraine"". A+ job."

Everytime I see Putin on TV I'm fairly convinced he's using broadcast technology to radiate waves of small dick energy.
The Russian failure to logistics might also be effected by the russian soldiers themselves. Many of them could had low moral when they saw what is happening. I think I had read from some of the news sources that there had been some Russian soldiers that had surroundered and then help the Ukrainian military to better defend themselves against the russian military. But it is interesting to see how much a problem logistic can be to a war machine
"@ER Where is the evidence for such a claim? Where are the facts? Where are the numbers? Where are the sources? The author shows abandoned and burned equipment, claiming that it is Russian. But with the same success it can be Ukrainian. The armies of these countries use a lot of the same equipment because of the common Soviet past. For years, Ukraine has been pumped up with weapons, instructors and money. For years it has claimed to have the strongest military in Europe. And now this army, being at home in a defense in depth, is losing to these ineffective cowardly Russians who are inferior to them even in the number of soldiers used in this operation. L - logic."
"@Дмитрий Гарин on the contrary. Never in all my years have I seen such undisciplined, untrained, low-morale having, leaderless, supposed ""professionals."" These wonderful men have been seen giving up without a fight, robbing stores due to horrible logistics, bombarding civilian structures because they can't seem to hit anything that moves, and worst of all asking the civilians that live there for directions. Your standards have been reduced to the current might of the Russian military which the world can now see as piss poor. I'm sorry but I'm very disappointed in your troops performance. You're going to hold an L on this one comrade."
"@ER Everything about you is measured by money. It never occurs to you that somewhere there are citizens who love their country, support their president and their army. It's easier for you to believe that these are bots."
"Many russians doesn’t support this horrible war, and we’re scared of this too…
Hope this will end as soon as possible!🧡"
They look very scared of the war as they form long line in IKEA shops. This is pretty much all that scared russians are good for. Serves them right.
Very instructive. the kind of footage you see AFTER the conflict. This war is so stupid people are just stunned. One way to HELP is to book a UKRAINIAN AIR BnB ... this channel (unbelievably) is still open ... the details YOU have to research but the MONEY goes straight to the AIR BnB HOLIDAY PEOPLE !!! .... send them MONEY !!!!!..check it out yourself.
Great job!  Go Ukraine!
"In regard to the criticism about the push based logistics system.

Pushed logistics is the only system that can be used in the beginning of a uncertain conflict.

A pull based system can only be used in a sustained conflict. Where needs are determined by units on ground.

The idea that Russia should have used a pull base system is absurd, especially considering Units haven’t been on ground long enough to demand anything. Logistics MUST  be pushed in anticipation of need at the start"
I know I shouldn't limit and derive my opinion from western narrative alone but you and RealLifeLore really breaks down most areas and at the most impartial western content in youtube.
Very comprehensive video. It  would be nice if we can go back in time making video of how US invasion in Iraq for alleged WMD played out.

Man Russia gon fuck that poor country up. Just a feeling.
"If Putin is a dictator, Hitler was elected so was Bush democracy is not green light to invade others or a token of your fundamental goodness.
West is hypocrite and racist ask any viet or Iraki or Iranian or pretty much anyone outside NATO and west puppets

"Why's the need of showing a communist flag? What kind of subliminal message are you trying to put in our head? I'm against russia invasion (obviously), even have people involved directly in the conflict, but which such decisions this video losses its point."
So excellent

"Putin fans kept saying Dec 2021 - Jan 2022 that ""nooo, there is no attack, this is just a military exercise .... russians have right to have exercise where they want"".

How wrong they were..."
Logistic are the guys obsessed with what could go wrong. In a dictatorship of yes men who would think that would suffer? Also logistics require resources. Deny those resources and the flames of war will extinguish....
"People seem to forget that real life is not a video game and war is not call of duty. In real life, the Russian army struggles with the same thing the rest of Russia does, People DO.NOT.MATTER. This Russians are simply a tool for the leader whoever that is, the tsar, the comrade, or the president to achieve goals set out by Moscow. This includes things like supplies, Russians know their higher numbers will simply push the ukranians to defeat eventually, additional casualties that could be avoided mean nothing, in the Russian mentality."
"No failure, just a long seige.  Russia didn't cut off electric, water or communications, unlike when the U.S. 'liberates', in the name of democracy."
"Yea no doubt this looks really bad on  Russia. As much as they like to blow their own horns on how strong their military is...after almost two weeks of stalling out, the rest of the world is now saying ""Damn, ya'll ain't shit"""
Russian conscripts are NOT innocent victims of this war...
"Hats off, better than any explaination on main stream media that I've seen so far"
Thank you!
"Majority wins, Russia didn't plan on the world banding together. We couldn't win a war against the rest of the world."
"Don't forget China is helping Russia, their names appears in some of the Russian tactics :)"
I'm glad you stuck to the logistics and not the politics because what Western mainstream media is doing is ridiculous
"Failed so far.  I don't see Ukraine lasting long term here, as heroic as they are.  And the more we sanction and pressure Russia the more likely the madman will launch nukes."
Oh the world suddenly cares about wars and casualties when it comes to European and western countries huh. No one's this much butt hurted when the good western people destroyed murdered millions in middle east. Now I understand why most of the people hate Americans and westerns in general.
"Funny how all western youtube channels pushing that Russia weak agenda, clearly paid to escalate the conflict further. Stick to your planes, for fuck's sake"

I applied to go to Ukraine and fight but they denied me as I am American I have skills in shooting never been in a war but I’m deadly at the shooting range I know a shooting range is way different than a war but I can’t sit here and watch this anymore I seen a few American veterans that are going to Ukraine I don’t understand why I can’t I’m in in the USA military I would just be a foreign fighter freedom fighter I have nothing to lose anymore and I want to get there and fight with them and help them people I would rather die in the fight then watch it happen while we are being slow on giving them weapons and jets Ukraine showed they can beat Russia if they have the equipment and tools and medical aid . I’m going to try and get in touch and figure something out I want to go there I’m trying 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🇺🇸🇺🇸 if anyone has info on how I can help and get there please contact me.
How can it have failed when they captured so much land in less then 2 weeks. Why do we expect these wars to be done in a flash when I took US over 2 months just to establish themselves in Iraq
"A LESSON FROM THE PAST! >>> 
During the 2nd World War they had to rely on American ""Stud's"" or Studebaker (6X6 and 6X4) - trucks, given to them by the 10's of thousands by the Americans, otherwise they couldn't even be able to deliver ammo, replacements and fuel to their frontline fighting units, something the Soviet propaganda machine at work at home seemingly ""forgot"" during the Cold-War era. In the West the whole filo-Soviet and filo-Russian ""public opinion"" and all the Western ""rolex-communists"" forgot it, too. They've proclaimed and BOASTED what sort of ""champion of democracy&freedom"" the Soviet Union supposedly was. All the modern academia (even in the United States!) is FULL of this sort of FREAKS and this is what we have today as a result! ...children and hospitals being BOMBED while those DAMN MURDERERS were supposed to win this ""war"" within 48-72 hours TOPS. Their ""mighty blitzkrieg"" FAILED miserably, so their ""fearless leader"" lashes out in anger and threatens the world with NUCLEAR WEAPONS, while resorting to the type of war THEY KNOW BEST - a WAR OF PURE TERROR AGAINST CIVILIANS, advancing by LEVELLING EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING in front of them, which stiffens the Ukrainian defense even MORE!"

"Nothing has failed. The Russians are proceeding as they have planned. There are 12 brigades of Ukranian military encircled in the east and the Nazi Azov batallion is enveloped in a smaller cauldron in Mariupol. The Russians are acting to maintain the Kiev government in order to keep the state structure intact, unlike the Americans whose objective is to create chaos in countries like Iraq and Libya."
"Only one thumb up per user is just not enough for this video. I wish I could give you a thousand. This is more enlightening than all the news reporting on the subject that I've seen in the entire week, combined."
Don't you think these videos are somewhat presumptuous? The Russians have only just started this campaign of saving the people of Ukraine.
From my understanding they are not stopping just outside of the cities because of resistance or lack of supplies.  It is Russian military doctrine to set up supply stations to support thier advance.  In addition it is standard procedure to surround cities beyond their offensive range cut off all supplies and shell them into submission (a WW2 Russian tactic)
"This will be won by attrition and quantity of massive Russian industrial machinery, just like what WW2"

"Good thorough analysis. Thougj this could also be completely misleading considering how strategic and tricky Putin seems to be whan it comes to warfare.... you never know the cards until they are played. And I just wonder if  they failed so miserably why isn't the west and Nato rushing to the rescue like they do everywhere else around the world. Without even involving nuclear warfare which is another story in on its own. I guess I am not adequately informed in modern conflict  enough to be accurately analyzing this but I think there is a lot more that we don't know and that's terrifying 😳  super powers don't ever want a scenario where they have to fight each other in a war.....oh man Geopolitics.
One thing I know for sure these sanctions won't in anyway affect Russia and its plans if they want to see them through good or worse but us the real people just living our normal life will feel this to the bone in the coming months because for example in Germany the utility bills have went up over 200%  and are expected to keep growing... seems all the gas and oil we use comes from Russia... and then the sticker shock will follow at the grocery stores.

Very real YT account that's existed since early January... Lmao.
"The failed logistics? You mean the arming and fuel stations for their next round of infantry that’s actually their military instead of the young men and crappy tanks/equipment they sent to basically die.. I hope Putin pays for his evil madness and Rots in hell.. this just started folks,. Read the Russian way of war and look at history.. they circled their enemies.. set up fuel stations all the way back to Russia…"
"Welp. You didn't discuss what's going on in the east where the Russian military has encircled several cities employing the cauldron strategy, turning up the heat on Anzof Battalion and other extreme groups. Kiev is a distraction and not the primary focus right now. This is the same strategy used in Syria. This strategy is fundamental in the Russian military going back to the Tsars."

"Ultimately, the biggest problem is Putin himself. Between him and his oligarchs running a kleptocracy which is bleeding the country dry, and his reputation for defenestrating anyone telling him something is a bad idea (which means he mostly likely believes his own propaganda), it's no wonder this invasion was ill-thought, ill-prepared, and ill-executed"
The fact that this uses the conventions of historical education to discuss currently unfolding events is awesome to me

"Its laughable how poorly the invasion has been so far, Putin is a joke! 
Even if Putin takes Kyiv and other major towns, it will be IMPOSSIBLE to keep the country under Russian rule and this entire war is going to bleed Russia dry!"

Wasn’t it Ukraine that shot down a passenger plane in 2014?
"“Ukrainians” in the separatist states on the boarder of Russia, not the regular Ukrainian people"
"I find it incredibly silly that everybody expected Russia to have already invaded the entirety of Ukraine and the city of Kiev. 
It took a month and five days for Russia and Germany to blits Poland in ww2. It took Germany six weeks to blitz France in ww2. In both those wars it took weeks to plow through and gain as much territory as Russia has already done. They will wage war in a way they know they will win. Because this isn't the first time they invaded Ukraine."

That's nice that the universe revolves around you.  The rest of humanity wants to know how that feels.  Could you elaborate?
Hopefully the Ukraine people 🇺🇦 will make the Russians see sense and break the back of Putins government.

That's a little too far. A lot of major cities in the way.

I am not sure Russia has enough troops to sustain an occupation of a hostile population. Russia should really negotiate.
"So glad the USA is talking frequently to Zelensky to keep him updated on all of Russian’s movements per US intelligence. It is great Europe has also sent weapons & humanitarian aid. We got another shipment of both coming from us too. We can’t give him the “no-fly zone” due to Putin’s threat of nuclear war if we actively oppose him on the ground but the surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles are really working out for them. The Ukraine Army is fierce! It is truly David & Goliath, but tackling a country as big as Texas is too big of a bite to chew at one time, Putin, even with Belarus’s assistance. 🇺🇦💙🇺🇸💛🇺🇦💙🇺🇸💛🇺🇦💙🇺🇸💛🇺🇦✌️🕊"

"In a war surrounded by lies, the most widely believed, the most persistent, and the one with (from what my research has shown me) the least factual basis; is the story that not only was the revolution in Ukraine (2014) a ""coup"", but that the US staged it.

From consulting the only piece of evidence provided, the infamous Nuland-Pyatt phone call (both audio and transcript) in context with a timeline of events, I just don't see how you get ""coup"" out of it, much less a US backed coup.

If anyone has any evidence beyond ""muh phone call"" or appeals to popularity/authority (""it is known, Khaleesi""), please let me know.  I'm genuinely trying to understand why so many people believe what seems like the flimsiest of claims."
Napoleon: an army move with its stomach
"Russia is defined and designed for control and defense from enemies within or without. Historically, its rarer for Russia to win an offensive war compared to a defensive war. This is partly to keep a significant force available for insurgency and rebellion countering. Russia must win quickly, and its clearly failed in Ukraine."
"Russia was always horrible at logistics, just look at WW1 or their venture in Finland. 
Their tactics also are subpar, they always won wars mostly due to sheer numbers of their troops. 
Basically Zerg Rush B."
If Ukraine had nukes would this invasion have happened?
"What you are failing to mention is that the Russian's latest intention is not to march into Kyiv but to surround it and force it into surrender. They're stationed about 20kms around it, which is the range required for their missile launchers to cover Kyiv."
20 kms from the outskirts. Not enough to rocket the city itself. Only cruise and ballistic missiles are a problem for Kyiv right now and they are running out.
"He did mention this at end as he expressed what they could do as they get desperate, which isn’t a good feeling"
So is it over then ?

Crazy how we went from coronavirus to Russia Ukraine invasion
"If you voted for Joe Biden, you're DIRECTLY responsible for this and have the blood of every Ukrainian on your hands."
That's just not true though
"This video is grossly premature, but it seems everyone on Youtube is in a rush to capitalize on the latest sensational news. For context, the surrender of France in WW2 after Germany's 'lightning' campaign that everyone loves mocking them for, was after 7 weeks of fighting. Even Poland took them over a month to beat. And more recently, the US took 6 weeks to win Iraq.  Hell, this is an active warzone, so how do civilian content creators seemingly know so much about the nitty gritty of everything? Is Wendover part of US intelligence or something?"
In other words the russian military is committing premeditated murder and premeditated criminal acts of genocide against the ukrainian people.
"An interesting observation I made a while back is that both America and Russia base themselves on Rome and the might of her Legions, but the two countries took different lessons from the Empire. The US took from Rome her republican institution, her rule of law, and her logistics system, whilst Russia based itself off of Imperial splendor, the loyalty and duty towards home and leader, and the tactics of putting your weakest troops in the front so the enemy will wear themselves out before you commit your crack veterans and elites."
Russia is NEVER going to make it. The Entire world is against Putin…Not gonna happen. This cranky decision was foolish and makes Russia even weaker than ever.
Russia always seems losing when it eventually starves its main enemy even though it lost huge chunks of army like in Chechnya or Central Asia...in this case Ukraine because it functions differently than USA strategy of back and forth like in Iraq
"We fight!! And we will win!
From Kyiv!"
Real Title: Why shitting on Russia is now pop culture and I get to ride the gravy train!
yup unfortunately
Thanks for confirming that Putin's army is totally clueless and little prepared for what they have started. Слава Україні!
"In Iraq, we were a stones throw away from Subway/KFC/and Mcd's. For an entire year, we would pull route clearance duty with our giant JP8 guzzling MRAP's, sometimes for a couple days straight. Not once were we short on food, water, and gas. All this while other Brigades were doing the same thing in Afghanistan. Our country is not one to be fucked with, we got logistics down to a decimal point."
You shouldn't wear your heart on your sleeve. Being objective requires that you stay neutral or else you'll end up parroting propaganda.
"Hell yeah for Maxar, Planet Labs, and companies like them! Daily planet wide satellite images are important for journalists and humanitarian personnel to tell the story and help the needy in conflicts like these, not to mention all of the other amazing things a daily image of the entire planet can do for humanity, from farming to combating global warming. We used to have to take the governments word for it that they were giving us updated correct information when it came to spy satellite imagery, now we can look for ourselves (to a certain extent when it comes to actual resolution)."
Death of Russia
NATO is trying to expand more into Eastern Europe where it gets closer to Russia Putin knows what the West is trying to do here they're trying to make Russia crumble as a nation and Putin isn't gonna let that happen. America is the one to blame for this since they're the true boss of NATO America is obsessed with controlling the world. Look at how many countries America invaded and destroyed how come America isn't getting sancationed for all the war crimes they committed for like the last 70 years that has past in this world.

"By the time you learn much of your trusted information is (at the very least) incomplete information and at the very most d33p st@te propaganda, YT won't exist any longer for a correction video 

As NESARA-GESARA rolls out globally in the next few days-weeks, the former Soviet states will rejoin Russia (minus the communism) as none of them registered their borders (with adjacent sovereign country approvals). Because of that, according to the CIS treaty at USSRs breakup, territory disputes default to Russia. Now, because of that, the area known as Ukr (or any of the former Soviet states) is a Russian territory. Russia continued to fund each even though each was thought to be fully independent. Russia can't invade that which is theirs. Their dispute with Ukr is with the govt of Ukr which is largely d33p state (like the Ukr military).

UNs Sec Gen Ban Ki Moon in 2014 mentioned in open assembly that the Ukr@ine hadn't ever registered its borders with the UN, therefore it was never recognized as a country. It is still Russian territory. And, since Ukr@ine is a Russian territory, there cannot be an invasion as people are being lead to believe.

Vl@d's cleansing of Ukr's DS bioweapon & other DS labs & DS manufacturing & DS military targets was necessary. His actions were was never against the public. It was against the hidden Ukr corruption.

Ukr@ine has become a d33p st@te playground. T@iwan is another DS playground, though not as many hidden underground targets as Ukr.

So, what's the d33p st@te (DS)?

The d33p st@te is 'a coordinated trans national criminal organization' that is silently embedded in all areas of life be it governance, education, religion, politics, medicine, judicial, law enforcement, workplace, etc. 

The d33p st@te operates upon it's own set of guidelines while giving the public a different set of laws & mandates (they made via their embedded agents scattered everywhere) they formed and put into place.

The d33p st@te never ever stands up and takes credit for it's actions. After something happens, because the DS agents are wearing garb of the larger group they are  an agent to, the larger group gets the blame because the DS wears no DS uniform. Russia's KGB/FSB is d33p st@te operation just as USAs State Dept/CIA/FBI/DIA/etc (intelligence agencies) and UKs MI6, & Israel's Mossad. That doesn't mean there's not good agents in these. There are. The good agents dont follow the c@b@ls full set of orders. They are DS infiltrators.

Much of the world history where millions of civilians are killed was a result of a DS operation. So, when Russia killed (by starvation) of Ukr@ini@ns in the 1930s, that was a DS operation. Sometimes there was a DS leader. Sometimes not. Either way, the DS embedded agents would have somehow forced all this death.

One of the telltale signs of DS activity is watching the reverberation of a relatively small catastrophe (DS caused) into a much larger wave of fear scattered among most of the public.

This is how the DS pulled off the ho@x of C19 by putting a catastrophe in everyone's face (on the news [corporate media & big tech & big pharma has c@b@l membership]) with the suggestion this is something to fear using their suggested measures. When you control the media & social media as the c@b@l does, you will not allow the real truth out but only continue your fear porn you push to maintain control of the people.

Good advice anyone can easily follow...listen to media & believe the opposite of what they declare. That's the easiest way to know what's going on."
This is frankly embarrassing.
this proves this was planned years ago

"I can suggest the YouTuber Adam Something, he basically predicted the whole war outcome pretty reliable last year and he does daily community post to update"
"Great narrative of the war. It's amazing that in this time, we can analyze a whole war in real-time, rather than have to study battles and wars months if not years afterward. It's a big question now whether Russia is aware that they have lost and will withdraw, or if NATO will have to step in to stop the senseless violence."

"""going in guns blazing"" where the hell did you see the russian army do that the first 4 days? You have no idea what you are talking about. Apart from crimea, the rest of the russian soldiers were conscript doing their military service, many of them never fired a gun in their life and had no idea they were invading Ukraine as video of the one caught by the Ukrainian show, they were teachers, shop keepers ..... and their amateurish behavior asking for help, food....shows. Things changed when chechen and some regular platoon were sent ...."
you were memed by chechen media warriors since they don't obey rules of normal russian military of not having a phone with you. Actually it seems they are not doing very much aside from uploading clips in their tic-toc pages.

"300 civilians died and a further 700 were wounded, you are wrong. Entire city blocks of Kharkiv are now gone. Alexeyevka, North Saltovka and KhTZ are no longer habitable."
False. Russia is shelling civilians

Great video
"Top-down logistics is a problem that's likely hand-in-hand with authoritarianism. The ones at the top don't trust anyone under them to do their job correctly, so they construct a system that puts them solely in charge. If everything works right, then it's often a more efficient way to do things. But as we all know, plans are great, until you get punched in the face, so to speak."
"In college I read a book on the Ottoman wars, and they had a quite similar if not identical logistical approach and ultimately problem. In preparation for invasion, they would within their own lands and up to the border, renew or build roads, bridges etc and set up supply depots along the route, mostly grain silos. However, this meant that once in enemy territory they relied on foraging and looting to keep the army fed, after the presumed supply they brought ran out. They would have to reach their objective relatively quickly and hope for a quick victory as well, since in a prolonged siege their supplies were at risk of diminishing if not running out wholesale. This would force either a retreat, or an all out attack on the city in a last-ditched effort of capture.

So what I'm saying is that Kyiv is probably gonna get stormed heavily. But if they win that fight, it could actually be enough."
It’s insane how social media is playing such a huge role in this war. Its another aspect of information war that countries will have to think about from now on.

"I didn't believe at first there is anything wrong with Putin's judgement, but every day now I'm more and more convinced you're right. He was in absolute power for too long without even a break, and he was very lucky a number of times. It messed with his head.

A simple explanation for those who do not understand this with Ukraine ...
So, 20 years ago, Ukraine divorced her husband (Russia).
She inherited children from this marriage.
The former was generous and left her a lot of money, property, and then repaid all her debts of 200 billion!
After parting with her husband, the woman immediately started flirting with a village bully (USA) and a gang of robbers (West). One way or another, she started listening only to their opinion and attacked her ex-husband with them.
The ex-husband got angry and forcibly took away one child - Crimea.
At that time, the ex-wife was offended and dreamed of marrying a NATO clan in order to force pressure on her ex-husband and take Crimea back. But the American village hooligan did not even want to marry her, hoping that he would use and, with her help, humiliate her ex-husband - Russia.
She occasionally slapped her other two children - Lugansk and Donetsk. The children cried and looked for their father, who came to help and quarreled with his ex-wife, but to no avail ... The main hooligan continued to provoke quarrels, using her and wanting her wealth, and incited her to quarrel and gave her goods. (military equipment that has usually expired).
The woman thought she had time to rely on and began to brazenly provoke her ex-husband. His patience ran out. With the help of his relatives, he set out to fight to protect his children.
Then she, together with the hooligans, got scared, but the main bully and hooligans left her stranded in a further quarrel with her ex-husband, who now controls her and the money that left her children ..."

"Well it has only been 9 days, we are still extremely early on in this war. Ukraine has one of the strongest armies in europe but they cannot win despite how much their propaganda is telling us they can. They have been trying to get people from other countries to fight for them, not letting 16-60 year olds leave and ukrainian soldiers are executing russian soldiers. I'm sure people can do their own research on the racial discrimination happening on the polish border right now. By no means am i supporting Putin, he is a horrible person who deserves to be killed for the amount of people hes fucked with this conflict but we need to realise that both sides are spewing propaganda, not just Russia."
"Also you miss 1 point. I think critical one. We not fight like US - steamroll enemy without makin difference - civilians or not. This hit logistic hard, i agree. But it is choice of this way or insane amount of civilian victims."

Worse, soem places it outright occupied (like Hawaii), subverted it, and made it become a state at gun point.    hawaii wasn't even a state when the US ships were bombed in Pear Harbor.. it didn't become a state until 1959."
"@roger0929 I don't smoke anything.  I don't hang out in a gang of thugs?  Do you?  I don't go around making rules up and threatening strangers with imprisonment if they don't conform and comply to my rules.  Do you?   When they don't comply with my rules, I don't surround their house with my thug click and weapons drawn dressed in black gestapo riot gear.  Do you?

When you flip it around,  as if you were doing their same behavior, you see how bizarre and unnatural and unciviliazed and evil their behavior is.   So yeah, just say no to gangs of thugs.   

They think they are Spartans and the rest of us are Helots they have some kind of right by might to live parasitically upon.   Sparta was the origin of the wickedness that is statism."

"The Russian army is built for large scale defence while the US, French, and UK armies are designed as global expeditionary forces."
"@John Davis not when they rely on rail, have little strategic air lift, a small blue water navy, realy on large air defence system for cover, and are manned by concripts. They do have more capable units such as the airborne but most are formations to large for modern expeditionary assaults. They are mainly attacking ukr with combined arms brigades which are scratch forces a bit like german kumftgrupper. They don't have the same sort of organic support as the formal formations. These are not the elements of a force designed for the offensive.

Yes they use it on the offensive and it was more intended for that in the 80s but the armies strategic vision is for war again a numerically and technologically advanced enemy, ie nato."
"If you read any Russian military doctrine you will see it is almost entirely focussed on offense. That is also why they have many Special Forces, paratroops, etc. These are not defensive units. No Russian military operations since 1945 have been defensive in nature."
when have any of those countries ever needed to defend itself other than france in wwii?
"Keep on barking, the Bear is still KING.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"Hey halfwits. That's the hammer parked there. They don't actually need it right now, so its parked. You have to park it somewhere and that is a good place should you need it. As well its a statement. ""You cannot do anything about it."" Go ahead and try. ;)"
"9:49

"Why have commentators started pronouncing KIEV as Kyiv which is the Ukrainian pronunciation. Similarly we say Moscow, we don't say Mosckva. It says in Wikipedia ""Kiev is the traditional English name for the city, but because of its historical derivation from the Russian name, Kiev became disfavored in many Western media outlets after the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War"". What bs."
Kiev is Soviet legacy. Kyiv is modern.
What's the non-Ukrainian pronunciation?
It's crazy to think how much of an impact social media is having on matters like this
"@Дмитрий Гарин Never said anything of the likes, only that as far as I know I can still go on the internet and write whatever I want in a twitter post as long as I keep to their terms of service."
Yea facebook bans anyone that goes against their views
@Amphiuma III more like everyone is an armchair general now
"Russia might have won already if Vlodomir Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people were not so inspiring.  Initially I thought is was good timing to be on one of the last flights out of Kyiv (booked there and back in November), but now I am having survivor’s guilt seeing their bravery overcoming fascism.  I am wondering if I should go back, or donate most of my paychecks to Ukrainians."
"Maybe ""lend"" massive amounts of tanks etc and let volunteer weapon experts join under Ukrainian colors."
Need a negotiated peace settlement asap

It didn't help when the clown in chief known as Joe Biden destroyed domestic oil production and refining within the US to then in turn import it from Russia. This added revenue of 100s of billions of dollars is what gave Putin the cash to build up the military and causing the current situation in Ukraine.
"Good day. Or evening. I am Russian, and i tell you - we dont want this war. No sane person want it. But also i cant deny thet in this situation it is two gouverments to blame. Or more likely 3 (we all know who is 3rd one. Begin with U and end with S). We blame politics who couldnt just get into sences. Our attak was wrong, but we dont had any choice left after Ukrainian president words about nuclear weapon. And i dont know if it even worth mentoing 8 years of two-faced western policy of closed eyes for systematic acts of Ukrainian agressions against respublics ?
I dont know whole truth. Non of us are. But i really hope this idiotism (most soft word i can describe situation) will end as soon as possible."

"This is embarrassing. Maybe Putin instead of invading other countries should fix the shit inside his country. Stop the corruption, increase infrastructure spending, fix it's economy, start building it's own computers, get rid of the oleygargs and so much. The USSR didn't fall because of the west, the USSR fell because it was shit and had to go, the Empire of Russia at its peak was far more glorious and had more prestige than the USSR ever had. It was a step sideways and because of Stalin , Russia is yet to recover it's pre WWII population. Putin should look to the future not the past"

"This missed one factor :
Crippling corruption. Like they are running out of truck tires because they have been sold elsewhere before the war."
"The same happened with the ""excess"" of fuel being brought to Belarus for ""military exercises"". Someone thought to themselves that so much fuel wasn't needed for exercises and sold it lol"
15:40 Well then Ukranian partizans. You know what to do.
analysis based on twitter posts lol
"To build infrastructure you have to be somewhat unmolested, even when its portable, also those trains are sitting ducks, it works in Russia cause no ones waiting with a javelin to take out the engine. The Ukrainians wont let them build anything. Also the sanctions wont let them have the time for a long war. The economy will tank at home, and the fact the Russians are trying to shut down twitter and Facebook says the people at home aren't buying the bullshit. So they have lost the morale war, they have lost the people at home war, they have lost the international soft power war, and are on a fast track to being the next North Korea in terms of international perception and sanctions. The long term is impossible, the short term is laughable, So in the end Putin has already lost. He's screwed and what does he get from all this now? He single handledly unified Nato, embarrassed himself internationally, crippled his own economy, pissed off his oligarchs and is being ostracized in every way, Every major corporation is literally ending business in Russia, divesting of Russia assets and cutting him off of Tech. 

Putin will fold, its just when, and how much damage its gonna do to the Ukraine before he does."
"6:20 Huh? I thought Ukraine retracted their statement of retaking the airport, shortly after making it? Ultimately, that ended up being propaganda like the Ghosts of Snake Island, or the holocaust memorial that is completely undamaged."
"Thankfully I have perfected the signatures of Vladimir Putin and several other high-ranking Russian officials. Little do these people realize that the Kremlin will be put up for sale on the black market.
I even have government seal stamps in Vladimir Putin's name and a Russian notary stamp in his name as well."
So if you blow up train stations behind the lines = russa is fucked for sure
"We still can't underestimate the potential power they hold of making the whole world a worse place for many decades to come.
They are very very dangerously playing with everyone's hands over the same fire. Ukrainians are ""just"" (please pardon me) getting the worst of it but all nations of earth are at risk because of Putin's actions."
Yeah.
you need some IQ to use logic logistics are kinda retart
"So basically, over reliance of trains by the Russian military. Does this mean when RU does finally supply their military, they will make more progress?"
Yes.
"Failed logistics? Lol

"Well lets see so far they have: Failed to inflict any meaningful damage on a far inferior military, are running low on supplies, and are getting pushed back."

"In short, Russia's infrastructure and military doctrine are entirely defense-oriented and they have neither the tools nor the knowledge to effectively invade someone. It's what saved them in the Napoleonic campaign and World War 2, and what ruined them in World War 1."

"Putin tried to do a Zerg rush without any logistical planning, just sent them with no direction at all LUL."
"The sheer quantity of cope I have seen over the last 72 hours is breathtaking. “Putin is frustrated!” “Russian soldiers are dying.” “Russian citizens are angry!” “Russian generals are threatening to resign!” And now this video, on the ‘disastrous’ logistics of the invasion.

If anybody is reading this, if I haven’t been banned by Wendover, know this: In war, nothing goes according to plan. But Putin is doing a lot better than we thought he would, and the conflict will be ongoing for a long time yet. I encourage everyone to learn to recognize propaganda, cope, and lies.

Thank you."
"@The Sorge According to Wendover, I can’t actually have the opinion I claim to have, because I disagree with the official narrative that you just gave me. That, all by itself, is proof that you’re misinformed."

I'm not buying it bro.  This reeks of propaganda because Russia isn't even going that hard.  If they wanted Kiev badass enough they'd bomb it.  They seem like they're not trying to hurt civilians.

L + Ratio + Russia fell off + Ukraine is built different + Stay mad
"I could agree with some points of this video, but the over-arching theme of Russia ""failing"" skews this video. A lot of the blank space from the fog of war is filled in this video by biased assumptions. I see a lot of the logistical points as more obstacles that might or might not be solved than decisive points of failure. I believe It's still entirely too early to call because the conflict is still going on. This video would have been more factual if you had waited until after this entire thing plays out. Though I get that this topic is at it's peak sensationalism right now, and calling it before it ends based on your logistical analysis would be a win to your channel."
"Could u make a video about the invation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and all the other countries?"

"@Sambain Got oil, but none for their military hardware, apparently. And again, why destroy Kyiv if this is supposed to be about helping the Ukrainians? If you want to liberate someone, typically you don't lay waste to their infrastructure."
"@Sambain Russia's taking way too long to actually accomplish anything of substance, and they won't have the manpower and resources to properly occupy any major cities they manage to take. Russia's economy is crashing very fast and the military is suffering mounting casualties and materiel losses along with worsening morale, they don't have time to wait. If you want to Blitzkrieg then you have to actually blitz, otherwise it's just a  sloppy, rushed krieg. And I thought this was a ""special military excercise"" about ""denazification"" and freeing the Ukrainian people? Why level the capital if that's their justification for invading?"
@The Sorge I also believe that Zelensky is NOT in Ukraine.
It's not failure if you consider that Russia don't really care about their own solders. They sent a mass of not prepared people with old equipment to create chaos
"9:50 ""welcome to hell"", more like ""go **** yourself"""
But did it?
The invasion only started recently and Wendover's already made such a high-quality video. Absolutely wild.
"Very informative video, thank you!"
This was actually the first Nebula/Curiosity Stream placement which genuinely made me interested in signing up for it. And I have seen a couple already
Chriousity stream has good content but the android app is completely broken and non functional
I signed up just because I hate that Youtube is a monopoly. And it helps quality creators have a second source of income if anything happens with Youtube.
"Me too and I'm sooo tempted. But, sorry Sam to say this, I simply can't afford a subscription. No, I don't mean the money, that's nothing, it's the time. If I signed up for the Nebula/Curiosity Stream package, I would end up watching videos 24/7 until I passed out. Then, when I woke up, I would start all over again. I might remember to eat some food and drink some water once a week or so but don't bet on it.

"The US and its other 15 allies’ logistics was at least 100 times better than China during the so-called Korean War, not to mention how poor China was at the time. But did the US finish the war in 9 days?"

“Amateurs talk strategy. Professionals talk logistics”
Not to be a prick but you really need to provide your sources. Regardless of where casualties are there are multiple reports spouting different numbers because its an evolving situation. For all you know these numbers are false.
"History is replete with examples of logistics being a decisive factor in the success of military campaigns.  In WWII the biggest threat that Churchill feared was the U-Boat menace.  If Germany was able to maintain its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign against shipping, Britain would probably been starved into suing for peace before the allies were able to mass their forces for the invasion of western Europe and sustain the Soviet offensives in the East with war materials.  And following the Normand landings, the Red Ball express was able to keep advancing forces resupplied as they pressed towards Germany.  Blitzkrieg tactics depend on timely, flexible, sustainable and survivable logistic support to work."
The Germans did use unrestricted U-boat warfare in WWII. The Allies simply went from sending unprotected ships to using a convoy system where supply ships traveled in groups protected by war ships.
"@alganhar1 through the worst of it not only was England able to get all its supplies it was able to keep the german surface fleet grounded, annihilate the italian fleet and fight japan. It was also able to run supplies to the wars in Africa, the Middle East, supply the soviets and get ground troops to the Pacific"

I wouldn’t say that it failed. Putin is a smart person and I swear he knew that something like this would happen
"He is smart, but I'm starting to think he might have actually lost his grip on reality. His generals promised him Kyiv in 2 days, and I'm not sure that he did NOT believe."
"I feel like the poorly planned logistics is symptomatic of the greater disease Russia has: its struggling economy. While living in Eastern Europe just a few years back, friends and I would joke that certain areas of the country were ""Eastern Europe"" vs ""Western Russia."" Russia's wealth was always in the hand of the powerful few, while the rest were left to scrape by. This includes their military. Many of the soldiers in Ukraine have had little training and worse pay due to Russia's stranglehold on the economy, and it will only get worse with sanctions. And while it's a good way to hit them where it hurts, I fear for the Russian people who face starvation due to sanctions. So many are trying their best to flee the country all together because they know that economic collapse is on the way.

Nothing good came of this war. Only pain and suffering for everyone involved, especially the people of Ukraine."
@QualityPen but has never been sanctions like these before keep talking you better go convert your money to Euro or Dollar before Ruble become a paperweight
@QualityPen Russia's economy is utterly laughable for a nation its size
I’ve been listening about the impending collapse of the Russian economy for 8 years now.
"@jackthegamer Russian authorities also keep this possibility in mind, which is why just yesterday a bill was passed to instate insane fines and up to 15 years of jail time for ""publicly discrediting the Russian military"" or just speaking against the military operation in general. Oh, and the media are also not allowed to call it ""war"", ""invasion"" or ""aggression"" under threat of closure."
this might infact push them to revolt and pull putin out
You just blew my mind with the quality of your coverage. You outclassed publicly funded television stations with your superb research and background.
Do you think the people watching your video do not know how to convert km to miles ?
"There's complaints about either way, so both are provided, stop whining to just hear yourself whine."
"thank you for this. As a resident of Kiev right now, it is great to see someone asessing thi situation rightly."

"Russias invasion of Ukraine is basically a really bad practical joke gone that's way, way, WAY to far."
"It's too early to judge that it failed, Russia is still gaining ground and hadn't deployed their new if u can say ''tech"" no t-90 were seen on the battlefields. it's just old soviet era weapons being used apart from the airstrikes on bases and airports."
"@Dexter Kofa ikr. And as the dude said their military relies on rail network, all the connections have been blown off. They can fix them now cuz that ground is in their control. The supply chain will function again as intended."
"Ah yes, thin roof armor and cope cages, surely that will end up with a different results than the T-72's."
Exactly. Even the blitzkrieg lasted more than six months and the Germans still lost the war. So I'm amazed that people can conclude the outcome of a war a little over a week after it started.
they ask supply and direction from people they are invading? thats comedic gold
"News: Russia's military logistics seem to have broken down in their invasion. 

Wendover: Did somebody say logistics?"
Hope putin ends up like Gadafi
I am not a military expert but know how important logistics is to an army. So I still cannot understand how they did not factor this in... Especially since everyone knew they were amassing troops so had time to prepare for defence.

"@Matthias May, I doubt those were actually the best elite forces. The best ones have not entered the scene yet (and I don't understand why; Putin is afraid to leave his back open, figuratively speaking?). But otherwise you're completely right."
Glory to Ukraine!
I feel so sad for the innocent Russians and ukranians
I can understand the Germans logistics being inadequate in Russia. But not Russia in Russia.
So you are part of the deep state. You are finished.
"I think there's a case to be made that Russia's supply issues are a feature, not a bug. Insufficient food and other supplies incentivizes the troops to loot and pillage to get what they need, further weakening Ukraine. Most of the death tolls in European wars, with the possible exception of the World Wars, was not through enemy action but rather by famine driven by marauding armies, most famously the 30 years war.

Another thing to consider is that the majority of the Russian people's hearts don't seem to be in it for this conflict. Forcing the troops to steal and kill to avoid starvation would be one way of getting them to fight harder."
All that railway track and only one motorway. A third world country or what?
"‘Key-ef’

Well if Russian civil service is like Britain 🇬🇧 they still working from home 🏡
Sounds like you been drinking to much of your own urine.
"Beautiful, informative episode. Thank you!"
I'm now thinking of all the ways gurilla fighters can halt supply trucks with rifles spikes and molotovs
This was well put together. Peace and love to the people of Ukraine
"*For future watchers* : 
The war is still ongoing.
The strategy used by Putin is very much inline with the war against Chechen, though the speculated losses are way greater in a shorter timespan. 
Слава Україні!"
"Hello from Ukraine! The front is nearer than 30 km from me, but our people are ready to anything. We are Home. And I hope they all will go to hell for that. About the logistics - they really sucks. Hope that this factor brings soon the end of war.
Sorry, my english not so good, I hope you understood what I said."
"@SAM08G Героям слава! Thank you for this words. Our army fights the best. Thanks them we are still live without war in our city, despite it is a state center with million people. But we have not a lot of planes and pilots and need a help with it. It is very sad that west partners still don't try to ""close the sky"", because that is the ONLY thing we can not always defend. And civilians is killed and injured by rockets and bombs. Ground forces just can't break our defence, only air."
"God bless you, stay strong and keep fighting to the end. The whole world will help rebuild Ukraine after this coward and unprovoked attack and ensure Putin and his inner circle pay the price for their actions. We are all allies now and have a common enemy, I hope to see Russian economy completely ruined very soon. Слава Україні!"
"There is also the factor that russian army is infested with corruption. Generals that dont do their jobs, that sell equipment in the black market, that fill high positions with uncapable family and friends. Its shitshow, like the country itself"

"@Thechlebek I rather hope it goes smoothly, wouldn't want witness Russia going crazy"
@Robo Chmel yeah wait for them to double
@Thechlebekthese numbers I'm not familiar with . Wait until it's all over.
@Robo Chmel is loosing almost 300 tanks and 10 000 russians affordable too?
"@Thechlebek that's affordable and minor, otherwise it would have been prevented"
"It had nothing to do with logistics,they was showing ristraint, because they didn't want alot of civilian deaths,but the fascist ukra-nazis put all their weapons in city's,and arming civilians out of uniform,causing them to lose soldiers unnecessary,but nowp Russia has taken the gloves off and now Ukraine will be finished with in the next two weeks,if Russia behaved like the us and NATO bomb a small city like Belgrade for 80 days before even sending in a single soldier,bomb Bagdad for 50 days,that's the difference."
May Putin soon realize he cannot win and is only causing unnecessary deaths. Slava Ukraina!
@ForOne814 ah I see- you are a Russian propagandist. Don't know why I bothered answering ypu.
"@NGCAnderopolis I don't think it ever had them to begin with, Russians that are there are quite loyal though. As to Mariopol, civilians there are being held hostage by Azov. When the war is over, we'll see trials of these war criminals."
"That's hilarious, Russia will win, the only question is will Kiev look like Grozny or not."
wait till the russians get tired and give kyev the grozny  strategy
Thank you and your team for making this incredibly informative video. By far the best one I’ve seen on the matter.
Gomel is pronounced Goh-mell
The Logistics of wendover production uploading a video on current topic much better than the logistics of the Russian military :)
I find it interesting that russian fuel trucks in the conflict zone have full hazmat labeling on the truck including the orange sign that singles them out as a target from afar.
The russian's desperation is just evidence of how badly they failed
:-(
"Russian military doctrine is a generation behind, they are still using World War 2 and Cold War era tactics."
Town hall 14 invades town hall 10 and only gets 1 star
and then someone forgot to maintain tires
"plot twist: ukraine now has more tanks than before the war, thanks to russia"
"As a member of Russian opposition who followed every bit of information available, repeatedly warning my US friends of how dangerous Putin's dictatorship is (fell on deaf ears mostly ""oh you exaggerate"")

I found this video surprisingly well researched! Great job 👍"
"So it’s been just over a week, and you’re saying Russia is failing? What a joke. Russia has encircled pockets of troops, and will maybe do even another. If anything, it looks like they’re succeeding."
Thank you for the analysis
Russian military: write that down!
Peak military logistics was the Mongols who would choose female horses so they could drink their milk/blood while riding through Eurasia.
"5:19 '' DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IN THE COUNTRY THEY BELIEVED THEY WERE THERE TO LIBERATE.


yeah that cut short what US did in every invasion along his history."
Wendover has mustered greater logistical prowess in producing this video so quickly than the entirety of the Russian military has managed to achieve in the war thus far.
@HPSAUCE 10 in Europe...so that makes them special 🤔
"@Nuclear Warhead yes, alot of people expected them to give up pretty quickly."
"@Nuclear Warhead It is the first interstate war in Europe for over 70 years, I think that's fair enough tbh"
@HPSAUCE 10 they're milking and monopolizing the entire event dry.
"@Nuclear Warhead Nope, but I wasn't expecting this boi to make a video this fast either."
"Cry me a fucking river

It was ok for NATO to bomb serbia, no support from the west because the west was the one doing the bombing.

I feel bad for the poor Ukrainian civilians, it's a complete disaster. 

But the west is only worried about the civilians if Orthodox Christians are on the opposite side."

"I saw a video of a Russian vehicle just stuck in the middle of the road in Ukraine:

Ukrainian man: What happened guys?
Russian soldiers: Out of fuel.
Ukrainian man: Want me to tow you…back to Russia??
Russian soldiers: hahahahaha"
The war is a week old 😂 Yall thought it was gonna be over in a day?
That day 1 paratrooper drop at Hostomel airfield and the fact that Russian airspace along the border was closed initially just till March the 2'nd shows there was a strong stake on finishing the war in 6 days.
"lol im only 2 minutes in and im sitting here like, were questioning russia setting up bases in their own country near others, yet we in the US have bases in like every country around the world, granted most of them want us there but, theres a lot that probably dont. weird"
The world needs to turn their backs to Russia...for a very long time. We should not forget this aggression and subjugation of Ukraine. Ever.
"Ukraine is a European country and trying to go ts own way and fighting for its life...not sure you compare to your examples. Ukraine did not initiate this. At least, there is lots of global support."
@Andrew Downie So you basically agreed with me. Dare to say that usinf a smaller word count?
Why should we? How do Afghanistan or Iraq differ?
If Russia didnt  have nukes they would be destroyed so easily looking at how bad their actual army is.
Thanks  for the video!
Praying for Ukraine  🙏
they shouldn't have updated to no step back
How pathetic
"Dude Johnny Harris's video explained why people will cause Russia to lose the war, and this video explains how the moving of things will cause Russia to lose the war. Too perfect."
Lazerpig also explained why overhyped Russian technology will cause Russia to lose the war.
We can win this war FOR THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 GOD WITH YOU ALL! Victory in our Lord Jesus Christ.
"Just here to point out that some of your footage is possibly inaccurate, due to the presence of a “confederate” flag.

And yet, I commend you for the hard research and fact-checking that you have done that easily surpasses some of the reporters from country wide media channels where I live.

Among their offenses: showing “footage” from Ukraine including one of a downed *tie* fighter, and DCS simulator. Reporting that the AN-225 was *shot down* and then without fact checking-  inventing a conspiracy that the Russians were planning to use that Russian (kill me now) plane to transport troops to Kiev to conquer it, but the Ukrainians shot it down….

Who needs fake news when you have lazy half assed reporters?"
"That is stock footage, not actual battlefield footage...."
"At 1:53 the flag looks similar, but it's missing the stars. I'm guessing the flag means something else because I can't think of a rationale for flying the Russian and Confederate flags simultaneously unless you're Tucker Carlson."

"Failed logistics? Mate, innocent civilians died."
"Russia has always had this problem. In WW2 the Soviet Union had to “leap frog” its attacks towards germany. They would build up forces, then make a colossal push and advance for only a few tens of miles until they had to stop and wait for resupplies. And that continued all the way until Berlin."
@RedZeckez well said.
Russia are always strong when they are in counter-attack mode. it's Always feel like the army hate invading other lands for no reason.
Special genocide operation
"Most accurate assessment thus far, couldnt have put it better myself."
Their biggest misstep was underestimating the will of the Ukrainian people.

1:51 anyone else notice that flag?  That's.... well that's weird!  I had to Google that one
"@GlizzyKing Novorossiya's flag resembles the 1860s USA confederacy.  Some articles online disagree if this means anything or is just coincidence: The Moscow Times reports that similarities to the Confederate flag are apparently not intentional. They located the Ukrainian insurgency supporter credited with introducing the design; he says he merely found it ""online somewhere."""
"Considering how much sheer territory was taken in a grand total of 8 days - their logistics didn't fail. The US couldn't do this much with countries with a fraction of the military power of Ukraine.

Let me end by saying I don't like what Russia is doing. I have to say that both because I actually don't like it, plus if I don't, Americans will pour in with ""Russian bot!"" purely because I didn't write a scathing paragraph denouncing Russia. Which is why I tend to limit my discussions about Russia to in-person - so they don't have that crutch to lean on when their perception of reality challenged. Notice Wendover Productions did the same thing in the pinned reply.

Here's the hard truth: both Russia and Ukraine are terrible countries. The people are being mistreated and abused in both. Russians don't want war / Ukrainians don't want war. Russia is an oligarchy that leaves no room for the voice of the people, and Ukraine uses white phosphorus on civilians.... And funds fascist paramilitar- ah fuck, the ""Russian Bot!"" spam is coming"
Yet another mind corrupted by Paradox games
"A lot of territory is flat land that is mostly indefensible against a superior foe. Defenses purposefully gave up that ground to get a better position and thin out the enemy and force it to stretch past its logistical capabilities.
You're looking at the red color on a map while not thinking about the context. The US in similar situations has delivered an absolute curbstomping (situations such as the kickoff of 73 Easting where infantry fighting vehicles came across a superior number of main battle tanks with the defensive advantage, and still the lesser vehicles took out several tanks on their own before help arrived) while Russia seems to be dragged into ambush after ambush as their enemy recognizes that they can't trade blows and expect to survive."
"Incorrect opinion detected, local authorities are notified."
I guess Russia needs amazon to win their next conflict.
Considering how much sheer territory was taken in a grand total of 8 days - their logistics didn't fail. The US couldn't do this much with countries with a fraction of the military power of Ukraine.
What if Putin is sending teens that he labels as liberal on a suicide mission
Great video about the logistics viewpoint of this war. But. Too. Many. Pauses. In. The. Narration. 1.25 x speed.
The USSR depended heavily on US supplied trucks and fuel during WWII.
Wallstreet help russia and china to be great power.
Lol don't give them ideas
"It took Germany and Russia COMBINED a whole month to conquer Poland, which is a smaller country.  Let's not get too ecstatic yet."
They didn't have access to artillery and air power at this scale. Modern wars are decided much quicker.
Soviet Union joined the fun (not funny) only after it was clear that germans took out most of polish military strenght and were ready to slice more land then it was anticipated with Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.

This entire war would NOT be happening if we had the courage to accept Ukraine’s pleading to join NATO at any point over the last 14 years
"How tho? Russian navy base in Crimea's Sevastopol was there since the collapse of USSR, and due to the rules NATO set in 1999 the applying country shouldn't have any ""defense issues"" which in my mind include another country's atomic missile cruisers and frigates docking in your port."
Nice piece of propaganda 💩 but Russia is beating the crap out of the zest pool of corruption that is Ukraine GOD BLESS RUSSIA
yep ukrain will fall its weak
"Your accent sounds American, forgive me if I’m incorrect. Russian war doctrine is vastly different than many western cultures. 

I wouldn’t quite say things aren’t going according to Russian plans. I would more say their “plans” are just less tactical/surgical (I hope those words make sense).

Can you do another video comparing this to Georgia or other examples of Russians “similar aggressions”? I think it will help a lot of people remove their own biases of how a completely different culture conducts themselves in time of war vs how their own culture does."
"This is cope. Doesn't matter what kind of doctrine one has, convoys should not be breaking down and running out of fuel like this."

"Fail logistics of Russia invasion?
The war is only going on for a few days and isn't over yet there are already people claiming this and that."
@Titanium RainWe've seen it from who?
@Max Kuftinec It is possible. You ran out of fuel? You ran out of food? Your tires blew out? We've all seen it.
@Titanium Rain That wouldn't be possible. It would be insufficient time to identify the authenticity of the information. Any conclusion drawn rapidly are based on emotional judgement.
"Doesn't matter how it ends, we've already seen enough to take conclusions."
Anyone who makes this video doesn't understand logistics and is a western mouth piece. God Save The King.
So what you mean to say is that the secret to invading Ukraine is good logistics ok noted
"RUSSIA HAS UNDERGROUND CITIES AND THEY DO DRILLS WHERE THEY BRING EVERYONE DOWN INTO THEM! SO DOES THE US AND CHINA!

"@Petro Semenikhin It may have been somewhat misleading to me to frame them as being on the same level, and I should have been more clear with that. But I stand behind the statement that they are in a similar ballpark. 

My key point is that the full picture of how much military is prioritized in Russia can't entirely be boiled down to the amount that is being spent on it."
"@An Actual Adult I mean sure, but you brought up the US, that doesn't do anything even close to what Russia does in terms of army prioritization."
For a nation that have a lots of drill and exercise their army performed poorly in the Ukraini-russo war
Drills and exercises have to be realistic. Russia's drills are more defensive with close bases for logistical support. Faraway invasion with long supply lines was not in their doctrine.
We can now see why Russia built a Russian-gauge railway line to an iron ore in southeastern Poland. It would enable a hammer-&-anvil attack on Warsaw should the Poles decide to rebel.

"There is no logistic failure, Putin has taken entire Eastern side of Ukraine as was the goal, as well as destroyed bio-labs and taken control of nuclear power plants - troops at Kiev was a distraction to divide Ukranian forces."

How long did the Invasion of Iraq take? Over a month. Russia is right on schedule.
"Not really. The main Coalition force entered through Basra province. 280 miles to Bagdad. Belarus border is 140 miles to Kiev. 21 days / 2 = 10.5 days.
Behind schedule."
"I find it very hard to believe that Russian troops are using unsecured communications. Every military has access to radios which can do encryption and some kind of frequency hopping. If it's true that those dudes were sent in *without even secure radios*, then I have spent the last decade or more seriously overestimating the competence of the Russian military. Just saying. Someone really high up in their organizational structure should be fired, just from a competence point of view. That's sending people to die without even a fair chance.

"Please, support Ukraine! If we won’t stop invaders now, they will switch to the next target just after."
I am not sure they failed.
I hope this just ends soon and peacefully
With this move Russians just showed how stupid they are.
Its been a week and now everyone is an expert on the situation on the ground. Quite hilarious.
Why? The info is out there. Smartphones are a thing and Ukraine still has Internet.
"So, basically you're saying that the russian army is flawed because it's designed to act as a defending force on its own territory, where it can be supported by its extensive railroad network. It's not designed to roll over the Europe, unlike western military forces, who are much better equipped for invasions. Do I understand this correctly?"
Russia? More like STINKsia lmao
"Makes me think of the war lead by the French in Mali in 2013. I recently saw a video called ""how France fought a lightning war in Mali"", and it exposes, imo, the importance of logistics. Anyway, Russia lost all credibility with this conflict. It may have a great army and great equipments, but when it comes to fighting (in another country at least), it's a whole other story. We should feel safe at the West. 
Either way, let's just hope this conflict comes to an end shortly, but unfortunately I don't think it will..."
Morale might be a factor as well.  Their men would fight harder if they were fighting a war at home.
✊🟦🟨 Stay strong Ukraine.  Keep giving them hell.  Make them pay dearly for every inch.  The world is with you.
good vid
this is your brain on the kiev independent
"What about the south/southeast strategy along the coast of Ukraine? It seems like those logistics strategies are markedly different due to the access to the Black Sea and and Sea of Azov, which is why military and logistical outcomes *appear* to be different in those cities along the coast such as Kherson. Not sure how up to date I am with the news from that front, or if the fog of war has cleared in any of these conflict zones/fronts enough to make comparisons. Really interesting video regardless and I appreciated the sourcing."
"It's a combination of lesser presence of Ukrainian troops, flat terrain, better weather, and lesser distance from Crimea. Russian naval assets played a relatively insignificant role in their success there."
"I speculate that the amphibious assault and forces along the coast are much more experienced and advanced, similar to the Navy Seals vs regular infantry. They are likely far more tactical. Also it is likely that Ukraine could not afford to spread their military so thin in and so had to prioritize Russian attack points that were closer to Kyiv."
My life in a nutshell: planning months ahead of schedule and failing in the first 2 days
@Robert Lee Now that was funny! 😁😁😁 👍
@Robert Lee did he?
"@Robert Lee Outstanding manouver, sir 👏🏻"
@Robert Lee 🤣🤣🤣
At least you Putin the effort.
Wendover this is schieße productions. Your politics have tainted this. Please stay objective. Stop the emotions.
"“amateurs study tactics, professionals study logistics” apparently the Russians studied neither of them"
"Seeing the statistics of what russian assets ukraine have destroyed,  it would be interesting to see the financial damage russia is taking to."
@James there were estimates about 20 bln per day so I'm somehow dissapointed. I hoped that with that mark they would run out of juce in 2 weeks.
"@Dominik Jeziorski you say ""only"", but the Kremlin's annual budget is around the $300bn mark.  Equivalent of 1% of their budget in just over a week."
"I read today that the value of all lost eqipment only is 3 bln dollars. That is not counting $ needed for fuel food, ammunition. The sanctions will cost them way more in the long run."
Can we just nuke Moscow and win this war already?
Yay americans pissed about imperialism
"It may have performed worse than expected but , imo it's still very early to call it ""failed logistics"""
"Not really. Failures already happened. Even if you get back on track, the failure happened, we've all seen it, and we can analyze it."
"the loss of troops and equipment resulting from the logistics problems certainly crippled any chances of this „operation“ being a quick success. Convoys being stuck, vehicles abandoned and grabbed by Ukrainian troops or farmers. That was unexpected and it also gave the UA the time to mount an effective defense."
I’m really shocked by this producer.  The war has been about a week and he’s already calling failure.  Was the Iraq invasion a failure because that lasted a month?  What about the German blitzkrieg campaigns?  This does nothing but destroy your credibility in the long run!
"@Paul Serdiuk 10 days?  What successful invasion was fulfilled in 10 days?  If we are going by these standards then the Invasion of Iraq, German invasion of Poland, and Fall of France were catastrophic failures because these operations went well beyond 10 days!"
"@Mr. Darcy Reaching an arbitrary line doesn't undo the equipment that was left stranded due to breakdowns and fuel shortages.
If you're securing a country, but have to steal food, you didn't bring supplies. Now stop wasting everyone's time."
@Mr. Darcy No large cities except Kherson were taken in 10 days. It's a failure.
@Titanium Rain Logistics failure?  The Russians are pacing well compared to other military invasions.  If you want to call not securing a country almost the size of Texas in less than one week as a failure then we might as well call every other military invasion a failure because that's ridiculous.
"""I've decided to [start a war]""

well, shit, dude"
It’s Kiev
Overall a brilliant analysis with but a few mistakes inevitable with the fake-new-polluted media.
The distances Russian units moved forward and then halted due to logistical stretch is pretty much text book russian doctrine . A lot of arm chair generals are over reading this.  Moreover the Russian plans captured show 3 week stop lines that are not that  far from current gains . The biggest military failure was the decapitation strike getting annihilated at the airport . ... The biggest oveall failure is eastern Ukraine russian ethnics have not welcomed the invasion making the entire operation pointless
"@mididoctors It took from March 20 to April 9 to capture Bagdad, and they entered from Basra province - Basra is 280 miles from Bagdad. The Ukraine/Belarus border to Kiev is 140 miles. Not to mention the US was conducting the operation from halfway across the globe, while Russia is doing it from their own doorstep."
"There is a degree of over writing history with a cursory narrative written in part by amateurs who are not aware of how fast armies move and how much tactical waiting there is .   How long did it take us armour to reach baghdad in perfect mobile warfare  country against a totally outmatched army with no airpower and no allies or massive support from abroad ?... 20 days a.nother 6 in Baghdad ...

20 miles a day for the units furthest away ...which is fast. Many units invading from Saudi Arabia had to travel half the distance but had to wait days for other elements to catch up"
"The mud has hampered the Russia's a lot . Blown tires ...or number of tires required per km is a logistically calculated number. After bagration 1944 the Soviets adopted echelon deep battle ...as outlined in the ""operational art""   several (usually 3 ) echelons are driven into battle with each pushed to exhaustion until the next wave leapfrogs over the top and then the third over that. ... The Ukrainian resistence and mud have had more to do with the current situation than lack of logistical tail. Areas where mud is less prevelent there is little evidence this is not going as the Russians expect on the ground ...hostomel was a major defeat that saved Kiev from being over run ... Don't get me wrong I think this is s disaster militarily and even more geo politically for Russia but the Russians are well aware of the logistically constraints ."

When you mentioned the trains and rail - for a moment I thought you will transit over to a sponsorship by HoI No Step Back... but that would be too cynical.
"I’m so happy that these NATOadies are painting a rosy picture of the Ukrainian war effort while Zelensky is emptying his prisons, preventing citizens from leaving and is even looking to outsource his right wing militia to the rest of the globe. Soon al-Qaeda in Ukraine will be a thing as they stand shoulder to shoulder with the NeoNazi Azov Battalion economically backed by the blue swastika brigade at NATO. 

Seriously these videos are going to get innocent Ukrainians killed for nothing."
"Pretty much all countries have it written into law that the state can call on all able bodied men to serve in case of invasion, thus ban them from leaving."

These people arent heros they are humans and we are watching them die.   As soon as Putin deems the citizens as combatants they are going to get put in mass graves.  And news is just pretending like everything is fine as Russia sets up more and more and more."
Great video! thank you
Great video. Those Russian soldiers were so unprepared to face a real armed military that wanted to and had to defend their country. Those there now should just put down their weapons and go home.

"Task & Purpose actually made a decent video about how the logistics situation may be deliberate.

Or at least since pressure has been crazy on Russia, they havent had enough time to put a proper logistics line in place."
@Jared Bowhay-Pringle im talking about post invasion. I watched the video too.
What pressure? They've been building up troop numbers in the region for about a year and moved troops into Belarus to prepare for an invasion in mid-January.
Lol whenever wendover went woke. Propaganda. Also lol at anyone disagreeing is a troll or actor. How about explaining why NATO existed after 1970. Unsubbed.

"Anonymous is not a hacktivist, it’s basically a deep state psyop masquerading as independent."
"Incredible how Putin spended his entire time as Russian Dictator to spread Propaganda about Russian Military, only for it to fall apart in 1 week making this invasion look worse than the Americans in Vietnam"
"@Captain Dak The Ukrainian army had around 200k soldiers on duty in 2020 while russia had 1 Million, not even taking into account the differnce in Equipment. The fact that Russia barely has achieved anything from their plans (according to intel Putin planned for 1-4 Day invasion) yet the Russian soldiers couldnt even get a foothold in Kyiv and are now resulting to Bombing Civilian Targets.

Tanks running out of Fuel and getting stolen by Tractors. Soldiers with out rations even if Russia manages to take Kyiv this will pay an immensive price both in lifes lost and Economical. Not even taking into account the Civil War that will be raging in Occupied Areas.

Putin can only lose from here on."
"If it fell apart, why are the Russians advancing and surrounding cities while Zelensky is crying for help?"
slava ukraini
I’m so impressed in just how quickly Wendover can make a high quality information dense video on rapidly evolving global situation. This one and the Afghanistan evacuation are mind blowing.
@j kuzi ...Look up to the skies and see...
"@Lance Lewis Therefore, he does not name sources. And you didn't check any of that, right? The gentleman is taken at his word."
"@Дмитрий Гарин Yet, none of this was falsified. Everything stated is easily verifiable from multiple different sources. Just because the guy is saying something you do not like doesn't make it propaganda."
"Well done video, thanks"
"PLEASE TELL US MORE!!!
MULTIPLE VIDEOS PLEASE WE NEED TO BE EDUCATED ON THIS"
"According to the maps pulled off of Russian officers, they are only 2-3 day behind schedule, it is also part of Russian doctrine the the conscripts and lest trained units go in first. if you look only about 1/3 of Russian units staged in the area have gone in, the rest as still staged. Russia is just starting stage two. if they keep following there doctrine they are going to blockade the hold out cities and really start to shell them. and make a no fly zone so food and aid can not be flown in. Also we are looking at the casualties rate from western eyes, if you look thru all the conflicts Russia has had from WWII on word they have taken higher casualties, this is expected."
"What Russia's biggest flaw is. Is allowing the west to take a step in the east direction. 
Nobody likes it when an enemy put big guns aimed at you in your yard, as the Cuba crises has shown the world."
You start the video saying the conflict began in 2014 with the Russia invasion in the south....how come you left out the 2014 USA/EU  violent overthrow of the democratically elected pro-Russia  leader  ?
"I don't see this as Ukrainian-Russian war. I see this as Ukrainian-Putin/Russian Oligarch war. When I saw the video of Russian soldier desperately eating and drinking tea, I saw just how much their leadership screwed them over. Glory to Ukraine. I am sorry for the loss of every mother in this war."
uhm the war isnt over
Love your videos
Meh... Western propaganda 🥱
Wendover is such a liberal haha. He can only speak for so much as an individual researcher with limited intelligence.
Welcome to hell.
Wendy must be the chief logistician of any army.
Am I the only one that thinks his speech mannerisms and cadence are a bit annoying?
"@-- It's just that in a narration heavy video like this, your elocutive abilities are very important"
"Very informative video, the research is always appreciated."
Stupid question: nearly everyone have a phone in their pocket with maps and navigation: why couldn't Russian soldiers use that for direction instead of relying on missing road signs?
"Maybe their internet doesnt work, maybe they cant be watching phone while going through a war zone (The could be ambushes), maybe russian military rely too much on road signs or took soldier´s phones... There can be a lot of things, but my theory, is that war is really demanding on psycological level and russian soldiers are already stressed enough to think of alternatives...

I wish some expert answer your question!"
In previous war in 2014 Russia was tracking phones of Ukraine and was bombing them with artirelly. This is why troops dont have phones with them.
I don't know but I have had soldiers here in south Africa stop by the road and ask me for directions. I wondered the same thing.. Maybe their phones aren't allowed..
11 what -- belonging to whom -- were destroyed on first day of the attack? @ 5:45

"No matter the topic (but usually when it involves aircraft), Sam will find a way to make a logistics video essay about it"
His next video will probably be about how the various economic sanctions against Russia will affect aviation and air traffic in the region...
You know it's serious when Wendover releases a video on a Saturday...
Dang bro fast video! Awesome!
"I'm in awe over how badly this invasion played out. Russia learned very little from it's time in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Georgia, etc. as well as from other Western examples (specifically Gulf War I and II). Either it was incompetent micromanagement from the top, or it really was as simple as ignorance to change from Soviet doctrine. The scarcity of supply trucks means that the big convoy headed to Kyiv, if taken out now, will cripple the Russian advance for weeks."
@dimbasz Isn't it strange tho that as a former intelligence officer he doesn't know shit about another country?
"@Kwa ndo just listen to that speech I've mentioned, it was aired on the Feb 22'nd. It's a full essay with some twisted historical shit, inaccurate conclusions and plain geopolitical daydreams. I'm sure as hell he got this picture in front of him of whole Ukrainian nation suffering under neo-nazi boots counting days for the honorable Russian warrior-saviours to lift the curse."
@Kwa ndo he was not that good of a spy.
@dimbasz You think a former spy didn't do his homework?
Thank you for supporting my homeland and documenting why Russia is bound to lose in the long run.
Lies full of fakes
Hello
"What are you going to say in a month when Ukraine is completely overtaken as a Russian territory?  Muh ""failed invasion"" then?"
A great game that shows off Logistics in War Is squad I’d give it a shot
"I’m so sorry for what’s happening in Ukraine. I can’t believe how people who are living in peace are kicked of their home and land, then occupy their land by force. 

Imagine that happening when there is no social media to expose the truth. Imagine that happening and all of the world standing against Ukraine.

That’s what happened to Palestine 74 years  ago."
Truth! 💔🇵🇸
"I'm from Kharkiv, ask questions"
"@dimbasz the situation is tough, but people around trying to help. The city is not surrounded yet, so it's possible to deliver staff. Nevertheless, logistic is broken, so delivery takes much more time.
Also, it's pretty dangerous for people to drive and stay on streets as there are bombing on civil objects. So people who care about all of this are real heros.
Need to add, there are some parts of the city, which are under attack almost whole time, so there is reall issue to receive the help.

 I need to say, that whole society become self organized and helping to each other. So, restaurants preparing food for free, truck drivers trying to deliver products in the city, doctors providing online consultations and people in general use chats to exchange and help each other even in the parts with the worst situation."
"How's situation with food and water for civilians? The city is in blockade for a week already, I'm afraid common people would starve"
Slava Ukraini!
Stay strong and free Ukraine!  🇺🇦✌️
"YES MORE!!!!
THE MORE YOU EDUCATE US ON THIS THE MORE WE UNDERSTAND AND THE MORE PASSIONATE WE BECOME ABOUT THIS AND THE MORE WE CARE AS A PEOPLE, THE MORE LIKELY THAG EVENS LIKE THESE WONT HAPPEN AGAIN."
"Praying that Ukraine can hold out, wish the west was doing more, seems our leaders are happy to just sacrifice Ukraine in order to appease Putin. :("
thank you for your sacrifice in putting a Ukrainian flag in your bio.
Same thing happened in ww2 iirc.
doesn’t help that the Russian soldiers are being lied to about the nature of the operation. In addition these soldiers are 18 year olds like me who are soft asf. Compared to Soviet soldiers these guys are complete jokes.
"Not really, there are captured consent forms about the invasion that privates also signed. It's all a cover story."
"They send the cannon fodder to the front lines first.
Let them spend their ordinance and expose their positions."
Please stop commenting with nothing but a pointless quote. Most annoying thing about this damn conflict.
"So if they had foreseen this pitfall, played to their homelands' strengths, and formed dedicated rapid repair rail logistics brigades at the start, this might've been a much faster war.

I can't believe as well that their soldiers are using paper maps, that's ridiculous considering Russia has it's own GPS network (GLONASS) free of the global one."
"You have to remember that Russia and the USSR had always prepared for a defensive war against an invasion by western powers. They expect neither side to be able to use satellite navigation soon after war starts, either due to jamming or the destruction of satellites. The push-based logistics and capability to build out infrastructure also comes from that mentality. Russia will not fall in a day, so in a multi-year war, there's time to build rail and pipelines behind the front lines, and a push-based system is far more efficient at delivering huge quantities of supplies compared to a pull-based system."
"Because you Americans judging about Russian Army on their Parades and advertisement videos ) 
Their army is primitive and equipped with 50 years old AMV,  it just to much of them..
Putin send everything he had in his Ground Forces, and now they all stacked at the borders. Their assault stopped 3 days ago, and now our Army burnes them out, convoy after convoy ) 
Those bastards forgot that we have the same Army as they have- with aviation,  missiles,and  artillery. And thanks to US- modern communication, while those idiots still using Soviet radios. And we have Assault/reconnaissance drones from Turkey. And intelligence info from everyone about Russian troops movement. 
Air defense is our weak point, we are simply outnumbered. Stingers are great, but it wouldn't protect against ballistic missiles.
Stop being afraid of those alcoholics  start take down their planes! They wouldn't even know who did this,most of their jets didn't even have GPS!"
"@nomobobby I agree with you but when you look at the amount of money actually spent on their military you start to really understand that Russia can't supply nearly 1/10 of it's fighting forces with top notch communications. They spent 62 billion last year, compared to 778 billion of the US. We keep falling into the same trap of trying to compare Russia to the US. Granted the Russian military is huge compared to the US but what it has in in numbers it lacks in logistics support and being able to field good working equipment to that large of a military. The US has fielded such a large military but with decent working equipment. It's a balancing act that Russia hasn't seemed to gotten right for many decades."
"@Flying Cactus Every soldier should be trained to use paper map, before being trained to use GPS, GPS can fail., but if their GPS network has no problem over Ukraine, yeah their soldier should use it."

"However much this invasion is looking like a Russian failure, it only has one outcome. Russia winning & Ukraine being forced to sign a long term treaty vowing to never be a part of any military alliance that doesn't involve Russia. Zelensky then may resign, remain in power or go to exile, that doesn't matter much to Russia as much as Ukraine not joining NATO.

So, it's on President Zelensky to stop the suffering of Ukrainian (corrected) people & limiting their misery. Fighting against the Russian only delays the inevitable & lengthens Ukrainian people's misery. There is no other outcome of this invasion."
"@Lukas Hulst They have to act smart. They got to focus on being very smart in foreign diplomacy, although I understand it will be very difficult. But that's the only route they have to take to achieve as much economic prosperity as they want with as much liberalism as they can enjoy. 

Being a liberal citizen from Nepal sandwiched between rival Asian superpowers India & China, I know how difficult a task that is. But that is our destiny by birth unless U can airlift the entire geographical area of the country & move it somewherelse on Earth not bordering with Russia; or India & China in my case."

8:09 what? Russian soldiers asking Ukrainian citizens which way to your capital? may be someone told the soldiers to make a right turn instead of the left turn!
0:50 the Russian attacks after a (pro Western) coup d'etat in Ukraine.

"People everywhere around the world are supporting Ukrainians in the conflict including Russians outside the Kremlin. No with respectable morals is against Ukraine in this conflict 

But let us keep in mind, there has been a significant amount of western and Ukrainian biased reporting and even propaganda circulating out there and not everything you see can be trusted 

Yes Russia was not initially prepared for this sort if conflict, they believed they could just send in conscripts who were expecting to be welcomed as liberators to a country who was growing weary of their government (Yes Zelensky wasn't always a hero before this, he is now being overly glorified) 

Obviously things aren't going well for Russia but they are making progress contrary to western reporting. Also keep in mind, a significant amount of their capability has not yet been used and they have enough experience to modify their strategies and even according to US military experts can just brute force this whole war if needed. 

Tldr; Don't believe the massive amounts of propaganda and unconfirmed news and baseless predictions out there. Take everything with a grain of salt. We love to say how brainwashed some Russian are but yet when we are subjected to the same we don't even realise it"
Russias logistics in this war is basically the Fyre Festival of Military Invasions
"It should be mentioned that Russia's military budget is at about $70 billion at the highest estimate, or about one eleventh of the US's $770 billion."
"This was incredibly well done! Puts big box news to shame. Terrible and sad situation, but thank you for putting this out there."

"everything in this video up until about 7 min is correct, then it becomes a bunch of bull.   you think Russia expected to completely take Kiev in two days? hahahah.  All of your sources are literally just from Ukrainian Twitter.  no bias?"
Cope and seethe.
"Russia is setting up forward resupply posts close to the targets (like Kyiv), and will completely hammer the cities with artillery after encircling them I'm afraid. It's almost worth risking nuclear war to spank Putin. US and NATO can crush his little butt so easily."
This video is pretty amazing.
They have not failed. 40km a day IS in their military doctrine. It is what they plan for. All these stupid ass videos doing zero research. Day 15 of the invasion will be when the war starts

This was always supposed to be a drawn out conflict, Kudos to the ukrainians for their adaptability attacking fuel trucks, but russians re-establishing rail lines seems more sensible."
"Putin is not Russia. That's not Russian invasion of Ukraine, it's Putin's invasion of Ukraine. The majority of Russians don't support this, sadly Russian governement does not care about what people think."
ayyy my boy woofers made it to a wendover vid haha
That's what Wendover Productions was always saying! TRUCKS TRUCKS TRUCKS. TRUCKS WIN WARS!
"LMAO Russia has surrounded the cities and taken over airports. If anything, it’s the Ukrainian army with its lunatic NATOady President Zelensky and his Western handlers that are losing the logistics game. 

The idea that Russia is losing is laughable to anyone that has actually seen a map of this conflict."
bruh its been 1 week
Lol at the butthurt Russians in the comments who won't accept their leadership is so badly corrupted their million-strong army is getting its ass kicked by a bunch of people with AK47's and Molotov Cocktails.
I stand with Ukraine. May Peace come upon all of us.
What a fantastic video. Can you also make a video on the how logistic of US invasion on Iraq plays out? That we could have a comparison not only on the logistic but also on how media put forward a discriminative portray of military operation base on political stand
Thank you
Good job with this report
Nice
"One positive regarding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is that it exposed Russia as a paper Tiger (Bear). They have minimal ability to wage war against a true symmetric enemy outside of Nukes."
"@Finnstigator
The Soviets _did_ beat the Finnish in the Winter War though, right?
Now, most importantly, that was purely due to the Finns literally running out of bullets and artillery shells, and just not having the manpower reserves to plug the gap once a small tank battalion(?) finally broke through.

And the Soviets did _basically_ get to dictate the terms. 
The Finns had to give up more than what the Soviets had asked for before the war (although that is unsurprising; I would _totally_ see them demand only the defensive line at first, but ask for more once the Finnish position was weakened after giving that up - so I don't think the Soviets could be trusted, and don't think the pre-war demands can be compared).
I can't find anymore the exact percentage of population that had to be ceded, but remember that Viipuri was one of the few/biggest cities of Finland. So the loss in population and economy was pretty massive, percentage-wise.

It was a MASSIVE shame the Allies needed Stalin against Hitler, and couldn't restore Karelia to Finland after WW2...."
this is making me wonder how many of their nukes are still operational

It was only a matter of time until we got this video since logistics are involved 😂
"Russia disabling Western media/internet, so trolls less prevalent."
"Gotta say, I've known a lot of my favorite creators were going to produce excellent content on this tragic situation, but I honestly wasn't expecting anything from Wendover. Pleasant surprise! Slava Ukraini!"
I've ridden most of those rail lines. Russians do have a sophisticated rail system.
"When this is over YouTube needs to stop censoring other modern conflicts content, this is the most modern one and I haven't heard anything about this issue being censored"
Ukraine should sneak into Russia and blow up some train tracks. I know there are a lot of problems with that idea but it might help a lot
"could you put a found raiser for refugees in the video, there are more than a million of theme, and Romania(my country), Poland and Hungary are poor ester European countries with crappy infrastructure that cant accommodate refugees, and every penny matters, I know some of the refugees since I worked as a volunteer a few days ago and they really need all the help, the red cross has a found raiser you can put"
"Tbh I live in Poland - we have 600k refugees already. It's starting to be hard to rent a flat but we are improvising like - seizing of Russia onwed houses or converting shopping mall to place for them. We give own supplies to them. We can share. We will do what no one did for us in 1939.

I know that for now Ukraine needs more help in war zone.

There are found raisers for medical supplies for people directly affected.

1. Israeli personal dressing FCP-01
2. HALO CHEST SEAL
3. Celox, ChitoSam, Combat Gauze, QuikClot, H&H compressed Gauze PriMed
4. Decompression Kit
5. The Pro Breathe, Kendall Argyle
6. CPR Face Shield

Found raiser should be to buy stuff like above."
"russia is a paper tiger, their economy is weak and backward. And what seems to be their strongest side - military. Is also weak and outdated. They just showed it to the rest of the world....."
Sad
NATO has assured Russia that they will not intervene.
👏😐
"15:20 I think you mixed up the 2 because didn’t you said western logistics is based on request, so shouldn’t it be westerns have logistics lead strategy and Russians have strategy lead logistics?"
I interpreted it that way that western armies can make a move and logistics adapts to it. Resuply what has been used in that move. While Russian forces are limited of what they have recieved. So only the tank brigades which received enough fuel can take part in the next mission etc.
USA global logistics might is not something that anyone should celebrate... Not saying you did. But needs to be said.

well i guess that Ukraine shouldn't have threatened Russia with american nukes.

"The russian army is and always has been a defensive force. 
It is all geared towards dealing with an invasion of the home country. It would be a lot more efficient in that situation.

I bet doctrine and most training for the last 7 or 8 decades has been focussed only on defense, no wonder offencive use of those forces then ends in a confusing desaster.

Still a bad very look for russia."

Thanks for posting this
"if I was going into a country and all the signs were painted over with ""welcome to hell"", I'd probably want to turn around pretty quickly"

An army marches on its stomach - Napoleon
"While I'm certain there were indeed some logistical failures, it is worth noting that Russia is making an apparent attempt to try to minimise civilian casualties, while also leaving local civilian organizations in place after securing particular cities. The fact they're not in Kiev does not mean they can't take Kiev. They're working on encircling it and forcing negotiations so that Ukraine will accept becoming a neutral state.

Just in comparison, during the 2003 Iraq invasion, where their sovereignty and right to self-determination was extinguished, somewhere around 7,000 civilians were killed in the early time-frame of the invasion. In contrast, the UN is currently saying that this number is approximately 350. This, despite the use of human shields in some areas like Mariupol by Ukraine's far-right neo-nazi brigades like the Azov Battalion.

And also consider that Russia's more ""high-tech"" and recently developed weaponry has yet to be deployed.

So there is indeed a game being played. Russia is banking on Ukraine negotiating (now going on 3 meetings) in order to reach security guarantees for both sides. NATO could help to end this quickly by also providing security guarantees, but it seems like they want to watch Ukraine burn.

Regardless, cool video that explained some things well"
"@j k when, in some instances, Ukrainian forces (the facists at the very least) are setting up in civilian areas, then that may certainly be the outcome. In other instances, I've also seen reports of destruction actually caused by the use of highly inaccurate GRAD rockets by Ukrainian forces. So those are two areas of concern. And yes, I'm sure Russia has also hit civilian infrastructure in some cases also. All the more reason for negotiations to come to a resolution as quickly as possible."
"As Russian, I always knew this. Our army is only strong in numbers - but numbers mean anything if they are not fed and supported properly. I hope Putin will ""retire"" soon so we may rebuild our country"

"I think it's more that Russia focused more heavily on their interior then exterior, after all unlike the US they don't need a global supply chain capable of supplying troops anywhere on earth.
Edit I mean the US doesn't really need that either, but they have it."
"To be fair, it's not even really strong in numbers.
I hope you can get him ""out"""
The numbers worked in WW2. Soviet tanks were not even half as good as the German ones but the sheer number of tanks and people on the field is what won the war. However the same tactic failed with doorstep neighbor Ukraine. Hope the madman takes note and stops this useless war.
I'm just tuning in so not sure if you covered it yet but are any of you guys thinking about how terrible it might be in that convoy right now? 10 days in cold weather in hostile conditions on a two-lane road if there's any lack of food or water or fuel it could get horrific. Tens of thousands of troops in deadlock traffic for a week and a half!
@Umph I read today - due to warm winter they have to use roads because of all the mud. They were driving next to each other and it seems that the trucks at the begginig run out of fuel and it's somehow impossible to pass by because of this traffic jam. I'm not sure how much true that is but looking at lack of communication I can partially believe in that. Now trucks at the end of the convoy can't reach front. It can be also possible that they don't want to fight because of low morale. I would guess as this was suplly chain - thay have food that they meant to deliver ;)
@Dominik Jeziorski I want Russia to fail but just thinking about you know you get like two days of cars not moving and people start eating each other this is 11 days. I just can't imagine what's going on in that convoy it hasn't moved for days.
Somehow I don't care - the drivers can go to last ones and drvie to Russia. This would help stopping that war.

wendover does his part in the war effort by throwing maximum shade on the russian military.
"I feel bad for them actually. Obviously Russia is in the wrong here and I am very much in support of Ukraine, but people are people and it seems that the Russian military was under-prepared, It is important to not dehumanize the other side. These are the people our whole military posture has traditionally been aimed at, and they aren't even using frequency-hopping radios (if this video can be believed). This should make a lot of people re-think geopolitics in light of how even the 2nd strongest military in the world seems to find it very hard to execute a 21st century war."
"If logistics wins wars, Amazon will be a future superpower. Let's hope Prime membership doesn't automatically sign you up for conscription."
"@Akislav1990 I think in your scenario Bezos would win but only because laser precision and intensity from the moon (let alone Mars) is inherently abysmal because of the distance, the atmospheric scattering, power consumption for a strong enough laser array, etc. XKCD did a great what if about shining laser pointers at the moon, and reversing that would have the added factor of power source difficulties.
If he's firing the lasers at the rockets as they orbit the moon (or Mars) then he _might_ have the advantage, I'm not sure about at that range."

Not a bad video. Things did not start from 2014 though. This is a conflict of ideology
"I once heard an economic analyst say that Walmart fails everywhere it can't drive a truck to.
He was talking about Walmart's inability to expand into Europe and Asia.
This video makes it sound as if the Russian army fails everywhere it can't drive a train to.

I don't mean this as criticism of the video or the channel owner, but I am skeptical about all the voices talking about how the Russians are failing and how badly things are going for them.
The US Army needed 3 weeks to conquer Irak in Operation Desert Storm and they had it easier. Iraq is smaller than Ukraine and there are no forests the defenders could hide inside. Also, back then in the 90s, pretty much nobody but the US forces had night vision equipment, which gave them a huge tactical advantage.

The point being, they had it easier and were fighting an enemy that wasn't supplied with the newest anti tank guided missiles and stuff like that and they still needed 3 weeks to reach and take Bagdad.

I have heard more pessimistic and sober military analysts say that 40 miles or 60 kilometres is pretty much the maximum distance a armored combat force can advance in a day. Apparently it is kind of the sweet spot, because it allows the trucks supplying the troops to make 3 supply runs back and forth a day.
And apparently the Russian army has been advancing 60 to 100 kilometres every day in this invasion so far, which indicates that things must be going pretty well for them, all in all.

It seems to me we are being too optimistic with all those ""the Russians are failing"" claims and analysis we are hearing in the last days.

Another thing that makes me wary is that the analysts and commentators can't agree on what the Russians are actually doing.
Pretty much half the videos I saw and articles I read said the Russians did a ""Shock and Awe"" strike, hoping to intimidate the Ukrainians into a quick surrender and since that surrender didn't happen yet, that proves that the Russian strategy failed. The problem is, the other half of videos and articles say that they are surprised that they didn't see the Russians doing a ""Shock and Awe"" thing and that they are rather using a slow and steady buildup and a gradual escalation of force, first sending in the weaker elements and keeping back the most capable units to see where resistance is strongest.
The thing is that most actual military experts are in the second group, the one that says there was no ""Shock and Awe"" strike.

And then there is the fact that governments and people who must know more than we normal people don't act as if the Russians just revealed themselves to be a paper tiger.
The ridiculously pacifistic German government just declared that they will pretty much double their military budged. I'm pretty sure they would not have done that if Russia would be whiffing this invasion.

Long story short, it seems weird to declare the Russians the losers because they didn't do in one week what Operation Desert Storm needed 3 weeks for.

I'm no fan of Putin and I am not some Russian nationalist troll, but I really think we are being too optimistic and too quick to sell the bear's hide here.

PS: That huge explosion you showed at 16:56 has been debunked. It is footage from some industrial accident in China years ago and is not from the Ukraine."

I would really like to get full-auto AK on my birthday though... Stay safe.
Johnny Harris AND Wendover? On the same day? What a treat!
Could Russia launch another offenssive to the Baltics or Finland soon now?
"@theGreenlandShark let's wait and see if Finland actually takes that risk.

I agree the invasion is probably harder than the Russians expected, but ""struggling"" is an overstatement."
"@Captain Dak Finland looks to be moving to join NATO so if Russia did want to prevent that they would have to strike quickly but I don't think that's likely.

I would agree Russia is doing better than the western media portrays it, but it's not a walk in the park and they are facing harsh resistance from the Ukranians."
"@theGreenlandShark 1. They're not struggling. They're literally capturing and encircling cities while Zelensky is begging for a no fly zone. It took weeks for the US to reach Baghdad. Ukraine is much larger than Iraq.

2. Finland didn't ask to join NATO. I don't see any reasons for the Russians to invade unless it suddenly decided to join NATO."
"Definitely not the Baltics, I don't think they would attack a NATO country. Starting another war in Finland would be stupid when they are struggling in Ukraine."
Russia vs Hacktivists and Twitter users. Turns out Russia lost.

Putins picture of war is basically that of a 12 year old kid. The one with the biggest boom stick wins.
The other 12-year-olds are smart enough to walk away and leave him all by himself.

hey just so you know you used a clip around 17 minutes thats from a few years were a weapons depot exploded.... with something like war you should really make sure not to use stuff like that...
I wonder what the logistics are like at Wendover Productions. They got this video to the front lines exceptionally fast
"He's done a couple videos on it, though they may only be on Nebula or HAI. The basics are that Sam is the voice and manager of the channel, and does do research, lots of writing, and editing for it, but he has specialists in each of the needed fields that do much of the construction for each video. For instance, a researcher and a writer collaborate, deliver Sam a script, which he Wendoverifies, then sends that to a video editor to match video timing to the audio, which Sam checks over and adds to the upload queue. How hands on he is varies, as he also does a lot of travel and research of his own, and while he can do a lot of stuff elsewhere, the voiceover is likely only done at his home studio setup."
Hey bro don’t be telling Putin how to do it better next time
"The initial invasion thought it would be like Crimea and they just walk in, that didn't happen so they payed the price, but now tactics are changing and it look like their encircling the cities so yes logistics kinda failed at first but now it seems its going differently."
You forgot to mention that the USA is good at war logistics because they never stopped invading other countries.
Damn they rlly fumbled this one lmao
It just doesn't make sence how they could fuck up so bad.. I feel that something isn't right. Surely they aren't that incompetent.
Russian soldiers are shooting their own gas tanks
"16:13, I love how the tractor hulls away the tank."
"It's a lightly armored military towing vehicle, not a tank. But some actual tanks have been hauled away by local civilians, too."
"Fun fact: the stock video at 16:18 was filmed in Bitburg, Germany. At least, that's what the number plates of the four cars suggest."
"Bitburg Airbase was abandoned years ago, I guess it was filmed at Spangdahlem AFB, which is in the same county."
"Nit: Unlike east Ukraine, I don't remember any ""rebels"" in Crimea (besides maybe Tatar, who were not pro-Russian). The majority of people in Crimea have Russian culture and did not mind becoming part of Russia, but as far as I know there was no violent segregation movement while it was part of Ukraine."

It's great to have a more nonpartisan account such as yours to balance out the sources I usually read from, and I feel vindicated that you have reached similar conclusions as them about the Russian military's massively flawed logistics. 

The way the Russians have now changed their strategy to indiscriminate shelling of civilian targets is reprehensible as is their nation's leadership. I can only hope Ukraine emerges victorious."
Nonpartisan? C'mon lol
I am team Russia
also Ukraine  having Logistics for their own for the forces in East of the country because they can't get supplies to them in time.
This video looks like propaganda. No one knows real plans of Putin about Ukraine. I bet that war will be stopped when he reached borders of LPR/DPR
"...failed ?

Exactly what i Hope to find on your Channel the comming days xD
Better at defense than attack
"I heard sometime, modern day wars is war of logistics not of people fighting till tooths and nails. So true."
"That has always been true.  Read, for example, Engels' _Alexander the Great and the Logistics of the Macedonian Army,_ or Creveld's _Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton._  Or consider Napoleon's adage that an army marches on its stomach.  And on and on."

"Ukraine will NEVER be subjugated again!
The cunning and determination of the Ukrainian military and citizen resistance was able to stall and delay and attack the Russians, using very well known Sun Tzu tactics. Never attack the spear head, but the hands that hold the spear. Distract and delay, and lure the enemy into areas that you control for ambush.

Long supply lines = vulnerable to Ukrainian guerilla attacks.

Napoleon said that an army marches on its stomach.

Today, an army, marches on its stomach and fuel tanks."
russia has only lost the propaganda war which is more important so i guess its right
Wow this was Absolutely fantastic
What timeline are we in when Wendover starts talking about supply chain issues about the Ukrainian-Russian war and not planes
@Christopher Robin Garrish Don't forget UAVs.
I think this is the one where Mike Rowe hosts top model.

Considering how much sheer territory was taken in a grand total of 8 days - their logistics didn't fail. The US couldn't do this much with countries with a fraction of the military power of Ukraine.

"Corruption is as normal in Russia as cheating is in China. People expect it. It’s not an oddity, it’s an embedded part of Russian culture. Quality of troops, logistics and air forces has been significantly overstated by the West due partly to our Western expectations of quality and aversion to corruption. Captured Russian troops have been found with 7 year old MREs (ration packs), many vehicles are is disrepair and communications equipment is mostly missing. In a corruption culture it’s easier to tell superior officers what they want to hear than actually achieve anything. The Russian air force isn’t winning because they can’t, they have insufficient experience and insufficient communication with air defences for this mission"
Was thinking the same thing. Wouldn't surprise me if some of those fuel trucks were empty too. Hard to sell a tank but probably easy to sell some fuel 😁
Russia should have outsourced their military logistics to Amazon. And feed their soldiers via Grubhub. 😂

Sunrise is just another 💩🤡💩 Krembot
There is and was no failure. Russia was going easy to avoid causing unnecessary civilian casualties. Russia didn’t anticipate that the Ukrainian regime would hold off this long and not accept any negotiations. The Ukrainian regime are essentially suiciding themselves and their people by not accepting any negotiations. They know they can’t win or even hold them off for long. But the longer they try to hold them off the more bloodshed they will cause for their own people. But make no mistake that militarily speaking Russia is winning easily even with them going softly. And it’s only been around 10 days and they already have the whole country. The US and nato strong 330k troops took 2 months to take over Iraq.
They have the whole country? Imao they don't even have Kyiv.
See you in hell Putin. Long live Ukraine.
The greatest risk for every dictator - delusions
Nice talking about things that most people never knew.
This is getting ridiculous. How the fuck do you even know that the Russians are having issues with logistics? All you have is anecdotes. The Russians have more or less already won the war and we're only ten days into the war.

it DIDN'T failed actually it's the plan. it's their doctrine and they aren't even losing. this is all very well documented and it's not even a secret. you are only seeing one side of the coin
"It was russia's plan to have a 40 mile convoy of fuel and supplies be stopped / stuck?  It was their plan to have tons of large military equipment run out of gas, and left behind for the enemy to just grab?  It was their plan to have countless soldiers surrender within a few days?   

Also, was it their plan to unite nearly the entire western world, haivng almost all of them impose sanctions, cut off fuel imports from russia, seize russian oligarch property?   Even if they do somehow take part or even all of Ukrane...The sanctions alone will cripple their economy, and with the western countries suddenly speeding up their adoption of renewable energy, The oil and gas fields in and around Ukrane won't be worth as much, If only China is the one buying it."

"“Infantry wins battles, logistics wins wars”

"Arush Reddi field marshal is a sort of extra special supergeneral military rank. I'm basically referencing egyptian president field marshal abdel fatah al-sisi, one of my personal least favourite current dictators."
@Semechki for Putin?
@dagdamor1 we need some frone hubs
@Jane Doe the AmAZOn DRoNe hUb
"The first time I heard ""logistics"" mentioned in news regarding the russian invasion, I instantly thought about Wendover surely will be making a video about it and here we are."
@Shankar Ravikumar ever heard of research?
"Yes, it look like Vladimir Putin didn't tell his military.  Because if he did you would seen massive supply dump of fuel, ammunition and food.  These warehouse are big enough to see from space."
"@Shankar Ravikumar because there's still stuff to talk about
should the news not be reporting on anything until the war is over???"
@Manikarnika Tambe spammed comment
"@Shankar Ravikumar The War still going on after 10 days isn’t surprising at all, granted. But the utter shambles of the Northern front is pretty shocking."
"To quote Eisenhower,  ""You will not find it difficult to prove that battles, campaigns, and even wars have been won or lost primarily because of logistics.”"
Double Michael hills
"@Michael Hill yup. The US militaries logistics complex is the best in world. Also, for some reason, this comment made me laugh."
Sup same name?
"Imagine this scenario of aggression. Russia has established something called SATA. (Surround America Together Alliance) with the Bahamas, Cuba, Canada and all of Central America. Article 5 of SATA says if one goes to war, they all go to war. Putin is trying to get Mexico to join. He orchestrated a coup there in 2014 and installed a puppet dictator who helps enrich Putin through Putin’s crack head son. He keeps assuring Mexico they will join SATA one day, even though the other countries would not approve the vote and they don’t meet some minimum requirements. Other politicians in the duma send their kids to be on boards of Mexican companies to collect paychecks of $50,000 per month. Russia keeps sending weapons to Mexico who has a neo-Nazi force of nationalists near the border who take shots at English speaking American separatists who would prefer to be part of the United States. Cease fires are broken 2000 times over 8 years, leaving 14,000 dead in the conflict. The U.S. has taken a patient stance, trying to reason with the Mexican coke-head dictator but he keeps accepting SATA weapons and money. Last week the Mexican dictator said he doesn’t just want SATA membership, he wants Russian nukes in his country aimed at the United States. That was the final straw. Tuesday the U.S. launched air strikes across Mexico and declared those English speaking American states as independent republics."
Next video: “logistics of carrying nuclear warheads”
calling an invasion failed after 11 days is very much preemptive
"@ApoloFEVE Yes! He says that very clearly in the title, but people don't seem to read anymore."
"I mean he is calling the logistics failed, not the invasion."
@Mister No Name thanks to TikTok.
"Yeah, this is rather dumb. People screaming that Russia is stuck in Ukraine after 3 days of invasion is ridiculous."
It's amazing how people think wars are won in three or four days.
I can already hear Putin's troll army cracking their knuckles and salivating with excitement.
@Good on my end I've never seen putin's trolls either;  I've never been to Russia.
"The best part is when the ""what about america"" and ""putin is a great leader"" comments start appearing from youtube warriors. As a person who speaks Russian, been involved in Russian business and been in Russia multiple times, it's pathetic when they come telling their theories and stories about how Russia or Russian people this and that when they don't know absolutely nothing about Russia, haven't ever been in Russia and never talked with Russians."
"I've never actually seen a putin troll
People tend to call others bots when they can not actually prove their points to be wrong."
"Getting on the propaganda bandwagon like the corporate media, I see"
Please elaborate
Everyone loves ad money...

"100th comment, here early, 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️"
This is what failed the German invasion of the Soviet Union.
"Yep. The German logistic tail was seriously fucked up. It makes sense when you consider that Germany was more used to fighting rapid wars in the Prussian style rather than long campaigns that were more the Anglo-American specialty. For the sake of the gods, Germany was still using largely mules and horses to transport shit."
"Can we take a moment to appreciate the immense amount of effort put in these Logistics videos by Sam, they are educational"
@awannagannaful Whats distance got to do with time?
"@verySharkey LOL, Kiev is less than 100 kms from the border, how naive are you mate?"
@globesurfer122 I should have used a more suitable word for the specific situation
"@awannagannaful Nono you got him all wrong, Russia can absolutely calculate the fuel needed to supply their own troops, they just cant calculate how long it takes to reach Kyiv xD"
It failed so much that they got  half of ukraine in a week.. Better not trust msm infos
"Woah, ive never been this early before"
This wouldn’t have happened if Putin had a subscription to Skill Share
@Keyser Söze of course man... it is a safe investment since raid's gem is more valuable than the ruble
He spends all his money on Raid: Shadow Legends sadly.
"God I love this channel, I get more out of a 20 minute video than hours upon hours of mainstream media"
"I didn't even bother to watch mainstream media. I was waiting for channels like this one to summarize and explain stuff. As always great job, Sam!"
Of course you’ve done this
"Putin didn't think Ukraine would put up a fight.  He did not budget in enough food or fuel for anything more than one week of an invasion.  Now the fighting is going into the second week, the soldiers are starving and the tanks are running out of fuel. Putin is desperate and he's going to start ordering mass air bombing of Ukrainian cities next."
"You're right, it seems to already be happening."
"Damn, Russia’s logistics so bad that wendover made a video"
"I literally said to my friend just 2 days ago ""I cant wait for the wendover video about the logistics of ww3"" and here you are LOL"
"And once again, Sam proves there’s nothing he can’t make about logistics.  I don’t even know why I’m surprised any more.  :D"
I mean war is a lot about logistics I don’t think the people of the country your invading will just re-fuel your tanks at a gas station for ya. So you have to keep a steady supply line.
bro you're everywhere
Russia is literally winning but ok
@AliceFoxxo Look at the map and tell me Ukraine is winning
Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 it 8/8
"Let's hope this video doesn't age badly, like that ""Why Afghanistan Is Impossible to Conquer"" video."
@Good Effort Afghanistan is one of the most isolated spots in the world.   It's nearly impossible to control.
"Afghanistan is still impossible to control. The Taliban has a lot of difficulty controlling their own factions, there is little centralized control."
Well this video came out quick! Lol
thank god they were dumb. if they had a plan ukraine would be dead!
I'm really early
"Putin has been in power for over 20 years and he clearly wants to expand Russia to bring back the Soviet Union, but he probably didn't expect the majority of average people in Russia to be against his actions with Ukraine, most likely because so many of them were born after the Soviet Union fell and view Putin's actions with Ukraine as an invasion and not reclamation."
@D.M. Wayne thank you for letting me know
"The invaders came to us in Ukraine
The uniform's new, military chain
But their inventory melted in part 
*BAYRAKTAR*"
It's been less than two weeks. You don't know if they failed. In today's world everyone wants anything to be instant. Wars don't work that way.
"@daffy the duck Well, at least you can admit mistakes.
It's hard for Westerners to understand the situation since most decent sources whose predictions came true are in Ukrainian and Russian. Good Western analystis are few and far between."
@Paul Serdiuk It appears that my judgement may have been slightly off.
"@daffy the duck You can dream. Meanwhile entire city blocks of Kharkiv were leveled, 300 civilians are dead, 700 are wounded, and my friends are helping out refugees from Kharkiv on their way to Europe. I'll be demanding a big apology as well if I will even remember you lol."
"I was woke up by neighbour at  approximately 7:00 with words ""war has started"" ... 
It was terrifying. However, what ensued by Russian actions were actually even more terrifying."
@X P Very big brained response to a war between two autocratic governments that imprison journalists.
💩🤡💩 krembot 👉@D.M. Wayne
"Putin: write that down, write that down"
Oh boi. This channel didn't take much to deliver. And finally i came here just in time.
On the plus side Russia has made the US' bungled occupation of the middle east look like military genius.
"Oh, another basic content creator that ignored 8 years of Kiev's shelling of civilians in Donetsk, Lugansk and Gorlovka and only turned on the news 8 days ago. Hypocritical sсum."
You're free to watch someone else
they think the ukrops are winning lmfao
Cope. Russia will win 🇷🇺
@Grig RP exactly
Cope. Russia is about to become a third world country.
@Photonic Pizza SLAVA ZUCCHINI
Nope. Cлава Україні
"2:08 It’s like in Civ V when you surround a country with troops, “just passing through”"
Putin is playing Civ for Windows
"“Don’t mind me guys we’re not invading you, we’re invading you neighbours.”"
"Didn’t it started at 5am, not 2am?"
Instant burst of laugh when I saw the title
They have the logistical capability of an average Hoi4 player.
"@「 Deadpoppin 」 

Not even close mate. You’re grouping 144 million people as Putin Clones based off the actions of a single individual. Its asinine."
"@「 Deadpoppin 」 

*Defending Putin. 

Putin and Russians are completely different."
@the V Ah yes Ukraine has lost so much of their grass
@Dodge all these fools fall for propaganda so easily haha
"I love finally someone calls Putin an autocrat (for not using a harsher term) rather than ""President"" or ""Leader"" as the bland mainstream media do"
"How about dictator, tyrant, or despot?  Or just plain old thug?"
Authoritarian sounds more scary than autocrat.
This video is going to be lit as the news is ogoing
"Are you saying Russia couldn’t conquer Ukraine in one week cuz of logistical limitations , therefore they failed? Kinda delusional."
"@Paul Serdiuk ok by that logic, it surely will happen that Russia will capitulate and will withdraw next week?"
"We are talking the 2nd largest army in the world versus the 22nd. Yes, they failed."
"@Conor Roush About 40 days, invading from across the planet into a country with terrible infrastructure, and they still didn't have armored vehicles abandoned on the side of the road. Russia will be lucky if they manage to pull off an invasion anywhere near the same timeline, and they started with a near total encirclement of the entire country."
Putin is fuct.  The best thing he can do is emulate the Nazis he loathes by taking his death and retiring to Brazil.
"Russia played the war like an old war.
They really underestimated the use of propaganda and the internet.
Ukraine basically has the entire world's support and people will call you a putin bot for refuting it.

The first thing that dies in war is the truth."
"@Yuan Tan Staying neutral doesn't necessarily mean not supporting. My country stayed neutral because of strong trade connections with russia, but we suffered a similar fatr to Ukraine at the hands of NATO. We are accepting refugees and sending donations, but as a small country ee can't afford to sanction Russia"
"""Ukraine basically has the entire world's support"" Is this actually true though...
AFAIK China, India, Brazil, Mexico, most of SE Asia (excluding Singapore), and a good number of of African nations are staying neutral at this time.
I think that's almost/over half of the world's population..."
"When there's logistics and supply chain involved, you know this is the go-to channel!"
@Fordragon love you comment. And it's disingenuous to compare a campaign in WW2 so many years ago and one in Iraq (so far away from  US) with one in 2022 right next to the border of the invading country...
"@Shankar Ravikumar France and Iraq are silly examples. In the late 1930s, France had one of the strongest militaries on the planet. In the early 2000s, Iraq could say the same. Both forces had large active military forces with good equipment and training. The major difference is that the invasions of each of those countries on the part of Germany and the US respectively, were incredible displays of competent logistics. My personal understanding of the reason for this, from my study of military history, is that Western generals tend to be better at understanding the supply chain requirements of war than generals from eastern authoritarian nations. The military staff structure popularized by Napoleon, which is still used by most militaries in the west, is better at mutual support and focuses a lot more on those vital support roles. Every level of unit, from the company level and all the way to the top, involves some level of logistical professionals, whose sole job it is to ensure that this function is carried out in support of maneuver elements (the tanks, infantry, etc)."
@Shankar Ravikumar because this war is unique in that it is taking place in 2022 where every piece of the conflict is being reported and recorded.. doesn't take a genius to figure that out. all this information is out there
@Alexander Philip Eisenhower
"@Shankar Ravikumar common man, in today's capitalist society, time is money, the sooner you upload, they more people will click because as time goes on, more and more people already know about the subject
and a lot more people will watch the video if its based on a current topic than people who would watch a history lesson"
“VDV! Massive casualties! Who the hell planned this?”
@E S getting annihilated at Hostomel is way more than 25% casualties
"VDV are considering elite unit mostly comparable to an airborne unit in the US army. Believe it or not airborne units in a conventional war naturally have high casualties. In a mass combat jump for example, USA usually considers 25% losses as acceptable in the initial attack. Units aren’t super soldiers  they can be killed just like any other . They just have more training so they can live longer. Also airborne units are usually designed to capture and hold an objective until the main force can arrive and relieve them."
"I see ""Wendover"" and ""logistics"" and I click. I am a simple man..."
"“Amateurs study tactics; professionals study logistics.”
— Omar N. Bradley"
"I'll remember you said that when I ambush your truck with my plan which takes your logistics out of the equation.

In other words my tactics is why I stole your truck. Meanwhile because you lacked tactics you miss a truck."
How many times do we have to read the same quote on here? Have you thought about formulating your own original ideas?
"​@BigMon The Nisour Square massacre occurred on September 16, 2007. The Haditha massacre on November 19, 2005. In 2017, The New York Times published an investigation in which they spoke about the numerous mistakes made by the US military during air operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Inaccuracies in intelligence, careless strikes and poor understanding of the situation on the ground have led to thousands of civilian casualties. Zemari Ahmadi, 43, who was killed in Kabul, was not a terrorist. He worked as an engineer for the American NFO. The explosion killed ten other people, including seven children, in addition to Ahmadi himself. During the years of airstrikes against terrorists in Iraq and Syria, about 1.5 thousand civilians were killed. Since 2018, at least 188 civilians have been killed by US air operations in Afghanistan. 2016: As a result of an air strike by American aircraft on the Syrian settlement of Tokhar, 56 people were killed, including 11 children. In the village of Hamira, 9 people, including four children, were killed by American bombs. In the Syrian Menbij, as a result of airstrikes by American aircraft, only from May to July 2016, 167 civilians, 17 women and 44 children were killed. On March 20, an American bombing of the Mosul University compound killed 92 and wounded 135 civilians. More than 150 residents of Mosul died after the US Air Force bombed a fuel depot on April 18. US aircraft strike a funeral procession in the Iraqi city of Dakuk on October 21, 2016. 21 civilians were killed and 44 wounded. On September 17, 2016, the US coalition attacked the positions of the Syrian army, which helped the terrorists. The US said it was just a mistake. In October 2015, the US Air Force shelled a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan. The airstrike killed 42 people. Again they said it was just a mistake. On October 17, 2001, at least 29 civilians died in one of the villages near Kandahar during the bombing of the village by US Air Force planes. According to the Japanese agency Kyodo, American aircraft attacked a passenger bus. On the same day, in the suburbs of Kandahar, an American plane destroyed a truck with people who were fleeing the bombing. The second strike killed 12 people. On December 21, 2001, in the area of ​​Khost, the capital of the province of the same name, a Lockheed AC-130 artillery support aircraft and US carrier-based fighter jets mistakenly destroyed a convoy of 12 vehicles in which a deputation of the tribes of eastern Afghanistan was heading to Kabul for the swearing-in ceremony of the interim government of the country. 65 people died. On December 29, 2001, at least 52 civilians, including women and children, were killed in a US bombing of a village near Gardez, Paktia province. On May 17, 2002, at least 10 civilians were killed when American aircraft bombed the village of Bal-Hul (Khost province). The reason for the attack was the shooting in the air, opened by the villagers, who were invited to the wedding of one of the locals. On July 1, 2002, as a result of a US air raid on the village of Kakarak (Uruzgan province), where local residents were having a wedding, about 40 people were killed, more than 70 people were injured. Another wedding shooting. On July 4, 2008, American combat helicopters conducted an operation in the Waigal area in the province of Nuristan. The victims of the air operation were civilians - 22 people, including a woman with a child. On September 4, 2009, in the Kunduz region, a US Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle fighter, part of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, launched an airstrike on two fuel tankers with fuel seized the day before by the Taliban. At the time of the attack, the cars were surrounded by local residents, who were allowed by the militants to drain fuel from tanks for personal use. As a result of the bombing, up to 179 people were killed, of which more than 100 were civilians.
On February 21, 2010, 27 civilians, including women and children, were killed and 12 others were injured when US Air Force MH-6 Little Bird helicopters fired on three minibuses in Uruzgan province in southern Afghanistan. ""Sorry, there was a mistake. It's not our fault.""
This list can be continued for a long time. I'm not going to dig deep into history and talk about the nuclear bombing of Japan (of which, of course, no civilians became victims) or the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam. Or we won't finish today. I want to say that yes, war is a terrible and bloody thing. And yes, people die in war (Surprise!). And yes, civilians die as well. These are the realities of war. And you don’t need to smear some with white paint, declaring them paladins of good, and others with black, calling them nonhumans or orcs. Get the beam out of your own eye before looking for the mote in someone else's.
The international reaction is hypocritical. The US and Germany are bombing Yugoslavia - everything is fine. Israel attack Syria and Egypt - everything is fine. Saudi Arabia is bombing Yemen - everything is fine. NATO is bombing Libya - everything is fine. Russia introduces a limited military contingent to Ukraine - Putin is the worst man on earth, Europe and the United States declare economic war on Russia, bring down sanctions on the civilian population. Quod licet Iovi, non licet bovi.
Russia has been doing everything for 8 years to prevent events in Ukraine from happening. European countries acted as guarantors of the agreement with Yanukovych. They acted as guarantors of Minsk-1. They acted as guarantors of Minsk-2. And they did NOTHING to fulfill their obligations and prevent bloodshed.
Russia warned for 15 years, but it was not heard. Because they didn't want to hear. Well. Can you hear us now?
You say the Russians are targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure. What for? It's just that Russians are naturally evil people. Because they love to torture, rob and kill others. You certainly have a lot of evidence of such events. You're not some empty talker, are you? The fact that you are a racist, we already understood."
"@Дмитрий Гарин I have no idea what you are trying to say. But here's my point. If I am driving on the street and a child runs in the middle of the street and I hit the child then it is true that I killed the child but not on purpose. That is totally different than driving in the street with the sole purpose of trying to kill the child. 
If you have proof that Americans purposefully killed those civilians then present your case. We have convicted many soldiers for doing so. We are not afraid to publicize it. Meanwhile, you Russians keep doing what you're doing. Let's see where this takes you."
"Ohh Vladdy-boi, you single handedly ruined Russia and its future plans for being part of an integrated world prosperity. On the bright side he will never be able to kill more people than Stalin."
