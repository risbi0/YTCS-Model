"How to be saved and be right with God for eternal life!
1-Admit you’re a sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God.
2-Believe  onto  Jesus  Christ,who being the Son of God, died on the cross,
was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins as a free gift.
3-Confess onto God,asking to be saved accepting this free gift of salvation,
to start a new life being born again after being saved from your sins.
