Ugzyg121_erOAa5xJtN4AaABAg,"Fun fact South Korea was a dictatorship until the 80s, the dictators daughter led it only a few years ago and a tinfoil hat tier feminist cabal theory mocked for years was proven true in the mainstream media. She was a puppet of Hillary Clinton types."
Ugz1loO6gTdjjfvvVXx4AaABAg,Because you used biological warfare on them and they need to spend all their food money on nukes so you don't do it again.

Ugw35P1mcnz9vs24BWR4AaABAg,"To think that the Americans are a benign power is dumb af! The Americans by the time they involved in Korea had already invaded Haiti, Cuba, Phillipines, Puerto Rico Hawaii and killed thousands in those places to maintain their empire! People of color were not even allowed to own land in America at that time in certain places! Let's not forget America bombed the shit out of Korea! Sk was a dictatorship until 1980s way more brutal than nk!"

UgzK2t64ymOtrY59ked4AaABAg,"Intentional or unintentional, this content is still biased. You are still white and an American, you won't understand their perspective. 
US systematically suppressed North Korea through endless sanctions since its inception till today and crippled it's economy while sympathizing south korea through investment, technology sharing and military.  You didn't mentioned this.
 South korea didn't developed on its own. In early stages, south korea even couldn't form a stable govt and had poor economy ,unlike North whose politics was stable and economy flourished."

Ugw0cq-z1uNLo61Iap54AaABAg,"The North ""hates"" the US for the same reason that Russia hates ""Nazis""  The current regime keeps alive hatred for a long ago enemy in order to justify the awful repression that the average citizen has to endure in order to prop up the current dictatorship.   Seoul has moved on and prospered.  The North, under the dictatorship of the Kim dynasty, has not. North Korea has one of the worst life expectancies on Earth.  Look at the nighttime light map of the Korean peninsula for a stark representation between those that move forward and those that live in the past."

People don‚Äôt realize how crazy it is to live right next to North Korea for the fact that we have to plan our escape in case of an emergency and leave everything behind if North Korea were to really start a war. It‚Äôs a reality a lot of people don‚Äôt have to go through that  practice of having to pack one bag take what‚Äôs important and leave everything behind as Americans we have to be here we‚Äôre not always welcome here.

Regardless of the history and tragedy that shaped their division, if you think that North Korea is really at war with just the US and you think South Korea would be just fine if only the US extracted itself from South Korea,  it would likely be a disaster for South Korea who dares to be a glaring example of how successful a free society is compared to the communist run country of NK, . . . or China, or Russia.  They all remain allies and would be eager to tear down South Korea's government and blunder its wealth and claim its industries.  South Korea face Taiwan's peril save only the direct, boots-on-the-ground, presence of the US.  Without our protection all these years, the people of SK would not have had the opportunity to prosper, grow and thrive, thinking nothing of their NK military threats . . . they would just be under one harsh communist regime."

Thanks to mistake of Stalin, USA bombed NK so bad for most part away. 
So, why still hate Americans and not at Stalin due his fault / misunderstood (literally hate USSR)? It's because they're friends. That is why NK leader will not say Stalin 'it's your fault'. Instead of, he just face to USA will say to USA literally 'it's your fault you bombed our land'. Short said: 'Don't interference my fight to South Korea.'
In other words, NK is really stubborn and stays with it, with stupid propaganda and keep going on with dumb moves and will not looking back in history why everything goes so bad?

Yeah, this is really sad NK is really stubborn and don't want learn from mistakes in the past, even with Stalins error.

UgytVe9373G4JkgXgrZ4AaABAg,"Of course NK is fixated on the three year conflict. It‚Äôs one of the founding myths of the country. Problem is NK isn‚Äôt told they started the war. They‚Äôre taught America invaded. So imagine 70+ years of being taught and thinking your leader held off an aggressive invasion where the US committed wars crimes and you see why they hate us. Yeah, war crimes were committed but that was on both sides. The communists were absolutely brutal bc no war conventions held them back. It‚Äôs called the forgotten war bc the West basically pays it no mind compared to NK. It‚Äôs a footnote of WWII - which is and isn‚Äôt true. My grandfather served in the Korean War so I‚Äôve always known and respected the US veterans and South Koreans. Now it‚Äôs obvious who was right and who was wrong but we gave the SK the right to forge their own way. That said, I hate when people compare the Vietnam war to the Korean War. We straight invaded Vietnam whereas we liberated Korea from Japan and were already there when Kim invaded."

Outsiders when they think of Korea, the conflict between North and South, and the nuclear weapons related new stories are some of the things that come to mind first. But for people living their lives in that context, they're more concerned with things that affect their lives and realities more directly. The war, since it's its been in ceasefire for so long, is more of an abstract. I heard of people living in Kiev that didn't even feel concerned about Russian aggression or invasion, even after the annexation of Crimea.

Second, We Are Being Told, North Korea, Who Don't Even Have The Technology To Succesfully Build Even One Missile That Could Potentially Carry A Nuclear War Head & Hit Our Mainland, Let Alone Engage In A Full Blown War With The US & Entire NATO Force That Could Easily Wipe Out North Korea In A Matter Of Few Hours, That Same North Korea Poses A Really Present Threat & Danger To Our Very Existance That We Need To Starve Their Citizens And Constantly Bully Them With Military Drills That Mimic Actual Invasion & War.

UgxW824aOZogPGsE13N4AaABAg,"This illustrates the problem with a cease-fire.  There is no winner and there is no loser.  The conflict is not resolved.  So here we are almost 70 years later with a DMZ still separating the two factions. The DMZ is patrolled on both sides by soldiers whose parents hadn't even met at the time of the conflict.  It's a gun barrel to gun barrel, who's going to blink first stand-off.

South Korea isn't really called South Korea, it's just called Korea.  It went from being a battered, broken, bankrupt country to one of the world's economic powerhouses in a generation.  North Korea is always referred to as NORTH Korea and is an oppressive, brutal dictatorship whose people are lucky to live an early 20th century existence.

The Allies' enemies during WWII are now among its closest friends.  Japan went from having a nuclear bomb dropped on them (twice!) to becoming a rival of the US in terms of industrial might. The UK uses BMW cars and motorcycles as it's police vehicles. 
The rest of the world has moved past prior conflicts, made peace with its former enemies, and have grown into prosperous nations.  North Korea's primary industry is propaganda.  The brutal dictator(s) who run the country live in a world of perpetual hate and fear. North Korea has tried to freeze time at 1953.
.   
If North Korea decides to launch a nuclear missile...their first one had better be their best, because they won't get a second one launched.  Missiles from every NATO country within range (or a NATO submarine within range) will rain down on Pyongyang like a deadly hailstorm. It's a safe bet that those missiles have been aimed at their North Korean targets since before the technician sitting at the launch controls was born."

UgxX18aYyi1lU54VtQd4AaABAg,Hello #Oakland
UgzvdeHXY559eeOcWe14AaABAg,"J. Harris, you are so bogus. Maybe you didn't learn about this potential conflict in school because you didn't pay attention, like so many students do. I know about all this because I did extra reading. Also the US Air Force dropped more bombs during the K War than in WWII? What do you expect? It was a war. The bomb shelters are as bogus as you? Is that the fault of the U.S.? Talk to the South Korea leaders. At least you tell the truth when you state that the conflict was started by NK. Please drop you socially anxious voice. It would be a better video if you did."

UgwPxtZqciSp7my2AmV4AaABAg,I was just in Seoul and was thinking this when I saw those bomb shelters too
UgzAcbwGyE9FVHVjIrd4AaABAg,South Koreans probably don't worry about war like americans do because if one did happen we would have most likely have been part of the reason why it happened. It's easy to forget that at some point Trump was literally boasting about his access to nuclear weapons on twitter and made threats to the North Koreans. We worry about it because it most likely is the case we will stumble into that conflict but South Korean lives are the ones at stake not necessarily US ones.

However, from other videos and documentaries, the North Korean dictatorship should be the one blamed for both the war and the enslavement of their own people. They inculcate the hatred towards the US as a way of control and indoctrination, the leader is to be worshipped as a god, etc etc. The south suffered as much but they thrived under the US. Japan and Germany suffered way more during WW2 and today they are some of our top allies in the world. Vietnam and Hanoi received a lot of pounding during the Vietnam war, however, today we have diplomatic relationship and trade with them and they might become an important ally against China, so the N. Korean hate towards us  is more about keeping them afraid and suspicious of us above all. We certainly don‚Äôt plan neither do we want to have a repeat of the Korean War"

Ugymv6zUhEeHxvulg1F4AaABAg,"Very good video. One thing I'd like to add is that it is generally true that most South Koreans don't spend too much time worrying about North Korea. But there is seems to be a correlation of the older you are, the more hardline you tend to be against North Korea. My father is old enough to remember the war and his time in the ROK army afterwards. He and his friends definitely spend much more time mulling about the threat of North Korea than the younger generation (which grew up under more prosperous and peaceful times). Conservative governments in South Korea (which tend to be more hardline vs DPRK) get a large part of their support from the older generation.

Another things I want to mention is that while complacency is normal, it is not always a good thing. Many examples where people downplay things because they don't think it can happen (again). They like to try to forget past history sometimes. Not always good."

Maybe you suffer from white guilt over horrible things that happened in the Korean War. It was horrible. But as you point out, it was planned and started by the Communists in the north with support from both Soviet Union and China. But it started with North Korea.

My point is that this conflict started and continues primarily as the result of what Koreans are doing. So stop trying to put this on outside forces.

Here is an alternative hypotheses as for why the North is investing in nuclear weapons that it knows cannot be used with out destroying itself. North wants continued American attention and focus as a direct threat so that it doesn‚Äôt pull troops out of South Korea.  Of course South Korea is happy to have them as additional insurance since it provides the psychological cover to go about their daily lives as if North Korea doesn‚Äôt exist.

Why would North Korea want Americans to stay in South Korea?

Having American boots in South Korea means that China will never get close to South Korea and remain a strong supporter of North Korea.  Think about that.  What is actually going on is that North Koreans are manipulating the Americans to retain support from China. As I said, this is not driven by outside powers but from Pyongyang."

I think Western media should stress less abt NKorean ballistics, but perhaps more on Chinese power cuz they can and willing to cause real problems anytime. Just to add, remember Koreans are still sharing same blood and everything so we never think and im sure North Korea wouldnt think abt destroying South Korea as it mentioned in the video. We both blame US , USSR, China and Japan for separating us and keep it as it is forever."

The Cold War was about fighting against Communism, not necessarily pro-democracy. And it's hard to ""move on"" without a peace agreement, which the North has been demanding for decades.
The video also ignored Japan's role in the conflict. The peninsula had been ruled by Japan with an iron fist since 1910. Kim Il-sung was an anti-Japanese activist and guerrilla fighter during WWII. After the WWII the US appointed officials who collaborated with Japan to run South Korea. This was deemed unacceptable by Kim Il-sung and motivated him to invade the South. Today North Korea is as anti-Japanese as much as it is anti-US."

UgwJOQGx4BQbDU4D2i54AaABAg,"As someone who was born and raised in Russia and didn't leave the country (for financial reasons) since the beginning of the war in Ukraine despite being very much against it, I believe I know why don't South Koreans fear North Korea all the time. It's simply psychologically impossible to live in constant fear. South Koreans just got used to this situation, and simply continue on with their lives, just like a lot of anti-war people did in my country. I myself was shocked and depressed for the first two weeks in February and March, but then I just kinda got adjusted to it. My life continues, I've graduated from my university, I'm hanging out with my friends and my partner, I go to family gatherings (although I can't stop thinking about my grandparents watching state TV and supporting the war, and I do feel bad about it), and generally my life didn't change aside from the fact that now I'm thinking more often about how I hate Putin's regime and how it's unfair to those affected by the war, having imaginary discussions with abstract Putin's supporters, and planning my escape from the country (because it just keeps getting worse, and I absolutely have to do this since it's also limiting my career growth). In fact, when there was somewhat quiet time during the summer, it kinda felt like not much was happening, and many people started to feel as if life was going back to normal (even though in reality it wasn't true).

At the same time, when Americans (or basically anybody from the outside world) think about North Korea, they analyze the whole situation all over again, they put their mind into it, and they feel like it's reasonable to be scared about this. I've also observed this effect with Russia, when westerners are often scared of visiting Moscow or other big cities in Russia, because they hear about all the oppression happening in the country, and naturally they perceive it as a significant threat. Whereas I, growing up in Moscow region, am just used to it, and don't really think of it on a daily basis.

There are countless examples of stuff like that all over the world, from South American cities ridden with crime, to deep poverty in Africa and South Asia, to countries like Taiwan where locals just want to maintain the status-quo despite it obviously hurting them.

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that people tend to adjust to things, and whether you live under a constant threat of your city getting turned into a pile of ashes, or you just were born in a favela controlled by a drug cartel, or there's an aggressive neighbor with a bunch of nukes who's constantly making promises to annex your country - you're gonna get used to it, and you're gonna bury it in your everyday life.

Also, AFAIK during the cold war there were thousands of ""bomb shelters"" all over NYC that were basically the same as in Seoul - just a bunch of random basements and underground floors with no infrastructure to actually save people from a medium-sized strategic nuke dropped a few kilometers upwind"

Ugy_sF85iEdvFRYsJtB4AaABAg,"They are acting out for interest of national security. Famine strikes, the  nation is weakened and people are disoriented, and as invasion looms, they built nuke. 
It's common sense. They are not acting out of thirst for vengeance.
You lose war, you become a slave.  That's the way of the world. 
The western lies can only be seen as absurdity that are only good enough to brainwash children.

And Truman was a psychopath and a mass murderer. He dropped two nukes on Japan, and did all that crap mentioned in the video to North Korea. He also did the same stuff to Vietnam, dropping bombs and spreading chemicals.

Fun fact, South Koreans were starving to death after fighting for Americans, while North Korea was flourishing unti late 1970s. Why? And how? And I am just wondering how in the world South Korea isn't holding a grudge against the U.S.

South Korean dictatorship really brainwashed its people to fight for foreigners in their own country despite starving to death. Which one is more totalitarian? North Korea or South Korea?

South Korea didn't even have democracy until 1990s. For almost 50 years, under American rule, they had dictators.

America does not care about democracy.

And who invaded whom is not important. South Korea is a valuable strategic asset and just like in any warfare, it's important to grab it. And as for Americans too, South Korea was an important asset so they invaded South Korea to fend off Soviet Union. 

The real question should be, why did South Koreans even fight for Americans or aided Americans.

What differed is that North Korea benefited from the alliance and had control over its own country, while South Korea didn't. And another difference is that, Soviet Union underestimated casualties and losses for war and assumed it to be an easy victory with minimal damage on both sides, while the U.S. maliciously bombarded the North and massacred people while being fully conscious of the consequences. Soviet Union killed their own people. North Korea didn't or let Soviet Union kill North Korean people. Killing people and throwing people in front for gunfire is a Russian thing, not Korean. That's Russian strategy for not having natural defenses or something like that. Koreans fight smart, not by numbers. (Russia and China fights with numbers and reproduction. America fights with oil. Koreans fight with smarts.)

It's good that South Korea is now finally putting its fertile southern lands to productivity and building computer chips for America like slaves while committing suicides, all that to gorge their mouth with junk foods to have their asses fattened like a bunch of pigs."

UgwdO7g0B7ZNak11-8p4AaABAg,"You don't need a video from a hipster to describe what North Korea is. Stalin was a murderous demon on this planet, and found others of his ilk to perpetuate power with. North Korea was saved by communist china after they crossed into their country. Eventually a standoff ensued, as they do throughout history. And there's a border. The things you are pissed about (our media coverage) is a result of our leaders not finishing the job 70 years ago.

The blood of MANY AMERICANS not only saved China in WW2, but what's left of Korea and perhaps the remainder of asia itself. The Russians came after doing next to nothing.

The border that was drawn was a battle line. At this point in history, the Communists were a new religion, and saw fit to convert whoever and whatever to their cause. Even by the communist manifesto's account, capitalism was just a rung on the step to communism. Subversion, coercion are the communist tools- so it makes perfect sense that the communists AGREED to the 38th parallel being drawn as borders are useless when you can take advantage of an impoverished people w/collectivist ideologies.

Also their ""spies"" assessments were wrong- the US defense powers were always keen to the fact that the communists wanted to convert other nations as they did in their Soviet ""Union"". They did this exact thing to Germany at the end of WW2. It pissed off US officials (generals and politicians alike). They also viewed it as an existential threat to civilization which Truman made mention of in his speech.

There is no ""new lens"", there is no ""my truth"". There is THE truth. What is actually happening. These old empires hold onto resentments and grudges that other men have long forgotten. They enslave and oppress their people for generations as a result.

Also dude, blaming AMERICA for turning the country to ""dust"" as you coined it is incredibly short sighted. Communism, China, Russia also had a card to play. The people in the south wanted to be saved. America felt obligated to do the right thing here. 

Look at South Korea now. 

They don't even *think* about the war, being so far removed from that type of horror by the comforts granted to them via the system they chose to perpetuate. They also don't want the US to leave. Similar situation in Japan, some want them to leave but most don't want the military to. It has a track record of not oppressing the peoples it occupies.

I think the issue of biased journalism and education is not limited just to foreign countries but also in South Korea. So your approach of sharing the telegram exchanges between Kim Il-Sung and Stalin was super interesting. 

I would be interested if you can extend this topic  into issue of reunification and the geopolitics surrounding this topic.

UgzXHbPwXOcfm_P5wm94AaABAg,"General MacArthur wanted to use the Atomic bomb before China got one as a force multiplier it was denied! So I guess the West had to make do with the gains it had namely regaining the 38 parallel? As fighting was rough and very cold due to geographic winters and it would have taken a push similar too WW2 to go all the way up to the utter most North so it was decided 38th no further to save soldiers any further pain of having to fight on! When there‚Äôs skin in the game it‚Äôs hard to say go over there and fight when we back home are warm in front of our TVs playing arm chair commander the MASH units seen it 1st hand having been the ones stitching up the wounded soldiers sent to fight so the 38th no further it was! It probably was the last true war fought!? Namely to stop a communist flood.Soooo thank you, you brave troops of the British and American units who bravely stood in the gap üò¢ I solute you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.."
UgzXHbPwXOcfm_P5wm94AaABAg.9hX-6wgOZ2M9hXHQdl4w-5,@Mike P what you are saying is historically true and remember it wasn‚Äôt too long between 1945 and 1953 WW2 pilots were still fighting during Korea so it was very fresh in the thinking that if a Atomic bomb could end a war against Japanese aggression then what was good for the goose would of course be good for the gander? If Russia didn‚Äôt have the Atomic bomb as well as China then it may have been a different history we would be looking at as the probability of using it would have looked favourable so MacArthur kept asking and pushing for it as a question of priority as China was flooding the battle field with extremely large numbers so something big was needed in his thinking? But all in all MacArthur did his best and politics was the main driver to the end of MacArthur rather than him being mentally unbalanced?!

After watching each of his videos, I come to the comment section to see how people constructively debate against his logic or how natives share their perspective. But majority of the native SK people seem to agree with Johnny that SK doesn't live in a state of fear that all. This points how we in the states, living thousands of miles away, feed the cycle of paranoia fed by both our media and the NK dictator(s). And let's not forget how superpowers across the world have fucked up countries, cultures and people's lives forever. This looks like yet another case of failed border-drawing

UgzNTk-EQ3wZSOBz1b94AaABAg,"My grandfather was technically a ""Korean War"" veteran, drafted and never having stepped foot anywhere in Asia, let alone the Korean Peninsula so I always add the caveat, a Korean War ERA veteran. He was stationed in Berlin when the Wall was up and never wanted to talk about it. As I got older, I realized it wasn't because he faced direct combat in Berlin, but he definitely maintained the mindset that the world was full of espionage and that he couldn't divulge information that would let the Communists gain any edge whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, and he took all those secrets with him to the grave. I only found out a piece of the puzzle when I discovered his old military records, but even that didn't suffice. The ""Cold War"" was way more than we could imagine it to be and it even had an effect on the psyche of the next generation as I saw my uncles and aunts were affected by his behavior as a father and then how it got passed down generationally even to us grandkids"

To end up with less wars, violence and authoritarian regimes, societies will have to give full freedom to the widespread teaching of the following beliefs and values to younger generations: To believe that we are the end product of an Intelligent Creator and that the ultimate agenda of our Creator is to end the cycle of war, violence, and authoritarian regimes through instructing our younger generation of citizens who will be the future world leaders to have spiritual, moral and civic values that are consistent with God's instructions according to Leviticus 19: ""Be fair in your judging. You must not show special favor to poor people or great people but be fair when you judge your neighbor. 16 You must not spread false stories against other people, and you must not do anything that would put your neighbor‚Äôs life in danger. I am the Lord. 17 ‚Äú‚ÄòYou must not hate your fellow citizen in your heart. If your neighbor does something wrong, tell him about it, or you will be partly to blame. 18 Forget about the wrong things people do to you, and do not try to get even. Love your neighbor as you love yourself. I am the Lord (Leviticus 19:15-18 NCV).

UgwtmZhG8GkjlO0qX2F4AaABAg,Watching this reminded me of the time I was stationed in 1996 and the life lessons I learned about foreign policy. Most of the younger generations I talked with echoed your same sentiment that the North was Saber rattling at the US not at them. They also had greater concern with Japan than with the North because of their history. I thank you for the video because you can't understand the world from a US centric pov.
UgzJ9JFngZpLlEwiV614AaABAg,"This is an amazing video! Thank you. But I wanted to push back on one of your conclusions a little bit. üòÖ I‚Äôm not 100% sure it‚Äôs the Americans who are the source of North Korea‚Äôs anxiety.

There‚Äôs a really good YT channel called Asian Boss that has a couple of interviews with North Korean defectors. To my surprise, one of them told a story of how he was arrested for wearing a shirt with an American Flag on it. Turns out this shirt had arrived in NK through donations and he had never seen an American flag anywhere. Ever. So he just grabbed the tshirt with other donations,  wore it, and got in big trouble. Another NK defector says he would actually like to ‚Äúfinally‚Äù go to war with the US because this wait was exhausting. The public schools where they teach about the Korean war aren‚Äôt that great and the kids are usually too hungry to learn.

So‚Ä¶ are the Americans still causing anxiety? Or is the regime? I don‚Äôt dispute that a war is traumatizing to a nation, but  people in the 80 and 90s haven‚Äôt really felt the bombing, they have felt the great famine of the 90s. The idea poor rural people have of Americans today is totally created by the regime

Maybe you could make another video elaborating on this topic? I‚Äôd love to learn more."

UgzIx8Fqt2EcUrIwoA54AaABAg,"Thanks Johnny for seeking & presenting a new perspective on the war that hasn‚Äôt really ended, certainly not in the minds of North Korean leaders. I suppose we can blame Air Force general Curtis LeMay for North Korea‚Äôs perception of American values & intentions. The American carpet bombing of North Korea, as you described it, reminds me of how the Russian army used massive artillery bombardment to seize more of eastern Ukraine in the summer of 2022. 

I think part of a future peace process to officially end the Korean War will entail a public apology by the US President for the decision to bomb the North indiscriminately in the early 1950s. 

But Pyongyang will also have to declare that it will recognize South Korea as a sovereign & independent state, renouncing any desire to reunify the peninsula by force. 

I don‚Äôt know what could ever disabuse North Korean leaders of a paranoid interpretation everything America does or does not do in Asia. The war still rages in their minds."

Japan eventually capitulated after having even nukes dropped on them, but some documents indicate that it was not the air raids or nukes that pushed the final decision but that they hated the Russians more than the Americans and Russia was about to get involved.

It says something about the difference between having your enemy as a neighbor compared to how the US and NATO has been operating for a long time.

UgzFJKC4QBmlUWB3yF14AaABAg,"""Be afraid of North Korea! Be afraid of China! Be afraid of Iran! Be afraid of X..with regards, the USA"". All this fear (and current and future wars) is very beneficial to the United States and its military‚Äìindustrial complex. It keeps the money flowing, guns going and the US power growing. That being said, its nice to see that so many South Koreans citizens are so smart and level-headed with regards of the situation with North Korea. Lets just hope the politicians are as cool headed, now and in the future. I still think that it should be up to the Koreans themselves to solve this situation ( and the possible reunification) without pressure or hindrance from either China or the USA...but I guess that will not be happening anytime soon."
Ugx3hMZPZjmqDmZeA8h4AaABAg,You make it sound like NK is how it is today because of US. Smh... I couldn't watch it all the way through because this is very biased against USA and I'm not even an American. I'm Asian and you make NK's hate is justified which is ridiculous.
UgylunIKC42ZGtA6Lcp4AaABAg,"This is the same exact feeling I get coming back from a visit in Israel. I live in the US and I get consistently asked if I feel it's dangerous in Israel. The similarities between the two conflicts are striking and while the current situation is not exactly the same, the feeling I get is. While I'm in Israel, there's not a hint of fear of the conflict, just people living their daily lives.

Oh, and the bomb shelter thing is very similar. There's a law in Israel since 1951 that requires almost all buildings including homes to have some kind of reinforced bomb shelter. Mostly, these spaces end up being repurposed for some other additional use. In my parents' home, it is a spare bedroom and while it doesn't have a window, it is still quite comfortable."
Ugx4Sg4KD18ESxT4VFZ4AaABAg,"Dude you're pouring fire onto a powder keg for money.

Ugx0Fte6nzDiUys1kTx4AaABAg,"I see this conflict from the perspective of the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine today. Well, many parallels are seen through the vision of superpowers, the US and Russia (well, Russia is not a superpower already). Wow. 

Also, as a Ukrainian, I totally understand South Korean's way of building bomb shelters. It would be a waste of precious space to build big bomb shelters like Finland showed us recently because the nuclear threat is quite overrated (I'll keep you posted about that, haha). And shelters should save you from shells. What I saw in this video could save you from bullets and shells, the last one would save you from a missile.

In peacetime, they could be used by businesses. In wartime, they should be prepared to serve a population. They seems to do it right."

UgwViJaKLi1VytX9xt14AaABAg,"This is largely tone deaf. Especially in the beginning about how one day the communists savages from Russia and the Americans just stopped being friends overnight.

Also on a small note. You used the wrong flag for China. After 1949, the chinese flag is the modern red and yellow starred one. The one you used is the Taiwanese flag."
UgwViJaKLi1VytX9xt14AaABAg.9hVOT09yX2x9hVPsJ8vG5g,"It's also important to note that while the Koreans are definitely used to the threats, in the back of most people's minds, it's always there. The threat of war is always there but it's not something they obsess over like the North does in regard to the south. The DPRK also uses the war and the US involvement to justify the treatment of its people. The Kim regime uses the hatred of the US and West as a scapegoat to continue hatred and keep the regime in power."

Ugwg7tnUpmwZLqtO8EF4AaABAg,"Thanks for the history, I too was curious of the root reason why NK didn‚Äôt like USA. In my observation and opinion: Initially both USA and Russia saved Korea from Japan but then they became bullies by dividing Korea. Furthermore USA wanting south to be American friendly and Russia wanting North to be Communist friendly. Initially  both USA and Russia did good but then became evil (by wanting control) and look at the damage they caused. If you want to do good for a country why follow up with bad? USA and Russia should‚Äôve left the Korean people to run their country. One day both bullies USA and Russia will find their Karma and be destroyed. Then earth may become a peaceful place for everyone to live. A peaceful earth will also mean people won‚Äôt have to go through the hardship of trying to colonize Mars."

A major part of the reason Germany became a major enemy before and during WW2 was because we didn't help them rebuild after destroying their country in WWI. Hopefully we can find ways to change their hatred towards us so that we don't have another war with them . A peaceful solution would be much more preferred in my opinion, but it's been 70ish years so maybe we are past that üò•"

If proper dialog between these two could happen WITHOUT US influence, maybe things could de-escalate."

Ugx3c8ece_zaVAadHbR4AaABAg,"One thing to note is that Seoul's subway infrastructure as a whole gets utilized as bomb shelters since the platforms and rail network are massive enough to transport goods safely across and deep enough to be safe from bombardment. While a lot of people might not realize, there are CBRN gas masks and other emergency kits (not to mention public restrooms, water fountains, and storage areas that can be quickly repurposed for stocking emergency supplies in these stations) placed on those subway platforms, albeit limited and not well-maintained. Similarly, some portions of Gyeongbu Expressway (main highway line in South Korea) were built to be utilized as emergency airstrips for fighter jets in case of invasion."

UgzDn1R08XTfnhAV0554AaABAg,"The North Koreans were the aggressors in the Korean War and the U.S. came to the South's defense. As we should have, because communism is evil, which is why we wanted to split Korea to stem its influence. And we helped transition SK from an autocracy to a democracy in the 80's. And I'm tired of the North Korean government's cry-bullying about ""western imperialism"" while they torture and starve their own people. And no, you can't blame that on western sanctions, not when their biggest ally is China directly to their north.

Ugzoaaq-yFBHm5ulrph4AaABAg,"Your bothsidesing of the conflict aside, it is important to remember that invaders deserve to be crushed. North Korea invaded South Korea, and the invading forces got thoroughly crushed for it. The fact that they invaded a region under US protection was akin to them invading a US territory in the minds of the American leaders at that time.  It is very important to remember that the US still had fresh memories of being invaded by Japan at Pearl Harbor during WWII, so Americans were in no mood for encroachment on US military might by what was basically a de facto colony seized from Japan and split with the soviets.  The North Koreans were extremely brutal in their campaign against the South Koreans, and the invading armies were known to execute their prisoners and burn villages to sow fear.  History is even more chilling if you research the fast neutron alternative that was actually briefly considered by the US, but thankfully quickly abandoned,  in favor of the carpet bombing campaign that was settled upon during that time.  One of the biggest reasons for going with carpet bombing over a fast neutron alternative was that the Americans didn't want to set a ""trend"", in the same battle theatre no less.  The saying went: two is a coincidence, three is a trend."

UgzsOECfUKC8qYjl8it4AaABAg,You should of talked about the trees. After the war there wasn't any.
UgyGo83tfsji3RCTSB94AaABAg,that is the worst piece of propaganda I've ever seen. no one in the south is being hurt by that standoff.. you make it purely about the us when the action in Korea was a un effort. maybe talk to some of the Korean veterans . you act like it was today's Air Force also. for the first part of the war the North Koreans actually had better Jets thanks to their Soviet and Chinese allies. the mig 15s  were far superior to anything the West had at the time. and to kind of gloss over the fact we didn't start the war. there are a lot of your films that I like because I hear that different perspective but this was complete horse crap
UgxBYVi0pO8jhiG3PXR4AaABAg,"Nevermind the politics, the fact is that Americans really did bad things to the people of Korea, an injustice done"
UgzUh4D1oFyCMkov6D14AaABAg,great color grading Johny!
Ugyy3yr3WoR7j9O5ZxV4AaABAg,"I feel like its sad this happened, but wasn‚Äôt it a korean who decided to destroy the balance, lose, and then force his country to remain in shock after they were war ravaged? seperated yes, but eventually to be reunited?"
UgyzlCSN-1swrD3HtH54AaABAg,I suppose Johny overestimate the factor of war that took place 70 years ago and underestimate the factor of crazy dictator who is in power in North Korea. We have an example of Japan which also was in war with United States bur doesn't want to destroy anybody
UgzF4wUybRNVRWtleXR4AaABAg,The US didn't have air superiority but air dominance.

Ugy9TcQFXP97bDArrgh4AaABAg,This was a very informative video. The most interesting thing I learned was that South Koreans don't worry about war with North
UgyYtTarpFhmnGus1XN4AaABAg,"If You Come To Think of It Between The Conquests And Wars of Super Powers Only The People of Korea Have Suffered The Most. The Thing I Can't Understand Is That People From The West Like South Koreans Because They Support The US And Are Against North Korea Because It Is Has Anti-Americanism, But As You've Clearly Said They Have A Perfect Reason To Hate The US Because The Devastation They Have Caused. I'm Not Saying That North Korea Has Good Governance or Ideas But Views of The Western People Are Clearly Biased."
UgyYtTarpFhmnGus1XN4AaABAg.9hUjtS6rZsI9hVExXBsbTk,"Do you see how developed South Korea is compared to North Korea due to both of their governments decisions on how they should live? Seems like helping SK escape saved them big time. They can go and move anywhere in the world, they've made top products, influence millions from their culture, they can be vocal on anything. But no, the US ruined NK. THEY RUINED THEMSELVES. Well their leader did."
Ugx2pBl_7XmVMNmtbXR4AaABAg,"USSR never gave the technology of nuclear bomb , it was provided by pakistan üáµüá∞ Intelligence agency ""ISI""   which was backed by America. Libya and Iran were also got this nuclear technology through pakistan."

UgwvfxbHKmvT4HIeDzp4AaABAg,Oy my god. Every Korean man must serve the military service and most of us went North Korean borderline. And it‚Äôs so ridiculous seeing this White savior acting like he‚Äôs in a dangerous mission in front of fence. Which is clearly near the tourist spot.
Ugw2qXrzp57-sNYxHI54AaABAg,"I didn't realize North Korea wasn't a threat to South Korea, but was as threat to the US and the western allies and did not forget while South Korea did. North Korea will never declare war on South Korea with the US still the dominate superpower in air and navy"
Ugw2qXrzp57-sNYxHI54AaABAg.9hUiJmikSAf9hUoTiNmvmM,"They were a threat till about the 90s. Western military tech just greatly out paced there military abilities. 

That, and without Soviet help, most of the NK military has fallen into disrepair and is under supplied. It‚Äôs air force in particular."
UgwK1cFccbSVbE9ERVZ4AaABAg,Thank you so much!true appreciated
UgzyKUwon5hXDN1x1sh4AaABAg,"Thanks for sharing this. Virtually no one in the US know about the over destruction of pretty much anything in the North. It's almost like they had a field trip with their bombers. The North Koreas never forgot, and never will."
UgzeH6zxkZNQgNHtCh94AaABAg,I didn‚Äôt know that about the influences of the USSR and USA in Korea and you explained it in a way that simply made sense. Thanks. This is one of my best videos of yours. ‚ù§
UgwwQ815MZ5IIGEfqq54AaABAg,That beanie gives you absolutely NO cred
UgxfmOvQke0nPAo_pPh4AaABAg,Can you do a video on why Europe is it‚Äôs own continent when it‚Äôs is directly connected to Asia? I understand that Africa is directly connected as well but it is a tiny strip of land so it makes sense to categorize it differently but Europe is Asia in my eyes when looking at a map
UgyGYO-0XXyTdaBT9lB4AaABAg,"Your final comment is odd. You say North Korea is at war with United States, but do not mention South Korea at all. Is North Korea trying to subjugate South Korea or the United States? and do not try to take this conversation off track by saying that the United States has troops there. Yes, they do, and so do the South Koreans! And they do not want to be ruled by Kim Il Sung family."
Ugw0GJGR7yO6jQzRnEV4AaABAg,"The opposite case in Srilanka,,, Tamils being oppressed and a occupied by foreign nation"
Ugz3bczPYVPKS3RgtBR4AaABAg,Ok but does anyone know what highlighters he‚Äôs using? I NEED
UgzNVNx1zQ-1ySfkjUF4AaABAg,North should never move on from what USA did to them just to flex muscle and show USSR who's bigger.
UgzNVNx1zQ-1ySfkjUF4AaABAg.9hUgqvudzEZ9hVGAfTnI-h,"They aren't moving anywhere. With all of their developments just going to their cheap military, the people barely get food."

UgxKu2IXcxbAJhIWHt14AaABAg,"the real reason north korea hates the usa is because they needed a common enemy to rally their people behind to get them to fall in line with the regime.

UgwF3PusLURy9bYsKgJ4AaABAg,"NK: >Starts a war

Braining via media and props sure is powerful ay. poor NKens"
Ugz_oam6hy8k7r7ITpd4AaABAg,"The real reason North Korea hates the USA?

Syngman Rhee. End of story. Nothing like the USA training a Korean politician √çN America, to be pro-American, and then ship him back to Korea to become the leader of the entirety of Korea. Just to have a pro-Western / Pro-USA Korea. Very understandable that a lot of Koreans did not like this idea AT ALL."
UgyInlLU_I0gMIxkJUR4AaABAg,"Hey Johnny, great video! I'm happy to learn the everyday south koreans live their lives free of thinking of a war threat. If you are into (actual) bomb shelters i invite you to a visit to Israel. Every building in israel has a bomb shelter, and buildings built in the last 25 years even has a bomb shelter in EVERY apartment which are fortified rooms with the ability to withstand even chemical weapons. There are also public shelters in every city but very common near the border."
Ugxw0N3d0pv6SeKLcbN4AaABAg,"adding on, it wasn‚Äôt the Soviets, rather Pakistan that provided the North Koreans with Nuclear technology"
UgzmzGv54mjNg2YTcM14AaABAg,They were never been friends they were just like 'ok first we deal with bigger fish and then u'. Enemy of enemy is kind of a frnd.

With those wide avenues, but no cars, huge airport, but mostly closed, the deepest subway just for the sake of it, all for show while the true people are hidden in the countryside away from the tourists view"
UgxvpMSdIT-IjAnHI_Z4AaABAg,the americans and the soviets never were friends defenitely when the soviet union invaded poland in 1939

Ugx0vC6nnCFWsmIuASJ4AaABAg,"South Korea is already advanced to a very consuming society. Young generation don't care about things much except their carriers, so what do you expect to hearing from them?  And you guy so underestimate the foundation of Kim regime is raising fear to grip on power in North Korea. They will escalate things if they are not getting enough attention. What a silly argument to say it's because the past War, that the regime escalate thing to protect North Korea as a country. You are really the mouthpiece of Kim Jong Un. Silly American boy, you will never understanding the way of Asia history!"
UgyonvLA_HnNdMSv1CJ4AaABAg,An absolute masterpiece. You stayed neutral bud. That's the best part.. And you presented the truth.. Not any propaganda. Very difficult to find people like you who present nothing but the truth. You have my respect mate. Keep up the good work... This 1video was enough for me to subscribe to your channel. I can learn a lot from this page
UgwwalywRqhvQSs7V9Z4AaABAg,"I really love the work you do and the way it translates to video. Every now and then though the tone of a modern American University student that was groomed to dislike the US and to point out its historical faults at every opportunity comes through. With that being said, I cant blame you for being trained by a University. And the US has many historical faults. Just like every country in the history of the world. To fix the bias you could simply just add a quick statement reminding your audience for example to this video.... "" let's not forget that the US turned Korea into dust during the war because Stalin and Jong conspired to dominate with communism and called Americas bluff expecting no retaliation."" And then simply give the quick 60 second history of Communism and the stats of dead people. And simply compare how North Korean life compares to South Korean life today. 

That is just a suggestion from a fellow american that truly does enjoy your work and appreciates the accuracy and truth in your research. Just try a little to sound like you stand for America no matter what before the videos end. It's where you are from and lots of people died during the good and the bad decisions made by our government, just so you and all the rest of us could live the lives we do as free as possible for our individual lifespans. Nobody lives as free and open as we do. Be proud of it. And shine the bad light on communism like it deserves."
Ugz6fjKMJ6zDilCN2_p4AaABAg,Something declassified by Moscow. Must be the truth!  Lol
UgztdMTjOO4VoIQiOdh4AaABAg,"Hey, Mr. Harris I am a big fan of yours. I had a question, Do you think North Korea will attack South Korea if a war breaks out between USA and North Korea? If you think that's a possibility which is more likely then what's your opinion on South Koreas' ignorance about the possible threat?"

Ugyqeo5iAQAj7h8AKa54AaABAg,"Haven‚Äôt watched yet. Will do as I enjoy Johnny‚Äôs reporting. To twist the title around, ‚ÄúNorth Koreans‚Äù hate us so much that they risk life and limb crossing multiple countries to get out of that hell hole. The risks of farting against the regime are horrendous. Can you imagine what a dynamo united Korea would be? Of course, Xi and his thuggish regime would never tolerate a united and democratic nation allied with the US on his border."

UgzuXdGiGdvi_bgQ4L94AaABAg,"Another hit from Johnny. It‚Äôs such a blessing that such highly produced and creative journalism comes at no cost to us. Thank you Johnny!

I found the most interesting aspects to be the absence of fear in S Koreans in nuclear war, that the shelters aren‚Äôt really shelters and that such a high number like 85% of buildings were destroyed.. that‚Äôs an unfathomable amount of damage."

Ugzrc35IB8lZeiUHLhR4AaABAg,"We are linear thinkers and there is an art to persuing a line of reasoning...taking aspects of data, polishing them, and weaving them together like a string of pearls.  You are an artist John, but there are always more than a single perspective to defend.  The polarization between the north and south is perpetuated by the north also as a means of empowering and consolidating wealth among a closed class of individuals in the north!  They have used the ideological premise as a context for enslaving the majority of the population to service their needs.  This ""favored class"" works to protect their exclusive access to the goods and services provided by endenturing the population which they could not do if they did not have the background of a fifedom.  And the fifedom needs a reason to maintain their castle and the surrounding moat that is more noble and intellectually defensible than providing wealth to a few."
UgzpuyHmgAXWaF3mKDR4AaABAg,"We see similarities everywhere in the world, as Greek I learned in school bad things that turkey did in the past and when I went to turkey I saw that they teach the bad this GS Greeks did to them in the past and of course in both countries kids marching and visiting museums with this kind of images, one in particular I saw in turkey is a priest holding a cross leading the Greek troops and killing only women and children. It‚Äôs so sad that our races keeps holding in the past and politic propaganda"

(also i saw a bomb shelter at a school which literally is a tin roof on four poles with the 'shelter' sign)
thank you for the informative video!"
UgxYUKxE3uQa5Usu4LN4AaABAg,Man this kinda reminding me of borders from vox
UgxKVvJjJlMtS9JVEE14AaABAg,Sanctions have the opposite intended effect. All they do is unite the North Korean people and make the DPRK more determined to proceed with its nuclear arsenal and missile program.

UgxGEWIVLj-IQvcjK-R4AaABAg,"As a Finn, I'd say a funny follow-up video for this one would be about analysing the winter war and continuation war and their effects on finnish society, since our whole present day infrastucture is built around the idea of the russians invading again.

UgwlR-jM_1mvG_JrrzB4AaABAg,"You have to minimize the threat so you are be able to live a normal life with it over your head. It is normalcy of an unusual exceptional circumstance. Other coubtries do not live with this constant daily threat. This is why you think others overemphasize this. Your habit has already mitigated the shock. The people has grown numb to it, until it really happens.
Its like in Ukraine since 2014, it citizen were used to live with the constant threat of Russia invasion. I recalled reporters surveying Kyiv citizen about their belief of wether or not Russia will invade. Many believe that Putin was merely posturing and he wouldn't do it. Now we all know what happens when society lives into complacency of an impending threat for decades."

UgzwJPjJhgg496a4Stp4AaABAg,It's so sad that North Korea still exists. At this point it's basically a buffer zone between authoritan China & democratic South Korea. It would be easy for an American president to apologize for the Korean War to Kim Jong-un. But I doubt that would change much. Kim Jon-un legitimacy depends on him threatening the world with nukes and I bet Xi Jingping would not happy to share Chinas border with another democracy.
UgwR_8y_LwfK1PKtGNx4AaABAg,"It would be good to say that S Korea is now one of the richest and more developed countries in the world, just surpassing Japan in terms of GDP per capita, while N Korea is exactly the opposite, one of the poorest countries in the world, constantly plagued by famine and disease. And all of this happened in just 50 years."
UgwkQF-lPcNn2aP8g9h4AaABAg,"If not for the crushing sanctions we have on North Korea most of the suffering and famine would not exist. Think about that... Do you think Kim Jong-un ever goes to sleep hungry or is in danger of freezing to death because of our sanctions? This Thanksgiving when you have eaten so much your belly hurts I want you to know they are eating dirt and grass in North Korea because of the suffocating sanctions we the USA places on them. 
How many more decades are we going to do this? Why can't we end the sanctions that clearly don't work and let them trade freely if for no other reason just to see what would happen? I'll tell you why... Because we really don't give a ratsass about the North Korean people it's all just a big game!   

As long as we have people on this planet that have to eat dirt and grass because of what we are doing to them none of us have any right to eat at all. This needs to end and it needs to END NOW !!@!!!@@~!"
UgzOTShYuzghBIay-xp4AaABAg,"Okay Johnny. I did not like your video. You prefaced it by throwing doubt on mainstream media and education as though, as your title suggests, they're not telling us the ""real reason"" that North Korean hates the United States. 

You don't need a master's degree to pick up a history book and read about the Korean War. While it is good to get primary sources (such as telegrams), I don't see why I should trust your analysis (there was little of it in this video) anymore than a mainstream expert or professor. Your video's thesis seems to be that NK hates the US because the US leveled' most of North Korea. And? All bullies whine when they pick on someone, then get knocked out. There doesn't seem to be anything new here.

From my perspective, it looks like you took a vacation in South Korean, and funded it with this video. Efficient, I suppose. However, I don't laud you for it."

Ugw4nflGOjQIXp8ocpl4AaABAg,"Talk about brainwashing.

In the principle of looking back, North Korean leaders stop short of looking back on who started the provocation.
North Korea's Kim Il Sung, with USSR's Stalin, and China's Mao.
They started the war, which the UN, at the initiative of the USA only defended, and pushed back against the aggressors, the communists.

Talk about revisionist history that the communists propagate.

It didn't help that original documents furnished by the former USSR exposed the hypocrisy of the communists. They will keep on lying and revising history to justify their aggression against their own people."

UgwrD7CoWEtsE2cf2Bp4AaABAg,"Another fascinating and artistically edited video from Johnny about a topic that I‚Äôve never really researched. It makes me realise the problem with ‚Äúlearning‚Äù history. On the one hand it should warn us of past mistakes and help us avoid repeating them. On the other hand, it shows how obsession with the past can trap us into crippling policies and viewpoints. 
So many current conflicts, political redlines and cultural arguments are often sustained by things that happened decades or even hundreds of years ago but, hold no real relevance to the current problems that need to be solved."

You can ask north koreans to forget US genocides if there is even a tiny minuscule evidence that US regime has changed even the slighted possible from the massive crimes it did. Now US is unable to continue genocides there, if it could it would definitely do. The monarchs in US and their policies had been 100% fixed from 1944 till today and almost 90% fixed from the time the fake nation was made. Why should any people on the earth who lost their loved ones to US genocides forget that while US regime has not changed at all! You can't blame russia for the crimes USSR did because they almost completely changed. The question is ""has US had even 0.00001% change from 1944 till today in its hierarchy of power and policies toward the world?"" Guess what! NOPE! The only way to defend yourself is to be able to threaten US land directly just like how US directly threatens the earth with its weapons constantly."

But like you said, we koreans think if north korea attack with all those artilleries and missiles to us, we don't have enough defense system to protect Seoul. Actually it is not technically possible.
So we do rather think that North Korea won't attack us if Kim Jong Un doesn't go completely insane. But if they attack us, we have a firm idea that we will completely destroy and demolish all the North Korean territory. Since all man in korea goes to the military, we are aware of the threats of North Korea very well, and we are prepared for a war. But you know, modern life is competitive and harsh. We can't just worry about North Korea 24/7 when we are already busy with our daily life.

UgyOKbyhFE0QBGwYbrZ4AaABAg,"The shelters you emphasized actually have practical functions. They are underground, have multiple outlets to the outside, and are huge enough to accommodate Seoul citizens. Although they may not seem to be ""perfect"" as shelters, it may be too expensive to build so in a country thriving to be in top 10 GDP rank. 
It would be interesting too to see how apartments in Seoul are designed to turn quickly into military bases! (made up of concrete matters which don't easily fall, windows facing north are smaller than those facing south, etc.)

UgyOKbyhFE0QBGwYbrZ4AaABAg.9hTi-nM9MEx9hW_0IVzJLY,"We have the same ideology with civil defense shelters in Finland's major cities, especially Helsinki. Most underground shelters are in constant use as sporting halls, public swimming pools, metro stations and whatnot, and can be converted into fully functional shelters for thousands of people within 72 hours. Apartment buildings in Helsinki also have their basements built as shelters with the required equipment, and are mostly used as storage spaces when not used for their shelter purpose. They're mostly a relic of the Cold War, though now they're under a renewed interest for obvious reasons, and a lot of communities are pushing money into making sure the shelters are in a workable condition.

It's very interesting to see that the South Korean shelters are so similar to what we have over here."
UgyOKbyhFE0QBGwYbrZ4AaABAg.9hTi-nM9MEx9hVn71KGGID,"Also those shelters have purpose not only in the case of bombardments but in natural disasters such as earthquake, typhoon, fire, etc. As a Korean citizen, I noticed that I never thought these shelters to be a bomb shelters rather than shelters for disasters.

UgyLwU1xt9XT2uql8Od4AaABAg,I wanna see the other side of the DMZ. Western media tend to treat people there as dumb and compliment but propaganda is rarely true. What does the average north korean think of the war?
UgxCfwSq98naMSZosGV4AaABAg,"Well... Your mistake was in speaking to mostly women. Men in South Korea are still conscripted into their military and the ROK Army is no joke. It is a perspective altering experience for any man that goes through it and unless you're a woman, sick, or rich so your parents can buy your way into the KATUSA program you're going to experience the brutality of military expectations from a country very much aware of its precarious security situation from the North. I also find it interesting you did not mention at all that North Korea was utterly and soundly defeated by US and South Korean forces and North Korea as a nation would not even exist if China had not poured soldiers into the war costing even more lives on all sides."

UgzU-b5IyJAICtb5i954AaABAg,"Typically I really like Johnny's video's and think he does a good job of taking a balanced approach.  In this one, however, he seems to be really skewing his viewpoint in a pro North Korean and anti-US fashion.  He spells out and establishes that North Korea and Stalin (one of history's biggest mass murders and most odious humans of all time) conspired to attack and conquer South Korea.  Then, he inexplicably frames the defensive response as just one from the US rather than from a United Nations coalition responding to a UN mandate which encouraged UN nations to lend support to South Korea in order to resist Northern aggression.  He goes on to focus so much on aerial bombardment and how terrible it was for North Korea, painting them as a victim of unreasonable force rather than a nation reaping what it had sown in nakedly attacking its neighbor.  Is he next going to paint Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan as victims in World War II since they were also very heavily bombed?  This smacks of reflexive ""USA bad, other nations good"" thinking."
UgzU-b5IyJAICtb5i954AaABAg.9hTb2Rv3u-d9hTozFijZEj,You know citizens of an aggressive country can still be victims of war
UgwUv3Ql8sMX0VV4G494AaABAg,"Now I know why North Koreans really hated the Americans until now. In the first place, Americans are always right. In terms of military tho. No war will happen between North and South Korea if Kim Il-sung didn't forcefully invaded South Korea."

It is true that North Korea occasionally provokes the South by launching missiles or conducting nuclear tests, but that is merely to show off their military capabilities.

Ugy2Mow4a9dkWh-48xN4AaABAg,@johnny harris I'm saddened by this video. In particular how you left it. Leaving out how many times over the last 30 years the South Korean government has reached out to the North Koreans to do exactly what you said should be done. And how the North Koreans rebuffed them. It is faintly possible that a corrupt North Korean Dictatorship uses the facts of American war atrocities as an excuse to perpetuate a criminal regime that is more oppressive than anything the US has done.
UgyHrHON1QAiP1s99st4AaABAg,"American here, I was stationed in South Korea when I was in the military.  

From what I've personally saw and experienced, for the most part your Average Korean doesn't think about going to war with North Korea, because they don't have to. They never really had to experience or feel it in their daily lives so they never really felt the need to be concerned about it. It's kinda like the feeling of being secure because your big brother is there and they will protect you and you know you will be safe.

People don't realize this, but I've experienced this first hand, when I was stationed there, we were incredibly close to going to war with North Korea. I was there when the North Koreans sunk the Cheonan and when they bombarded those south Korean islands. And in both instances we were so close to war that if there was a third incident we would have to go to war. 

I was in Field Artillery, so in both instances our battalion commander got the whole battalion together and debriefed us. I still remember what he said to us. ""North Korea did this incident, I don't know if it will be tmrw, next week, next month or even next year. We have a possibility we might have to see combat. So we need to be ready, if that call comes down.""

And for each incident we had to have are Artillery M109a6 Paladins ready in line ready to go for months. Ready to answer the call. 

And I was stationed right near the border so, our priority mission was to evacuate civilians south. And then regroup south of Seoul to be ready to push back north. 

At the Camp I was stationed us soldiers, had a going bet what were our survival chances. We estimated it was about 30mins. Because our camp is one of the primary targets of the north Korean Artillery. 

Those, in the States only had to be concerned about what the media would spew, when north Korea would use Nuclear weapon tests to get what they wanted. 

When you are in the military stationed there we had to be more concerned about the tangible stuff. 

So the reason why I believe that most south Koreans are not that concerned is because they don't have to, and it's our job to be concerned so they can live carefree."

Most of the places labelled as shelters in Seoul and other parts of South Korea are woefully unequipped and are often not big enough to take in the population they are supposed to protect. The basic issue of course is that no one thinks they will actually be needed, so nothing has really been done to make sure they can protect the population in case of an actual invasion. It's funny that some foreign guidebooks point to the existence of this vast network of shelters as proof of how prepared South Korea is for an attack from the North."

UgwZ5rnOzc9SatfzmPl4AaABAg.9hTI5QcNHs59hTMEwK1Gpy,"@John John It did, but it's worth remembering that the South, at the time, was run by a corrupt dictator who was economically and militarily weak. Kim Il Sung invaded on the pretense of reunifying Korea for the first time since Japan occupied it (a big personal goal for him see he was a freedom fighter against the Japanese prior to the end of WW2) and with the understanding the war would be over in a matter of weeks... and it would've been, if the US didn't intervene. 

US likes to claim that it's intervention are to ""protect freedom and democracy"" but that's pretty much never the real reason. It certainly wasn't in the case of Korea... both sides were led by dictators, and though its spliting hairs, the North arguably had the more competent and invested one. Instead the US intervened to preserve its own regional power, maintain a platform from which to threaten the PRC and Soviet Vladivostok, and in the hope they could take the whole peninsula to enhance that threat. Stupid, power based, ""sphere of influence"" war.

It is often believed by historians these days that if the US had simply stayed out of it, the new United Korea under Kim Il Sung wouldn't have become the dynastic, nuke heavy, militaristic state of today. Instead it would've, it's thought, without sanctions and belligerence, become quite wealthy and essentially been another China... authoritarian, but diplomatic and with a highly educated and relatively wealthy populace. Instead only half of Korea got that... and the other half got bombed into oblivion, held on to dear life with Chinese backing, turned ultra-militarist and then nuclear in the interest of self preservation, and became fertile breeding ground for a hostile cult of personality. Hindsight..."

UgzQgM5EPyMSixeuIsV4AaABAg,"The end of your video is totally fucked up.  First off, there was only one outside power, us, who created that situation.  You said it yourself, the North was the one who initiated.  And second, the most egregious in the end of your video is your mention of us being afraid.  I am not afraid.  Mine is a state of pity for the 10 million people(combined) of Seoul and Incheon, who find themselves in the obvious path of destruction, who find themselves the target of an insane regime, who frequently threatens to literally destroy them, because we maintain(ed) the peace.

I mean, what is there for us to be afraid of?  Nuclear war?  Please, son.  I have lived my entire 43 years of life, since birth to present, under the constant threat of nuclear annihilation.  The constant threat of nuclear annihilation is as natural to me as breathing is.  In fact, I would be someone else entirely if it were not for the constant threat of nuclear annihilation; if I would even exist at all.  And if somehow that burden was lifted, I would struggle to redefine myself, because it is a part of me, a part of who I am.  I have no right to be afraid of nuclear war, it is part of my existence.\

And by the look of you, you don't appear to be older than 73 years.  So the same is true for you too."

UgyjQo_eU_7DdRu3On14AaABAg,"WRONG!  The big breakup was about the development of nuclear weapons...  Russia had been a ""tentative"" ally to the US during WW2.  We gave them some vehicles and equipment with a lend-lease program while the war was going, but relations quickly soured with the takeover of Germany.  Every General in the war knew what it was.  Russia tested their first nuke in 1949... not 1963...  Also, the invasion into the South was NOT the beginning of the Cold War... in fact... that was technically a hot proxy war.  The Cold War is defined by the buildup of nuclear weapons and conventional weapons that were never used.  This video gets a lot right, but seems to get as much wrong.   ~~~ Another note... Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons humans possess, but the deadliest weapons are biological.  Biological weapons can be indiscriminate or highly modified to attack a certain genetic population (thanks CRISPR!)"

UgzWBZVh8nnJwstwB6p4AaABAg,"My grandfather served in the Korean War. I remember talking with him a few years before he died - in 2011 - about his service and about his thoughts on the state of things between the United States and North Korea. While he held no guilt over his service and remained convinced that we were justified at the time and North Korea was just a sore loser, he made a similar observation to the one you do here about how North Korean policy since the war has been based on keeping the trauma of that conflict and the determination for vengeance alive, if only for the Kim regime to maintain their stranglehold on power in the country.

As an American, it would be easy for me to have the same cavalier attitude as my grandfather, who believed that their grudge against the United States has made hostages of their people and poisoned their reputation on the world stage. However, as someone with C-PTSD, I can understand the influence of their traumatic and troubled history with the United States and the urge to protect themselves from a repeat of such trauma by projecting an unwavering and adversarial strongman image."
UgzWBZVh8nnJwstwB6p4AaABAg.9hSsbzZoUnu9hYiIR0tpEG,"@Robert Tracyit might not hold true for the general population of North Korea, but it's certainly a valid motive behind the actions of its leadership, especially considering the leader of the country is the grand son of the man who had gotten into bed with Russia to shore up his own position. As for America, I think we had some valid reasons for doing what we did but bringing Mickey Mouse and Coca Cola to the south does not make us any sort of hero. North Korea and our other Cold War shenanigans will continue to have ramifications, the same as it has because of NAFTA/CAFCA, School of the Americas, and the Drug War in South America, the same as our fight with Russia over Afghanistan and our bullshit in Iran and Iraq sewed the seeds of 9/11 and the current situation in the Middle East.

Again, perhaps we were right to go into Korea, but, right or wrong, our acts have had consequences."
UgzWBZVh8nnJwstwB6p4AaABAg.9hSsbzZoUnu9hTf67dl4oM,"There's a vanishingly small percentage of either population that remembers the actual war (my grandfather was a Marine in the Korean War and he passed some time ago) and as a US Army soldier stationed there myself in the late 80's it was the older generation that remembered the war that greatest us the kindest and the younger folks who believed we were keeping them from their North Korean Brothers that were overtly hostile. That said I gave more than one Korean soldier the opportunity to join their north Korean brothers while on patrol with them in the DMZ and each time they would get angry at me for mocking their desire to join their brothers but none of them ever walked over the wire. They want to rejoin North Korea, but they also want the freedom, luxuries, lifestyle, and security that America bought for them in blood and they know very well that the day US forces departed from Korean soil would be a day followed by a day of war and northern invasion even if they don't want to admit it."

UgxSeVlvcjZVdC0KbcN4AaABAg,"It's a Stalinist state with extra fascist elements baked in and armed with nuclear weapons, we've seen it before in other areas of the world. Kim is not a major risk to world peace. Does he have the capability to go to war? Sure. Would he go to war? No, almost definitely no. Not unless he was dragged into one by probably requiring both the Chinese and the Russians. Otherwise, if it was one or the other he could wiggle out of it using the other. If He was to launch a war otherwise he would lose international support from his main benefactors (the Chinese and the Russians), risk regime change, and if he did make good on his nuclear threats most likely death or becoming a ruler of a depopulated wasteland with none of the wealth and political power his family had previously enjoyed. Even if he didn't care at all about his people, although I think he does to some extent, it still would not make sense."

Ugw-cyJ1Y0wwnr7-wnx4AaABAg,"I love your excellent work. Interesting stuff this video. What I do see and can comment, as a Mexican, is that US people are so oblivious to the realities of their world, even their own country, not like we score better here, but we are more aware of the evils of power struggles in the world than those US citizens who may think the US actions abroad are justified and always with a good intention, no massacres, no war crimes, no crimes against humanity. You should cover the Mexican-US drug conflict, how the US and MX governments have perpetuated the drug against drugs. Something that catches my attention is that I hardly ever hear of any drug cartels in the US... who controls drugs there? No druglords like in Latin America? I hardly believe that.

Ugz2VfOZQFmfvJvxkwV4AaABAg,"Odd parallel there between the North Korean communists brainwashing their children with visual depictions of violent events from 80 years ago in order to keep the hate alive and justify their regime's existence, and the whole slavery/white supremacy narrative of 170 years ago deployed by American progressives to keep Blacks angry and resentful and in the Democratic column. Pretty clearly the same thing."

UgzPG8C4oIZaxt2yGsl4AaABAg,"Many long-living international conflicts started like this.

Powerful countries try to control small countries in their on different ways.
Local people really hate it but powerful country don't care.
And as this hatred continues, it transitions into hatred between local people.
This conflict never ends, because local people don't really understand why and who started this chain of hatred.
And now powerful countries just want this problems go away."
UgxwggE706aDKFbJWgJ4AaABAg,"You neglected to mention that there is a significant difference between the two political systems. North Korea still has concentration camps, attempts to kill defectors, and routinely executes its citizens to keep the Kim family in power and unopposed."

UgzbkkovLUX-5fAlcVd4AaABAg,"And now we see criticism to Russia for applying similar tactics (or planning to) against Ukraine. The criticism is of course just but the usual hypocrisy is unbearable. South Korea seems to have adopted that by naming regular city spots as ""bomb shelters""."
UgxTztclw8n-8yVhwi94AaABAg,"Well, I guess that does it.  We (the USA) can leave now.  We're not needed as the South Koreans don't need us there anymore. 

To be honest, I was trying to wrap my head around this willful ignorance of what was sitting across the border pointing at them.  Once North Korea decided to start shelling, the death toll would be enormous. Tens of thousands of dead South Korean citizens in probably the first 48 hours alone.  

I thought the North Koreans were brainwashed. Now I know the South Koreans are too. If you doubt me, just ask a Ukrainian.

And the same can be said for Taiwan too.  I had a friend who lived there for several years.  He said a Chinese attack never entered anyone's mind."

UgzOW-BxsjLUIFc90ot4AaABAg,"The Japanese and pretty much all of Europe forgot and forgave America and Britian for dropping bombs all over there continent. They forgot and forgave us! The North Koreans don't forget because their leaders won't let them. They use it to control them! Looking at South Korea from the sociological view, they have to live their lives. The have a social dissociative amnesia to just live their lives. If they didn't they couldn't operate. Almost everyone there has delt with it their whole lives so it's normal for them. But to Americans that sounds so scary and concerning because we haven't lived like that. If Canada and Mexico ware communist hermit kingdoms with nuclear weapons we would feel the same. And people in Australia would be more worried and anxious about us then we would be. Johnny's production value is so high that we think everything he is saying is amazing. But sometimes his opinions are not as deep and revolutionary as we give him credit for. Honestly, it's not great video journalism. Watch Frontline and DW Documentaries to see how it is really done."

Ugw8dNx8ggO7qe9A0yx4AaABAg,"This reminds me of an NPR podcast episode (that I can't quite recall, and google doesn't seem to find) concerning China's view of their own history and centering humiliation as the emotion to emphasize concerning interactions with western powers. 

Narratives have an incredible driving force, and being able to point to the foreign enemy that did so much damage has been one of the factors the North Korean regime uses to continue to inflict so much suffering on its general populace. 

The other deep problem in the region, more than the vestiges of the cold war, is that the ruling class of NK has the tiger by the tail. It's truly remarkable what the Soviets managed to hold together in the wake of Stalin's death, and even more remarkable what China did after Mao. I seriously doubt that NK has enough momentum to gradually unwind what they have in place, and that when cracks break through, I worry that the collapse will be catastrophic."

run FATF today pakistan cleared from gray list by FATF. do North Korea send terrorists????? do they shelter terrorists in North Korea????? they are in black list and under sanction because 
US want and NK threaten USA. Simple US do not care about terrorism they care about themselves and around the world US going policing everyone that world should support them why???
if US do not care about terrorism, if US do not put those countries under sanction on in blacklist who spread terrorism and kill common people in other countries, why anyone should

UgzZw5A92CK3kXyevhF4AaABAg,I would like to speak my heart in this I think the US and NATO are doing the same thing with Ukraine and Russia just like they did in the Middle East and Asia they don't think about the people they just think about their own political gain I guess videos of people died I myself from Syria have witnessed all the horror and the bad things they do I'm not saying that all the people are good and not all the people are about I'm just saying that these things can be easily resolved without Millions hope people dying and million suffering I hope this world will see a better future a future where no one will suffer

North Korea rebuilt their ENTIRE country and have achieved admirable things dispite a trade blockade by the entire world for decades.

Also, I find it interesting the way that he talks about the museum. Do children and field trips not go to holocaust museum across the western world?  Is it really so bizarre to learn about the history of your own country.

They were allies of mutual convenience during WWII.  The USSR never forgot the United Kingdom and USA send combat troops into the USSR in 1918-1919 to defeat the USSR.  The photo of your father smiling: as a Russian once told me, ‚ÄúPeople are people, governments are business.‚Äù  Just because ‚Äúworker bees‚Äù get along great but politicians stoke ideological issues.  Next, I served in the DMZ in the Autumn of 1981 and along the DMZ in Spring of 1986.  Next to combat, there was nothing like conducting foot patrols at night in the DMZ.  Next, anywhere I went in the Republic of Korea (RoK)üá∞üá∑ in the early 1980s the people were always appreciative of my service there.  To really appreciate the PEOPles‚Äô Democratic Republic of Korea (PDRK)üá∞üáµ you need to go there and our contacts in the Swiss and Swedish tell us it is not worth your time.

Why can‚Äôt North Korean government just move on from the hate and allow their people daily food, warm housing, health care, and the basic ability to live happy and fulfilling lives?"
UgwJKVshWDxB7gGc0RZ4AaABAg,"Korean, born and raised as well. Just a quick note; while a lot of apartments and underground garages listed as bomb shelters are in fact inadequate, subway stations are the safest and the most well-prepared bomb shelters in South Korea (and especially in Seoul) despite their appearance. In fact, during their construction and planning, these subway stations and lines were designed to inherently contain basic infrastructure and facilities necessary for a large bomb shelter; this included large tanks of drinkable water, ability to store food, a back-up generator for electricity, and quick access from multiple points of entry and exit. To this day, you can easily find gas masks in red boxes throughout subway stations in Korea as a mark of how they are prepared to be used as bomb shelters should it come to that. In terms of the depth, most NK weapon system uses HE (High explosive) rounds, which while cause a lot of boom, it doesn't really affect the people as long as they are underground. So despite the shallow depth of the subway stations on the outset, they are more than deep enough to shield people from NK rounds should the war begin. It's also noteworthy that many stations are multi-layered with different lines, and people can move further underground should that be necessary. 

Another aspect to consider are the skyscrapers and apartments. A lot of modern apartments (especially the ones near the border in North Korea) are built to withstand most high explosive rounds. While up-close and consistent bombardment may be able to demolish an apartment, long range bombardments with traditional high explosive rounds (which is what North Korea has mostly) from wildly inaccurate and outdated weapon systems will not be able to bring down these buildings, let alone the entire city of Seoul. With that in mind, a lot of these rounds will get ""caught"" by the net of buildings, and will not cause extensive casualties after the first hour of an attack on the ground level. People in the building may have less luck, but those on the ground are safer than one may think (though they should quickly move to a bomb shelter to be absolutely sure). 

Final note we have to consider is that US, Japan, and Korea have considerable surveillance on North Korea, especially using satellites, and it will be impossible for North Korea to actually launch a large scale attack without US warning months before. Think about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the US warning that came before it. Any large scale military assault requires months of preparation, and in this day and age, it is impossible to launch a true large-scale surprise attack. In other words, people will be prepared by either evacuating from border areas or working from areas closer to the bomb shelters way before the actual attack to begin."
Ugy8CDjdM1DsF_N0W2x4AaABAg,It really stinks that Johnny just glosses over the genocide that happened to the North Korean people and just calls it a memory instead of the genocide that it actually was. Imagine if we called the Holocaust a simple memory and not the genocide that it actually was.

Ugy8zcj6c3cuTzTKJ5x4AaABAg,"Can't disagree more. I think what you are doing not a first time in your channel is quite dangerous by distributing such personal opinion, that is based on poor literacy and analysis, to millions of subscribers. Presenting the country where you were born as an evil which at the same time provides you possibility to criticize them and express yourself freely is quite stupid. On the other hand if you were born in a communist country you like North Korea or Russia, the only thing you could say freely is ""God bless the leader!"" :-) Not to mention, that any information distributed by communists to their own population is a propaganda (truth + lie = lie) to promote their supremacy over other countries. And if any democracy like USA can admit their own mistakes, apologize and take responsibility for their actions, then communists, authoritarian regimes will never do it."

Ugzcf5j43H6J0-aQsXx4AaABAg,"yeah, korea only has to be wary of the dangerous and oppresive regime on the other half of the peninsula and not the one that actually controlls them and would sacrafice them for money/ambitions, hegemony or national security."
UgzucLNx2hh8WRHmmxF4AaABAg,"South Koreans rarely think about the North, even with the recent escalation of ballistic missile tests, it is just a passing thought. The state of the economy, rising inflation and interest rates are more on the minds of the locals than anything else. 

The ones that do ponder about the situation with the North, they reckon Japan is in more danger of being annihilated before the South is. What Johnny forgot to mention is that there is just as much lingering resentment about 35 years of Imperial Japanese annexation as there is about the Americans and the Korean War. Hence those missile tests are more often conducted over the Japanese archipelago and into the Pacific than into the East Sea (Sea of Japan)."

UgxwqrKrMiOgDtt9s_J4AaABAg,"Nothing about that awful war has to do with the tyrannical nature of North Korea. I get the resentment, it makes sense, but it does not justify their goverment's behavior; neither the hate towards their neighbors in the south."
UgxBwrrcPF_Vx-vR74R4AaABAg,The internet without it we would be brainwashed
Ugz7KiAO2vAWjgOozxx4AaABAg,"South Korea, Japan and Germany are probably our greatest contributions to Freedom and Democracy in the world effected by military strength. Our other efforts in other places since have had mixed results. Most people (I grew up and lived under the Cold War) have no idea our decades long arch enemy was an ally in WWII. I understand FDR's use of them to crush from the east the Nazi war machine. But Russia would have been crushed by the Nazis if not for US aid, tanks, fuel food etc. Many top Russian generals of then admitted that. but Russia was a completely duplicitous and destructive ally. They stole the Bomb from us along with many other inventions. Like China they are a nation built on stolen American Tech. When The USSR collapsed we even sent help to Russia then and I KNEW they would learn just enough capitalism to be a problem again and here we are. Again, done with a lot of US and corporate funding.  Anyway we also sent American military to help the Chinese fight off the Japanese occupation and destruction of their lands and they repaid that by going communist and becoming a HUGE adversary. We would have won the Korean war and unified the country if not for Soviet supported China streaming into NK at the last moment. If we had been smart at end of WWII we should have turned the Germans eastwards and crushed the Soviets before they could bring down the Iron Curtain. Same thing in the Pacific, we should have left the Japanese boot on the neck of China and maybe ALL of these places would be the free Capitalist success stories today that Japan and Germany turned out to be. Hindsight being 2020.  Now we have China declaring they will crush us and rule the world. How that could have been SO different. Even in the last 30-40 years if our DC class had not seen the chance to suck up and make bucks off the CCP.  Good Vid Johnny. I always wondered why they taught every school kid so virulently to ""crush the skulls of the American bastards!"".  I mean active hate is one thing but that is just ridiculous. Their museum displays of destroyed 1950s US Army equipment and all."

UgxSZaNH8cPTMqyAbM94AaABAg,I think the most interesting aspect of the Korean War to me was the incident which led to the intervention from China. I don‚Äôt think people realize that China and America fought each other in a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù conflict
UgxSZaNH8cPTMqyAbM94AaABAg.9hSM_ypS1bx9hTJxmskRFa,"There's a book from the 1980s about the sneaky Chinese intervention, some of the Chinese military leaders involved were interviewed. The book is ""Enter the Dragon"". (the title is similar to Bruce Lee's 1973 kung fu movie ha ha ha)"
Ugxpj3GjbMBZnRPye_p4AaABAg,"It was right on the discovery channel on Korean war where it said Seung man kept asking US to srart war. Both knew war could come. But without war SeungMan and US knew that Kim Il Sung is gonna take over. Kim,Gu, who was the only hope to avoid war was assassinated by US agent."
UgxtzGS6NuB1xfpberV4AaABAg,The saddest thing was North Korea started the bloody war to save Koreans in south from horrible US military occupation.
UgxanlkAzkRDTAO6oiN4AaABAg,"what i don't understand is what you trying to communicate here. why north Korea hate united states. that is obvious. United State is in the way of the north forcefully taking over the South. SIMPLE. Just a reminder once Stalin died and Kruchov took over, the soviet moved on from North Korea (other than supporting it militarily).   But you forgot to communicate, this is not a total nation hate of the United State it is the ruling party of North Korea that hate the United States for the sheer fact that United State is in the way. the reason the S. Korean People are oblivious in your video is because the North Can't repeat their actions ever again."
UgzfO3JwiD2lYGFCrQp4AaABAg,"something also that happened in the Korean war between the Chinese and Americans is called ""man vs steel"". it was the largest continuous artillery barrage in history. an American general planned it to show the Chinese that they were stronger despite being outnumbered. the length of the barrage wasn't long, I think around 24h hours but resulted in 35 thousands deaths among the Chinese. just imagine the size of it to be this lethal in such short time. 

I always wanted to read about in more details but I couldn't find any resources unfortunately. I only saw it mentioned in the documentary about the war."
UgzfO3JwiD2lYGFCrQp4AaABAg.9hSMEiMx5AA9hTOgR9h9U9,"@Hamood Gr√ºnstein yeah I'm not debating any of that. what I'm saying is while weak in terms of fire power, they had enough to make them a formidable foe. McArthur was removed from his position because he wanted a war with them. sometimes stamina beats firepower and that was the case here in a way."
UgzfO3JwiD2lYGFCrQp4AaABAg.9hSMEiMx5AA9hTNgfbgPrW,"@chawki challadia Also, an anecdote from Vietnamese soldiers who fought the Chinese in 1979: ""The white men (the French and the Americans) duck immediately when attacked, and would not dare to move an inch. The Chinese would instead charge at us with absolutely no fear.""That pretty much summarizes the difference."
UgzfO3JwiD2lYGFCrQp4AaABAg.9hSMEiMx5AA9hTNP1YMW_n,"@chawki challadia They had a severe shortage of basic equipments and food, all this while under constant US reconnaissance and bombardment from the air. They were severely outgunned and had no sea-control or air-control. They had to hide in plain, barren mountains in harsh winters, without enough clothing. The Americans were also highly mobile, relying on motorized vehicles and helicopters, while the North Korean side had very limited number of vehicles and no helicopters. They were essentially lightly-armed infantry. The Soviet supply was far from enough, and China had to supplement it with self-made weapons. The weapons they seized during the Civil War was mostly 19th and early 20th century stuff from warlords and some Japanese-made stuff that didn't really match US military. The Chinese and North Koreans were incredible in their perseverance, holding off a full attack from the military superpower for years. If you put the Americans in their position, they would have surrendered within months if not days."
UgzfO3JwiD2lYGFCrQp4AaABAg.9hSMEiMx5AA9hTMI9uCPOf,"@Hamood Gr√ºnstein I double checked the documentary. ""man vs steel"" was the name of the approach, the barrage itself was called ""van heimen load"" (at least, it was the name of general and it was too hard for my brain lol)
also while china was 3rd world, it had all sorts of Soviet weapons provided during the civil war and in preparation for the war. also the Chinese only lacked longevity in the war otherwise they could've won in their first offensive."
UgzfO3JwiD2lYGFCrQp4AaABAg.9hSMEiMx5AA9hTJLtDE8G1,"Of course, the US was the military superpower supported by a powerful industrial capitalism, and China was a non-industrialized Third Word country that barely had any weapon. North Korea and China were climbing up a very steep hill."

UgynkEx4VwjUpcKVyuF4AaABAg,"Fat thumbed my way to this video when trying to comment on your ""Why I Will Never Use the Metric System"" video.  Stayed because you covered some really interesting stuff.  I come from a former Canadian soldier background, who's regiment fought in Korea (so was part of our regimental history classes, and my kids have had Korean War songs sung to them to sooth them through tears), and used to here about N Korea in threat breifings.   No pollitics in the breifs, just ""N Korea has aprox this many artillery, this many tanks, and this many special operations soldiers.  Their tanks have the following capabilities...""

UgxZAs1LH5HAv8xv6394AaABAg,Not to say they will never drop bombs to SK but the bombs aren‚Äôt to show strength. It shows insecurity and anxiety. It‚Äôs not that they will drop the bombs as an attack but only if they get threatened by an attack. Which will not happen anytime soon.

UgzXfsA4HTf_yoxBZsR4AaABAg,"It was quite hilarious when Johnny was looking for shelters in Seoul. I have seen those shelter signs in Seoul, but never really thought that they were meant for ""War"". 

And also, I was surprised to see all SK interviewers seemed zero caring about Wars. Granted, English speakers are quite young, but I gotta say I care about the threats from North Korea and especially When Trump was the president of U.S. and that put more than five thousand SKs gathered in Gwangwhamoon, Seoul, for ""Peace-in-Korea Rally"". I am pretty sure those SK interviewers didn't participate that rally. 

One last thing, 
 I wish you could've tried to interview  North Korean defectors and hear their side of horrible stories growing up in NK and their inputs on U.S. It might be interesting to see their way of education looking at the world or they don't really care other than living on a crumb on daily basis."

Ugzdhpk4fJ0Hsc0Ro294AaABAg,"Love this video! I respect all your findings, but I wouldn‚Äôt equate people being desensitized about North Korean threat to attribute reasons to why NK does what they do. 

I think your summary is clear and great though, SK chose to not live in fear and move ahead, vs NK‚Äôs regime chooses to dwell in the past and oppress their people to do the same.

There is also an interesting dynamic to think about where when I was growing up in Korea in the 2000‚Äôs, there was so much emphasis on reunification and how NK people(not gov) are the brothers. There were also tons of SK elderly who had living family in NK. As most of them have passed away, I think a lot of SK millennials like myself or gen z don‚Äôt care about reunification and don‚Äôt want it to happen due to the stress of taking on a country with really poor economics.

One last thing, I‚Äôm not a semantics guy, but I‚Äôm not sure if I would agree calling Stalin and Kim great leaders @ 8:40."

Why you still mad about 85% of all your relatives being bombed to pieces?"" Thats the same as telling an abuse victim that they should just forget about it and move on... seriously wtf? Also, it wasn't really started by north korea. It was america and the USSR who divided the peninsula in the first place, and when one of them (the USSR) wanted to help the peninsula reunify, America's response was total annihilation... how tf are you gonna sit there with a straight face and say that its north koreas fault? Wtf is wrong with you?"

Ugzzeca1F5bneFx855B4AaABAg,"16:48 Well the same is the case in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) in Vietnam. They have a museum dedicated to the war with a huge emphasis on the atrocities and war crimes committed by the Americans. Even though it's one sided, it's extremely powerful and disturbing.
Still the population nowadays doesn't show any hatred towards Americans as far as I can tell."
Ugz_SCs3p6MMzegOQRF4AaABAg,"The thing that really drove this home for me was realising that the phrase ""bomb them back to the stone age"" was not a hypothetical about nuclear weapons, it was a description of what was actually happening to North Korea. There were factions in the US military that pushed for the use of nuclear weapons, on account of the fact that it was a cheaper way of inflicting the same devastation.
I do feel there are two important misleading statements here though. First is that the USA is at war with NK. They are not, and never have been. Everything they did they did under the flag of the UN. Part of the reason for their continued isolation is that they have the same distrust of the UN as the USA.
Second is the presentation of North Korean ideology as paranoid, and that they would have been fine if they just relaxed a bit. There is an implication there that the USA would not have aggressively pursued regime change if they were less defensive of their ideology. This is demonstrably false. The CIA has a long history of working towards regime change across the world, often with civil war being the result. The USA is openly hostile to them to the point of regularly conducting carrier exercises off their coast using assets of comparable value to the GDP of North Korea. While they are reminded by their leadership that bombing is devastating, it is the USA that regularly reminds them that they are capable of it and willing to do it again.
It is hard to call them paranoid under those circumstances."

Ugw1pNlKc96-E9PNJdd4AaABAg,"It's as much a war between two visions of Korea as it is one between North Korea and the US. To suggest otherwise would be to downplay the agency of the two Koreas, especially South Korea. Many South Koreans are desensitised to the conflict precisely because the North Korean regime threatens armageddon but never follows through with it. The video also does not address how the Korean War and the perennial issue of reunification are major faultlines in the political scene, one that divides conservatives and liberals and shapes South Korea's willingness to engage with the North. No less important is the fact that many South Koreans who lived through and survived the Korean War are still alive today, and this serves as a sort of popular memory that is both sustained and sustains public imagination of the Hermit Kingdom."

UgzX2_LfIht3LEYTOJd4AaABAg,"I haven't watched this video yet, but with such a controversial title I hope you address the ""real reason"". The reason North Korea hates the US is because we bombed them flat in the 1950s; we bombed every building we saw including hospitals and daycares. After they ran out of buildings we bombed the dams which flooded away their crops, destroyed what little arable land they have (it's mostly rocky terrain) and caused a massive famine which killed millions more. That is why they hate us, if I were them I'd hate us too."

UgxdoRUntcEzjCHB9l94AaABAg,"12:56 this is somewhat of a ""random"" comparison. The Pacific theater of WW2 was not as favorable to strategic bombing like Europe was. Japanese industrial and demographic centers were long out of reach of allied bombers, unlike German and Italian cities that were being bombed already in 1942.
I don't have the numbers, I'm too lazy to actually check my following statements and I don't even know if there is any academic research into it but I'd bet that most bombs dropped in the Pacific theater of operation by US aircrafts were dropped in tactical operations, in direct support of military operations on the ground or at sea.

So comparing the quantity of ordinance dropped by the US in Korea to the amount of ordinance dropped  in the Pacific during WW2 feels somewhere senseless?
It would have been far more interesting to compare that to the amount of bombs dropped on Germany since that's the area that suffered the unrestricted wrath of the US air power."

UgzZA6l75ImPxzqNe6J4AaABAg,"From someone with a degree in International Relations and Asian Studies, this video was very well done. A few thoughts.. Kim Il Song was a rebel fighter against the colonial Japanese in the North, before he travelled on foot to ask for Soviet assistance with the Japanese. It was then that the Soviets trained him and Kim Il Song returned with tanks in the North. The North Koreans hated the South Koreans, because the viewed them as Japanese collaborators. So naturally the Soviets being an ally already, and half of their own countrymen being thought of weeds that needed to be pulled up, the U.S. was a natural obstacle to the aim, in the minds of the communists, of restoring the Korean nation and culture. The fear of outsiders stems back centuries from repeated invasions by foreign powers into the Korean peninsula. And after the Japanese annexation, then later the war with the U.S., and as you said air bombardments, the North Koreans especially hate the U.S."

Ugxm-IZqpEI8C0lsgPR4AaABAg.9hRv02aOF2a9hVZJ5WX6Al,"@Paapa Fahodzi well that's my point you're not as this video is largely mistaken. Unlike the video creator I've actually been to North Korea and North Korea has shut itself off for the same reason China, East Germany, the USSR, and any other communist nation does, consolidation of power and control over its populace. That's the reason the Kim family has closed itself off. However north Korea was allowed to close itself off due primarily to geographic reasons (it is a peninsula) and because the much larger, more powerful, and ideologically aligned China wanted to close itself off and control it's own populace and the best way for it to do that was to let North Korea deal with the headache of having a thriving and vibrant democracy on its border."

UgxajE710-kqY691IA54AaABAg,"I doubt any Korean lives in a constant state of fear that NK might invade. Most of us simply don't care about what NK does. I think the one time I got really scared was when I was a recruit in ROK Navy boot camp back in '94 and NK threatened to turn Seoul into a ""sea of fire"". We were mentally and physically prepared to go to war by our drill instructors just in case they invaded, but of course, that never came. I suppose over the past decades, we have gotten pretty used to the frequent saber rattling by NK, no matter how serious they are.

During the Korean War, my mother was just a child and her house on the outskirts of Seoul was completely destroyed by a US jet, while she and her family were still in it. Fortunately, the jet had run of out of bombs since it did multiple strafing runs till the house eventually caught fire and burned to the ground. She was extremely lucky to be alive, or else neither of us would be here today. Her countless life stories of being born into a wealthy family and ending up as a war refugee after losing everything including her father, always hungry and in poverty for decades even after the war, constantly reminds me of how thankful we are living in this day and age without fear or worry, although technically we're still at war. Under no circumstances should that ever happen again."

UgybiCdjtgWBcZ63Ez14AaABAg,"As Israeli, I can tell you those are normal bomb shelters. Here it's the same thing. Some buildings' bomb shelter is a basement that was reinforced. Newer apartment buildings have a safe room in every apartment that is used as normal room for most of the time, in fact it was my teenage bedroom for a couple of years. And public shelters scattered around towns and cities are used for other purposes as well - like scouts bases, senior citizens clubs, neighborhood meetings and public restrooms. For us it simply the norm, whenever a siren sounds you just find the nearest one. It's ingrained in us from childhood, that's why all the people interviewed don't think about it all that much - it's just always in the background it's ~casual~ so to say."

Then when it DOES (and it usually always does if history serves as any educator) everyone acts shocked, morally outraged and goes hard to work throwing their peanuts into The Opinion Pile, laws are enacted (and seldom ACTED upon or generally practiced/enforced) and Life goes on for the survivors who perpetuate the legends, lies, truths and half truths known in full by no one.

You also should come and visit Kyiv now, its a pretty weird experience."
UgwC1A2WSqOV68sqUod4AaABAg,Sadly the media told us to be afraid so that someone can sell more weapons
Ugx4pSncArMEGUgbFrh4AaABAg,In America there‚Äôs still that intergenerational fear of a nuclear war. The cold war really started a nuclear fear in America. That could be a reason why America takes these threats more seriously. Bush is an example of that. He used the weapons of mass destruction excuse to make Americans support the Iraq war. South Korea could also be minimizing the threat to reduce panic within their populace.
Ugx32cCuPYT8avNgy2p4AaABAg,~~~friends is stretch frenemies at best
Ugzk-E8xja9sbetRRq94AaABAg,"The one part that personally hit me was the comparison of North and South Korea after 70years, how if someone moves on and it results into a dynamic growth, how if a person who keeps rubbing his wounds and just never gets out of it impacts the entire family and just forces a starvation realising everything yet not realising"

UgzRvpEueR2t9Ci6iKR4AaABAg,"I hated history in school & I‚Äôm not much for watching the news but something about your style & the way you explain things keeps me glued to your videos.

UgySabOY5_AiC_ipxI14AaABAg,This made me recall a scene in the West Wing in which they were discussing the DMZ and the expert asked CJ if she‚Äôd ever been to the DMZ.. he said it was an ecological paradise with plants and wildlife only to demonstrate that she (we) don‚Äôt know anything about this conflict aside from what we are told‚Ä¶ pretty sure if we dropped books & food instead of bombs then perhaps the DMZ would never have been necessary.. America really is in the wrong business so to speak..
Ugy4u0attCc25PThPXl4AaABAg,"Umm... So no mention of McArthur¬¥s  official request to nuke North Korea (Just avoided because of Truman¬¥s fear of Soviet retaliation, the nuking itself was OK) No, let¬¥s just throw that little detail under the rug. No Biggie."
UgzK4QsBPWGWnWZJhmR4AaABAg,Before the invasion of Russia in Ukraine a lot of Ukrainians did not think the tension would escalate to a war. This threat had always been present for a big part of their lives. I suppose it's the countries' interest to keep their people reassured.

Also the barely mentioning that North Korea started the war and giving the idea that all the bad came from foreign powers. Ask South Koreans and they will tell you they are grateful that the USA saved them from the communists (referring to Russia and China, who were just using the Koreans in the North)."

UgzefNECp_d2lhxfcK54AaABAg,"Very similar situations in Pakistan and India, two Nuclear-armed countries, that were one country before the Brits split it. They are separated by a 24km border crossing.

Ugzj1RcX6LT36E9QU8B4AaABAg.9hR9HRgQffL9hRES21yyq-,"@Jackson Luis The US and Soviets pulled out forces from Korea at that point. 

Most American forces in asia were stationed in Japan as its new constitution banned it from having an army relying entirely on the US for protection.

Americans at this point were more occupied in defending Taiwan üáπüáº from the mainland than South Korea from the North."

P.S It also tells us that no one is inherently bad, it's just the trauma and world view that they grow up with, which tends to shape them."

Ugw6D4VjcZZhSBTgoNl4AaABAg,"It‚Äôs the same way how Sino-Japanese war was brought up in China. CCP makes people never forget the war and keeps the hate alive today. Like when Abe got assassinated, it was like national celebration in China."
Ugx_z5gjsQhj2xkmJwB4AaABAg,As an American living in south korea I will admit the first couple years I would check US embassy‚Äôs evacuation protocols and made sure I knew exactly where our passports are.  Now been here almost a decade I forget that I live 20km from the border.  And the only times I do think about it is when watching CNN.

Ugyk4EbPbDG0x5uaalh4AaABAg,"Everyone walking this earth and still wanting to breath peacefully should hate the Usa. That dark horse club hidden behind the coulisse of democrazy will kill us all. Us has millions of warheroes living to this day.. How are they concidered as heroes as Usa has mostly invaded, occupied and provoked other regions by their actions? The Usa is nothing but a gun factory built by its citizen thats where the american dream is slowly sinking in. Nobody says a thing about Us nuke tests is the first and funniest part of all this. America probably pays tubers like Johnny, sites like Netflix. Its all about what brilliant the Us has done. Find a serie of crazy leaders, you find them all but american leaders. Why would that be? Why would the situation where we're in be? Its because the Usa wants control and most importantly money. How they make it is by provoking other parts of the world knowing small countries would also rely on The Us so its win win, for the great generation fo Usa ofc. Why would the Us want so much growth when theyre whole population is filled with criminals, whores, idiots, terrible musicians etc etc. How many podcasts are there going on in the Us? Probably more than they have population."
UgyQkc-LC2f_cOIzkm94AaABAg,"So it was America that went back and prevented their unification by compromising with the Soviet Union, and brought that lesson with the South Koreans to Vietnam to wage war? us good or bad?"
UgxzfUPQl9sOkK8LAxF4AaABAg,"A thought experiment I have always had: Imagine you are Kim Jong-un, he was born into this and just had to run with it I assume. And what are his options now? It's either to maintain status quo with an iron fist, or ""abdicate"" and either end up as an enemy prisoner or getting killed in the streets by your own people, like Gaddafi. What are you going to chose... if you have no off ramp, all the incentives is to continue being a brutal dictator. But what about this solution:
We grant the dictator himself and everyone that is guilty in his ""government"" not only a full pardon, but also grant them a guaranteed and protected life in luxury for the rest of their lives.... But in return they have to surrender NK to SK, creating a unified Korea. In addition SK would get an extremely generous deal with the world bank, in order to handle the cost of bringing old NK up to date with the rest of Korea.

Yes the thought of Kim Jong-un and his henchmen getting off scot free is an affront to justice, I agree. But if this would actually work you have to look at the big picture, this would definitely be a ""greater good"" deal I would be willing to make. What do you guys think?"
UgxzfUPQl9sOkK8LAxF4AaABAg.9hR5Nofimgc9hRdU9tZclO,Hello üëã how are you doing üòä and how is the weather ‚òÅÔ∏è over there?

UgwAhAK0Cgl6or6fBUF4AaABAg,"As always, interesting and insightful. I am not surprised about the South Korean people not thinking about the threat to the North. Do you think that's just the optimism bias at work?"
UgwWtZ9SGeg6sEi8UOV4AaABAg,"This is journalism at its finest. No extreme bias or political narrative, just a straight-forward explanation of North Korea's perception of the US. Taught me more about the war than 15 years of school ever did. Keep up the great work."

UgzzKb-Lej8l67UGY0J4AaABAg,"This video makes it seem like the DPRK is unreasonable. Bro the USA firebombed them and destroyed almost every building in the country but the narrator said ""they have't moved on"" lmao tf? That's not to mention that the USA is always talking about ""we're going to wipe that country off the map."" I'm going to assume most of the facts are correct (Like he said the DPRK started the war. Which can only be true if ""starting the war"" means the DPRK solders crossed the border first as if Syngman Rhee wasn't about to do the same thing. And what about all the massacres the USA was engaging in during their occupation?)  but the way its framed is really weird.

I feel like a historian that specializes in this part of the world should respond lmao"

UgzM7m3fng5XOZtMJfp4AaABAg,"As a dual citizen born in the states and grew up in korea for the most of my lifetime, I love that you finally get to do story over my country! I love an amount of research you've done for this video, as well as holding on to the firsthand experiences traveling around Seoul.  Never doubted peace even in my days in the Korean military, and impressed that you even got to the point that koreans don't give a ** about the war. Again, thnx Johny for the production!"
UgzM7m3fng5XOZtMJfp4AaABAg.9hQxIXoE2Ty9hXGEo4fs8S,thank you for the really kind comment. so encouraging. I poured over every detail on this one. I became really obsessed with the history for a while there trying to make sure I got it right. so to hear approval from a local means a lot.
UgzM7m3fng5XOZtMJfp4AaABAg.9hQxIXoE2Ty9hVJpXFQs4R,"@Muhammad Hafis Haiedar exactly! thnx for elaborating it, Muhammad. To go further, by serving the military duty for Korea, I acquired the Korean citizenship permanently as well. Otherwise, I automatically lose it."
UgzM7m3fng5XOZtMJfp4AaABAg.9hQxIXoE2Ty9hV57U9_oCR,"@Storage Crafter US use where you were born based citizenship. While Korea use bloodline based citizenship. 

So if one of your parents is Korean who immigrated to the U.S she/he is still considered being a Korean citizen. And if you were born BEFORE your Korean parent change his/her citizenship the Korean govt immediately recognize you as theirs because of bloodline. But since you were born in the US, the white house labelled you as theirs. 

Sorry for bad English xixixi"
UgzM7m3fng5XOZtMJfp4AaABAg.9hQxIXoE2Ty9hUs_n2C3Y-,So cool :)
UgzM7m3fng5XOZtMJfp4AaABAg.9hQxIXoE2Ty9hUnREN9YoK,how did you got both of citizenship anyway?
Ugzg7qNDUxX3QdnR-TR4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve got a friend who is currently enlisted in the South Korean military ( Adult males there are required to enlist before or by the time they turn 30 for about two years ) and according to him his army mates are running more and more drills and training activities than before. For all I know, he is stationed in a base near the 38th Parallel and from what I hear, many bases around the border are facing the same situation. Some are camouflaged and rarely accessible to the public ( I do not know the details only that this is apparently the case in his base ). Recently, I asked him about the situation of North Korea‚Äôs missile flying over Japan and dropping near the island nation, to which he responded that he has no clue of anything of the sort. Apparently, even the military units there are pretty much unaware of the situation out there or rarely choose to care, but seeing from how the drills and training activities are being increased, it pretty much shows that the government is in fact the one taking caution. So from what I can tell, the public is left with ignorance and a carefree attitude to go on with their lives, but I‚Äôm sure the government are on their heels.

Edit: my point in saying this is not to discriminate against anyone, but more on giving an idea on what the perspective of the South Korean public is towards North Korea and their recent activities"
Ugz1TkC47FyCejHKPhd4AaABAg,"It is refreshing to follow this story in its most relevant states: on the ground in the Korean Peninsula (especially the DMZ) and in the historical archives detailing plans between Stalin and the first Kim. 
I can always count on Johnny Harris to provide a different perspective that doesn't obstruct the facts."
UgwPlihSejODHmlktv14AaABAg,"This is a very good video! I agree, there is a lot people, if not the most (we don't know it), who are believing in the national propaganda, but there is also a lot people, who don't believe this stuff at all. I am also pretty sure there is a lot People, who follow the propaganda, without believing it, because they don't want to get caught and put in a reeducation camp. Actually there is a lot videos and books of North Korean, who was escaping from North Korea and who told the story, how North Koreans think about their government etc.¬†
For example Yeonmi Park, Hyeonseo Lee or Eunsun Kim and many others, who told the story  about living and escaping North Korea. It would be nice, if you make a second part of this Video, where you explain, how North Koreans really think about their brainwash and everything."
Ugy51NgOh0_DZqpctVV4AaABAg,Hoenstly kinda wondering why you didn‚Äôt mention that most of the stuff in their museum is just fake propaganda used to instill hatred in America. It‚Äôs all used mostly to distract them from their oppressive dictatorship. The government has committed far more atrocities to their own citizens than the US troops did during the war‚Ä¶

Ugz1MK4a-Q0hrZ2b4Nh4AaABAg,Also one main reason why Truman was so willing to bring the US into war over Korea was because they had just lost China to the communist and Truman wasn‚Äôt going to let his political opponents from blaming him for losing Korea too
Ugwmw4w5_20cGsJekMl4AaABAg,"Oh please Johnny, Winston Churchill wanted to continue on with WW2 to defeat Russia but the liberal apologists wanted to stop so basically everything that has happened since then is on the globalists head"
UgwIsa_5sMAcZewwft54AaABAg,"From the look of those war photos NK was almost bombed back to stone age. Their leader miscalculated US reaction to an invasion, Stalin was fighting a proxy war, while China was just coming out of a civil war. This was definitely a war that deeply impacted their psyche."
UgwCK4MxKGa2qFC9iZh4AaABAg,"Really good video. The latter half is definitely reflective of how I felt being in Korea, compared to western medias reflection of the conflict.
My only quibble would be framing the conflict as ""Started by North Korea"", both the Soviets and the US are complicit in the conflict. It can't be forgotten that American installed a fascist leader in the South prior to the events of the war."
UgwCK4MxKGa2qFC9iZh4AaABAg.9hQvS1b-sWm9hYrIXYu5Ib,Facts! Johnny doesn't really talk enough about the juntas and their role in jeju.
UgwCIMZsrKoeNYWbJMt4AaABAg,"You skipped tons of information. For example, the part about how north Korea pushed back ""The UN"" force to 38 line, the part about south Korea became dictatorship and US still supported it."
UgwCIMZsrKoeNYWbJMt4AaABAg.9hQvQTKGIvL9hQwJuQsShJ,"And since at the time of 1950, everyone believed that Korea is one country, how was it an ""invasion"". Did the US north invade the south during the civil war?"
Ugw1kZPgWpZxDiRFIHR4AaABAg,"Sorry, Jonny, but I have to say this perspective wasn't that new to me. And what you have studied was not the full version of the story. If you want to understand the broader picture of this conflict, it would be helpful to have a look at the Chinese archive (of course, it is distorted for political reasons, and access to it is limited) and several pieces of research on modern Korean history (one of my recommendations is done by Dr David Fields. His book on the first Korean president Syngman Rhee has some deep insight into how the peninsula was split by the US government apparatus.) 

So I, in a sense, disagree with many of your points but thank you for your impressive work and attention."
UgyXBtw4k2l-9FBemNJ4AaABAg,"You could say the same about Taiwan. Ask the people of Taiwan, where I am now, how they feel about all the conflict that surrounds them. They've been dealing with it for 70 years."
UgwEqQmmCDZjvtan_1h4AaABAg,"Nice erasure of the fascist syngman ree dictatorship that crushed the people's committees and genocided communists and even unaffiliated people in the South, most infamously on Jeju Island. Also you do not mention Syngman Ree's constant begging to Americans to invade before the North eventually did. Also, communist support in, even in the south was extremely widespread, and most Koreans were pro-Soviet, even though it's inaccurate to the North Koreans were soviet puppets. Literally look up how quickly the Soviets left! If you actually wanna learn, listen to Blowback or read Bruce Cummings or Suzy Kim. Johnny Harris, even when he pretends to turn away from the mainstream narrative, stumbles onto imperialist narratives.."

Ugyhvr3rlV1xO-EsIMx4AaABAg,"As a strong leader you don‚Äôt send emails, you send a rocket to make a statement. It‚Äôs the agreed way between both sides to maintain dialogue while still be ‚Äúat each other‚Äôs throats ‚Äú. Military and political theatre at its purists form."

Ugxkoid41gNinw_mqyF4AaABAg,"What do I think? My dog eats better than many North Koreans, and that's not something America did to them. 70 years of that kind of treatment of their own people far overshadows the horrible things that occurred during the war.

UgwtCLs14QtAkMhldtp4AaABAg,"Oh man I really had a lot of respect for until this videos. I‚Äôve shared your videos to friends and family, touting you as an honest journalist. How many people did you actual poll in South Korea? Why is it according to your polling that South Koreans aren‚Äôt phased by the divide but you are. I mean you seem flabbergasted by American tyranny when they aren‚Äôt, why is that? Or are you going for irony? Why didn‚Äôt you go to North Korea to poll a handful of people? I‚Äôm gonna have to really try and not let this cloud my opinion of your values toward journalism because I have seen incredible, intricate work from you. This only seemed like what I‚Äôd picture North Korean propaganda to resemble, drivel, half truths, spun webs and anecdotal. Your better than this, I think, don‚Äôt become a sell out like western American fascist fake news."
UgztShzUVIAzBC4DeY14AaABAg,wait---are you in the ROK right now? welcome to the peninsula
Ugz0mExY8wFCIzgmXLF4AaABAg,"Thank you Johny for highlighting the severe, lasting and unintended consequences of America's foreign policy."
Ugz0mExY8wFCIzgmXLF4AaABAg.9hQjhvw2bT79hRdhkqFk7w,Hello üëã how are you doing üòä and how is the weather ‚òÅÔ∏è over there?
UgxwTcyZNobAEy5iwtl4AaABAg,The Korean War is the Forgotten War and it really shouldn't have been. I think I learned more here in 25 minutes than I did throughout all of High School History which frankly isn't saying much.
UgxwTcyZNobAEy5iwtl4AaABAg.9hQjcm8oI8u9hTqELYChni,I think Korean War is a quite important historical event because it is acutally an ideology war between the democracy and communism which continues till today.
UgxwTcyZNobAEy5iwtl4AaABAg.9hQjcm8oI8u9hT-l5WLG0c,"The world would be a better place if countries taught their children about the atrocities committed in their pasts.
Compared to stuff like heroic D-Day liberation stories, teaching kids about how Americans killed ~1.5 million innocent civilians is a bit of a downer.
Of course, the communists were about equally viscous during the Korean war, so it definitely wasn't some one-sided genocide attempt, but still, it's a very ugly part of US history."
UgyKBX_jsYFfGbsTPtF4AaABAg,"FINALLY! Someone who actually gets the reality once in for all. I was sick and tired of everyone, even so-called reliable journalists uncritically accepting the narrative consistently told my US media, which is again solely based on an American foreign policy perspective."
Ugw3Df6TTYwZzeWRYJ14AaABAg,"It's actually similar in Japan. They tell us to find ""shelters"" if a missile from North Korea ACTUALLY hits Japan, but the shelters are just.... subway stations. Basements are also really rare here. It's so weird as someone who grew up in Switzerland, where basement bunkers are normal."
Ugw3Df6TTYwZzeWRYJ14AaABAg.9hQirb62hNO9hWFfMdPwIs,pretty sure its just a storm shelter not a nuclear bunker
Ugw3Df6TTYwZzeWRYJ14AaABAg.9hQirb62hNO9hWBK7dQNJ6,"@Iain Bagnall yes. In case of nuclear war, the shelther need to have at least 2weeks of foods and water because that's the time when the nuclear goes down. But it is kinda impossible to have 2week water and foods for 25 and 30million I guess. If nuclear attack comes, what I can do is just pray."
Ugw3Df6TTYwZzeWRYJ14AaABAg.9hQirb62hNO9hVzJCB_1Me,"@ÎßàÏä§ Even if you had the shelter space, realistically the use for that shelter space is in case of nuclear attack, and in case of nuclear attack, you could have all the shelter space you like but that doesn't mean you have enough food to sustain the population for months afterwards, so.... probably better just to prevent the nuclear war from happening in the first place?"
Ugw3Df6TTYwZzeWRYJ14AaABAg.9hQirb62hNO9hTorKn_TKC,"It's hard to take that massive 30million Tokyo population into a legit shelter. It is literally impossible. Korea too, if we account all the metropolitan cities of Seoul, it is 25million. So, we and Japan use normal city infrastructures like subway stations or school basements, park basements as a shelter instead."
UgyYlrBufqJS_ng4iXZ4AaABAg,"Hi John. I'm Azri from Malaysia. I always fascinated with your in dept coverage of geographical and geopolitical issues of a country. I hope one day you could come to Malaysia and do some full documentaries about Sabah, Borneo. One of Malaysia state that relentlessly claim by descendent of old sultanate of Sulu. It not just war of terror of kidnap for ransom but now it turn to global claim when Sultan Sulu descendent had manage to seized many company owned by Malaysia government abroad. It not just war by weapon but prolong to citizen of both country kept claiming google map for their own country. Since Sulu Sultanate was from Philippines which was annexed by United Stated from Spain, I think you are capable of telling all the stories from American perceptive which I could not wait to watch it."
UgygQNNvhBuFUftACPJ4AaABAg,Thank you for making me understand the true nature of this conflict
UgzBmIW4zBOGcfpXex94AaABAg,"""Why North Korea's Neighbours Aren't That Scared Of Them""
I agree with your title change from this, to an extent. It's not a particularly attractive title and it's ambiguous who you're talking about, and doesn't give any sense of clickbait, and we all know clickbait works.

""The REAL Reason North Korea Hates the USA""
This is a better title, but I think it's only representing half of the video. Explaining the Korean War and the context of the tension between NK and the US provides the information you're alluding to in the title, but that's not the whole video.

I'm feeling conflicted, and I think it's because you ended the video in a different place to where you started. I think the question was answered halfway into the video, and the rest of the video was a supplementary perspective - SK's perspective. Maybe it would have been prudent to ask and answer the question of ""why does the US worry so much about NK but SK doesn't?"". That question feels unanswered, and that's directly tied to the proposal in the title. The title says ""REAL""  reason, but I don't know of any fake reason. Should the US be as worried about NK as SK?

Maybe this kind of conversation, questions like ""should"" and ""why isn't"" aren't appropriate and too speculative to answer. This whole part of the video, while incredibly interesting, only presents an alternate perspective and sorta just leaves it hanging there.

I wonder if a different title might do the whole video justice, instead of the first half. I can't think of one, annoyingly, because I do honestly like your new title better than the original. The best I have is ""Why South Korea isn't afraid of North Korea"" and the answer being ""North Korea hates the US more"", which is basically what I got out of this video (as well as *why* ).

The actual video is really well done, Johnny. I can't comment on any factual accuracy, just presentation, and I am really pleased to be able to understand your history lesson into the Korean War. You made some very good maps :D

(I hope this feedback is useful and not just the ramblings of a pre-coffee it's-too-early night owl)"
UgzHKI3cQ3pbFG0ID8x4AaABAg,the USA wants their souls...
UgzUw6dAFCF-aPBNLFp4AaABAg,"The chill attitude of South Koreans makes sense, but it eerily reminds me of the chill attitude of the Ukrainian people before their country went to war. The inadequate bomb shelters and ignorance of the threat will not translate into a good response if the worst ever were to happen."
UgxRGRYJD-QdQ-vnibB4AaABAg,So we committed a nationwide Aleppo and did not 'liberate'...but flattened everything in the North. Wow.
Ugx7rxJDHDVoGjdbwoF4AaABAg,üíØüíØüíØ As for opinions üëç
UgwAi3AfgTfRcxLCGNF4AaABAg,the funny thing.. why capital city not more than 100km from border line..wkwkw..ambush attack will destroy south korean
UgxM_OBwPpNn9GXV-o94AaABAg,It's similar situation in Taiwan. People don't realize they are under threat from China invading in actually.
UgyIPbWeMjlJ3bv797B4AaABAg,"I was expecting a little more insight... not much new here.  If anything, the background was less revelatory than standard fare.  Kim's bogus pantomime, MacArthur's serious blunder, China's entry into the war... these are much more enlightening than a few telegrams and more impactful than the events mentioned.  I get it, going for a different perspective.  But I didn't see a twist.  One thing is for sure, they're not teaching history in the schools, which is probably one of the reasons why we're currently inundated with red guards over here.  The last century is packed with great history, especially in Asia.  We ignore it at our peril, regardless of how used to the status quo we've become."
Ugx585glR99h-9hXSMN4AaABAg,It's seems to me that North Korea would be much much much better off today if they were lucky enough to be defeated in that war.
UgyaEluAf2IVDHY9C0V4AaABAg,thank you for risking your life to educate us
UgxhMBg9562XicasdCN4AaABAg,Now you know the truth.  Since your old videos with VOX was bias.  You should redo a new story in China.  China too will not allow the west to threaten them ever again.
UgzOyqchtF56luxzhhV4AaABAg,Now this new title I'd click fast
Ugwi6PE3bP5sogZnHpB4AaABAg,"Thanks for giving us this perspective, it's definitely not what most Americans know about Korea."
Ugy0uRpdpJjvi5sPzf54AaABAg,Forget not the propaganda spread by the global north against the North Korean government.
Ugx0n0jEJHBKNFFZuXJ4AaABAg,I really like that in your documentries you hear a story from both sides of the same coin keep it up
UgzScqa5rEWbUZDFXJ54AaABAg,USA has the best missile defense system in the world but somehow the media made the American public terrified from a country thousands of miles away while their neighbours is not remotely concerned. that's how they justify the massive military budget for wars.
UgyTDuzuG9_M2cfzNMJ4AaABAg,"Awesome video! Hope you enjoyed your stay in Korea, please come back again. I think you need to do a video on the capitalization of news media and the dumbing down of news. I think most news media outlets love North Korea"
Ugy7v2M2jXl2fckjbCF4AaABAg,"I don't think this video really paints the right picture.


The US did great harm to Vietnam, Japan, and Germany and those countries aren't like North Korea.

The real reason that North Korea (now) hates the USA is mostly that their government focuses the narrative on this historic trauma while perpetuating the myth that the US (and the outside world) is an existential threat to them. The rest of the world has moved on.

Totalitarian governments love war and invent or exaggerated existential threats that help keep them in power. They paint themselves as both strong and persecuted."
Ugw-UBMTk9cHVVYs3J94AaABAg,Was that really your Grandpa?
Ugz2a1XmHzXF6H82hlR4AaABAg,The moment they do this China will likely militarize their borders and tell the US to rain because quite frankly China is going back to their ways of Imperialism instead of Communism.
UgxvEnb38Z69TAeOKAV4AaABAg,"There's only one thing to learn from this. Evil communist dictators with imperial ambitious caused the debacle.  This video is weird the sympathy for noth korea. THEY WERE THE ONES WHO INVADED THE SOUTH. And it wasn't just a USA operation the defense of south korea was supported by the UN. Communism has been the greatest killer of the human species in modern history. Between Stalin, Mao, the Kim family just in famines alone killed nearly 100 million of their own people on purpose."
UgxxOpXBJa4ZGSP-iR14AaABAg,"pigeon: *more terrifying than north korea*

UgzC1vZUMAxylfmIzMN4AaABAg,Korea is also like Hindustan which become now India and Pakistan
UgzlfMELpmkdPhjcr294AaABAg,US was not friends with the Soviets at the end of WWII.  Patton wantet to rearm the German army and continue through Germany to try to push the Red army out of Europe.  I have heard reports that he had already sent forward observers behind Soviet lines.
UgwQ7QzT16PTi_73PfZ4AaABAg,"They Hate Us, Cause They Ain't Us"
Ugyp9IyDj4yEqfTYalB4AaABAg,"I'm glad South K. is not living in fear and all but Ukrainians were all like ""Nah, the west is hyping up this Russian threats nothing is gonna happen"" even Zelensky was ""there's no reason at all to be afraid"" than DAYS later Russia invaded and how many dead now???? Exactly... so at least be aware of the reality because their ""neighbours"" are also a bunch of communist-terrorrists with no regard for human life, just sayin'"

UgzpwkdYDW-YaiIEBbZ4AaABAg,I don‚Äôt think sheltering in the basement of a building during artillery shelling is such a good idea.
Ugz73Ejv_7bcMpSGegZ4AaABAg,"I think this isn't really about being threatened by nuclear war for SK but a ground war where nuclear deterrent is used against the ally, the US, so they can't or are limited in assisting SK in such a hot war. The US isn't scared of full on destruction of their country or SK, but to have one city like LA threatened in any kind of way is something they're not going to want in any fashion, which they probably could defend easily with their anti missile defense but you never know.. There also isn't unrest in SK as much as you'd think because if NK does go nuclear directly on SK, there's nothing they can do about. There numb at this point to it happening, might as well live their lives and not focus on the unpredictable."

UgzyBTPPf1KVh3cYLpR4AaABAg,It learned the US made a lot of mistakes during and after WWII. But I never knew exactly how North Korea was one of them until now. Thanks.

UgxSa7B2yaa1bWyfKBd4AaABAg,"Most of the world hate the US, you have a lot of material to work with"

Ugy0NPM0AXwr4Y6mxxl4AaABAg,is there a therapist for countries and their trauma?
UgxAF3BddPeiClruAx14AaABAg,"That's why I despise both politics and religion, both creates this absrud narrative that one side is all good and pure and the other pure evil and wrong all the time and most humans still buy this pathetic ideology today, but as we've seen mankind and our economical/religious ideals are often different shades of gray, never black and white, humans are too complex to divide between ""good or evil"", ""sacred or profane"", nothing is as simple and binary and mostly every side of any ideology and beliefs are responsible for the problems any side of anything blames the other for it."
UgynDTLvm-Bsqp-GNG94AaABAg,these first-hand account investigative journalist videos are your strength. Shocking that North Korea has been made into a boogey man by the US security state.

Ugz38pVwk8v5lF4QS5J4AaABAg,North Korea.....lol!
UgyGKsDdZMlLC7po1-Z4AaABAg,"Visiting the DMZ, the craziest thing to me:

There were farmers in the Civil Control Area, they had to leave between dusk and dawn and never be there during the night. 

Their farm ended ON the border fence following the coast. Didn't give a fuck.

Just worked his job.

During my visit to the DMZ museum, Korea had saved all the original treaty documents. ""This treaty we disliked. This one was awesome.

And here's all the Americans who died on this ground. We pray and honor them in this museum.""

Just totally upfront. Craziest part? The museum ended in a reunification of Germany exhibit saying that, despite it all, they still want to reunify through peace and welcome their Northern brothers with sympathy and forgiveness.

Wholesome"

Also, older generations of South Koreans were taught in school that North Koreans are mentally and physically inferior people, that they even have red faces like monkeys. It means that many people in the South can't imagine their neighbours as a real threat. Sadly, it also means North Korean defectors in the South face terrible prejudice and discrimination."

Ugw8BELY2zUUObQGash4AaABAg,"Great vid, very powerful. Maybe a vid on the Japanese history pre war?

Kim's family fought the japanese fascists for years (labor and sexual slavery) before having to go after the new rulers from far away. South Korean Army ""belongs"" to the USA. Not to mention imperialism (harris' Subway video ie). 

Very fair war: 400k tons of bombs 30k tons of napalm.... Funny how brutally destroyed socialist countries were able to be fully industrialised,  reach outer Space before the USA and also developed the A bomb. 

""Efforts have been made to distort my position,‚Äù MacArthur said during his 3,233-word address. ‚ÄúIt has been said, in effect, that I was a warmonger. Nothing could be further from the truth.

UgyM99IP9CR8wAvTUjh4AaABAg,"North Korea did not attack the South because of anxiety. They thought Americans were weak cowards and would not intervene. It's the memory of what the US did to the North Korean Army on the ground and from the air that has prevented the Left fascists of North Korea from using South Korea as a nuclear test site.

If you want to have anything resembling cordial relations with socialists, whenever they launch their inevitable unprovoked attack against you, make sure to brutally kill as many of them as you can in as cruel and as terrible way as you can manage. Make them suffer in horrible agony as they die by the thousands and millions from your ground, naval and air forces. Socialists respect power and nothing else, and the sort of power they respect is the kind that can slaughter them. It's the only consideration they explore when they contemplate robbing, raping, enslaving and exterminating your people, which is after all the primary objective of socialism. Likewise always strike from the top down, as these Left fascists don't care at all about their common troops, which they will use up like cannon fodder, but will suddenly get very pacifistic and conciliatory when their very own personal and flaccid socialist porkine buttocks is on the line."

UgzNB93mH5mPxIS1b9V4AaABAg,"I really, honestly thought this was a great video, but I just don‚Äôt think it answered the question of why the South Koreans aren‚Äôt more afraid. If you had walked around Kyiv the day before Russia invaded in February, your conversations with those citizens would have sounded a lot like these ‚Äî ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even think about it,‚Äù ‚Äúthe United States cares way more than we do,‚Äù etc. So the South Koreans aren‚Äôt scared because their local media doesn‚Äôt play up the threat from North Korea as much as the media does elsewhere?

North Korea might be able to get some cheap shots in, but South Korea would finish it. Especially given SK's modern weapons and military. Especially the logistics that SK would be able to support. Especially with the backing of the US. So I'm not surprised too many people aren't that concerned! Sort of like how people living on the west coast of the US don't think about ""the big one"" like the 1700's Cascadia earthquake that repeats every ~500-600 years."

At the time, the war was everyone's problem, and above all, it is the Vietnamese people who suffered the most.

They can say they don‚Äôt worry about it or that North Korea does it for the U.S but that‚Äôs a fucking lie. Same with China and Taiwan. 

I also question your presentation about bomb shelters. Who did you reach out to to understand the purpose of each shelter and it‚Äôs rating with regards to an attack on soul.

NKorea has a lot of problems, but the ironically also have some some good for their people. Jobs and housing get allocated, so the people (at least of Pyongyang) don‚Äôt have many of the common stresses experienced by other city folk.

Media reports of NKorea is unquestionably greatly exaggerated. The people there are decent people, but Kim-il Sung created such a messed up regime that his grandson couldn‚Äôt just reform and open up the country even if he wanted to"

Y don‚Äôt you try to talk to ppl who were in NKorea forced labor camp prison? They don‚Äôt have strees unlike other cities? what a complete joke
UgzHFoDbeJ8LQZz4gNF4AaABAg,"As a South Korean, i will tell you the core of all of these mess. The dictator and communists in higher rank living in the capital city of North Korea (it is a huge privilege for NK people to live in the capital), they are the core of the problem.  What they are doing has only one purpose : status quo = protecting their life style in Pyongyang.
This is why we are not that worried about North Korea.   They know they can not win us.  They know if there were a new war, they will not survive like they did in 50th.   
South Koreans are also vigilant to the potential threat.  But we are well aware that as long as we keep our military strength powerful enough, NK will never think of starting another disaster.   It is a concept of mutual assured destruction."

UgzW2nU6_MkKj5Ocd9J4AaABAg.9hQ-TZgQULx9hT2-u4MT7b,"I think the difference is... Nazi Germany fell, which made things easier. Not easy, but it's definitely easier to reconcile with a state which has been brought to its knees. Germany in 2022 is a completely separate entity from The Third Reich, and no one still argues about the necessity for revenge. So while people will not forget about the Holocaust, there has been reconciliation. What makes the situation in North Korea difficult, is not just that they ""won't forget"", but also that they can't reconcile because they view the current USA as a direct continuation of the entity which murdered 1.5 million of their innocent civilians. Of course -- the communists in the North ALSO murdered nearly a million South Korean civilians... so -- It's a story with only villains."

But I wonder, however, the way North Korea opressess their own citizens, how can we not expect them not to be equally oppresive to South Korean citizens? It's great to see how South Korea moved on but... I'm not sure North Korea's hate for them would be much different from Americans."

Ugzf5tdxybrRiOXjoYl4AaABAg,Pakistan helped north Korea gain nuclear bomb tech. Not just the commies from rogue nation called China.
UgzEfGQDP1UyFE_wwVN4AaABAg,It's great to see this video that indeed shows what it's like for those living in Korea and the Asian peninsula there. I was backpacking in Seoul and made a trip out to the DMZ where they still have the train station that's still maintained where a train would arrive each day there empty up until a few years ago in hopes that one day they will become one. I didn't even know it but while I was visiting the DMZ was the same day that N.Korea started testing long-range missiles where the western world was on high alert but not a single person cared about what was happening in Seoul or the rest of the country for that matter. They only mentioned that once on their news channel before moving on to other news. That was when I first realized that the western news media blows it way out of proportion compared to what's happening on the ground.
UgzEfGQDP1UyFE_wwVN4AaABAg.9hPysSzudV49hQzCxHCuLB,Thank you for sharing. So true.
UgyRC8XepwifhaQC2Yp4AaABAg,what is the name of the track playing in the intro?
UgydrGJWsNP7hQpKr2t4AaABAg,"Teaching about the past of your own country, be it the wars, political and social problems, droughts, floods and what not, is not the problem. But it is almost impossible for that to be an unbiased take on history, it will always paint the nation as right and others wrong. Also it will not allow the kids to take all of it in and form their opinion instead, will turn it into propaganda and spread hatred.
You also mentioned how you never learned this in school and that it should have been taught.
It is hard for me to decide if the history should be taught in schools or not?"
UgxWYll7PLr1sFQDI9t4AaABAg,"Aside from an refreshingly new perspective of the Korean War, I *love* the soundtrack! Do you choose the music on your own?"
Ugw8eqHbk0WX5d5xq254AaABAg,"As someone who lived in Israel I feel the same. There is an coexistence between normal day lives and vigilance (and in Israel people are actually always prepared), while my friends in America thought I was crazy to live there. 
Also North Koran propaganda on the US atrocities aren‚Äôt entirely true, the former communist bloc countries in East and SE Asia often invent atrocities and stories to anger their people. The details of the horror of atrocities are often committed among themselves, but they just switched the character to the US. Not very worth referencing."

Ugxt6zalfcNSNPXLDWN4AaABAg,"Interesting imagery when describing the Koreans being ‚Äúangry with this stuff‚Äù a protest sign in English. You severely undermine the support the communists had prior to the drawing of the 38th parallel, making it seem like the initial aggression of the war was on the North‚Äôs side. But from their perspective, they were finishing the revolution that was paused under the influence of world powers. I‚Äôm glad I have studied enough to be able to spot this framing, because your content is very digestible, which can lead to us consuming it uncritically.

Ugzx-yhNgMDRQUoXkcl4AaABAg,"Johny, excellent video. However, the scariest place is not only a place like North Korea. Hope you know and learn about the country that works your brain, the one that shows the best communist propaganda of the perfect country to the World today, the real best militar intellingence in this Planet that started to evolve since its foundation in 1925, and the only country in nowadays history that has really achieved the genocide experiment of reducing the function of your brain capability of common sense understanding to the point that misery is seen as freedom since the (nuevo  hombre) education was executed starting the 1960s. That is Cuba the darling of UN, an example of imaginary freedom and human rights, UNISEF, world health system example, ""liberty"", a dictatorship family living rich under one word with double sense meaning (Blockade), and so many other lies! Again, N Korea has no way to hide anything. That is an excellent killing machine.üëç"
UgyboQh7IQuiRW_qlp14AaABAg,"This video also sort of works for Indians and Pakistanis. Not entirely similar circumstances, but the underlying fact remains the same. A foreign power hastily divided the same people with a line that doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Logically there's no need to point nukes at each other. Logically nobody ever wins a nuclear war but here we are, 70 years later, still at each other's throat. We got played by the west and continue getting manipulated by them and we've cultivated this hostility for 70 years. Now it's seems too late to stop. Trust deficit has deepened. I'm not sure the issue will ever be solved. I can just feel sorry for us"

Ugz6WX-afylJvwS5A5l4AaABAg,"It's a survival instinct for north Korea. They have a long history of repelling invaders. Even in south Korea one of the major roads Euljiro is named after Eulji Meondeok who killed a huge Chinese invasion. 

The survival instinct got worse after US led regime change in Iraq, etc. And Americans think Asian lives don't matter, Asians attack in suicidal kamikaze attacks so of course they would start nuclear war because they're not concerned about their own survival. Another big difference is South Koreans don't dehumanize Kim Jong Il into the Team America World Police trope."

UgwlPwDd3-uh7HdbdX54AaABAg,"The propaganda is strong in this one. Mentioning shit like ""destroying 85% of buildings"" and ""targeting anything that moves"" without pointing out how this explicitly requires targeting basically everything civilian. Claiming that museum trips for kids showing atrocities is propaganda and trying to keep the desire for revenge alive? I guess that means hebrew schools want revenge as well, considering the yearly observance of yom hashoa and trips to holocaust museums."

UgwYW7LjpAPbR0qNG8B4AaABAg,"I found a lot of this video's content to be very informative! However, I do strongly disagree with one of the conclusions regarding two common peoples having the desire and capability of rejoining one another: the regular people of North Korea and the regular people of South Korea are incredibly distant from each other in the way they live their lives and the structure of their beliefs regarding their relationship to each other. I'm sure that South Koreans would love for the regime in the North to collapse, for a new democratic government to gain control, and for peace and trade and free travel to occur between the two now-culturally-distant countries. However, North Koreans are largely caught up in the propaganda and forced ideology of the regime they're oppressed by and unable to see eye to eye with the populace in the South. Michael Malice's book Dear Reader is an extremely eye-opening look at the kinds of things that are taught to the common folk in the North. There are other stories told by, for example, Yeonmi Park, about just how crushing and evil the North's regime is, and stories about twins separated as children between the two countries meeting once again and realizing just how different their life experiences were living divided from one another - and those differences were written into their very bodies, let alone their minds and experiences. Differences of weight and muscle mass due to severe malnutrition and constant stress, differences of posture and outlook and philosophy, differences of independence and self-ownership and confidence - these are all impacts of the vastly different cultural, economic, and political systems in control in both countries. Even if the regime were to collapse - which it won't without violent conflict - the people of each country would still be very much divided. The ship to easy reunification sailed long ago."

Ugz3-Yj4U46EgsBXXjN4AaABAg,"Appreciate a few of your takes on it which were definitely from an unbiased perspective, but still need to point out a few biased views.

For instance, when you mentioned the museum in North Korea where they display what the US did - it‚Äôs incredibly important that they do that. Specially because the US never actually stopped doing those heinous acts. They just changed where they did it. So instead of North Korea in the 50s, the bombing and invasions just shifted to Vietnam later. Then Iraq, Afghanistan and everywhere else Uncle Sam has a vested interest in. Thankfully (hopefully) the bombings weren‚Äôt as catastrophic in those places as it was in NK (since your video said that 85% of all buildings were damaged) - but that just makes it even more important to highlight what the US did. 

I mean, imagine if Russia bombed out 85% of all buildings in Ukraine, and then 50 years later some Russian journalist was calling a memorial to that bombing an ‚Äúoppressive‚Äù move and living in the past. 

No it‚Äôs not. And the repercussions of that is still being faced by the NK civilians. The ones still dying of famines and hungers. 

A few more inconsistencies worth mentioning in your video was how the North Korean regime even acquired the nuclear weapons. How it was an American ally (Pakistan) which aided the NK nuclear programme. 

Still, I appreciate your effort in painting a less Western-propaganda-ey version of the story. Although you did fail in that, to some extent. But I appreciate the effort."

UgzRxgo3DkO0i5v8smV4AaABAg,"Typical Johnny Harris history: ""America and USSR were allies after ww2"". This statement completely disregards the bitterness of russian ssr about usa and allied invasion of parts of russia and open support of tsarists during revolution, all of the accusation of each other in different wrongdoings during ww2, rush to carve up as much of post-germany europe as possible and so on. At best they just had common enemy, and never were an allies. ""Soviets joined in in Asia to help deal final blow to Japan"". Sure bro, just selfless soviet help, ofc they didn't want to take as much of territory as they could, like Sakhalin and Kuril islands. I do like some of your videos, but lately you started doing more of historical videos. I understand that you are trying to simplify as much as possible for the people who don't know much about the part of history that a video covers, but please, simplify in a more historically correct way. For example, i think you would give much more viewer-friendly and historically correct version if you called them ""frienemies"" or framed their relations as ""enemy of my enemy""."

UgzEdictEetkMbzNtm94AaABAg,"This is a great video to really open the thinking behind this conflict for westerners. So many Americans I know think of this conflict as just a kind of joke, and that South Koreans are just... sitting ducks with a fondness for boybands. I think this is a very good and indepth picture of what people actually think in South Korea while explaining really well why North Korea isn't going to just ""get over it"" anytime soon. 

One question. In the map portions for the first half of the video... why are all of the towns labelled with Japanese imperial names and not the Korean ones? Didn't they stop using the Japanese names in 1945? Seems a little insensitive to use the imperial placenames instead of a map with the native placenames anglicized..."

Ugxo8BjQhXR8sQr8b2J4AaABAg,"I've lived here in South Korea for almost three years now. Even though policy regarding the North is a big deal for the government and military the average Korean has more to say about current conflicts with Japan (Dokdo, Sea of Japan) and China (kimchi, hanbok) than they do with the North.
That said, I think the younger generation doesn't feel that much kinship with the people in the North. Some just view the people of the North as the enemy, others as a burden. Kind of sad, really."
Ugxo8BjQhXR8sQr8b2J4AaABAg.9hPSEX7yiSY9hRnAZVHLiF,Yeah correct. I am a Korean in my 20s. We do more care about the relationship with US Japan and China. The supporter of one party being against Japan and the supporters of the other party being against China and they fight a lotüòÇüòÇ

Ugx3ZWP-BHQS2TEb9YF4AaABAg,"The important thing in this video is the presentation of North Korean perspective. It may be wrong, but it exists. It's important to take the fact into account.
A dozen years ago, I spent some professional time in Iran. I was astonished by the ease with which the people whom I worked with criticized the ayatollahs. Despised and disdained them. At the same time, these same people despised the United States. They know their country's history. They know that a burgeoning democracy, led by Mohammed Mossadegh, was overthrown by the CIA, and replaced by the Shah and his murderous secret police, the SAVAK. These people fully agreed that Iran needed nuclear weapons to resist American interference.

UgxfwLkV127JAUKQQTl4AaABAg,This is what happens most of the time between a victor and the defeated. Germany and Japan are exceptions to the rule due to the Marshall plan and the complete and utter annihilation that they suffered. Almost every conflict in history leaves lasting and deep hatred between the participants. Just look at what has happened with the US conflicts no matter how targeted our strikes or how much aid is sent to the conflict the countries hate us throughout the conflict and we stopped waging Total War arguably after Korea and certainly after Vietnam. If you are going to use military means to achieve an objective this sort of lasting enmity is what you have to expect unless you are willing to do one of two things. Either you so completely destroy their capacity and culture such that you are able to design the people's reinvention over time or you literally conquer and occupy them ala the empires of old.

Yes, North Korea is a constant threat to South Korea but whenever the Kim‚Äù family did something it appeared it was for attention and finally something from South Korea or the UN like food or lifted sanctions.  The unfortunate part of the Dictatorship up North is the suffering the citizens of North Korea must go through by the leadership.

Ugx8-i4j8I0SpBlT6Yh4AaABAg,"This is exactly how it is in the India-Pakistan conflict. Both the Indians and the Pakistanis are doing much better than before and the people who live near the border are not scared of war at all despite both countries possessing nuclear weapons. The only problem is the Pakistani military and intelligence agency, like North Korea, chose to remember the conflict and keep it as a main focus of their existence, which leads to continued strained relations between both countries. Even if Pakistani politicians chose to go peacefully with India, the military just organises a coup and overthrows the government to place a puppet government that opposes India. Sad that this happens but there is only little that anyone can do.

They are taught that the Kims are mystical gods that can read their thoughts and know if they're doing anything wrong. Dead bodies in the streets due to hunger are regular sights for children. Resources are so scarce that actual feces is considered to be valuable since it's the closest thing they have in some areas to fertilizer.  Women can have the government show up at their door and kidnap them to be a member of ""pleasure squads"" where they sometimes will have all their teeth removed. 

Yeonmi-Park is the most recent person to escape North Korea and still has some contacts, so she knows the most about what life over there is currently like. She's incredible and has a presence on Youtube, check out her channel and her book ""In Order to Live""."
Ugwzvp7gbvw5N-j2FbF4AaABAg,"I've seen a lot of people getting a NK missile alarm in Japan
but so far absolutely no missiles from NK ever hit Japan soil 
i think it's because NK knows the consequences if they do attack japan
not only would it enrage the world's third largest economy(Japan)
but it would also mean taking on the USA at the same time 
they already have a collapsing economy let alone a war against the USA and Japan
and i think that's why most people in japan when they get a NK missile alarm just either pass it off as nothing or just don't care at all"

UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hSfBP-kfPw,"""I wanted to see this outside ofthe US military lens""

Well, that spectacularly failed.

""To their surprise, the Soviets agreed to split Koreas""

Soviets were ALWAYS ready to split Koreas, that's part of what USA prevented Japan FROM preventing. It was them who put the conquest of Manchuria onto the table, while USA rubbed their hands for the business prospects, since Europe had already colonized and made playpen out of Southeast Asia and the islands in the Pacific. Now it was down to USA to weaponize voteless Hawaii to the brim, just like Matthew C. Perry would hope.

They were not surprised at the slightest, unless they were surprised that Japan actually stood up. Russo-Japanese war was LARGELY ABOUT forcing Russia TO NOT divide Koreas, and Japan's later occupation of French Indochina had similar reasons, except the French had no such evil intentions so they didn't have a huge problem with that. THIS WAS ALL against US war business, so US State sanctioned Japan for 80% of their petroleoum, by forbidding capitalism to the US exporters. What a FINE way ""to prevent Japanese oil war with sanctions"" in July 1941.

For all the talk about Japan's expansion to the South, people seem pretty fine and dandy with Russian expansion FROM NORTH to the same direction, which USA facilitated. The conquest of southern sides of the Sakhalin and Kuril islands, and forceful displacement of the Japanese living there, who had been there certainly longer than any English-speakers had been in Texas by 1861. Any word for the UKRAINIAN settlers INTO these islands? Any word for the haphazard way USA launched massive, Vietnam and Korean War operatives to walk back ALL THESE mistakes, with fun to be had using Agent orange and napalm? HOW MUCH praise do the Nanking and Manchuria have to levy at their great liberators and allies NOW, with these current, cozy China and Russia relations?

And how funny, that USA seemed to have gained so many WAR CONQUESTS for all its' ""help"", from military base occupation to forced labor in China and Korea, ""because Japan tried to do it first"" (but didn't though). Them being ""opened up to the west"" was a spectacular failure of the COMMAND LINE and military integrity, causing events like Nanking to happen without effective oversight from the Japanese population, just like the uked japanese civilians didn't have effective oversight of the EMPIRE that USA took INTO THEIR CUSTODY. Amercian dmeocracy simply keeps washing their hands form the DECISIONS of the democracy, and blames SUBJECTS of empires LIKE THEY WERE democracies. AND THAT seems to be the entire reason and MO, of how US kids are ""taught"" in schools."
UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hSW0WeomYx,"@bob bob how is that not the case huh? When you are not allowed to trade freely, your economy of course will suffer a lot. And don't forget that the NK has very few land suitable for agriculture, and another is that the Socialist block has collapsed which thier main supporters. It's incredible how they can keep their self-determination.
BTW the US 'dictator' point has been using so many time and the US is the main supporter for dictators all the world   made it lost all it meaning."
UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hSU7f--db6,@mads Kristensen you need to do a lot more research on North Korea. Everyone tries to use sanctions as an excuse and American but that is mostly not the case. North Korea rebuilt faster than the south after the Korean war North Korea at one point was pointed to as a success. North Korean woes are almost solely it being a communist dictatorship with so many poor choices
UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hSDrKyF00z,"North Korea is not ‚Äústay there‚Äù. Before the end of 1970s. North Korea had a much better economy than South Korea. The economy only began to decline after North Korea was sanctioned by the United States for a long time, until today.  Without U.S. sanctions, what is now more developed is likely to be North Korea."
UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hS1LTi-Na-,@bob bob Maybe North Korea stayed in the 50s cause they had no other choice since the US bombed up to 85% of their infrastructure and shut them out of the global market. Im not defending North Korea but there is a material analysis to be made when talking about North Koreas material condition
UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hS1K175QS1,"@bob bob south was a fascist dictatorship up until the 80‚Äôs,propped up by the US. They rounded up people in concentration camps for resisting it,for being communists or suspected communists. All with the financial and military help from the US.  The north was fine until 90‚Äôs,when socialist block fell and they lost their trading partners. They were severely sanctioned by the US and still are to this day! When SU fell,north had serials of drought and floods in the 90‚Äôs,for which the propaganda mashine hasn‚Äôt been able shut up about,they couldn‚Äôt import oil,or anything for that matter,the Kim‚Äôs wanted to join international banking institutions,and open up like China but they were denied. The US wanted them to starve to death. Basically continuation of genocide they committed in the 50s where they killed 20% of their population."
UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hQxO69_aMB,I agree. And the quality of this JH video is cutting-edge.
UgyQv1sYzXWPDrqR68x4AaABAg.9hPGnYB4IXx9hQ_czVK1e5,It is not really taught in history class as besides all the people that died on both sides it did not really change anything. The only thing that changed is South Korea moved on and thrived while North Korea stayed in the 50s.

It‚Äôs 100% true that many South Korean citizens don‚Äôt consider war as a possibility in their everyday lives (except the occasional scare abt some NK missile test). I will say though, being an active duty personnel basically serving as the first line of defense in an invasion put many things in perspective. It‚Äôs almost every other day that some incident occurs (distant explosions, reports of unknown people in the DMZ, and more recently the NK fighter jets that crossed the border for nuclear drills). Whilst I still believe war may be unlikely due to the stakes of nuclear weapons, I do believe it‚Äôs correct to always be on standby. Sure there may be the occasional silly show of dominance through who can set the higher flagpole, blast the loudest music, etc. However its important to realize the border is still a highly unpredictable zone, which Im sure both sides of the border acknowledge."

 The thoughts about the North Koreans of me and the folks around me is that they severely lack the ability to wage a full-scale war AND somehow defeat the South Korean military miraculously and take Seoul, but the main fear is their nukes and the Chinese which would probably intervene if an another war breaks out in Korea.

UgyPz7bOE0wleYW-EzV4AaABAg,"15:37 I agree that North Korea did not evolve due to its President.
But, at the same time, it was not allowed to evolve because:
a) Destroyed its farm land, factories, and infrastructure (especially energy);
b) Destroyed its major source of income.
c) Sanctions imposed by the USA, not allowing North Korea to import and export goods to many countries;

Without infrastructure, without money, and without connections to the rest of the World which could help North Korea to get out of its poor state (whether through food, raw materials, or money), how was North Korea supposed to evolve?

I am not saying that the USA had a good reason to do so, in order to keep its President from invading and starting a new war again.
But, was there another option?
I think so.
The USA chose the easier and cheaper option: to close North Korea to the outside World, after destroying it - much like a bully does."

UgzJiSB-_cW_8vueXQN4AaABAg,"That the North Korean population are constantly barraged with American atrocity propaganda is not the ""Why"" of their hatred to America but rather the ""How"". The regime certainly use that as the tool to justify their stay in power. Wait, I may be toeing the Western line. Anyway, I have been to Vietnam, another country heavily bombed by the US (more bomb than WW2) and where American atrocities were also infamous. There's a war museum building where Vietnamese heroism is glorified and the Americans are vilified but that's it. In fact many of the tourists there are Americans and I don't see any ill-feelings. So the bottom line why North Korea ""hates"" the US is that the regime breathes the air of Anti-Americanism to stay in power and justify how they rule. Their justification for closing their borders is supposedly for protection, but more so to confine their people from seeing what's outside else they will realize what a difference it could be if their repressive regime cease to exist."

The line was actually drawn up by Russia and Japan before their war in 1904-5 while they fought over a dying Joseon Dynasty. Later, the US and Stalin dusted off those old plans. And the West didnt come to Korea's aid until the end of WW2 because the US agreed to let Japan keep Korea, so long as they didn't interfere  with the US' interests in the Philippines. While Seoul is woefully unprepared for a war (really, what could they realistically do?), if you visit the coast, you see much more fortifications."

UgzDGD_zcYSMQpdYRVF4AaABAg,"It's all nice and dandy showing us that South Koreans don't sweat over North Korea one day invading them but that doesn't make the danger any less real or imminent. Just look at Ukraine. Basically the same people as Russians, they used to be one country under USSR, they understand each other's languages, share history and culture and I bet they also didn't sweat over Russia one day rolling over them with brute force, to ""liberate"" them from Nazis. I live in the Czech Republic, basically in the heart of Europe. Our lands have been invaded so many times during the course of history yet we didn't seal ourselves from the world in a desperate bid to keep out everyone till USSR cut us off from the rest of Europe by iron curtain and begun to force feed us the same narrative about evil Americans poisoning our soil, sending foreign bugs to destroy our crops and spies or saboteurs to thwart our glorious communist utopia. My point is that no matter how the Americans conducted during the Korean war, the new reigime would still have painted them as devils just to scare and control the population. You blurred the museum murals but do you really believe or have any evidence of US soldiers raping Korean women in droves, killing little babies and torturing the populace for fun? The fact how many bombs were dropped has little to do with the general narrative of the propaganda. If US dropped 1/10 of the payload, Koreans would have invented the remaining 9/10. On the other hand, the lack of general readiness in South Korea baffled me. It's like living next to a volcano that may or may not erupt one day, not having any semblance of a plan to deal with the chaos IF it erupts. I'm not saying people should be frightened all the time, just ready, informed and vigilant."

UgzokE303MXgB3gERJF4AaABAg,"so few comments from the person in shelter under air raid alert. 
- such bomb shelters are ok, when NK will decide they need to unite Korea again - everyone would appreciate that. There are probably much better shelters in there, but you cannot build ColdWar era bunkers for entire population (my kids are in one of those currently, it is nearest to the school).    
- in 50th NK started the attack, not SK, the destruction of the infrastructure and indiscriminate bombing is definitely bad thing that happened, but interesting if everyone has the causality in place. Wondering what are the reasons of war and how start of war is described in the museum you have in the video. It is not new, people in russia\soviet union still largely believe the WW2 started in 41, not in 39 (they decided to ignore part where Soviet allied with Germany to attack Poland). This causes mass dillutions among citizen and you still see. A lot of the things like 9may victory parades with messages on cars: ""onward to Berlin"".¬†
- nukes threat is huge, probably SK citizens does not realise, but they are at umbrella of US for protection. We (the humanity) are currently at stage where first time Nukes are promoted as the weapon of attack and expansion, not the deterrence mechanism. And surprisingly a lot of US and overall world think tanks are seemingly supporting this idea. Imagine in 52, the NK said if US interferes to protect SK, we will nuke the US\Japan\US Bases. Will the decision be the same? Imagine in 2025 NK use conventional weapons against for attack at SK and says if anyone interfere, we will nuke US\Japan\US Bases. What will be decision?  If nuke ""attack usage"" will be accepted once, will SK still rely on outside powers for protection or they will start to develop their own Nukes?"

Not so for their subsequent generations. And look how much they've moved on, progressed, developed and continue to prosper in their overall relationship with the Americans. Unforgiveness and its accompanying unwillingness to let go will perpetuate the internal rot that's eating the North Korean leadership. KJU is the 3rd generation leader from the same line. No wonder the gateway of hatred remains open to this day! That gate needs to be closed and shut tight before a bright future can dawn on NK. The combined joint offer of Trump, Abe & Moon offered to KJU for investments and economic development of NK was thrashed and binned away.

And I might be a perculiar person who is living inside South Korea but my logic of not worrying the war is that if there is any war, South Korea is doomed anyway.

i'm not joking, the Americans had to send a follow-up ""clarification"" that they meant only Korea, not Northern Japan
and Stalin was PISSED LOL


edit: ""war started by North Korea""

it's actually a bit more complicated than that, the South Korean president right before the war was also talking a lot of shit about wanting to invade North Korea to reunite Korea... and it wasn't clear to the North Koreans whether he was bluffing or not
it was only clear after the invasion (North Koreans called it a pre-emptive strike) that he was just talking shit, and there were no preparations for war - but the war had already started..."

The books you'd find on the Korean war on a Master's reading list aren't the product of hermetically sealed cartesian reflection, they're based on the primary sources you're getting so worked up about.

Technically Vietnam today is still communist but its economy is booming and Vietnamese people no longer hold grudge against the US for the war.

We were the best responders when the pandemic started, not like we are doing so hot right now though haha. When China launched missiles over our country a few months ago, we still go on vacations to small islands around Taiwan not fearing that if war breaks out we might end up getting stuck on those islands."
UgytmAAoVJh7Lz4nu6F4AaABAg,I'm just gonna join this train of South Koreans commenting here. Yeah basically we're not scared or even care about the possibility of a North Korean invasion and kind of waiting for Kim Jong Un to pass away and North Koreans to sort everything out themselves. Politicians rather talk about improving relations and peacefully reuniting like Germany. Students learn about the prospects of reunification and how we can connect to the trans-siberian railway and combine resources in the north and the technology of the south to become an economic giant etc. We want to move on from the painful history and build a better future while Kim wants to use it to manipulate the people into demonising the west and thinking he's the saviour of the korean people.

I mean, I could show you a picture of British and German soldiers smiling together on Christmas 1914, but that doesn't at all ""prove"" that their nations were friendly with each other at the time; indeed, they were literally at war with each other.

The Western-Soviet alliance was always an alliance of convenience and was even fragile during the war. I understand he's simplifying it for people who know literally nothing about the Cold War, but I think it would have been better to say that they were ""partners"" or something like that."

It still is a class riven and unfair society where the elites have immense power. So stating that 'South Korea' went on to success because it was a democracy  - shows either ignorance, or a complete willingness to lie."

UgzV4ssam8DLK-UVpwd4AaABAg.9hOhDO-Kzme9hSDBS28stx,"@M majik7 that‚Äôs why I think these videos often saying ‚ÄúSouth Koreans don‚Äôt care‚Äù or ‚ÄúTaiwan isn‚Äôt worried (about invasion from China‚Äù are often misleading. People like to spin it as if North Korea and China aren‚Äôt threats and that‚Äôs it‚Äôs all bluff. The realty is the military and government of South Korea and Taiwan are preparing for the worst and don‚Äôt fully take it as a bluff but the people get numb to everything and it gets normalized. 

I grew up in the ghetto and I was use to it (wasn‚Äôt too worried) even though the violence and gun shots where real. I‚Äôve moved on to an upper middle class life and I‚Äôm very scared now when i enter neighborhoods similar to what I grew up in.

Ugw52ZPXYsXKFGfp6w14AaABAg,"This video doesn't really convince me.  

When the entire peninsula got wrecked, then supposedly there should be just as much animosity in the south towards America.  But there's none to the extent as the north's.  So there's more to it than simply the destruction caused and I'm willing to bet it has much more to do who who's been in control and influencing people.  I honestly believe there would be a different tune sung in the south had the north won and vice-versa.  The brainwashing of people there is also nothing new to viewers and comes to no surprise as the other reason made in this video.  I was really hoping for more.

If you really want a better picture of things, you should to speak with people in NK.  But of course that's going to be next to impossible.  Any tourists I've known to visit NK were under guard and in highly choreographed and restrictive tours.  So perhaps you could interview someone who has fled from NK instead, which are many in SK.

The bomb shelter part is interesting but also not relevant to the main subject, I felt.  It's very common for civilian infrastructure like subways, basements, or parking garages to be designated as shelters, actually.  We have that here in the US as well.  You also see them used as such in the war in Ukraine and they can hold up surprisingly well.  Perhaps you were expecting all shelters to be built and designed specifically for that purpose.

Not hating or anything and I love your videos.  Just giving my thoughts on this particular one."

UgxBAAGoQ4B_L7wtdw54AaABAg,This is a really well done presentation about North Korea.  I am a Korean American immigrant who's been living in the U.S. since 1978.  Both my parents were born in North Korea and escaped communism during the Korean war.  The Korean war was profoundly traumatic and forever changed their psyche.

Otherwise, the wonderful South Korea we know today would not be a thing and be a hellscape like North Korea. War is still horrifying, and I hope the world can move towards the right direction without wars. But with dictators like Putin, it just seems impossible."
UgxKVIL24-qSwKnjRQN4AaABAg.9hOZUVh5urG9hOnDjvuBdG,"@FamousPlan Yes, believe what you will, NK is definitely a hellscape for common folks. Reform takes time, and the time that SK got after the war has proved it was the right choice. In the same time NK has where is it now? 

And also, two wrongs doesn't make one right. Just because US did wrong doesn't make Putin's action any lighter. And no, I don't believe US is an angel, but in this SK case, they did the right thing, considering the end result."

I want him to run for everything and if he was president maybe one of the Joe's could be his vice president."

In contrast, Japan went through even more serious horrors, but chose to pull themselves up and become world economic leaders. It's a little simplistic to blame this all on Russia and the US, or even China. Solutions are closer to home."

UgxtlTf_BmYjDdOX8MZ4AaABAg,U.S. culture is very reactionary and that's why every time there is any vague threat our media jumps on it to fear monger people and whip everyone into a frenzy. When you've grown up your whole life with a crazy leader just up north of where you live you start to quickly realize the pattern. When North Korea wants attention and media they release a a new threat and fire off a missle into the ocean but they DON'T actually mean it. South Koreans know this. If they overreacted every time one of the Kim's threatened them they'd never be able to live properly. You learn to just roll your eyes and go on with your day.

UgxaBhrDXDUgPQFHMsB4AaABAg,"War is always tragic, but we must not forget the phrase ‚Äúevil men only succeed if you let them‚Äù which is how WW2 started, and it remains the most destructive conflict in human history. 

N Korea wanted to jump on the expansionist and imperialist bandwagon by invading another sovereign nation while resorting to communism. And to avoid the errors of the past that countries like Germany and Japan teaches today, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd teach their children about the mistakes of the past. 

And because countries like Germany and Japan has come to terms with the past while being open to outsiders, we have built their economies into something that it has never been before. But N Korea will never have anything like that and their people continue to starve while a supreme leader focuses all their spending on military rather than the people.

Since we have a more powerful air force that‚Äôs already working on a 6th generation fighter jet, it‚Äôs likely we would do the same to punish Russia over Ukraine if they didn‚Äôt have nukes. Along with China if they invaded Taiwan and didn‚Äôt have nukes. But all we can really do is provide the little guy with weapons and hope they come out okay.

There‚Äôs a quote by Reagan that goes a little something like: 

‚ÄúWe cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, ""Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters.""

UgwlWC6OPt_edt4t0gJ4AaABAg,"I lived in Seoul for my entire life. Nuclear threat is real and acutally many people think like that more and more recently. We don't think it's okay. But we just have to accept and live our lives. Because S.Korea is not that big country like U.S so there's not so much space to disperse or escape from that threat. Even Tokyo has that threat because they can throw a missile over Japanese land. So we just decided that Seoul is dangerous as Busan or Tokyo. And we recently discovered that European countries or U.K are not safe for a nuclear attack, neither. Now. the only threat to Seoul is a missile attack, not a conventional attack like tanks. So our strategy is shifting to retaliating if a missile is hit. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. And that is entirely up to the US decision over S.Korea. Whether the US will launch a nuclear attack for S.Korea, or allow S.Korea to develop their own nuclear weapons, or just lend some US nuclear weapons to S.Korea like NATO.

And for South Koreans perspective your view of what North Korea thinks of the United States is wrong it's N.Korean point of view which is just propaganda."

I know it‚Äôs hard ‚Äî after all, the absolute majority of western media outlets are controlled by the USA ‚Äì but when you travel as much as he does it should be a given that you‚Äôre being lied to. 

Case in point: South Korea isn‚Äôt worried about the North because they are not the enemy. They don‚Äôt need to worry about bomb shelters because North Koreans don‚Äôt hate the South.

Japan held Korea on a chokehold for over 100 years. After that the US dropped more bombs in the country than the sum of bombs they dropped during WW2. Saying that they teach the kids about revenge is absurd. 

If a bear attacks your family and kills your father you don‚Äôt go after the bear. You get ready. It‚Äôs not about revenge; it‚Äôs about defense. After all, who knows when the bear is coming back again?

I was really excited about watching this video. Seeing what it turned out to be ‚Äì basic anti-communist propaganda ‚Äì saddens me."

UgwZKzv1W5XPSRJJKrV4AaABAg,"Whilst American mainstream news outlets do love to pump up the prospect of war for ratings, the thing that I took from this video was how unprepared SK has become in the case of a war. The fact that either old bomb shelters have been repurposed or underground facilities slap on  a bomb shelter sign for some bureaucratic compliance seems blas√© to me. For South Koreans, of course they wouldn't think about the prospect of war when NK and its nuclear tests have always been a regular part of their life - this doesn't mean the danger is false however. Most of us don't think about car accidents or natural disasters at all if they don't happen to us directly, yet it happens all around us and the chance is very much real. It reminds me of days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when some reporters on the ground in Kyiv interviewed people and asked if they were concerned and almost all people were not, just going about their lives as usual, thinking its a media beat up. You can't expect regular citizens to understand and be aware of military readiness and security intelligence. I'm not saying things should be any other way, but these are my thoughts from this video. Many thanks Johnny for offering such a unique look into this and congrats on the Emmy!"

UgzNxcZ5fuvMHuqbxOx4AaABAg,It‚Äôs crazy to think how different things would be if the US didn‚Äôt join WW2 and Germany wiped out the USSR. Then the US could have easily defeated the Germans as their armies would have been exhausted and supplies depleted and how different things would be. No German nazis and no Soviets to help North Korea. The US would be insanely more powerful than any other country could even dream. This outcome could have prevented all the proceeding conflicts with Russia and North Korea. Nuclear weapons wouldn‚Äôt be as plentiful and the only other country that would somewhat be a threat would be China (big maybe). I know the US definitely has blood on its hands but that definitely seems like a better option than total nuclear war bringing an end to all human progress in a matter of days.
Ugzl9ouEtT40OR66xix4AaABAg,"I worked in South Korea from 2014-2015 then when I finished my contract I went to North Korea for 12 days in autumn of 2015 via a British operated travel agency HQ'ed in Beijing (Koryo Tours)- I remember going to Pyongyang seeing how crazy deep the metro system was (can be repurposed as bomb shelters) and the some of the tunnels dug around Pyongyang from the war. The scars are still there. The only city with any intact buildings that predate 1945 in the DPRK are in Kaesong, and that's because it was originally part of South Korea before the war. 
It's also not just a defensive mentality  there. It's a revenge one as well. There's a museum south of Pyongyang at Sinchon devoted solely to American war atrocities. Are some of them embellished to serve as state propaganda? Sure. Do some ring true like mentioned in the video? Yes.  Anyways at this museum there's an outdoor amphitheater like area that is a ""revenge pledging place"" where school kids can go to pledge revenge on the United States. It's pretty grim stuff."

Much worse in North Korea but you get what I'm saying..."

UgwdDBrWJmRdJ26A3ZB4AaABAg,Can you do a video on the India and Pakistan border. The history and stuff behind it. Really like these videos.
Ugxn_s34F9vpHmbmUux4AaABAg,The podcast Blowback does a really good job covering the events leading up to the start of the Korean War if you are interested in more details.
UgzlCynz0tuulYHwJtZ4AaABAg,"Lol, was wondering why the author of the book was left out and why someone famous for Korean war stuides like Bruce Cummings wasn't cited, searching the title I find it is Charles K. Armstrong aaaaand, gee, maybe this is why,

_His 2013 book, Tyranny of the Weak, won the John K. Fairbank Prize, but he voluntarily returned it in 2017 after the American Historical Association asked him to account for issues with the citations, including plagiarism and source fabrication. He left Columbia in June 2020._

And of course Cummings _wasn't_ used surely because he gets to the actual heart of the matter: a direct indictment of the grotesque belligerancy of US ""full spectrum domination"" empire. We are literally the cause of all of these conflicts globally as they are stabilizing in their chaotic tensions and more importantly can be perpetually profitted from while we strip-mine the earth for resources, imposing neoliberal finance capitalism post-WWII through Bretton-Woods and our tentacles of financial domination in the IMF/World Bank. Cool stuff.

If anyone wants _actual_ depth, check out the podcast Blowback and their third season on what actually occured, with interviews with Bruce Cummings and other scholars standing in for the stylish hollow performance of any substance that this guy thinks accounts for any sort of understanding."
UgykzzbiPmKHbY4ZbmV4AaABAg,"Pretty sure it was a Pakistani nuclear scientist who gave them the knowledge to build the Bomb. Also, fairly certain that the North Korean museum doesn‚Äôt include the minor detail that it was they who invaded the South. I just wish Johnny had gone into exactly how long America not only had troops there but essentially governed the country; South Korea didn‚Äôt have meaningful elections until the mid 80‚Äôs. This was largely our mistake in Iraq and somewhat also in Afghanistan; a people who have never experienced democracy cannot embrace it so quickly. I think the French are on their fifth go around, and Germany is at least on its third."

UgyUG5EDK9LuNEGYm294AaABAg,"While it is certainly interesting that those in South Korea don't feel much concern/threat over North Korea, the same was true in Ukraine. Every interview I saw with Ukrainians leading up to the full-scale invasion dismissed a Russian attack on Kyiv as a possibility. Everyone they interviewed said it was all just western paranoia. So it might be sometimes that those too close to a brewing conflict might not have the best view of the bigger situation. Great video though."
UgxyYba3DTg8zWXjG7B4AaABAg,"Clearly the US is the aggressor here.

Ugzdcre6E0c8rROS7u14AaABAg,"It's really sad to think that people live under constant fear of bombardment. They are Pawns in a chess game between powerful nations. As in american, I apologize for the fact that my country decided to take military action on a nation that had such a rich history.

   Having bomb shelters around the city it's not something I would consider to be a solution. It just keeps people aware..... all the time. If the city is completely destroyed there won't be much to return to

   North Korea is basically a nation living in the 1950s perpetually. It gives them a sense of solidarity and community and that's a dangerous thing. They will stop at nothing to defend their land so we best just leave them alone and do our thing.


   On the other hand I realized that the leadership in North Korea is completely lunatic and the people need to rise up which they eventually will. They have access to the internet, the next Generations will make themselves heard by sneaking on to the world wide web.

If you just leave it up to the citizens, they will get together and ignore both governments. People just want to live their life


However johnny, at the end you stated that it was started by North korea. I would not necessarily consider that true since other nations drew the line. We need to be able to blame ourselves when necessary. I always put myself in someone else's shoes and I can understand the anger."
Ugzx42F6_Nz1TZTq46h4AaABAg,"Wait wait wait wait. You're saying ""they've not moved on"" (NK)? Would you ""move on"" when you were massacred by a war criminal with absolutely superior firepower just for the sake of it? And when it's still right in the neighbour's house?? And all this with total and complete impunity???

You don't ""move on"" from an abuse, unless there is justice and reparation. The USA hasn't even asked pardon for their crimes of war."

Ugx2EySWufa8Br1XoAR4AaABAg,"Dictators are egomaniacs by definition. They always underestimate their opponents. They start the war. They get bombed to dust. And they play victims. The real victim (South Korea) simply moved on.  The walled-off one is the poorest nation, the open-one is one of the richest. Fast forward 70 years, Putin is repeating Kim's mistake to the detriment of the Russian people (as well as the Ukrainians, obviously).  The real lesson is not to have a dictator. Easier said than done, though."

UgwiIFMn93GaOvC1VF94AaABAg,i feel like there was a very large gap in in my education growing up. I was told it was a war between north and south but the USA merely stepped in to help after the initial cold war divide. I only now just learned that truth. it does seem like a scary thing to live that close to north korea but i love how the people of seoul just lives on day by day as per normal. love it
UgwiIFMn93GaOvC1VF94AaABAg.9hOCS98GDTq9hQg6Sc25Ne,@Bro Ragnarok Its not about what I believe. Its about the timeline that is presented in this video. I legitimately do not understand how you could watch this video and takeaway that the US started the war. Video literally states that the communists in the north first secured commitments from both Russia AND china and then invaded the south without warning in June 1950.

UgwiIFMn93GaOvC1VF94AaABAg.9hOCS98GDTq9hPnE012YYI,"There is more of a gap that this video leaves out, a HUGE gap between the fall of Japan and the US entry, and it just starts as if the US and the USSR entered at the same time and divided it up, and so it's left unable to provide a good explanation for certain things like why the North decided to invade the South (just accrediting it to some nation of wanting to ""spread communism"") and why the North has not moved on while the South hasn't (which the video doesn't even try to explain). 

There is so much left off here. The phrasing it as if the Soviets and the US just equally, at the same time, ""invaded"" Korea and decided to ""split it up."" This is not historically accurate at all and he left off the fact that Korea had a united government called the PRK between the fall of Japan and the US invasion of Korea. The PRK government was largely comprised of Korean nationalists and Korean communists and there was initially more communists in the South than the North, and it was centered around grassroots local governments that arose after Japan pulled out called the people's assemblies.

After the US invaded Korea it setup the United States Army Military Government in Korea, which was an incredibly unpopular and brutal military dictatorship as it abolished the PRK government and dismantled the grassroots people's assemblies. There was huge protests against it in the Autumn Uprising which the US dictatorship responded to by massacring protestors. When the US government would then install Rhee and the later ROK government, protests would only increase more, leading to several other large-scale massacres like the Bodo League massacre where they are still digging up women and children in mass graves to this day, and the Jeju Massacre, after the people of Jeju island rebelled and the government responded by killing off a large portion of the population.

The video states that South Korea ""moved on"" yet North Korea hasn't, yet it never offers an explanation to why. But the explanation is to be found in the very thing he conveniently left off in this video, that the Southern government was incredibly unpopular since Korea just came out of a long history of Japanese colonialism and the Southern government imposed by the USA abolished grassroots organizations. This is in stark contrast to the Soviet Civil Administration which entered in the North as a response to the US invading the South but hardly had any presence at all in the Northern Korean government, and rather just had a small number of advisors mostly in Pyongyang who encouraged the pre-existing leadership to transform the PRK into something more akin to the Soviet political and economic system, leading to the formation of the DPRK.

The largely hands-off nature of the SCA made it perceived by the people of the North as an ally which wanted to help their nationalist struggle for national independence, while the US military government in the South literally massacred nationalists, and the later ROK government would continue this by the hundreds of thousands, burrying women and children in mass graves. The reason the North wanted to invade the South was because the nationalists in the North were in political power while the nationalists in the South were being killed off in a political genocide, and the North felt the need to intervene, while the video just makes Kim Il-sung sound like he just wanted to invade the South for no real reason. 

This also explains why the North never ""moved on"" while the South did. To be a nationalist in the South was to be shot in the back of the head and thrown into a mass grave. You either remained silent or died. Most Korean youth in the South these days don't even care about reunification anymore and one poll found 75% of South Korean youth describe the country as ""Hell"" and want to leave it. This is not to suggest the South has worse living conditions than the North or anything, but it is to show that Korean nationalism is largely dead in the South. Which is incredibly odd for a country that was under Japan colonial occupation to not have some nationalist tendencies! 

While the video does accurately describe the genocide the US attempted in the North, bombing elementary schools, hospitals, dams, etc, forcing people to live underground, the video seems to leave off the fact that the US is still performing war games on the North's border, practicing pretend invasions. They also, along with much of the world, continue to try and strangle them with economic sanctions. Both these things quite literally place the country under siege and very naturally lead to a siege mentality in the country and the feeling to always need to prepare for war."
UgwiIFMn93GaOvC1VF94AaABAg.9hOCS98GDTq9hPllCbSpTO,"Yeppp, I learned it was a war between the koreas too. When its North Korea vs US. And the US started the war."

UgyKlflE2yV0BPbqEJJ4AaABAg,"Honestly the museum you talk about doesn‚Äôt sound too different from things like the 9/11 museum in the US. it‚Äôs supposed to be a memorial to atrocities but also doubles as a propaganda machine that at least partially operates by using traumatic imagery reinforce nationalism and militarism, and yeah largely targeted at children through field trips etc. Given that 85% of buildings were destroyed it‚Äôs not too surprising that that this sort of sentiment is dialed up in North Korea."
UgxanhrYrF5g67pL3It4AaABAg,It‚Äôs because US kicked their ass in the Korean War and didn‚Äôt let the communist cancer occupy all of Korea.
UgymAEV2xZgNRZBdKZN4AaABAg,I wonder what would happen if both Russia and the US make a formal apology for the war and make amends.
UgzBlOtN4PhKYhRu9Np4AaABAg,I'm Australian and I am pretty sure that where I am is in range of nuke from country's like China and North Korea. but there just isn't a point in worrying about it. nukes are just not going to get used unless someone actually wants to end humanity or some really really really really bad mess ups happen. there are way more likely things to seriously hurt or kill you that are nukes. if you are in the US falling out of bed and getting crashed by vending machines is way more likely to kill or badly hurt you then an attack from any other country. for the rest of the world walking up stairs is the most deadly thing you deal with maybe other then driving I can remember which is higher.

Ugz_DiZD1O-sQHb0Yrh4AaABAg,"I remember when Kim Jung Un threatened to nuke Guam where I‚Äôm from, in like 2016.

I remember the panic everyone had in the island and even in middle school we did drills in case it ever happened. The only ones that didn‚Äôt care were all my Korean friends because their parents told them it‚Äôs not gonna happen."
Ugwf7Q7FypvtkTDmnUl4AaABAg,"Johnny, thank you for this informative video shedding light on the land of my ancestors and the DMZ. I am Korean American, born in Chicago in 1988. My views of North Korea and the Korean War have always been a mystery to me until later in my adult life and this video helped add more knowledge to the history of my people. 

Some history about my family in Korea. I found out in my adult life my great-grandfather was part of the first Korean government started in exile in Shanghai after the March 1914 Korean Independence Movement against Japanese Colonialism. My grandmother was born a few weeks after the March 2014 Independence Movement began, so she spent a chunk of her life in Shanghai. After WWII my great grandfather and his family moved back to the peninsula, but were forced to flee to the South when the Korean War began. Fast forward to the present day, I work for the Federal Government in the US. So I guess I'm continuing the family tradition of public service."

Ugzp_kRfi7uCuII-h2R4AaABAg,"North Korea like all dictatorships hate the U.S and the West, because culturally they know that people will incline to living a western style culture.

If North Koreans had access to IPhones, Samsungs, free Internet access, western clothing attire, western based films and games, western based home appliances.

By western, I mean ‚ÄúThe West‚Äù not western as in U.S western culture. Although I‚Äôm certain some people would be attracted to cowboy attire.

The North Korean dictatorship knows that their population would revolt against the regime. 

The supporters of regimes like in Russia, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua. They claim to hate the west and evil imperialism. 
OHHH but they like iPhones, Nike, American and European products. Don‚Äôt they??"

UgwfL0HENWDXHj-M9IV4AaABAg,"When you put ""neighbors"" in the title, i thought of all of NK's neighbors, which was the sk, jp and china, and also russia at this point.

And you stop mention china after kim visit to mao. And even mention japan as another us ally in the region. You just solely mention seoul and the sk which actually rather fond of the NK people, their hatred mostly only to the regime. Russia pay little attention i thought compared to what ussr did in conflict.

In my humblest understanding of geopolitics in east asia (which was shallow as anyone else's) as a person who only ever lived in a third world southeast asian country, is that the existence of nk (the status quo) now days really much beneficial to the countries surrounding it. The commie regime in mainland china didn't want heavily us allied country directly in their immediate border, japan cannot do much if theres any conflict in the region after being awfully demilitarized without bringing the us in, and sk cannot really afford the price to carry out integration of all nk people to the awfully different society and way of life and the influence from mainland china's regime to their foreign and domestic policy. 

And this video didn't mention the main issue of this conflict in my opinion, that is the separation of people of korea. How a country's history being dominated awfully by foreigners, emperor dethroned, being divided and influenced by foreigners, and separations of family, separation of culture, separation of people. From a nation that was pretty much as anyone else's. 

Whlist nk were able to distance itself from mainland's regime (at leasy publicly), sk and jp seemingly forget their hatred towards foreigner influence in their country and being dependent on it (no complain on jp though, i don't want to see that rising flag again being fly on my motherland here). Really different to what happened in korea in the immediate aftermath of ww2. At least jp were able to retain their unity and the emperorship, and china and nk made their own system of emperorship, sk has their emperor abroad and belong to other country.

In my shallowest opiniom, Korea's geography which borders directly to mainland china is the main culprit why it couldn't ever able to both koreas to reunify. All those separations of people and imminent catastrophe behind it didn't really matter to the powers involved to the matters, except,maybe, only to the people of sk. 

And maybe little attention from the west is another reason why they couldn't ever reunification in the hindsight. Whilst Germany has significant contribution to history of the west, korea wasn't much compared to neighbors. While germanies has strong similarity on cultural and society identity, current koreas wasn't. Whlist germanies didn't directly bordering to any of superpowers and easily reunified, koreas isn't. That's why koreas isn't germanies, and there's wouldnt be a eastasian union and Korea fill the significant role in it.

Lol didn't realize the comment would be this long, apologies to the awful English, not much people i was able to speak the language to (entirely in the internet). Nice video overall though. Thanks Johnny. 

Didn't matter how much mainland china's youth to sk's pop culture the country in particular never really want to directly bordered with it. I wonder was pochonbo ever really popular there? And if there's any way between the us and their enemies in the region, do koreas ever want to fight side by side with the japanese? Their animosity is beyond what was exist between the brits and the french."

Since their repressive regime was found on the enimity to the Americans, it has no other legitimacy rather than maintaining this enimity as a capital to perpetuate a cause for existence. The N.

UgyWCmZbUKgU6hCMf0l4AaABAg,"Great overview!  Also didn't shy away from how the propaganda goes both ways.  You mentioned the armistice agreement that settled on the 38th parallel and also how US nuclear weapons in South Korea allowed South Korea to become a thriving economy.  But there's a link between those two that is often missed and has huge bearing on the mindset of North Koreans: One of the main tenets of the armistice was that neither side was to introduce any new weapon types to the peninsula.  The nukes were a massive breach of the armistice (which is why it was top secret for years), and greatly increased fear and mistrust among North Koreans further playing into their stereotypes of Americans."

UgxcJtXPcdyPgNKmfjp4AaABAg,"It's funny how South Korea doesn't even think about North Korea at all (maybe their relatives).

Ugyti19vWhiugQA-35V4AaABAg,"This may be an unpopular opinion, a long strategic process that might take decades but I think the regime may fall from the dictator himself, not the current one but the next generation ok Kim's. I'm convinced that there might be a declination of suppressive and totalitarianism within the present leader compared to the previous, at least there's hope. I'll give a bold assumption that for one day, their economy might possibly collapse due to isolation, the best case scenario would be cutting off ties with their top trading partner, China. In this way, the supreme leader would somehow be forced to open up the country and allow access to trading with the rest of the world in an exchange for giving up their military arsenals. ( I know this negotiation attempt failed previously ) This is not the 90's anymore, with this situation coming into play, the population might starve but I would never assume that they will revolt due to how they were treated to obey the one's that ruled them, just a desperate dictator that is willing to let go of his possessions for economic stability. My perspective is pacifistic as much as possible but close to impossible. I just don't want their neighbors to suffer from a Nuclear disaster after poking the hornest 's nest."

UgxsQZye9f9tMPnYA9x4AaABAg,"Another great in-depth presentation - thank you Johnny!  Once you look at how the military industrial complex has shaped and influenced Americans on world views, you really start to tear down the walls of where we actually fit in the world.  Just as North Korea presents propaganda to their youth, we in America are having the same done to us.  Our politicians are bought and paid for by industries that control the wealth and resources of this country.  Those indutries pay the ad revenue that media companies depend on and therefore shape their programming we indulge in."

UgztPHxmZ59Rn1RLTJt4AaABAg,"As a Singaporean, women are usually a lot more ignorant when it comes to national defence and external threats.

UgzwB5au4W7VTQBIC7N4AaABAg,"The thing is if North Korea ever tried to conquer the south again they could probably inflict a lot of damage and kill a lot of people but they would eventually lose unless they were bailed out by China again. South Korea and its allies have modern 21st century militaries that in many ways vastly outclass NKs 20th century army of half starved conscripts, although it‚Äôs pretty massive. Another invasion would mean the end of the Kim regime so it‚Äôs in their interests despite their goal to reunite the peninsula to keep the peace. It‚Äôs probably for this reason that South Korea isn‚Äôt too worried about an attack these days."
UgzOhCtD9nqBsefGinV4AaABAg,"I was always in denial that a world war could break out in the future. War was the thing of the past.

UgzwYuRAnwrz4I04LqJ4AaABAg,"Even if nuclear weapons were launched at them, they wouldn't have any time to run to a shelter, as warheads move too fast.

UgwwBqnvwbXf6RyvOXh4AaABAg,"I love your videos but unfortunately this video only adds yet another misleading media take that shows a one sided view. But in this case it is from the viewpoint of people who think like you. To make such a blanket statement that all Americans care so much about what happens in north Korea is incredibly inaccurate. You are watching news reports and movies and they made you believe that people are truly concerned about this topic but it is mostly an elusion. Come walk thru main st America and ask the same questions you've ask in south Korea about our city bomb shelters and if they're afraid of being bombed and you will get quite similar answer. Nobody actually thinks about this stuff on a daily basis. More people will most like be afraid of the pigeons on the street just like that girl in the video haha. I think in reality we want to believe we care that much so people act like our country is afraid.

I have clips of the president saying exactly that, to then blame them on their starvation never allowing the idea of us forcing starvation on them. The nuclear bomb is not the dprk states attempt at keeping the state, but the prevention of starvation. It is the means to the right to live. It‚Äôs logical. It‚Äôs exactly how I‚Äôd play it out if I were in their shoes no matter the political ideology. The destruction brought upon any nation in that manner would have devastated and starved any nation no matter political ideology, especially with the forced economic isolation. Be it capitalism, fascism, or socialism. I what other choice did they have? Even if they didn‚Äôt believe their own ideology, what else could they of done?

No, if we had not come to Korea ALL of Korea would be the same hell hole as N. korea. And it was not Koreans vs. Koreans before the USA arrived, it was USSR and China vs. Korea. And NO, USSR and USA were not friends at the end of WWII."
Ugw7BsM4n18QhwbYneB4AaABAg,"I guess I'm one of the few people to dislike this video. Not that this comment will get any attention from anyone, but it is not your place to yell ""trauma"" and ""this is just sad."" You can do it to anyone that holds a grudge: act like you are made out of a different substance where the noblest thing is to pity the malformed. I could cause you all sorts of harm that you would not forgive me for, but I am not so ignoble as to ever hold that against you.

Not every problem is caused by people refusing to go to therapy. It is a selfish delusion. Causing harm for the sake of harm is the forefront example of nihilism, this is only another‚Äîa world in which actions do not matter, where all can be forgiven, where resentment can only expose a lack of character."
UgxSOZmEgB8qqJdqCrh4AaABAg,"I did a project on North Korea for school (I had a few good months to prepare for it) and it sure would have been nice to have this video back then! After reading through many websites, books, and endless documentaries--I arrived at the same conclusions you did. The world is far more worried about an upcoming war than South Koreans. I also delved into the perspective of the people of North Korea's side on this, and they aren't as hopeless as my American History class taught. The more generations of the dynasty pass, the less faith North Koreans have in it. The younger generations are starting to peek out into the rest of the world the more technology advances and slips into the country. It's my belief that there will be a time when the people of North Korea earn peaceful prosperity, but that will have to come from themselves. Not the USA, or any other country. 

Very awesome video!! I look forward to others!"
UgxSOZmEgB8qqJdqCrh4AaABAg.9hNxxw6EEtu9hOtJy5MVgo,North Korea is extremely complicated and if the war ends it won't be pretty afterwards either
UgxSOZmEgB8qqJdqCrh4AaABAg.9hNxxw6EEtu9hOZSmvMB1K,"I Remember when I was in the Marines during Trumps term when people said it was about to go nuclear, many of my peers from what I can tell didn't want that war to break out but we were ready to go if needed, our higher ups however were foaming from the mouth for a new war to start.  

Then on one Friday after PT I went back to my shop then went to the smoke pit and one guy looked on his phone and said ""oh shit, north and south Korea signed a peace treaty finally"" it was just a few of us there and after he said that it was quiet for a sec, it sounded unthinkable yet so believable, I just said ""really, huh, cool"" in a settle acceptance of knowing everything was gonna be ok.  We got further confirmation later that day from our higher ups during our safety brief for the weekend but it was quite a peaceful day."

Ugxw8_ZIOfsUeTUOWxd4AaABAg,"The US may invade North Korea soon. This is probably the last chance to do it. South Korea‚Äôs aging is catastrophic. Also, the propaganda in this video is annoying. US and SU were not friends. And Pakistan is behind the development of North Korea‚Äôs nukes."
Ugwd_qXsEFjxzZ1Tj1F4AaABAg,"But when you think about it, america really was like a hitler to these north korean people. I really feel like we in the west keep thinking we all are great, we fight for freedom. And all the bad people are always communist or nazi dictators.

UgzoxKz_9nblEKY6SE94AaABAg,I was in South Korea in 2017/18 when every media outlet made it seem like a nuclear war was going to happen. I don‚Äôt think a single person I met even mentioned what the rest of the world thought was happening. P.s. Jeju is an amazing place to visit!
UgzoxKz_9nblEKY6SE94AaABAg.9hNusqWf0Tc9hQ_33UJ64T,Ukraine didn't take seriously too days after being invaded and shelled so... sometimes it's ok to fear what might actually happen especially when it comes to a country with a border filled with communists and terrorists like N. Korea and Russia for instance
UgzoxKz_9nblEKY6SE94AaABAg.9hNusqWf0Tc9hQ4mVjdUHI,"Jeju is awesome, great memorial to rember the US backed genocide there."

UgzoxKz_9nblEKY6SE94AaABAg.9hNusqWf0Tc9hPih3XKeLv,"It's a little weird that you only mention Jeju as a great place to visit, considering that the massacre was literally the instigator of the Korean War."
UgzoxKz_9nblEKY6SE94AaABAg.9hNusqWf0Tc9hPRsYIyinD,Jeju is awesome. Good orange juice
UgzoxKz_9nblEKY6SE94AaABAg.9hNusqWf0Tc9hPRhAhuLr5,"That's so interesting because it often times strengthens that phrase ""ignorance is bliss"". I don't mean that in a demeaning way, rather that the mass populace honestly have no idea of the real danger they face. Often times the military knows what's going on but they are under no obligation to tell the press. Also, Western media NEEDS viewership to stay alive. The more drama they infuse with a story the more viewers watch - which is probably why the West fears N Korea more than S Koreans do."

Ugy51-OseX26ivgExxp4AaABAg,"really enjoying the spin on this one, you really need to educate yourself before putting out this garbage, no mention of syngman rhee and the leadership that the usa put in power, no mention that there were many incursion beyond the 38th by south korean forces before any incursion from the north, no mention of the un barring the real government of china from representation, no mention of macarthur, no mention that until the 80's north korea was a more prosperous country than the south and had sent substantial aid south following the war, no mention of the brutal sanctions and blockades, lame"
UgyAIFQn9p_Zo741eOx4AaABAg,You should go to North Korea and see their version and have more
UgyBWogYPaIgZICRWNN4AaABAg,great video
UgzQP_MIhoM-VEd4Jqp4AaABAg,"Funny how the north starts it but also get the most butthurt.  Don't fuck around if you don;t want to find out is my advice. Everything that happened to NK was NK's own fault. If they didn;t invade their neighbor no air strikes.

And something you leave out. South Korea isn;t scared because the media doesn't focus on it, intentionally. It's good for Americans be ready to help but not helpful to have SK scared when they are such a strong economy. Not mentioning this is basically lying."
UgybRiusNO4wUA2Wd0l4AaABAg,"The video didn't really explore the question.
More so went into Korean War background from perspective of the North."
UgyOKrJk7gvv6StgaCh4AaABAg,"The USSR did provide troops, in the form of Mig pilots. Ours were better. And the DMZ is littered with more landmines than you can shake a forest at! As for the shelters, they're about the same as many, if not most of our old Civil Defence shelters. But ours had supplies in most of them."

UgyIJAHdKZj_hsHHpEF4AaABAg,"""8th country to obtain nuclear weapons""
Nope.
US, USSR, UK, PRC, France, Israel, India, and Apartheid South Africa also had them. South Africa is the only country to have ever voluntarily dismantled its nuclear weapons. Though former Soviet states did give their weapons to Russia."

UgxA4yw_KS8GmVBu9Jp4AaABAg,Long story short...surprise surprise....our government and media wants to keep us in fear.....
UgxK_eTnoo53rMYLfJV4AaABAg,"I lived in South Korea as an English teacher for 14mths, the people there just feel really sad for the residents in the North who are starving and cut off from the world. Many have family stuck in North Korea to this day. Very surreal to think in 2022 that a dictator can cut an entire country off from what's actually going on in the world and still rule with propaganda."
UgzppPUrkgggs21zWAB4AaABAg,"Love your work Johnny. But you kinda glossed over the whole ‚Äúthey use this fear to keep their people oppressed‚Äù and pushed more of the ‚Äúthey do it cause US burned their country.‚Äù This comes off a bit as some propaganda more slanted toward the DPRK. South Korea also was not thriving until the tech boom in the 1990s, and was a much worse place to live than North Korea before that. After the CCCP collapsed in ‚Äò91, they switched in terms of life quality, and now South Korea (more specifically Seoul) is a mini America. You need more experience out of Seoul, as the people there are not the same as everywhere else. Seoul is to South Korea as Santa Monica is to the USA."
UgyWIKdEl1EISQzryZF4AaABAg,Do a video about the Warsaw uprising.

UgzkEcFuw39VFxPvra54AaABAg,Saying that they don't think about the chance of war is like asking people if they constantly think about how they will die. No one likes to spend their day to day lives thinking about negative things. They would rather spend time thinking about nicer things and pretending like something bad will never happen to them. If tomorrow the US said they would not interfer in any conflict between north and south Korea and pulled out of the region you bet your ass the people of Seoul will start to think about what would happen from the north.

UgymZZzSPn3uOoDLmUR4AaABAg,"Johnny,
It seems that you are interested in the truth, so please, if you are a brave journalist, make a video about the nuclear bombs that were used in Japan under the pretext of ""ending the war"" and in reality *testing the effectiveness of America's new mass killing toy on the ppl*"
Ugz4IZrTFQGhtg7DduZ4AaABAg,"Note here that the Koreans did decide what kind of country they wanted, not with American or Soviet ""help."" They created the PRK, a domestically-developed proto-communist government not strictly aligned with the Soviets. In the south this democratic government was outright banned and its leader eventually assassinated.

In the North, the Soviets pushed for a more centralized state which became the DPRK. The sole successor state to the PRK. Note however the south has had many revolutions and coups since then, and is no longer simply an autocratic American puppet regime. South Korea may have been an illegitimate state at birth but that does not necessarily say anything about its current condition."
Ugzq0GRq3oPrvffyM1J4AaABAg,My favorite youtuber...more of this johnny
UgyF0PPGLwgbdTLQIsx4AaABAg,"""city that moved on"". That's the definition of a place where the majority of people are still selling their worked hours for drastically less than they deserve while a dozen assholes live better than kings (that's the reality of everything capitalist country btw)."
UgyZ8q9CSqdcaWCGIJF4AaABAg,Just more imperialist propaganda. Nothing new under the sun.
UgzfY1iMxdhRQsGXGBh4AaABAg,Great content and story telling but as usual the editing it terrible. There is no need to keep flicking from shot to shot/pointless photo every few seconds with a mix shaky talking to the camera. It really is a terrible style and completely unnecessary. I wonder how many people go away with a headache after watching a Harris video.
UgwRvNaZs4-rX-IsOFZ4AaABAg,Ad ends at 4:21
UgyYIhLXvEv5vGuIEz54AaABAg,"To be fair,  this video was better. I'm glad South Koreans are way over the war. Hopefully, North Koreans will do one day.

PS: Your idea of forgetting the awful things done by the US military over there, and calling propaganda its remembrance at that museum, needs more perspective. It reminded me of when Barack Obama told former Argentinian Socialist president Kristina Fernandez de Kirschner to forget the old practices of its predecessors overthrowing democratically elected presidents to install dictatorship puppets in my region. America is now ""different"", they don't ""do"" those things anymore, he said.  He bombarded Libya and he declared my country a national threat, building up the sanctions that came later. To be clear here, sanctions are another word for bombarding. I think Europenas will finally understand this in the following years, they will become the new United States subject. Welcome to the club :)"
UgwfYmaS1iyFk_n02f14AaABAg,"i dont know about different countries bombshelters but here there are shelters who are not the traditional shelters with a fallout style door, just a basement with reinforced walls so it wont collapse. no food or water is stored just basic first aid kit. it would be used as a way to collect and keep people safe for the first attack"

Half asked bomb shelters don't seem smart considering they're 40ks from the nuclear ""pit bull of China"" as my dad would say. And yet, they seem fine with it in the south, don't even think about how their neighbours could absolutely level their nation in a weekend. That seems strange, right? Or maybe that's the western influence in me. More power to them, in the south I mean. More power to the students, to the small business owners, to the industrialists, to the retired grandparents and so on. God bless South Korea üá∞üá∑"

Ugx6FPxpLF0wa6-g0q94AaABAg,100 percent agree. Seoul is phenomenal on the weekends and no one there cares about nK. you get closer to the border in the training areas and it is weird for an American to see a tank in someone's lawn. but to each his own

UgwT_XI9EZipMljj5Qp4AaABAg,Truman literally ordered the drop of nuclear bombs on Japan. How could the Soviet Union have doubted his resolve?
UgyjY9sNEqHDim1788F4AaABAg,"Johnny thank you for showing us the ""bomb shelters"" üòÇ"
UgzeVFSVrV5y8FHHPEF4AaABAg,"I wonder if there's a demographical element when it comes to worrying about North Korea, or if there is a conscious or subconscious effort within the minds of Seoul metropolitan residents to divert their thoughts thoughts away from war. Because the responses I see here are completely different from my experience (and I am from a southern region in South Korea). The dreadful truth is that, in the opening minutes of war, North Korean artillery barrage will target key infrastructures and corporate holdings compactly placed within Seoul metro area. Within the first hour, tens, if not, hundreds of thousands would have already perished. South Koreans take this matter very seriously and do think about them from time to time in my experience. More than 70% of Koreans think that they should possess nuclear weapons as well as a deterrent against China and North Korea. South Korea's military-industrial complex is slowly becoming a behemoth of its own. Placement of THAAD is still a hotly debated issue."
UgzvpqsoWcpeAdm3b214AaABAg,People have to understand that socialist countries don't win anything by destroying others. They have the weapons to defend themselves against the capitalist empires. Let's talk about the yearly US military drills on the South Korean border. How can you let your guard down?

UgwECf6WMua1mztKsPx4AaABAg,"Great video! I've been living in South Korea for a while now and I agree - Koreans really aren't too fazed by North Korea. They see it as connected to (South) Korea and hope for one day that it will reunified however it's really interesting that as a foreigner living over here, the dangerous rhetoric is only ever from an American lens. Thank you once again Johnny!"
UgxkfLCcus-bK3vty-l4AaABAg,"To be fair, I watched a video of a journalist on the ground interviewing Ukrainians right before Putin invaded and all of them said there was no way there was going to be a war."
UgzZ28Nu7HQvkvTeEdZ4AaABAg,Very good job in that documentary about this border but you have missed very interesting and harsh reality that has happened in Europe. I am talking about Albania that has a similar past as North Korea (you can cover the bunkers part) and it was the most isolated country in Europe and also worldwide. Regarding to the borders of Albania it‚Äôs only country in the Europe and in the whole world that is surrounded by him self. In the 1913 The UK separate this nation and made those border ridicules. You should study this story to cover on your documentary. Take care
Ugx2FiXtIWz0btVrSrN4AaABAg,North Korea suffered when it invaded.  North Korea has suffered ever since.  Strong man leadership rather than democracy does not work so well.
UgyD0C2CQYCZ8f7bCtR4AaABAg,"i love your videos so much. I discovered you through your brilliant explanation as to why putins war isn't working in his favour, and skin discovered how amazing your explanations are in all areas. another great video."
UgxiUun5u7it7VxQmXF4AaABAg,It true hypocrisy that US tells the world that it is the only guardian of human rights in world and on the other hand it does all the things that hurts it's ego. What was the fault of North Korean people why they got this destruction by foreign nation? And what was fault of Syrian people why there life bombed by US? Why Vietnam people and their land got bombed by foreign nation like US? Why US invade afghanistan in the name of soviet Union would have invade it? All the destruction caused in the world has US Played role in it. By seeing all these war by US I think Russia being automatic nation is more better than oldest democracy. US is worst PREPRATATOR to  human till date.
Ugyb9-563D1TyKJCdeJ4AaABAg,"As crazy as North Korean leaders are, I think South Koreans are keenly aware that even North Korean's crazy leaders understand that if North Koreans ever try to take out the South (or Japan or any other country), it would only take few minutes for US and its allies to turn North Korea into a parking lot."
UgwBv-6Ffe6rQli_iZJ4AaABAg,"History proves that nothing good happens when you do not move on and be a stuck-up SOB. Perfect example is these two countries, one poor and driven by hate, the other moved on and bettered themselves."

Ugw2BeBj8kOriKaU5Nl4AaABAg,can we apply his view of north korea keeping the memory of the war alive as propaganda for children to the western holocaust fetish?
UgznmFB8I0IoiMIK1u14AaABAg,"How can someone make such an empty interpretation of North Korea. You said it yourself, the US bombed everything and the people should just move on?
It's a socialist country, with a government of workers, it's the real menace of the capitalist world, of course they have to defend themselves. Capitalism will never stop the fear mongering against socialist countries until every one of them is gone. Why? Because a workers government is the real threat. 
I can't possibly teach you communism and anticommunist propaganda in one comment, but i wanna know something about you.
In the beginning of the video, you said you used to work at a Think Tank? Tell us more about that. Who put so much money up your ass you started spitting out all this bullshit?"

UgwEMgPzvvSaVFncn8J4AaABAg.9hNq0Mtklaz9hRJRxDikvN,@ËâæÁ±≥ÂøÉamihart I understand Syngman Rhee was just as crazy as Kim Il Sung.  They both had supremacist philosophy for One Korea and Juche.    Also the North Koreans had huge issues that the US took Japan back as an ally and prior to the war hated the Japanese more than the Americans at the time.  I know South Korea is today what it is (a really nice country) but not without consequences.

UgwEMgPzvvSaVFncn8J4AaABAg.9hNq0Mtklaz9hPnauTntpG,Read About Face by David Hackworth
UgwEMgPzvvSaVFncn8J4AaABAg.9hNq0Mtklaz9hPmhLeyMoe,"You actually don't know much because the video is still just more US state propaganda like all his other videos. There is so much left off here. For example, the phrasing it as if the Soviets and the US just equally, at the same time, ""invaded"" Korea and decided to ""split it up."" This is not historically accurate at all and he left off the fact that Korea had a united government called the PRK between the fall of Japan and the US invasion of Korea. The PRK government was largely comprised of Korean nationalists and Korean communists and there was initially more communists in the South than the North, and it was centered around grassroots local governments that arose after Japan pulled out called the people's assemblies.

After the US invaded Korea it setup the United States Army Military Government in Korea, which was an incredibly unpopular and brutal military dictatorship as it abolished the PRK government and dismantled the grassroots people's assemblies. There was huge protests against it in the Autumn Uprising which the US dictatorship responded to by massacring protestors. When the US government would then install Rhee and the later ROK government, protests would only increase more, leading to several other large-scale massacres like the Bodo League massacre where they are still digging up women and children in mass graves to this day, and the Jeju Massacre, after the people of Jeju island rebelled and the government responded by killing off a large portion of the population.

The video states that South Korea ""moved on"" yet North Korea hasn't, yet it never offers an explanation to why. But the explanation is to be found in the very thing he conveniently left off in this video, that the Southern government was incredibly unpopular since Korea just came out of a long history of Japanese colonialism and the Southern government imposed by the USA abolished grassroots organizations. This is in stark contrast to the Soviet Civil Administration which entered in the North as a response to the US invading the South but hardly had any presence at all in the Northern Korean government, and rather just had a small number of advisors mostly in Pyongyang who encouraged the pre-existing leadership to transform the PRK into something more akin to the Soviet political and economic system, leading to the formation of the DPRK.

The largely hands-off nature of the SCA made it perceived by the people of the North as an ally which wanted to help their nationalist struggle for national independence, while the US military government in the South literally massacred nationalists, and the later ROK government would continue this by the hundreds of thousands, burrying women and children in mass graves. The reason the North wanted to invade the South was because the nationalists in the North were in political power while the nationalists in the South were being killed off in a political genocide, and the North felt the need to intervene, while the video just makes Kim Il-sung sound like he just wanted to invade the South for no real reason. 

This also explains why the North never ""moved on"" while the South did. To be a nationalist in the South was to be shot in the back of the head and thrown into a mass grave. You either remained silent or died. Most Korean youth in the South these days don't even care about reunification anymore and one poll found 75% of South Korean youth describe the country as ""Hell"" and want to leave it. This is not to suggest the South has worse living conditions than the North or anything, but it is to show that Korean nationalism is largely dead in the South. Which is incredibly odd for a country that was under Japan colonial occupation to not have some nationalist tendencies! 

While the video does accurately describe the genocide the US attempted in the North, bombing elementary schools, hospitals, dams, etc, forcing people to live underground, the video seems to leave off the fact that the US is still performing war games on the North's border, practicing pretend invasions. They also, along with much of the world, continue to try and strangle them with economic sanctions. Both these things quite literally place the country under siege and very naturally lead to a siege mentality in the country and the feeling to always need to prepare for war."
UgwEMgPzvvSaVFncn8J4AaABAg.9hNq0Mtklaz9hPiZGnyMIT,"Yeah it's really suspicious that he ignored the Jeju Massacre, which is literally the instigator of the Korean War and was entirely South Korea's responsibility."

UgzEe-pDvpNHQJWEkRh4AaABAg,"While I‚Äôm glad this perspective is being represented, I think you missed a few really important points: North Koreans have been suspicious of Americans ever since the General Sherman incident in 1866; the North Koreans are really an extension of the Choseon dynasty in many ways and the failure of diplomacy to garner any support to stop the Japanese occupation of Korea for over 30 years has had a larger impact than the Korean War; It wasn‚Äôt just Kim Il Sung pushing for invasion, in the south Syngman Rhee also was pushing the US to support an invasion of the North. There are a lot of other really important notes in this conflict and I respect that you can‚Äôt make videos that are too long, but this still feels overly American centric."

UgwcqJorODU2SVVpc4Z4AaABAg,"Ninth country, actually."
UgyyDC082awOW67ntJ54AaABAg,"Here‚Äôs a radical idea for all of you. I believe that because the conflict has been a stalemate for the last 70 years, and that more and more young people in the South are not interested in Korean reunification, I suggest the conflict should be resolved with a two-state solution, the reason being is because while North Korea‚Äôs nuclear threats are real, they are primarily targeted at a domestic audience there. 

Additionally, I believe that the U.S. military should still be deployed in South Korea, not to contain the north, but rather keep East Asia secure such as to avoid and become a deterrent the hypothetical war scenario in the island of Taiwan. 

I believe such a deal to end the war should be negotiated with help from neutral countries like Singapore, and Costa Rica, and not Switzerland because of their new collective neutrality policy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sweden could also get involved in this, but their NATO aspirations, could negatively impact the negotiations unless logical thinking prevails to decide whether or not Sweden (America‚Äôs protecting power in North Korea) should be part of the bargaining chip. Additionally, the U.N. should get involved while also opening up a telephone line between Pyongyang and Washington to keep lines of communication open to prevent a hypothetical Cuban style missile crisis. 

The closest to reunification lastly, should be in the form of a political union between the two Koreas (think one peninsula, two systems under this E.U. style legislative scenario) where cross border travel can be free to citizens of both countries. This stalemate won‚Äôt end with an overnight solution, but given the hardline stance the center right government of South Korea, in contrast to their soft line left wing counterparts, this stalemate should end gradually and not immediately (hense the lessons from Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s) so that life in Korea can move on in peace.

P.S. If Nukes are kept in North Korea, the United Nations should handled them I believe as a way to prevent existential threats as a collective unit along with other U.N. Members."

UgzuRswSiwqAaEYfsBR4AaABAg,"Your image of a bomb shelter probably is something 15 stores underground with a bank vault kind of a door.
As a fact, as war in Ukraine continues, most common shelters are: subway stations, underground garages, basements, factories, etc. Basically everything that is ‚Äòmonumentally‚Äô built and can withstand air strike. It is not an underground disneyland and most certainly does not have all resources for hundreds of people to survive. That‚Äôs why also emergency backpack is so important. 
As you might remember Azovstal/Mariupol story in Ukraine. City is nearly 100% destroyed and last standing was massive steel factory Azovstal due to its massive constructions, fortified structures and series of technical tunnels, etc. 
It is absolutely impossible to have ‚Äòall-inclusive‚Äô shelters for the whole population"

UgxF6CLSqDJ2xC3-vAl4AaABAg,people that think North Korea posses any kind of aggressive threat they've been watching too many movies. The only reason they exist is because China finds them to be a semiuseful scapegoat or distraction for America. Almost any other civilized country could wipe them off the map but not before Seoul would be destroyed. They're lucky that they're next to one of the largest financial centers in the world with firepower almost too primitive to block out.

We drove to the NK border and stopped in a little town to look around. We got stopped by armed guards and interrogated. We were told politely to leave and to delete all pictures of border. Even though the town was advertised as a tourist town. We left, but had a car follow us to the edge of town. We decided to drive to the NK/Russia/China border (where all three countries meet). We got stopped by the police, our car searched, and told not to take pictures. There is more to my trip, but it was intense. It was the best trip, but also highly stressful."

UgyGZMmTlz2MQbr953h4AaABAg,"imo friends between us and ussr is a big word. They had to be allies to defeat reich but it was rather from pragmatic way. There were always problems with soviet help. West tried to help Poland back then few times but it was impossible to fly to Poland and go back a the same tank. Unfortunately soviets didn‚Äôt want to free their airports up for allies forces and west had to drop help.

Also you say that north Korea has a lot of powerful weapons. Look what is happening with russia forces in Ukraine. North Korea has even older stuff straight from ww2.
Yes, they will cause a lot of deaths and pain eventually but i think they are afraid of attacking anybody. It is just flexing in front on their citizens to justify the way they live.

She finds a color picture and I tell her it's a fake, or colorized, or taken from South Korea, so it looks like there is color. I realize this is not funny and not a funny situation, but North Korea was and continues to be a global concern. Making light of the situation makes it less scary? Anyway, good job and keep them coming!!!"

UgwCeqBL5P1S0oI2O3J4AaABAg,"The USA and USSR were not ‚Äúfriends‚Äù during WWII. They were just the two biggest powers who happened to be fighting Germany. Stalin‚Äôs spies had already infiltrated the Manhattan project well before the bombs dropped on Japan. By mid to late 1944, the Allies already knew who was going to win in Europe and they were already debating who should get what territory conquered from the Nazis. Don‚Äôt forget that Stalin was on Hitler‚Äôs side until operation Barbarossa. Stalin also honored his non-aggression pact with Japan until after the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan. He clearly only attacked Japan at the end for the geographical wins. 

That being said I‚Äôm sure you already knew all this and just tried to condense it all together for the length of the video. Just trying to help others be aware of the nuances during this time period. I personally don‚Äôt believe the Cold War ever ended, and we are still seeing the ramifications today.

UgxGSHhotW5ixCxQHZp4AaABAg.9hNeyJIeArx9hPb92wO8cm,"I've been to Vietnam too and visited the War Genocide museum in Ho Chi Minh City. It too highlighted the war crimes and atrocities committed by US forces during the Vietnam War -- but I walked out and throughout my stay, found no visible sign of hatred towards America among regular Vietnamese. North Korea's museum to indoctrinate hatred towards the US is similar to China's museums teaching the same about Imperial Japan. The larger goal is to legimitize the ruling party and their justification for their rule. By constantly propagating the United States remains a threat to North Koreans, Kim Jong-un justifies building up his army and staying in power. China constantly bringing up anti-Japan sentiments reminds people how the Communists 'unified' China. If United States really wanted to attack North Korea, they would have done it right after the Soviet Union collapsed. They haven't. Neither has Japan threatened N. Korea in decades. And yet North Korea keeps firing missiles close to Japan. Their actions are to constantly remind North Koreans about the past because they are still stuck in the past. Helps when North Koreans have no access to a free internet and media that isn't under state control."

UgwWz5u0C5_qMTNL8AV4AaABAg,"Johnny is one of the best storytellers on the youtube. Only when you watch people who cannot logically put sentences together - do you appreciate simple storytelling ability. At two family gatherings previous month, I re-told the story heard here previously about the Spanish monk who advocated for the northern California sea-route to Spain - just to bore everyone to death for 40 minutes. Also this video is a story - and no matter how punctual or precise historically (I'm guessing mostly) - it's the story that's more important than the 110% historical precision - of course, bearing in mind one doesn't mix up the key aspects of the reality. Also - another country not moving on and feeding on its 80 year old lymfoid of rotten, bloody and useless patriotism, is Russia. It's feeding on - and throwing down the throats of its citizens - an overly sentimental, distorted, broken past of the ""heroes of our grandads"" - mixing it up with youth education, propoganda, huge marking of anniversaries, symbolism in the entire country - while the poeple are drowning in the endless mass of lies and self-idolism coming from the self-imagined Tsar - a madness that is spilling over to other countries where people don't want anything to do with that crap.

Some south koreans don't really care about the history behind Japan and Korea, however others sincerely takes Japan as a real enemy from the past. These kind of thought (sharing enemy) is making two Koreas stays cool instead of fighting each other."
UgwAnlELzVRNMPuKptd4AaABAg,"Great video, thank you! 

But I'm still asking why: why are the people in South Korea calm? 
Why do they think they're unlikely to be attacked by North Korea?
I've done absolutely no research, but we could speculate:
-North Korea would find itself in a terrible situation with the western powers
-The South Korean Government works hard to create a peaceful atmosphere which is conducive to a healthy economy

But then, why does the U.S. media make us feel worried?
-Attention grabbing for more media viewers?
-More gun buyers?

What do you think?"

Why doesn't the US formally end the war to ensure peace? Obviously, North Korea is in a tenuous political situation to say the least, but one could argue that war and tensions between the US and North Korea has fueled massive resentment and reactionary beliefs, which empowers the authoritarian government. It seems like it'd be better diplomatically to ease tensions.

My only memory of the departure was being on a ship from Yokohama during a typhoon.  I suppose the evacuation was scary for my parents but they never shared any sense of fear with the three of us even when we were old enough to understand.  We landed back in San Francisco on August 19, 1950, according to the family passport."
UgymppGnqK8GRAH0NnV4AaABAg,why would they be afraid? NK knows that if they start something it will come back to bite them in the ass. America is the most powerful military country on earth and yet they see everyone as a threat. Who are we to say they can't have nukes? Ridiculous

UgzYgKTplV3WTMUWbbh4AaABAg,What a fucking video everything is perfect like literally everything i wanted to know now i know thank u so much
UgxlSqyIngNNYFzbmyp4AaABAg,"A few things that should have been in this video:
The Kim Family and their Sycophants have perfected keeping the population of North Korea in Fear, but not fear of the US, South Korea, etc. but rather in Fear of being shipped off to one of the less desirable cooperative farms for a life of brutally hard work due to the lack of modern farm equipment and slow starvation as the elete of Pyongyang get most of the food...
The Artillery of North Korea threaten Seoul with shells that contain high explosives, incendiaries, or chemical weapons, with the latter being the biggest threat. However, the drones, missiles and helicopter gunships of the South & United States can take out most of those artillery pieces within minutes of an attack rendering them a paper threat...
The Nuclear Weapons of the North require a reliable launch system, something that the North doesn't have due to electronics needed, and because their Nuclear Warheads are still too heavy and large just like early versions made by the US & CCCP. So they are also a bit of a paper threat...
The citizens of Pyongyang have been getting western media mostly in the form of thumb drives and are beginning to learn that the rest of the world is not as they have been told. As they were told how North Korea is the best place in the world to live, due to their isolation since the war, until said western media started falling from the sky in the form of balloon drops from the south....
The human rights abuses of North Korea are very real and many families have suffered due to generational punishments, as your spouse, children and parents will also get sent to North Korea's Gulags with you if you are found guilty of a crime...
China's support for North Korea will end when the veterans of the Korean War and their children die of old age. As the Chinese [Pseudo] Volunteers who prevented the North from losing paid a very heavy price for the war...
When revolution finally comes to North Korea, the people will kill the Kim family and all those who helped them, and likely all of their decedents in a very bloody war. As most families know how much they have suffered even though they can't talk about it to outsiders..."

Going to guess because NK is a country that went through a massive recession, then put all their eggs into their military and literally have nothing else. Essentially they are a starving man with a gun and one bullet with no way to get more. Who doesn't so much want to conquer their neighbor but rather prevent their own demise."
Ugw2yIO3C6z-Iw61SDB4AaABAg,"Why North Korea's neighbors aren't that scared of them?  It is because Kim Jong Un is like a fly, irritating but can be easily crushed with one swat if they cause any trouble. Sadly, their own people are brainwashed into revering Kim Jong Un and his father as gods.  They have repressed their people and caused them to suffer, become poor, enslaved and stuck in the 60s.  The best proof of that is the stark contrast to South Korea"

I am not saying these things do not affect the US. But being safe between two friendly weak neighbors and two oceans has made them really insecure, especially after 9/11. They are alarmed with things that do not make headlines in the countries within the immediate neighborhood."

UgwIvLfN_YlZY9MUwER4AaABAg,"I am South Korean who was born and raised in S.Korea. I believe North Koreans are not stupid. There is no advantage at all for N.koreans to throw the nuclear weapons at us lol. For them, it is better to threat other countries so that they can get what they want for free. Especially Kim Jungeun is so privileged man and he would be live like a rich forever when he just threat others. Why would he want a war? These days, when Putin is going mad, the very first thing north korean media stated was ""North Korea didn't sell their weapons to Russia""  they really don't want the war to be happen and don't even want to be involved in a war.... before Russia invaded   Ukraine, North Korean media used to talk about USA aggressively. Nowadays they don't.. kinda funny isn't it? However, it seems like they want to attack Japan tho lol but remember, they want make it real until Kim Jungeun dies. Why would they?
Btw,,,, I didn't know there are 'shelters' in s.korea.. I didn't even realize there are so many shelter signage around us. I have never ever learned and heard of them,"

UgwzXRZjGpcBSVUGkst4AaABAg,"Thanks for filling in the blanks.  But, let's be real, North Korea does what North Korea does because of the Peoples Republic of China.  The PRC knows that while this atomic saber-rattling North Korea exists it keeps the US Military in the Pacific and Asia preoccupied.  Which gives the PRC wiggle room to engage in all kinds of mischief."

Ugw61oaR3EqG2yAyON94AaABAg,"Just to say, NK wants to take over South Korea, that's their only purpose, which is what we need to prevent. Hence, the US military's presence in SK. Like, NK have even drilled some tunnels underground towards South Korea which have been exposed. And also, in my opinion, NK is promoting false information to raise hatred towards US among the people, not because the US were so bad at them, but because NK is a c o mmun ist. They just brainwash their own people like that as horrible as it sounds. Nk is poor, has No access to the internet or foreign media, No freedom of speech, No freedom of religion, No rights whatsoever and Tons of human rights violations as well. NK is a typical example of how much a failure co m muni sm is."

But it might have been good to highlight Seoul's metropolitan area is actually home to 24 million people, not 10.
Or the role of a South Korean gesture of good faith in North Korea's procurement of nuclear weapons.
I kinda feel your latest videos are ignoring fundamental facts in favor of underlining the narrative."
Ugx2TKJC-QgT_ufFTPV4AaABAg,"9:34 when you say ""china, which is also a communist ally"" while showing the flag of republic of china flag is inaccurate. The communist ally is mao, not ROC.

The conflict wasn't started by North Korea, it was started when those military draw a line through a country on the 38th parallel.

UgxURbDpJGnTxpA831V4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm curious Johnny if you‚Äôve ever looked around where you live in the US for ‚ò¢Ô∏è shelters. They‚Äôre all very similar around where I live in Michigan: a bank building, parking garage, an old factory, etc."

UgwBuTzP48emUkv_1Hx4AaABAg,I wonder what the gift shop is like at that North Korean  American war crimes museum ?
UgymXFUal_RjmwPjF-R4AaABAg,"Of course the shelters aren't maintained, manned, or restocked.  This seems like common sense that would be ungodly expensive.  At it's core a shelter is a temporary space that gives some protection from aerial bombardment or indirect fire - and those places are still capable of that (no matter how unlikely).  It's been 70 years since the war...you can't expect an entire country to maintain readiness over that time (well, I guess the north has?).  It would have crippled their economic growth.

Good information overall, and a few things not generally touched on - but nothing groundbreaking here.  North Korea's plans with nukes kinda backfired, and in the end it cost them billions in humanitarian aid and economic support.  But they can't back down without losing face, so the main suffers are the DPRK civilians left starving as a result.  No telling how this plays out long term...will be up to the DPRK and China to decide."
UgxsHTIFPBkCD09jqUJ4AaABAg,"Great insight. I lived in South Korea in 2009. The former Kim was ""testing"" and launching all sorts of missiles at the time, which concerned my family back home. My Korean colleagues reassured me he was posturing for the newly elected Obama. This was all show, he wouldn't attack or invade. The west would flatten them immediately. 
The US is aware of this which is why America troops continue to be stationed across the South to this day.
I also discovered South Koreans don't view North Koreans as the enemy. They are one ethnic people and this divide is international powers interfering in their land. Koreans can be understandably wary of outsiders, and this dates back centuries. Their land is strategically placed and has been invaded numerous times.
I think the bigger question is how can they potentially unify the peninsula one day. The south Koreans are a couple generations ahead in education, healthcare and infrastructure. I'm not sure the divide between east and west Germany was so great (I'm not an expert on German history, so please don't take that as fact). Korea is a beautiful place, with incredible people."
UgxjIc55YfF6kskOea94AaABAg,Johnny. Great video! But can we please get a video from you about something we all care about. Something that is REALLY going to change the world for the better? Psychedelics being decriminalized and psychedelic research!

Life continues and when faced with day to day problems, worrying about Kim could get tiresome. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs not a daily threat what the Kim regime could do next but my only issue with the video is exactly that, day to day lives will not change for them until Kim does something tangible (which we hope he never does). If they called off school and work every time Kim launched a missile, nothing would get done. Same reason life in Taiwan continues, same reason life anywhere continues. The threat of nuclear war looms over the world like the sword of Damocles"
UgxxCHba6pQAxzwZK514AaABAg,"Johnny, thanks for the video about the Korean Peninsula. The history adds more context than what we normally hear about in the us media.

Ugwr8fzikZQB-dYHYm54AaABAg,"It makes sense that North and South Korea are unlikely to become whole again, simply resolving their government differences is inconceivable, or at least I can't imagine a system that would allow a dictatorship and a democratic system to co-exist, and both are unlikely to accept the other.

It's easy to think that removing the dictatorship of North Korea would ""free"" the people and that the nation would prosper and likely reunite with South Korea. And I think that ease of thought is dangerous. It just sucks that dictatorships have historically struggled to respect national boundaries. (I also like to think that democratic nations do better, but there's hella room for improvement) They started the conflict after all.

A dictatorship has the allure of being incredibly efficient by way of skipping the democratic process, but no society I'm aware of appears to be capable of resisting absolute corruption (Then again, neither do any of the democratic systems, but we somehow see them as more humane/acceptable).

Democratic, dictatorship or any other government structure, all I ask is that we see eye to eye in that:

The same country that invented napalm and things like Agent Orange to use against human beings, at that. Nobody believes that our kin to the north would use them to kill millions of us for no reason and ruin themselves in the process.

UgwyDhG6Pic_i-tL7Jp4AaABAg,It makes perfect sense for bomb shelters to be regular infrastructure. It would cost a lot of money to build dedicated shelters that only serve as shelters. Use already underground infrastructure that has a good chance of preforming as a shelter
UgyyAcyBtuwRAp-okeR4AaABAg,"The story of Korea pretty much explains how the military people steered the direction and culture of a greater population without the latter having the liberty of living on their individual ideologies.

Ugzy01cfzRvSQq19L3R4AaABAg,"I think the framing on this is a bit weird.
Its interesting to learn that the U.S. feels more tension than what is felt locally and some history behind the war.  Wartime atrocities should not be forgotten or ignored when it suits us.
However, in total this video feels leading into the ""America has a war complex, nothing to see here"" mentality.
There are plenty of North Korean defectors on YouTube who have talked about their motivations, experience, and thoughts.  Yeonmi Park, an award winning novelist and escapee is one such person.  She advocates for countries to actually intervene on behalf of the average North Korean citizen, to free them from dictatorship.  What people go through there on behalf of their leader is indefensible, regardless of whether or not Americans intervened.
Rather than posing this topic as an issue of the American War Complex, I would pose the question- are the people most at risk taking it seriously? Is it just in the nature of current generations who have not experienced violence to continue assuming it could never happen to them personally?  Or, if they're justified in being unconcerned about the whole thing, then what are those justifications? What does the American media (or others) get from overblowing the situation?
 You titled this video ""Why North Koreans Neighbors Aren't That Scared of Them"", but the answer you seem to have is ""they don't think about it"", or even implied ""the people who should be afraid are the Americans that started it"". These ideas are not a full conclusion, and not very nuanced.
I'm hoping there is a part two to this to expand on the conversation."

UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hRIaQROwCP,@Ridwan Ameen The US wouldn't because the strategy of war has changed over 70 years just like muskets to machine guns or Turing machine to the NSA.

UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hRIHwNH0NJ,@yuuyuu Actually North Korea was better off economically than South Korea and stronger up to the 1980s.  After the Cold War and Soviet Collapse and with the Miracle on the Han River...the gap grew exponentially between both...so half is North Korea from the 1950s to 1980s and South Korea from 1980s to 2020s.

It too highlighted the war crimes and atrocities committed by US forces during the Vietnam War -- but I walked out and throughout my stay, found no visible sign of hatred towards America among regular Vietnamese. North Korea's museum to indoctrinate hatred towards the US is similar to China's museums teaching the same about Imperial Japan. The larger goal is to legimitize the ruling party and their justification for their rule. By constantly propagating the United States remains a threat to North Koreans, Kim Jong-un justifies building up his army and staying in power.

UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOs4O3LKhE,It goes back to 1910.  North Korean side hasn't had freedom for 112 years.
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOkT7HRX4R,yeah I think that if usa suddenly stopped meddling. China would swooped in .. same with Russia. and their colonial mindset.  As a person from former eastern block the usa influence is tad more better.  and we are tiny country who just can't be neutral.
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOfnfR-VDy,"True. I‚Äôm Vietnamese and I bet that Americans bombed us way more than they did in North Korea. We still have museums, history lessons and all kind of things to remind the youth about it but we moved on. We open to trading and all kinds of activities. Actually the sentiment in Vietnam is the opposite now, we consider Americans as a ally and China as more of a permanent threat."

That's exactly their aim so I say they are succeding, no chance they will try to heal the wounds since keeping them open is so useful to them. That's why we should be more mindful in the way we intervene and interact in foreign conflicts...one bad move and you create another rogue state."
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOZHyDhVyM,"@Homiegotdough Well yes and no. While it is a strategic military are for the US, they also have plenty of others around. Just Japan and Australia gives them enough bases to control the pacific. It's also because South Korea is a valuable trade partner and potential target of belligerent powers. And the US do care about the well being of the people to an extent. A happy and productive people isore beneficial than just military occupation. That's why you don't see US base in Congo even though it would counter Chinese expansion in Africa."
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOY7DANu9T,"You are completely missing the point of a population that has been left in poverty and constantly brainwashed and threatened with death for decades, and a regime that bases their power on controlling the army.

It's not their choice at this point, and the regime needs to keep these external enemies as threats for absolute obedience to be possible.

That said, of course the ""west"" is not an innocent lover of democracy and freedom. We wage war when we want and where we want, and have been drawing lines on maps thousands of miles from home, with no care or knowledge about the local population it affects."
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOWn8WUMog,Imagine telling someone how they must feel about their pain..Some Karen somewhere.
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOWVzpIL1O,@Homiegotdough Have you been to South Korea?  It is  vibrant prosperous democracy.  So what are you saying about prosperity of the people?  The South Koreans do not want the USA to leave because the USA gives them security over the North.  That is why they are very prosperous and their economy is thriving.  Think about that.  And ask any South Korean what he/she thinks.
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOWAowT2wR,@Rose it is to late for reunification even if we leave unless the Kim family is gone but I would love to see the day that north and south combine but the north is so brain washed and poor it will take some time for things to normalize.
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOP3OLxAuj,"@Homiegotdough sadly, yes."
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hOOkh5VNqN,@Rose You have to understand that usa would never leave south korea bcuz it gives them a lauchpad for future military conflicts against china at the all usa cares about is its dominance over the world not the prosperity of the people
UgyxbPxS2S_Q3_CJhHl4AaABAg.9hNW1mSEq_99hONLoONaA8,"I agree, it would be great to move on from the conflict and reach reunification. As stated in the video, it was a conflict started by two world powers. One of them is gone, now the other needs to leave so Korea can solve it's issues. Korea can't be healed while the U.S military stays."
UgxhyN6Gml9Ii_FKDxJ4AaABAg,Good job Johnny
UgxsgxB5aXc1zHiR7xJ4AaABAg,I wonder how the world would have been if the superpowers of the time came together and experimented with the government of Korea mixing the socialist and capitalist system into a cohesive system of government - setting an example for future ruling or just another failure in human ruling. Regardless it could have been a more peaceful time.
Ugz_7WmRk9zJ0Bxh-zF4AaABAg,Dude... This was great video. Thank you for your well put together videos.

UgxQm9OD7j6YQMmOCWd4AaABAg,I lived in the pacific only a 3 hour flight to South Korea when tensions were high with North Korea doing those tests years ago. Thinking we could‚Äôve been hit was kind of scary. Glad it never happened. The USA media does over exaggerate it which scares a lot more people. Thanks for the video Johnny!

UgySFWTxApLD-YkAZOV4AaABAg,You need to win another Emmy for this Johnny. You're the fucking man!
Ugy9zEVw_65rRytF8vt4AaABAg,"good video, but you missed out on the major fact that Terenty Shtykov was chosen by stalin to teach the orphan kim song ju (who we know as kim il sung) korean because he spoke fluent russian and chinese not to mention you cant have a white russian be the ""founder"" of north korea, so they chose kim methodically. (the korean people praised a ""kim il sung"" prior to kim song ju being the ""founder"" the legitimate kim il sung was from the mt paektu region and was notible for defending korea against japanese invaders, the kim we know is from pyongyang as is SAID to be from paektu.) the regime and the russians are strategically replacing history"
UgxuZSOzvj9-vIhgMt54AaABAg,"In the future you will have a future EUROPA under attack by China, Iran and the new incoming Sowjetunion, Kim will fight with South Korea and Japan will help South, I guess. The USA will fight in all conflicts and has no chance. They will go back and safe there own nation. 

NATO against the Dictators  ore Kommusin against Democratic? 

I guess Putin is just starting thinks for a bigger crash in the next years. I think they are just playing in the ukrain to keep the world ready for the WW3. I hope not so but I have this feeling right now.

This are  just my thoughts. Pleas don't follow them but let me know about your feelings right now. How do you feel in the USA?"

They don't have to flee at all because they can travel freely. I've never met a North Korean on a holiday, have you? America and its allies should have finished the job when they had the chance, now those poor North Korean children have to go visit museums to view pictures of torture..."

UgxQFkvElDNngmMYo814AaABAg,"What I'd really like to know more about is the role of Christianity in the politics of both sides. Kim Il Sung's family were preachers at a time when Pyongyang was a hotbed for Christian-fueled nationalism against the Japanese. Although it's safe to say that the present Kim is not  a practicing Christian, I am sure the legacy of the family feeds into what we see of today's DPRK. And over in the south, everything from the Moon Unification Church to Shincheonji, the church blamed for the early superspreader event for Covid 19 in SK."

Ugw-n2m53unt1U5Utvt4AaABAg,"I wonder how much of the failure of N Korea to move on from the war, like most nations do, is about the Kim family's personal grudge for failing to achieve Kim Il Sung's dream of conquest over the entire peninsula. The Kim's live in and propagate that moment of failure to control the people with fear and maintain total control over them in the hope of vengeance one day. I'm pretty sure by now the people of N Korea are more concerned with and in fear of the cruelty of the Kim regime than of the Americans. Even the outpouring of ""grief"" by the people of N Korea over the dear leader's death a few years ago was so fake that it seemed almost like a big joke. The Kims have to know that they don't really have the support of the people who wish they could move on."

UgzYODZoRXjqKMiheUR4AaABAg,"Hmmm, blowing up towns and villages and dams and power plants...kind of sounds like Russia to Ukraine....I guess the world will never learn"
UgzBHxwaj_QSsfR15qt4AaABAg,Seoul itself it such a bustling and fast pace city that thinking about war is never going to help them in day to day lives. Can you really think about war when you have no food on the table for tomorrow? Same reason why climate change is so hard to take form in people's mind. But we're seeing a bit more change since now weather have displaced people and effect their abilities to get food
UgwiQBmDg3sbUTqafr14AaABAg,North Korea pretends that they're going to use nuclear weapons every now and then when they run out of aid money from Europe and the US. It's a way to scare the West into more money. That's quite literally it.
Ugxdq8NMSdVrgUigb-h4AaABAg,"The Taliban bombed WTC on 9/11 and Americans have never recovered from the trauma, how would anyone expect the North Koreans to recover from a near wipe out especially considering that the aggressor never cared to pay any reparations."

UgyaZMA9wcZdS-R459V4AaABAg,"From what I understand and what I've seen the subway stations double as a bomb shelter and is why korea has invested so heavily into their underground system, that shopping mall (bomb shelter) you saw is also part of a subway station. It's designed in a way to act as a normal subway station but it is also large enough to accommodate a huge amount of people, and if you look closely you can see survival kits and gas masks at regular intervals. I think it's done this way because a constant reminder of bombing threat causes unneeded stress to the population so they are built into plain site, but not in a way that is always noticeable."
UgyaZMA9wcZdS-R459V4AaABAg.9hNQ59QC7U69hNWbg46xYW,"recently watched an architectural video on a similar concept for the mall/subway station under the new One World Trade Center. How the mall served as an exit point for many people, saving a lot of lives. The new design reflects that as well, though apparently COVID wreaked havoc on the retail there. I think the idea of having underground areas and incorporating them into natural living is good. As long as people are also aware they can go there when they need it, which this video shows at least in Seoul many dont know :["

Ugyr4vCQW-IRmk-KLsV4AaABAg,"Visited the north a few years ago, and the ordinary people I met were very much as loveable as the ones I eat and meet with every day in the south. However as you said there is a said in-built fear and enmity towards foreigners (any looking relatively americanish) which you could feel from the stares driving past in a tourist bus. So much to say on the topic, but just wanted to say I much appreciated the content, and your independent desire pushing you away from the educational norms and discover the real facts on the ground.

Yeah, never really gave it much thought day to day, either. My mom was almost trapped in a shopping mall taken over by a rebel faction of the military, and we were laughing about it over dinner that same day. 

Americans are so sheltered that the thing they're most terrified about is the **possibility** of losing their shelter, not the actual danger of things like North Korea declaring war or terrorists attacking them. The ""prepper"" movement and the ""Don't Tread On Me"" gun nuts are just 'Muricans overcompensating for their insecurity that they aren't as tough as they think they are."

I‚Äôm not saying that they should live under a perpetual sense of fear but it is irrational to think that the north would not attack again and to not have a plan or simply give it thought it is very dangerous. Yeah western media probably over hypes this events but it feels like the south korean public is being a tad bit ignorant  at the same time because they do have a neighbor that is constantly making threats"

UgzN8dMwWfXnBDpDIIt4AaABAg,"I'm sorry if I'm not really good at English ,but I hope you can understand what I say. Everything you said you sound like the US just go there and invade North Korea and destroy everything that North Korea had. Somehow you manage to turn this into America is the bad one and North Korea is a victim of The US invasion. Or do I get it wrong? and also US isn't at war with North Korea ""technically"" ,because the US haven't declare war on any nation since ww2. But if you talk about it from the North Korea prospective is kinda correct I guess."
Ugwjw6eXxUC7FICmMMJ4AaABAg,"Highly likely reason as well that the DMZ looks more like a petty posturing between two countries is mainly due to the fact that they are technically like brothers fighting against one another, and while it's no longer prominent as it was before, both countries hope for unification of the entire Korean peninsula. It's just a matter of which country. 

Also, the decades of separation has caused them to become two completely separate cultures already that even speaking to one another would be considered a challenge already, as noted by defectors adjusting their lives in SoKot.

P.S. Mr. Harris, you did it wrong. You don't ""sip"" soju. You drink the shot bottoms up in one go."

In December of that year, we went to Pyeongchang (in the Northern Eastern Province of South Korea) on a skiing vacation. After a day on the snow (17th of December 2011) I checked my email to find frantic messages from my mom asking if we were fleeing the ski resort as Kim Jong il died earlier that day. I looked up and everyone was just continuing with life as normal. When we Skyped with them a few days later, they were under the impression that we in a war zone... or so they thought watching news reports."

UgysDB8uMJMTVpt8iqh4AaABAg,"17:05 You got it wrong Johnny. Atrocities were committed. To call it propaganda is disingenuous.

The ‚Äòpropaganda‚Äô you‚Äôre referring to is the Sinchon Massacre. Although the extent of the atrocities are disputed, multiple NGO‚Äôs have confirmed the following:

‚Äú‚Ä¶American troops had beheaded up to 300 North Koreans using Japanese samurai swords, and that the US Air Force was using bacteriological warfare in Korea.‚Äù

Since then, multiple GI‚Äôs, New York Times, and other publications have consistently reported on the presence of massacres, atrocities, and cover-ups during the Korean War. 

And given that identical events happened years later in the Viet Nam war, is it really so difficult to accept the atrocities in Korea?

For you to label criticisms against the American war machine as propaganda, is sad."

The new focus on the psychological affects and presenting those in a way that is understandable and makes sense within this story to show how the perspectives of South Koreans further this argument.

UgxM-TfzwxTOjrS5IVR4AaABAg,A fun fact I learned over in Korea was that North Korea absolutely hates the megaspeakers South Korea uses and whenever tensions rise one of their demands is for them to turn them off. They're more threatening to their army than any missile or plane Korea/US has

UgzFZy7B8cNGAuTsZ-14AaABAg,"How South Koreans sees north korea is very similar to how we Taiwanese see China...Americans needs to realize that us people who live besides these country who have been treatening to invade us non stop for ages, we don't really take it seriously in our normal life, even though borth South Korea and Taiwan definitely have made preperation for the scenerio. Everytime when we hear Xi or Kim saying horrifying language of how they gonna use force to take over.....tbh I always laugh a little every time when I heard them saying these things, if they have the balls, then come now looool 
But one of the main reason why we don't worry as much, even to kind of poke fun at them every so often, is because we know that US will have our back, the reason why we're so chill is not mainly because of how well our country are prepared, its because of the US~ so US better be a good ally and partner, here in East Asia, otherwise.......oh man, I couldn't imagine the disappointment and anger."

UgymUnTKfAE_q86tnlF4AaABAg,I believe that NK's nuclear weapons are not for SK or the U.S. NK has no ability to fire nuclear weapons at the mainland of the U.S. and win a war against SK too. Those are for their supreme leader. The leader exploits their people and wants to keep his lucrative business forever. The nuclear threat will effectively suppress the international voices for NK peoples' human rights. It is sad to see more and more people in SK become indifferent to NK people nowadays.

Basically, anywhere that's fairly well reinforced with concrete.

A military that out-spends the entire economy of North Korea is just a small insurance premium we the South Koreans don't have to starve for."

Not letting people hold free and fair elections so they could decide. If there was a chance they weren't going to choose a capitalist government than we always chose to cut countries in half...

After WW2 and NATO was created they denied the USSR entry and fast forward to today haha so I wouldn‚Äôt say they were totally Allies.

I wouldn‚Äôt say South Korea ‚Äúlet go of the war‚Äù and flourished. After the Korean War, USA imposed crippling economic sanctions on N.Korea and they were never given a fighting chance to flourish, which according to international law is a war crime‚Ä¶ but who‚Äôs gonna call out the US? Haha

UgyIxlipEFKKK9HZ_Hl4AaABAg,"A bit of counterpoint: I think Johnny does not emphasize enough that the regime of North Korea is about self-preservation. So while the memory of US air power's overpowering and destructive force is true, even without that reality, the NK regime will find some propaganda to preserve its power. Look at Iran. Also, it is good the South Korean people are largely not worried about the threats of North Korea - but make no mistake, North Korea would still look for every opportunity to unify Korea. There is evidence Kim Il Sung wanted to invade Korea again. But the prosperity and flourishing of South Korea need its people to not live in fear. While the U.S., because we are not directly threatened by NK, we can look at this more from a geopolitical perspective. Objectively, NK will always be a threat. And NK, understandably, will always see the Western as a threat to their existence."

Ugz0cR2dvAgPyG0eSbN4AaABAg,"Thank you so much for this video. I think this emphasizes how the conflict is presented by the majority of western media outlets. I cant tell you how much I appreciate your video. I know even though north korea was the one that started the war, the US reaction was so outrageous that North Koreans were traumatized. North Koreans really wish for a reunification with the south but because US military and foreign politics are a big influence on South Korean piece politics, there is no hope at the moment for both countries to approach each other. I wish both countries that they can overcome this issue and find a new path to stabilise peace and establish bilateral cooperation."

The possession of nuclear weapons by a country contributes to the desire of its neighbours to maintain the current stable regime. No one will try to overthrow a dictator, when they know, he have a nuclear bomb he will use like ""Ultima ratio regum"".

 Muammar Gaddafi confirms it."
UgxD_Vq0fLLVDo3NKOt4AaABAg,Thank you) very important video
UgxP4imZoCwE0h9b_9x4AaABAg,"I enjoyed watching this video in general but, there is no WHY South Koreans are not afraid of North Korea in this video. Actually, the truth is quite simple. 

South Korean and US army combined is so much stronger than North Korean army. North Korea doesn't have a chance of winning the fight. And if the fight starts, Kim dynasty will be destroyed for sure. South Korea will never start a war as we have to risk nuclear attack on Seoul. North Korea will never start a war as it means end of Kim dynasty.

We may be on a knife's edge but it's quite balanced. At least for now"

Ugw-s3xO_iqqwGsf3Kt4AaABAg,"Jonny, great video. But one small critique. 
I understand that you are trying to reach a certain core audience with these videos, but while I did enjoy it (despite never really getting a clear answer to why the South Koreas are so blithe about the danger you keep hyping up) I can't figure out why you highlighted our bombing campaign against the north, and the not also the atrocities that the North and later the Chinese carried out during their invasions of the south. 

So much harm and evil was done by both sides, spending that much time on just that one point, ""we bombed the hell out of them"" instead of almost mentioning other things, like how it was a truly international united movement to free the south, how Truman fired McArhthur to make sure his ordered would be followed (and no nuclear bombs dropped)... That it feels very carefully positioned as a political statement. 

America did bad...  Which feels a bit off. 

Just like I dislike how conservatives reflexively insist the USA has a moral exceptionalism about it, I also dislike how liberals tend to reflexively insist we are somehow more evil than other countries. We are a country like any other, we do things in our own interests, we try to keep our civilization and culture alive, and we regularly do bad things defending ourselves and our way of life and just getting as much power and wealth as we can..."
Ugw-s3xO_iqqwGsf3Kt4AaABAg.9hNKAPzqiX59hNLgb__7yW,"Your internal paradigm that makes you feel ""off"" about his choice of focus, is the reason he chose that focus in the first place.

The vast majority of typical Americans swim in a deep ocean of affirming cultural hegemony and historical interpretation. I would wager Johnny did not intend to paint the US as the sole villain of the Korean war, but rather offer a unique and atypical perspective to his largely US-based audience so they might potentially gain a more nuanced and deeper understanding of global events and history. 

Feeling ""off"" is exactly the sort of sensation that COULD motivate a person to adopt a more critical and holistic view of their own cultural assumptions. I, for one, was unaware of the extent of the American bombing campaign in NK. That perspective offers me new insight into how North Koreans might view the world. That doesn't make NK's political claims ""right"". But it offers me a deeper understanding of their perspective. Which is probably what Johnny intended with this video in the first place."

Ugw7bi2uGTddqMby4ZB4AaABAg,Ukrainians spoke the same thing before the war as well. That didn't end up well.
UgzOv_BcTa6GpetDOqp4AaABAg,"Thanks for this video and for your different point of views. I'm a Korean living in USA. I think main reason why S.Korean is not worried about the threats from N.Korea is they might be used to this and very familiar with the situation Korean has faced. Since Korea war, it has been a lot of small conflicts but it has never expanded to the war. When N. Korea launched the missiles, S. Korean people just ignored or even congratulated on their success.  I know it is weird but we did."
Ugwpy7pwbqe1ic2Kb1p4AaABAg,"As a South Korean, I share other Korean's view that if they do launch an attack, there is nothing we can do to stop the initial attack so best not to worry about it until it actually happens."
Ugwpy7pwbqe1ic2Kb1p4AaABAg.9hNIKFI7NzG9hTqXCjw8oz,"@Thomas Kim We can demolish North Korea completely if we want. We have 6th strongest military in the world. 5th strongest army in the world. We take military very seriously and we train a lot. But, we can't stop the initial attack of North Korea's artillery and missiles. We do have our own version of Iron Dome but that can't stop 10K artilleries.
Attack to Seoul will be a huge loss for us since there's lots of infrastructures and ecnomic activites concentrated there."
Ugwpy7pwbqe1ic2Kb1p4AaABAg.9hNIKFI7NzG9hRptkU2dOE,"@Thomas Kim Strong enough to rebuke it eventually, but if NK decides to attack, the initial attack will still cause massive damages"

Ugwpy7pwbqe1ic2Kb1p4AaABAg.9hNIKFI7NzG9hO9ug0EgSp,"@Thomas Kim 
In a conventional war, little question that South Korea would eventually beat North Korea even without America joining in. If China joins in, gets a bit more questionable. 

But little can be done to stop the attack which would probably be the bombing and shelling of Seoul, which is very close to the border. A potential bombing and shelling of a city like WWII bad. The potential misery and death this would cause, horrific."
Ugwpy7pwbqe1ic2Kb1p4AaABAg.9hNIKFI7NzG9hO8pGq7r5g,"@Andrew Chung well you gotta understand most people on the Internet don't know what it takes to start a war, the buildup, logistic, information leaks, etc. Korea can definitely stop the initial attack unless it somehow lost contact with all its satellites and America.

If everything plays out like the Ukraine crisis, South Korea is more likely to take the military build up more seriously."
Ugwpy7pwbqe1ic2Kb1p4AaABAg.9hNIKFI7NzG9hO76tKG-C-,"with thinking like this, Americans are right to have problems about putting resouces in to protect SK."
Ugwpy7pwbqe1ic2Kb1p4AaABAg.9hNIKFI7NzG9hO14WXGSqW,"Isn‚Äôt south korea‚Äôs army strong enough to stop an attack though? If Russia attack on Ukraine showed anything, big armies do not mean much when weapons are old and dysfunctional. South Korea has superior and larger Air Force, more helicopters, armored vehicles, and much more artillery. North Korea has more soldiers but South Korea has a larger population to draw from in emergency.

 Also if South Korea somehow fails, there‚Äôs always American military to rely on"

Ugz1jOGOYcVu7egm9B94AaABAg,"Personally I highly doubt the DPRK will ever invade unless provoked. I really like that this video points out that the main purpose of their nuclear program is to threaten the US, and not South Korea. It's pretty clear their main motivation is scaring the US out of doing anything provocative or violent and you honestly can't blame them for that after everything Korea went through during the war."

UgzSJr3T5BQ8l9DLMXp4AaABAg,"Thanks for the video!  You really got the point regarding the issue.  The most majority of people here really don't care about the north except those seniors who actually experienced the war.  And that's why the conservative party always use N.Korea for their propaganda to gain votes from those senior people. Never changed...  So it is all related to political issues usually. Not for everyday life of S.Korean people.   The party once actually asked N.Korea to make some shooting around at DMZ to gain more votes...  it happened.  Yeah sad country, but also quite interesting country at the same time.   Btw, I am a Korean ex-mormon,  I found your channel accidently, and been enjoying so much.  i appreciate your video on mormon things.

Ugx_0TPG6RPr4xMQw394AaABAg,"Great documentary! The only thing I have to say about it is the fact about the bomb shelters. When you compare it to the ongoing war int ucraine it is just a physical barrier above your head to protect you. Sure it's not safe against chemical weapons but it is a way to protect yourself against airstrikes. See Subway stations in ucraine, bad comparison i know but still a valid point I guess. Still a good video. Keep it up"
UgxUphjWfjnkPfE4pBJ4AaABAg,"It is really sad/a pity how memories of the pasts still being used as political propaganda to justify war and conflict around the world in this day and age of internet and interconnectivity.

UgwKVuEipp9nLUD4Zpp4AaABAg,"why didnt i learn this shit in school, what a fking joke.... students in school should just watch your channel. Done and learn more on here than in school."
Ugx-_XgjU2boVJtpBsl4AaABAg,"While I understand the angle of this video, I think it's a huge oversight and simplification to say that the conflict is solely pushed forward by American interests. South Korea still has universal male conscription and if the country really thought there was no threat from the north then this institution would be obsolete and have ended years ago. One would think that with the heavy US military presence and how the supposed South Korean apathy towards the conflict that this video highlights, that South Korea would have see no benefit to raising such an army, which by some measurements is the eighth largest in the world.  

Perhaps the South Korean government still feels it is necessary to protect against the north or support the US forces on the peninsula with their own, but for the average everyday South Korean citizen it is out of sight and out of mind, which is the case in almost any country about these types of perceived threats. I live in Finland and until earlier this year, few took the threat of our eastern neighbor quite seriously, especially in Helsinki. You could also make the argument, and you touch on it, that one of the reasons the conflict is out of sight for many South Koreans is due to the sizable US presence on the peninsula serving as a deterrent against North Korea."
Ugx-_XgjU2boVJtpBsl4AaABAg.9hNHhjuK65s9hNny-ji_A4,"Can't agree more. I'd also like to add in this video he missed so many history lessons like China/Mao attacking back on US forces and wars from both sides were horrific. If south Korea kept museum of North Korea and Mao attack they can claim the same case of horrific deaths. 326,863 Americans died in this war second to south Korea to preserve what is South Korea today. South Korean democracy exists because north Korea, Mao and Russia feared US intervention if they didn't South Korea would not exist anymore. As he pointed out they attacked and took over all of South Korea just because ""They thought US won't interfere"". 
I think this video is shot from an opinion perspective not historical just pushing his general narrative."
UgzTPw68TmItbdOfKb54AaABAg,South Koreans never thinking about being bombed gives me Legend Of Zelda Majora Mask vibes lol.
Ugxai-JTttLzXN5V1rV4AaABAg,"I was fortunate enough to study in North America that I share the same view as the video. Had I spent my youth in South Korea, I don't think I would be worried about a possible attack - media & social structure make it such that people stay ignorant to the matter. Perhaps because it's fear inducive? Perhaps incentivizes more people to move out of the country? In anyway, I think now is time to be more aware."

UgzU_nsRmioT35-LRmp4AaABAg,"I mean, nothing in this video is shocking or surprising. But is it even relevant? So you went all the way to Korea to tell us that South Korea is a prosperous and ordinary place that doesn‚Äôt fear bombs when none have been used in 70 years? I think that was painfully obvious and anticlimactic. We saw a year ago that Kyiv wasn‚Äôt afraid of Russian attacks when Russia was literally on Kyiv‚Äôs doorstep. Certainly no fresh perspective has been added to the conversation here. 

I dare say you even admit you didn‚Äôt discover anything new here, but you only confirmed on the ground what you mostly already had a fairly firm grip on. Did you just want a vacation and figured our views would pay for your trip? This was almost as bad as your bread video.

The more important story is what North Korea does to its own people., and it‚Äôs a story that has been covered extensively. Can you discover a fresh perspective on that? You might consider talking to Yeonmi Park, the YouTuber who grew up in and defected from North Korea.

You have a flare for dramatic storytelling. But without some sort of genuine news to share, it‚Äôs wasted."

The real reason is that we understand our opponents better than the West - What they're doing is not to actually invade us, but to maintain their tight grip of their own citizens. Thus they created their hate-centralized narrative, so their people could focus on external enemies rather than the government that has oppressed them. It's dictatorship 101, to create an imaginary enemy.
But they won't attack tho, because a full-fledged war might actually destabilize their power, allowing internal struggle to brew. This is the true reason they don't attack."

UgydXh89d_qMvN0yfE54AaABAg,"I have met those koreans that worried about nk attacks online, but yeah those koreans are sort of in the army and those armies i met online are just as conservatives as war narrators on american news with black and white thoughts. They talk everywhere not only about north korea but japan and the generic broad ""middle eastern"" thing from american and their similar perspective without me asking.

Too bad i lost contact with them. They love to talk from topics to topics very broadly."

UgxRQrmxPfW4P2mGLTR4AaABAg,"It reminds me of that line from the West Wing, with some guy criticizing the US's strategy in Asia: ""They do not share our fear of the bomb."""
UgzcoxoFdotQxu5AEiZ4AaABAg,You also should've asked north Koreans and Chinese.
UgwVRhH4FcrGZ8nV3UZ4AaABAg,"Well, we don't like them as well. We'd fuck them up, wonder why they haven't used those nukes yet?? ü§î"

UgynCK1rz3gh1w_xgbB4AaABAg,"I've never seen it as the US being afraid of North Korea.  Sure, the bomb is a threat, but it always felt like they wanted to use the bomb to hold off the world so they can do their real goals... like overtaking South Korea.  Now, maybe they aren't interested in taking that, but that was their goal in the 50s like you said in the video....and I don't see why that desire would not change.  When I think of North Korea, I ultimately think of South Korea and what might happen to them.  But, I did not know how much destruction we caused to North Korea during the 50s and it's really disturbing.  No wonder their hate for us goes so deep.  Just because we have the power to demolish an enemy, does not mean we should."
UgxLiXqOmf6jD_LCg2N4AaABAg,Plz do a video about how you go about making a video and how you get all papperwork

Ugxd9UxpIMO5DDE6eud4AaABAg,"great quality video as always, but I do want to point out that you spent a lot of time detailing the ways the United States ravaged North Korea, then acted shocked and appalled at the museum. Of course they have a museum!!! of course its geared towards children!! im not saying its not wrong that the DPRK holds such antagonism towards us, but think about how many museums America has dedicated to atrocities like the holocaust, slavery, etc. Every country I've ever visited has something like that museum. In Vietnam they have a museum detailing exactly what we did to that country, and I doubt you'd consider that so appalling as North Korea"
Ugy_UpwOUEPL-d4t-Lp4AaABAg,"I notice that the locals don't use the terms 'north' or 'south', they just say Korea - another small example of how outsiders see this part of the world. Ultimately the situation in Korea will need to be concluded in some way, we can only hope that it will be peaceful."

UgwCIUX2qrIjoOI7wBd4AaABAg,"it is kind of surprising to see the seoul citizens are not that afraid of all these threats from the north, while we at the other parts of the world are very much horrified by the nukes developed by the Kims of the north"
UgwCIUX2qrIjoOI7wBd4AaABAg.9hNGV1Z3EdZ9hO2JaLaa-S,"Kim jung eun is nervous about that NK might collapse soon.
That's why he keeps firing missiles at japan.
Kim is sending signal to SK&USA> Please help me maintain system in NK by providing food aid.
NK also asked Vietnam and India for food aid."
UgwCIUX2qrIjoOI7wBd4AaABAg.9hNGV1Z3EdZ9hNZPHDxseA,"It is probably hard to be constantly terrified for 70 years. They had to continue life even if there was a threat at their border. 

And let's not forget that the US needs to remind its own population why it has military bases around the world. As soon as the population thinks nothing is happening abroad, they'd start demanding the demilitarization of those bases.

Most countries deal multiple times a year with Russia, China, NK and other oppressive countries entering their airspace for example. In those countries it barely makes the news if at all. Cause at this poibt it's just a chararde, where we call their consulate and ask wtf explain, and they call back saying, sorry we had a malfunction.

The US though does not deal with those kinds of threats, and still they have a big military and need to give reasons for why they still have it. So they use these threatless shows of power for those."

UgwbiS5ZCmAY884fD3J4AaABAg,"Perhaps a bit paranoid, but those bomb shelters you can find on that app that happen to be branches of Starbucks, shopping centers, or parking garages... could it be the South Korean government deliberately put fake bomb shelters in their app, knowing the North Koreans might get hold of this app too? That there are actual real bomb shelters out there, but that those are communicated in different ways that are much harder for the North Koreans to find out?"

A corean started this war, north-corea divided its own peninsula and sealed their fate declaring a war of agression. This case is not like irak, in this situation the USA has no responsability as the agressor and you gloss over the war because it doesent fit your narrative. South Korea is allowed to live in peace thx to USA backing, if it was not like that south korea would be under a fking communist starvation regime like the north."
Ugw7_vQENTy5dhXbtRx4AaABAg,He didn't answer the question in the title at all...
UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg,A former colleague of mine was stationed at the North Korean border while in the Army. He said it was the most depressing place on Earth and just a 24 hour stare-down contest. Each side showing off to the other. He was so happy to get out of there.
UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg.9hNG6Ncy9q-9hSc4_91VvJ,"@- Phoenix - The problem isn't just the extremism on both ends, its also Politics of both countries which works on Dividing the religions and hence both the countries which stand basis on Religion. But still India is now progressing due to stable government and Progress brings education , access to information and hence less mind washing."
UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg.9hNG6Ncy9q-9hO-baCL_M3,"My 2010 history teacher visited that border, the whole class saw her pictures. Thats when Kim John Il held power."

UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg.9hNG6Ncy9q-9hNat6pUs3j,"‚Äã@Andrew Pergiel but the tensions between India and Pakistan are much more serious than the world sees, wether you ask a Pakistani or an indian, each side is so hungry and just wanna blow the other side, the hatred is like pre programmed in everyone's mind and with passing time, there's more and more increase in the tensions and threats, pak India conflict is an outcome of 200 years of complete mind Washing , it's a conflict between religions more than a country and indians claiming the entire sub continent while Pakistan not backing off from Kashmir, it's a mess"
UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg.9hNG6Ncy9q-9hNX0skiWih,"@Krishna Bajpai I've heard similar about the tensions at the border, which is real. The ceremony is interesting to watch but definitely shows a lot of tension and hostility."
UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg.9hNG6Ncy9q-9hNQDMuB3NB,"@Andrew Pergiel not that much, It's more of ceremonial, The tensions are real high at borders of both of these country (India and Pakistan)."
UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg.9hNG6Ncy9q-9hNPrPCQjkl,@Andrew Pergiel Probably - they put on a good show at Wagat.
UgwgeGa_oed4i-43b4t4AaABAg.9hNG6Ncy9q-9hNOsKttMp1,Interesting...that perhaps explains the crazy border ceremonial displays betwixt India & Pakistan.....they just got too bored and decided to liven things up.

UgzmzfQN2DZKfxUy3Xx4AaABAg,"What was the point of this video?

I feel like I just watched someone talk about a bunch of things but without ever scratching the surface. 

Like he read us the back covers of a few books, but never actually opened them up to explore the real content. 

Sure, it was a video about North Korea, but why? Absolutely nothing was said. Just regurgitating the masters degree knowledge would have been more informative."
UgwlEVZe0onTAYA9YIx4AaABAg,The Korean war officially never ended (they're still living under a temporary ceasefire) and neither country recognises the other's sovereignty. So defectors are not seen as defectors. They're just regular people - legally. Irl ofc the reality is a bit different.

UgzMcDv10jRjL3oPcnp4AaABAg,Well I think that's the case with India and Pakistan too. Nobody in India actually thinks of Pakistan as a threat nowadays. Its just western media which thinks that both the Nuclear capable Nations are on each other's Necks.

UgwfoWpr7xVRdNfCdZh4AaABAg,"After seeing what happened to Libya, Syria and Iraq add the fact they're surrounded by unfriendly countries, North Korea has every right to have nukes.

By having nuke and the ability to deploy them NK is sending a message to Japan, South Korea and US that they will not be easily invaded like Libya, Syria or Iraq. 

Overall all countries should possess WMD's as an ace against invasion especially when you have country like the US that believe it can invade any country it pleases."
UgwfoWpr7xVRdNfCdZh4AaABAg.9hNFonmgBV39hNG2rm0MIQ,"Except North Korea is not ""surrounded by unfriendly countries""

And why I laughed when he said some stuff about reading those documents is something you can't with a degree. That's literally what you do for a senior thesis or Master thesis. I know because I actually had to do it and it was a pain in the @$$.

 For the documents that weren't in English I had to pay a translator and cite them as a source. Even then I had a very hard time convincing my professors to accept the sources. In real life using documents for resources actually is amazing."

UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hOra0FO_Is,@Johnny Harris why'd you leave out massively important things like the Jeju uprising and the tens of thousands murdered and tortured by the US backed government?
UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hOFE5_7vF-,"@Johnny Harris 
I think folks like the OP don't realize and/or fully appreciate the historical significance of those documents and maps. It's like holding a piece of history in your hands, even if it's not the original locked away in a museum or archive. And unfolding those maps just looks freaking dope, ngl. 
Anyways...just wanted to say: keep up the amazing work. Your journalistic and filmographic style are wonderfully unique and that's what makes your work so engaging and fresh. Congrats on that Emmy btw! That was some powerful journalistic punch."
UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hODaui8N40,"And if he didn't print them off and read them off a computer screen then you'd call him lazy and lame ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hO5i1scTcw,"Geesh.  What a trivial complaint.    This technique highlights the importance of those three points in setting the stage for the Korean War and following 'peace.'  Everyone does this to some extent and frankly some are quite jarring - as if to show off what their post production team can do.  If you do not like the ""effects"" that are crammed into video news to make them visually engaging, go to the original sources ... like Johnny Harris did."
UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hNoJY2lTzM,Really? I think it's dumb and pretentious AF.

UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hNkQdpB-TB,I do this myself but on video it has some classic Alex Jones vibes. Content is different but visually and emotionally channeling something similar to what Infowars did ~10 years ago.
UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hNfrignSgZ,"@Johnny Harris Yeah, the paper bit of the videos gives some sort of originality to the videos, too - also, it makes viewers appreciate that they too, in the information age, can probably access these documents and educate themselves on their own - if they wanted to. Great content as always - and best of luck from Latvia."
UgyzA24Lw1MaZCK9gGJ4AaABAg.9hNFU8KIPH89hNdzO7h2FW,"@Johnny Harris it is also probably way cheaper to get a clip of you drawing on a map than it would be to hire an animator (or do it yourself) to emphasize the wording in the documents.

UgzYPnoHmohRTz1v7Pd4AaABAg.9hNF0pLi5aw9hY_USyFSJX,"@Se Basti√°n Not really.  There's are many people who would far prefer that the US had simply invaded Japan rather than used nuclear weapons.  They generally are not aware of how many lives the use of those weapons very likely saved.  If you are interested historical alternatives, then research those estimates, and create alternative histories.  Imagine a world where Japan lost say 12 million people in the American invasion, and the US lost around a million.  While the USSR for instance loses hardly anymore after the European war ends.  What does commerce look like, what does science look like, what do international politics look like?  Postulate the US had the bomb but did not use it - on Japan but instead on the USSR as WW IV kicked off because Stalin was Stalin and Truman was Truman, or Eisenhower was himself, or that US did not develop the bomb.  The US and Japan have a deeper first-person awareness of the consequences of actually employing nuclear devices as the aggressor and the target that no other nations on the planet have.  There are Americans alive today because their fathers were not in the assault on Japan.  There are immensely more Japanese alive because of that decision, but both nations know really deep down what using those weapons really does and what the cost can be."

Its like in Ukraine since 2014, it citizen were used to live with the constant threat of Russia invasion. I recalled reporters surveying Kyiv citizen and asked if they believe wether or not Russia will invade. Many believe that Putin was merely posturing and he wouldn't do it.

UgzYPnoHmohRTz1v7Pd4AaABAg.9hNF0pLi5aw9hPqRg7jDZi,"@Se Basti√°n this is so dumb. South Korea dosen't have to worry about NK because of the deterrence the USA provides. The only reason NK hasn't done anything is because of the threat of US retaliation against them. hence why NK launching missiles is always aimed at the US, not SK. It is our JOB to be always on the watch and concerned about NK, its our JOB to deter them. If we stopped caring about NK, our deterrence will weaken and NK will be more empowered to take more aggressive action. Constant vigilance, and preparedness is the PURPOSE of the US military. Its why our military is so LARGE, because it has to be in order to make actors like NK think twice about doing anything stupid"
UgzYPnoHmohRTz1v7Pd4AaABAg.9hNF0pLi5aw9hPlWyla5bN,"At the same time though, isn‚Äôt it still possible that North Korea could launch a nuke into Seoul whenever fatman Kim feels like it‚Äôs a strategic necessity?
Shouldn‚Äôt they be a little more prepared, without going full doomsday?

You know, like the time Japan used Korea as a granary, forcibly moved Korean workers to Japan, and kept a sizeable portion of their women as ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù slaves?

Or when MacArthur ordered nukes on Korea, Truman said no, but instead let the Air Force bomb the PRK to the tune of 635k tons, demolishing an estimated 85% of all buildings?

Ugzk40olfvXQrtYbAcB4AaABAg.9hNEd8g-TPD9hOo1UrXxaI,"@Arms I mean they're legitimately testing. It's not like their capabilities are remotely comparable to the US. 

And the part of Japan the missile crossed over was miniscule, between the mainland and Hokkaido. They basically tested it in the safest way possible instead of putting it over Russia/China/S Korea which would have been much more dangerous."

The funny part was, I had been suffering from bad food poisoning for the past 36 hours at that point and really didn't care too much about a ballistic missile having been shot from NK to Japan.

South Korea as we know it today became so in 1948 when Syngman Rhee who was backed by the US declared Korea below the parallel as the Republic of Korea. His presentation of facts are in line with historians and peer reviewed journals. Now you can go off on how he's American & presents what some may say is an ""American view"" but given his history on America and it having to face the uncomfortable reality of what they as a nation have done I'd hardly agree with your notion that he's pushing an agenda."

UgyjZMvR0CF6vQOkbUZ4AaABAg,I lived in South Korea for years and most Koreans didn‚Äôt care at all about North Korea and their frequent missile tests. It was hilarious to see the American media play up the threat so much when We just went about our day like nothing was going on.
UgwBxTtZ9ngMaBygaM94AaABAg,North Korea can only make bluffs and try to bully to get what they want. The country can‚Äôt actually afford to have open armed conflict with anybody.

UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg,Today's fact: The most popular item at Walmart is bananas. They sell more bananas than any other single item they have in stock.
UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNUB3es0ar,@EverythingIsScience no idea but I can tell you that I easily put out over 30 50lbs. Boxes in a usual shift when I worked there.
UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNOEO_fI-s,Supermarkets are the same.
UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNLyd0nlTh,"@David Taylor no, the comment's point was to share an interesting fact"
UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNKXRZVjRl,The most sold item in my country  it's toilet paperüòå
UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNK30mt6Fp,"It is true but also there is alot of theft that is behind this. Alot of the times at self checkouts will punch out bananas as they are cheap rather some organic fruit or something. So alot of bananas are sold but also alot of underlying theft too, so system shows alot of bananas being sold but its people stealing to pay less"
UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNJs6kmF9Y,"Needed this, thanks you."

UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNHUKdc0d9,The point of the comment was that it had more revealing information than this video.
UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNF_msAlJl,Kinda a random factoid

UgyBdD-Mia0oqZZyO8F4AaABAg.9hNBGpCeN5h9hNCy83xf5X,"That makes sense to me.  I like bananas, they're cheap, I need them often.  So I probably buy a lot of them."
