The 6 hour cut of this is up on Floatplane.com for subscribers there along with behind the scenes and outtakes from our other content :)
@Shiva Kumar it‚Äôs not coming to YouTube it‚Äôs on float plane. Just pay five bucks and binge all the exclusives on there and then never pay for it again
@Stephane Neron it will be on YouTube but it has an early release on floatplane
"@Stephane Neron it's definetly going up on youtube, it just goes up on floatplane a little early"
"So, The part 2 of that video is on floatplane?  Its not going to be on YT?"
@Krychu TM  why bruuuh
I would still say twomad was a more chaotic client
"how can i have pc. very soon
working hard for my dream pc"
17:09 Drop moment
When are you posting the next part. I can't afford a subscription. üòÆ‚Äçüí®
"I wonder how he will react if he comes to Tier 3 cities in India üòÇ
Holes all over the place, not just the walls üòÇ"
i know liunus has a wife but like. Him and kris are perfect for each other
come visit my place where everything is not leveled.
Do you have hammer in your webshop? In RGB colors?
"15:35 my new asus 3080 also smells like paint.. but it's not painted lol, usually it smells like ""new electronics smell"" but.. paint smell I guess :p"
Fuckin' Linus ü§£ - The man is a legend.
üëç
Can you ever have too many holes in your wall?
Watching it at 1.5x speed makes it even better
WOOI
Where is part 2?
Bro I love how when Linus is explaining kris is just nodding her head. Hehe
"13:42. That is not close to ""level"""
We need more stuff with Kris! Linus and Kris work off each other well!
"""I have friends, I just pay them."" :p"
We've all been there
Woooooooooo!. Yeah.
imagine trusting a stud finder
Came here from a live stream lol
"You can just imagine the conversation during the prep for this, considering some recent collabs, ""finally, an internet personality who's not problematic!"""
"Next collab video, Kris gives Linus a makeover while Linus builds a computer.  Optional: Yvonne is present and tells Kris how she wants it."
she can knock you down with multiple personalities
"@19:18 problems at home, my boy?"
"@19:50 Kris responds ""bruh, you have a wife and kids...stahp."""
"@4:35 No I'm so good at this.  I've assembled tables, and....coffee tables.....SO many tables...."
"very good setup job and the lady is very beautiful, hi from Colombia Medellin"
"Didn‚Äôt he have twomad as a client, I have a feeling this title is a bit of a bluff"
was anyone else unsettled by the unsolved rubix cube?
Yessssss
Would have been better without the riser having the bottom mounted intake = no fighting air flow
"Aw, we have to wait for the second part?  üôÅ"
"I think Linus is in love. The way he says ""Kris"". Oh lordy. Someone is in trouble at home."
"What recent LTT videos have taught me: Don't watch an LTT video until it's already ~1mo old or you might be frustrated. 
""some recent video I don't remember"" referenced Linus getting a haircut on channel superfun, and that video didn't come out for much longer
and now this. 

It's normal (not GOOD, but unfortunately normal) for LTT videos fo fail to link to things (eg other videos) they reference, but at least in those cases I can search for it manually.  But with this, not even possible.  DISLIKE."
took long anough
10:44 My man üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Linus thinking he is older than he actually is. That's the cringe millennials watch for.
"This one is soo perfect, Linus dry humour, and Kallmekris goes soo good together.
I can't wait for the second episode, I would watch all 6hrs if I had Floatplane"
What case is that? A Lian Li something?
I don't know who Kallmekris is and have never heard of her but damn is she delightful to see and hear. She has a wonderful attitude and of course any blond woman wearing a Prince old school T-Shirt gets my attention and respect.
Pls pimp my computer
Twomad was more chaotic no cap üóø
these two need to host a new tiktok channel
ur old linus
WOOOOO!! YEAHH!!! GET HIM KRIS!!!
how can i be picked :)) im subscribed
Sooo... When does part 2 come out?
"The peen end is actually used for an obsolete hand practice of peening which has since been taken up by shot blasting, or shot blasting. It was intended to be used not to shape or stretch metal but to pre-stress the surface of a metal object to increase it's strength."
üòÇ I figured you were going to hit some plumbing in the wall.
still waiting for the LTT drill
"Oh, I've been stumped by those boxes before. Brutal ."
My two favourite Canadians!
I didn't know Kris is Canadian. I thought she lived in the US.
I have lots of friends. I just pay them.
"12:05 I 
DONT
KNOW
Directed by Christopher Walken"
Great content. I can see a LTT deep dive into how much money each platform takes from creators.
"Okay, she's hot!"
Another classic Linus drop tips video
Why rich ppl don't have to pay for expensive stuff? Why only poor ppl have to pay for expensive stuff? This is society. I wont able to eat the end of the month cause i brought myself a 3070ti
"These videos are brand deals and sponsored promotions, this isn't free stuff. Instead of all cash they the brand saves some money by sending parts to pay some of costs."
40 oz. = 1.18294118 liters
Tech is good but is THICC tho
"Looks great. Wakes up next day excited to start gaming. Rushes down the hall, eyes glowing brighter and brighter, swings open the door..... Right into her brand new OLed TV... 
Begins to cry, picks up phone, calls Linus. Same day gets hooked up with new one at no cost."
The way they feed off each other's energy is awesome. This video was great!
I had no idea Kris was so tall. Making Linus look like a wee lad üòÇ
ijustine vibes everywhere but prettier :)
"Not to be that guy but the ladder is set up in the worst way @2:00, always work on a ladder facing whatever you're working on. 
Absolutely no reason to comment this but please don't die we love you guys"
shes so white
This is a chaotic clusterfuck & I love it lmao
"good luck with the lian li fans, great fans until they start squeaking or rgb gets a mind of its own, at least their customer support is very helpful and replaces no questions asked."
"Since she doesn‚Äôt make crap from her TikTok videos, you should hire her to host videos."
I absolutely will never understand how someone who used to be a painter is so incompetent with every other part of handiwork
where is part 2 with out a subscription ?
"Just installed this exact fan setup in my case 2 weeks ago--like Linus said, these things are ridiculously easy to install and require so many fewer wires (especially with 9 fans in 3 blocks on 1 controller).
Does anybody have suggestions for best in/out configuration (disregarding aesthetics)? I landed on the same intake bottom and back, outlet top configuration as this example but not sure if that's best..."
Lol 2:40
She screws but she drills?
Linus Interior design tips
Gotta love these tech upgrades. Only people that work for LTT and influences that have the money to do it themselves without batting an eye. Couldn't possibly help out anyone that can't afford it or someone actually in need.
I feel so fucking bad for Kris after Linus found all these problems.
Awesome collab
Kris and Linus have shockingly similar proportions
At this point I think half of Linus dropping things is staged.
Imma guess that if Linus wasn't married to an Asian chick he would tots be into blondes  with multiple personalities lol.
where is part 2?????????
"10:39 what he should have said was ""when you sell this place, just say that its a holey house."""
I need to watch Yvonne's face when she see this.
That‚Äôs crazy i actually had deja vu about this video when they were talking about how youtube pays and whatever they said.
"It's not a Linus video if he doesn't drop it. 

üéµ Drop it like it's Linus.
Drop it like it's Linus. üé∂"
is she the one with the sibling vids??? Awesome!!!!!!
That was very entertaining. Hope you both do more collabs in the future. Good chemistry.
now  way lmfao
"Linus, the only tech guy who gets hired to a job and makes the client do the work... Awesome video, but what makes me sad is that was Kris who asked for the service and not Riley to watch frozen on a acoustic room üòï"
Who?
Will patiently wait for part 2 ‚ò∫Ô∏è
POV: up next building a pc with the devil!
...med tanke p√• hur h√∂gt och h√•rt hon har dragit upp sina jeans...s√• jag klandrar han inte... :)
100 sp√§nn p√• att dessa kommer att bli ett par snart...
"I worked for a guy named Philip. We both said ""HI I'm Phil"" to each other when we met"
Basically one of my top favourite creators on youtube. Love this. Endless chaos.
"Oh dear, ""she screws, but does she drill?"""
wow they work so good together!
ok ok i cant breathe this is definitely top 5 lol
there is gonna be a part 2? fuuuuck yeahh!!
im never buying another rog PSU mine went out after 2 moths back to EVGA
I own EVGA 1200 watt G2 Supernova
LONG GONE ARE THE DAYS WHEN LEGITAMITE PEOPLE REIEVE FREE GIFTS NOW ITS JUST INFLUENCERS ETC
@Zach N JUST STOP BEGGING DUDE
"AND LINUS I WOULD HOPE A 1000 PLUS DOLLAR TV WOULD BE ""PERFECT FOR GAMING"""
I don't ever comment but I love this so much. Two of my favorite YouTube channels together ü•∞ thank you Linus for your techy know how and thank you Kris for all the laughs! You both are amazing
I can‚Äôt tell if kris is tall or Linus is small üò≠üò≠üò≠
Thats probably not the painters fault Id put the majority of the blame on tapers and drywallers that dont take pride in their work. A painter can cover up some stuff. But if its that bad they basicly have to do part of the drywallers and painters job to clean it up. Im a tech hobbyist but general construction is my daily grind. I can tell Linus is a good painter based on the shocked looks scanning that flat lolüëç
Kris is lovely!
Those holes in the walls are going to look like that Korn music video. Also Linus inspecting Kris's house is like that episode of the office where Dwight overly analyzes David Wallace's house's construction during the dinner party thing
This was a really great and hilarious collab. I hope y'all do more collabs with people like Marques and Kris in the months / years to come. They always seem to get a ton of views and are always hilarious to watch
"Linus dropping a 12900K is about the most Linus thing I've ever seen just after Linus barely handling being a handyman.
This video is very Linus. It's a fun time. Like a train wreck you just can't stop watching."
She's face looks familiar ü§î
I never knew linus had a daughter
Unable to login onto floatplane ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
"This video makes my OCD mad, whoever did the house didn‚Äôt do it right and in the most inconsistent way ever. But atleast Linus came through and made it beautifully in that room!"
Funny having her shirt up....that part would look a lot better covered...lol.
Good thing Kris is chill.
This is quite fun to watch
"22:44 that ""short"" joke was savage and smooth hahahaha"
3
Chris looked like a proud mom at the start
23:55  Asus product sale sky rockets after that plug in
"Throughtout the video, i am watching Linus holding things and be like 
""Don't drop it, don't drop it, pls don't drop it"""
"17:54 Bahahaha, basically me every time I look at the 5 hard drives in my tower üòÇ"
"""i have lots of friends. i just pay them."""
Linus is just the drama queen that keeps having meltdowns every minute because things arent going his way and then Kris is the one smart sidekick that calms Linus down every single time he freaks out üò≠üò≠
"Love how these are usually people with lots of money already, get expensive stuff for free"
shes wearing a purple rain shirt and linus didnt know if she was going to get an mc hammer reference lol
Doesn't seem to be the blind leading the blind at all.
The collab nobody asked for but everybody needed
Yes they got kris on it
Has something changed in the youtube algo? I have been watching all LTT videos since the beginning.(of time) and since a couple of weeks I don't get LTT reccomendations anymore. I do get techlinked while not subscribed??
"They don't recommend videos that you have already watched. For that same reason i don't get recommendations from channels that i really like, maybe some occasional video from 4 years ago."
Man yall 2 could have alot of content just hanging out this was a really fun videoü§£ü§£
"""she screws but does she drill"" tshirts plz"
"As a person with OCD , I‚Äôm happy that this isn‚Äôt my house Linus is messing up with ."
Go Kris Go. You rock and Linus needs more height off the top
Only Linus has a Discord mod to help
"We call this type of women ""blood and milk""."
"""You know what people should do on their honeymoon?""

Linus, you know what people should do before getting married? XD Actually, on the first date wouldn't be a bad idea."
"I'm really enjoying the interaction these people are having. you can see they are genuinely having a great time with each other, strangely enough way more than with most of his own employees with the intel upgrade series."
"""most chaotic client ever""
Twomad:"
Great banter. Lost count of the ‚ÄúPFFFFT‚Äùs üòÇüòÖ
"Linus is rubbish at DIY, stick to tech stuff. Its a good jobs she's ok with it. Mind you i'd help her  if she asked.  :)"
"""She screws, but does she drill"" XD WTF Linus"
"A minute and a half into the video, Linus manages to nearly break something ü§£"
Linus wasn't sure a woman wearing a Purple Rain t-shirt would get an MC Hammer reference...
Is a social media personality Canadian? ‚Ä¶.. have they done a calab with Linus üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Oh Kris... <3
PS Linus broke a drill bit.
"Linus, please wear safety glasses when using a nail gun. I almost lost an eye from not wearing them before. I wish you the best. Have a good day. üëç"
"Why is it that even though I've seen tons of Kallmekris videos and loved them, I just now during this video realized that she is gorgeous?"
Very nice
Linus likes Kris üòè
She's fine üò≥üò©
She's cute AF.
LMAO when he found the stud I lost it
I could feel her ADHD from here.  Is that how I look to others?! lmao
"Bro, Tik Tok taking 80% of your streaming funds/tips is friggin awful.  I didn't realize how terrible they are to creators."
And also I‚Äôm not good at pc stuff but the aio was not in the rigth place u see I watch vid and they no to keep the cpu cooler little block square thing above the top fan that what u did bc the wire were under
Bro that desk gonna snap it‚Äôs bend
Alt title: chaotic Canadian guy meets chaotic Canadian lady
Dang kris is taller than I thougrh
@Leonel Cervantes but she‚Äôs 5‚Äô7
Nope Linus is just short
Linus and Kris looks like brother and sister ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
KallMeKris little bit nutter butter little bit complete hottie little bit nerd = 1000% beautiful person
"Thinking about playing Fall Guys on that 55"" Oled makes me drool."
The AIO tubes going down noooo
Yes! I love Kris' content. I've been wondering when this was happening considering she's a Canuck
Humans are so emotional said super computer
"dang, the roasting from Kris ü§£"
"You guys always do so well with these makeover things, always love watching them."
Lines I feel u on the dry wall after doing it for awhile and going into new people house it's the first things I look at
This is literally cringy af. It reminds me of guys trying to be super funny or otherwise trying to impress the single girl in a group in HS.
"I can just imagine the contractors face watching this video, poor guy."
7:53 - For when you're as thirsty as Kris's video comments.
I LOVE HER. She's literally so down to earth it's amazing.
i didnt think id love the personality clash between these two until i saw it and my god is is golden
"If I didn't know how tight Yvonne and Linus are, I'd be worried."
That electric nail gun sounds so weird. I'm used to the loud kaplink noise that pneumatic nail guns make.
"i use the ball peen for exactly what y'all weren't using it for... to hammer in those anchors.  it makes it easier to hammer them flush without damaging the wall so much.  actually, i hammer them a bit under the surface, not just flush, and the ball peen makes it super easy."
I flinched when Linus dropped the thing.üòÖ
Wheres part 2 üò¢
"When she thinks that Linus and Kellerman are an old married couple, she should watch the house build videos with linus and jake"
KRIS
never join the tiktok creator fund. it basically removes all discoverability from your channel and you get like 30% the views
Kallmekris would make a great LTT intern
This is the most vancouver ive seen
who is she? pass
They don‚Äôt only take 80% no no no sweetheart they take additionally 40% from creator when you take the money out people have gave to you
So basically 88%
the stuff im learning about tiktok and youtube...glad I didnt quiet my job to become a streamer lol and im in Canada lol
"I'm not going to question how two of my favs got together, I'm just going to enjoy it."
"The TV is tilted, and I am now tilted."
"How does the song go...?

üé∂ ""Kris and Linus sittin' in a tree,  
k - i - s - s - i - n - g ...""

The boy-meets-girl tension in this room is palpable. ‚ù§Ô∏è

You may have missed it, but Freud certainly didn't - after some time working together with Kris, Linus concludes,

""...people should build stuff together on their honeymoons...""   ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®ü¶Ñüåà

Pretty sure Yvonne is confident enough to handle this.  No need for concern. üòÖ"
When is part 2 coming to the main channel
Kris is adorable! üôÇ
I love her
The collab I never knew I wanted! Amazing!!
....more Kris pls <3
My 2 favorite people from Canadia!
"Oh, she's the funny woman on tiktok. That's why she was familliar."
"Kallmeris is the most chaotic client ever!

*Twomad:*"
"Fuck, now the creator MBs will be out-of-stock. Thx directors"
"This video was soo much fun, cant wait for part 2"
15:17 LOL
The one and anly WHO
"The perv in me can‚Äôt stop looking a t such gorgeous, beautiful, pretty‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.


I‚Äôll let myself out."
Linus is so old that the T-Rex was asking for tec tips back in the days
i dont find part 2 where is it?
Would be pretty cool if you did a tech upgrade for a viewer or something. Or just hook up someone else who can afford to do it on their own I guess. I'm so impressed someone who makes a ton gets more free stuff!
6:15 yikes
She screws but does she drill....... Missed opportunity
Pls send something to me in india too pls
"What brand was the case, i love it... want one"
Pretty sure 40 oz is a little over a liter
I love her
@Cheezy what's the meaning of that?
üíÄ
Very good chemistry between them too was very funny to watch. The lesbian with the beanie and the beard looks very submissive and breedable too.
"David: i have a nail gun, should I trust you with it.
Linus: heh heh heh"
ooh... Linus has a crush
"""i have lots of friends... I just paid them"" jajajajajaja noted"
linus and kris got great synergy. hire her as a friend.
PC building Speedrun incoming
Linus your not nice I pay YouTube premium so I can watch YouTube videos with out commercial and you put pt 2 of this video where I have to pay another premium cost üò§
Celebrity upgrade not really fun to watch. Because they don't keep the items
delete  video
Wasnt there a Short teasing this Video like 2 Months ago or something?üòÖ
"I am proud to announce that I have finally finished my first pc, thanks Linus for all the help."
"""she screws, but does she drill?"" 
-Linus Sebastian, 2022 ü§£"
Linus wife will be pissed off we all can see whats in beteen these two here ;)
This came out of left field. I love Kris and love Linus. Never thought this colab would happen
I love Kallmekris!
Arent they building a gaming PC? Why dont they use the far better Ryzen 5800X3D then?
14:16 ASS!
LINUS PAINT TIPS is back!!!
"Acoustic panels don't really work the way they explained it in the video You're not going to prevent sound from escaping your space with diffusion and absorptive panels--those will just make sure you don't have a lot of crazy reflections in the room. Studios generally float the structure and build in an air gap between rooms to provide proper isolation so you can have super loud drums in a room next door to a nursery. Even then they do use specially acoustic materials to accomplish that as well. Diffusers and absorptive panels don't do this.

I get asked this all the time--which is why I decided to post. I'm sure Linus and co know this."
I think they censored the lawn because they're afraid that people might geo-guess her exact location.
"I have lot's of friends , I just pay them
                                   - linus 2022"
"Dislike split content between websites like this to clickbait people over. Keep it on one or the other, but keep all of it there."
OMG WHAT IS THIS CROSSOVER
I now a girl that is essential a clone of her. Even how she speaks and moves. Weird.
55in tv is good for gaming? Her eyes gonna be on a swivel non stop.
Don't need drywall anchors if you screw into the stud
"Hey, that's great... uhm, who is she?"
"2:18 thank you Linus, now I feel old."
Can we just appreciate how absolutely baller that MB is I have like 3 ports and I barely know what to do with them what madlad needs 20?
17:02 19:19 typical linus
I never pegged her a LTT fan
"Kris: I'm really good at falling
She's similar to linus. Linus drops things and Kris drops herself"
love you kris your the best
Where's  part 2?
"You know how could this series be more awesome, if they did kinda hot ones! The upgrade the room while the talk about the life of the guest, if they went over all the life and accomplishments of the person. I would have loved to know more about callmeKris‚Ä¶"
Either Linus is short or kris is tall wait nevermind it‚Äôs both
Who else realized she isn't wearing a ring? I think I might give her a call.
Haven't heard of Kris before - she's jokes & I love how Linus gets along with damn near everybody
She‚Äôs a TikToker
Damn! Shes super cuteüò∏
Beautiful!
"I have to pay to watch the rest of this, that's BS"
"ALREADY DISSING HIS HEAD-DRESSER...  remember Linus: SuperFund grows faster than Hair...  on haircut video you admitted 6 months to grow it out....  but Dennis does a SuperFund video every month or two.....
JUST SAYIN'     LOL"
WHEN YOU REALIZE ONE OF UR FAVORITE CREATORS IS MUCH MORE FAMOUS THEN YOU REALIZED!!
She is so beautiful
what speakers are those at 21:28 ??
"""I have lots of friends...



...I just pay them."""
Im really having trouble relating to linus now for some reason
Could you do mine next. I‚Äôm 13 and would appreciate it a lot.
Ty
"@Harambe-H if, IF Linus would see this and make him a setup he would better pay for himself"
"haha, good luck with that."
Bruh
"Ngl,i think bro is sleeping on the couch after this shoot"
divorce is on the cards AFTER THIS I TAKE IT LINUS LOL
was linus eating Cheetos before recording? his hands are all yellow and orange
"4:24 Linus apprehensively offering his help and immediately laughing as if to punctuate the absurdity and low probability of him being able to render any meaningful aid, only to himself (and with perfect comedic timing) drop his tool bit in a moment of relentless self-fulfillment, halfheartedly chuckling while conceding defeat..  chef's kiss"
Linus is always so damn cringe around women.
When you put 2 kids with ADHD together
TINY HANDS TIK TOK GIRL
what is this collab im nort ready for this
Who was the handyman channel mentioned at 7:37 that helped/collabed with kallmekris?
80% cut what the f*ck tik tok.
only i think she's crazy cute?
Linus whyyyüò≠
"You can screw but can you drill, lol, so direct"
All the way simp for you dear. Love your face.
The collab of the year has dawned apoun us
"I have no Idea who she is, but I like her :D"
Yvonne's face when Linus gets more housestuff done and agrees more with a female cohost on aethetic choices.
best Collab ever <3
I recognize her she's on tik tok she's actually very funny I watch a lot of her videos
GREAT VIDEO!! FINALLY UPLOADED!! Y'all should do more sposored videos with Asus collaborating with celebrities like Kris! Great job!!
"17:00, I was so much glad that I thought he would Linus that and he really did.
I was eagerly waiting for it to drop !!"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GOT ME WITH THE CLIFFHANGER looooool
Two of my favorite people. :)
I love her so much!
I'm totally fine with this being a two-parter because I'm loving the video so far
"loved this video allot. Kris is cool, makes allot of fun of others and doesn't matter if others  make fun of her. give her a channel and I think there will be allot of additional subscribers."
Don't use TikTok Its pure Chinese government trash. And its bad for creators.
I cannot tell if they were flirting or not
Asus baka naman.......
Mom jeans? why?
Did anybody notice that Linus installed the radiator upside down?
"@Ken Sim i like the dunning kruger, in the vid u linked GN shows the way linus did it was the correct way ( 19:50)  soo GJ!"
"@Norkris The correct way? The hoses to the radiator are below the pump on the CPU, which means any air will work its way to the pump and get trapped in the pump. This will eventually burn out the pump over time. Here is something you can see what I mean, https://youtu.be/BbGomv195sk ."
you mean  the correct way? yes i did see that
"@7:55, Canadian, oz and liter."
Dorky hot
Isn't it enough of these silly jaw drop thumbnails? Aren't we passed that point yet? It gets old fast...
Sve je lako kad si mlad krv i voda mogu te√ßi
I have never heard of her before but I love her energy
kris was lost at what they were talking within the first 10 seconds
"Ah fuck, not a poor paint job again, i think im the only one who also feels it ;-;"
This basically was linus not centering things and triggering ocb for 24 minutes straight.
"Imagine madison being here. Linus wouldn't need a haircut, he would lose all his hair."
"""The most chaotic client"" 
What about Twomad?"
"I think I see a Grey hair 
Linus: üëÅüëÑüëÅ"
Ok Now Chris has to cut your hair its only fair you tortured her with the screw holes in the wall she needs payback
What's litres? I'm from medieval times before the metric system.
Linus is like the fun uncle
"Linus: The one and only KallmeKris!

Me: ...who?"
"if you dont watch yt shorts or tiktok you wont know her. but she is actually huge with probably more than 10,000,000+ followers. or"
"Linus has always been a stud finder, I mean (chosen at random) Jake, Riley, Dennis...commonnn there's so many more to name..but he's good.ü§£"
I was beginning to think you guys were never going to release this video. Been a long awhile since Kris announced it. Totally worth the wait and I still totally wish I had a GF like Kris.
Ok but who is this?
She would make a nice adition to the team! Too bad she already has a job!
the stress was real on this one
I have a massive crush on Kris. Help.
"Man, it's fun to see ltt doing more collabs like these with other youtubers, like when y'all used to go install storage servers in people's studios, it's just got a fun energy"
watching this was therapeutic.
if she ever tries to sell the house she can advertise that professional linus holes were installed in the wall
"Linus is crushing hard, bout to get that divorce, and Kris will happily take that spot by the looks of it‚Ä¶"
Call me Kris is just so confused all video lol
"Giving someone els who already ""made it"" free stuff is kinda like artesian builds all over again "
"Somebody get Linus a drink, he seems a little thirsty."
"When I first followed Kris i was like ""damn she's Canadian wonder if she's gonna Collab with Linus ever"" and here we are"
8:05 arabis of the old showing off their slaves
SO happy to see Kris getting a Tech makeover
@gamersnexus needs to do a video of steve having a spider sense moment when someone mounts the tubes upside down
"""I'm really good at falling.."" well just don't fall into Linus's arms as he's good at accidentally dropping stuff.."
4:41 what is she talking about?
Kris seems like a super nice person. I'd marry her.
what the hell?
There is part two üò≠üò≠
Wow Linus went full dad mode on that Intel core.  Just throwing things away and putting it in fully in reflex.
"Call me a men of low culture but I've found her channel less than a week ago, and now she is here ... excellent."
oh got you couldn't route the plug for the tv behind it? It looks HORRIBLE just sticking down there
Cutie alert
"Sure they already know, but for the ProArt Boards, if you put an M.2 in slot #2 it will change your 1st PCIe slot into a 8x instead of 16x. Additionally, if you connect slots 5&6 in the Sata, I think it does the same thing. I have the X570 board with a 5950x on it."
@13:30 is the reoccurring nightmare Kris' paint contractor will now live with forever.
"This vid was funny as hell. And Kris you are a very lovely lady, Give me ya digits  lol kidding (about the digit thing you are very lovely)"
Will you upload part 2 on youtube?
I feel like this is a part 1!! Lol
"Was I the only one who was confused for a sec seeing them just effortlessly drill into the walls without even any dust coming out until you realize they are in America and the walls are just plywood? XD

edit: before someone says ""but they are in Canada"" - if I meant USA I would have written USA...


16:59 and another one..."
this is awesome loved this collab
The captions be like thank you Jesus for sponsoring this pc build
It's not level lol
17:02 It's not a Linus Tech Tips video if Linus doesn't drop something... this time it's the processor. Oof!
WHY SHE DIDN'T CUT HIS HAIR?! I WOULD WATCH IT SO MANY TIMES
I am glad I'm not so influential or famous to the point where I don't have to block out the exterior of my house
"Riley could of done it in half the time, Otay, wets git er done.  (-:"
Poor execution; the acoustics should have been corrected in the build phase of that room. There are many solutions that could have prevented the covering of that feature wall and its sad to see the design defeated with cheap panels and negativity. Its apparent the customer needs weren't satisfied because she hadn't sought/received adequate consultation; designing the wall and ceiling acoustic assemblies would have been a good idea maybe? In the future maybe  better advise your customers Linus; you're dissing others for not doing things the way you think it should be but you also didn't make sure they did either.
more of this!!!
And thats why I will never get tiktok.....don't want the Chinese spying and taking my money
"hands down when she like the screwdriver, you know shell be fixing alot in the house with it. Her hotness is up 10x üòç. I like girls who are fun of tech."
44 fluid oz = 1.3 litres
The genuine fear at the grey hair
Am I the only one that wants to see the hair cut?
Two of the best Youtubers.Kris is hilarious.
When the motherboard fell out i gasped so loudly at work people thought something was wrongüò≠ü§£ü§£
What bookshelf speakers are those?
What case is this?
Linus' behavior makes Sexual Harassment Panda a sad panda.
I waited more than two months for this video ü•∫
The round part is for knee caps
"S Tier Subtitles at 23:56üòÇ ""thank you Jesus for sponsoring this"""
"I never clicked on a video so fast, Kallmekris tech makeover with LTT, you know your in for a fun time. I really enjoyed this video. I'm looking forward to part 2."
Who's the chubby guy?
When Linus smacked the door closed on the Ethernet jacks I died
"I love Kris ""call me complete"".üòç"
"I usually love these makeover/tech builds but I have to say, there were a lot of parts of this where I was cringing in agony."
"And yet, the comments are full of fanboys kissing butts."
Don't melt the controller. It will sell more as an art piece.
Dont do it Linus. I klnow what you are thinking and we are all thinking it too!. Dont do it!
Never heard of this lady but she has amazing personality
Do you drill? I see what you did there Linus!
I have a strong feeling that contractor even though not perfect was not the idiot one in this equation. Like with a TV they probably asked her where she wants it and she pointed in general direction and they prepared socekt where she pointed at.
"Don¬¥t watch this at work, it¬¥s so funny you will laugh out loud"
TO BE CONTINUED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
45m followers in TT! Killin it
I really love it when already rich people get stuff for free because of sponsors.
@Raidzor ok zoomer dear
Are you implying there's something wrong with that? Cause that's how the world works and should work.
it‚Äòs a great video and all but the fact that linus has no time and he is rushing really makes the video 40% worse imo
"did Linus say ""you screw, but do you drill?"" around 2min mark?
I have no idea who she is yet, just started to watch the video :o"
"Dude im really sad for Yvvonne but i felt so much chemistry with these 2.. maybee an open relationship is on the way??? since Yvonne has been doing some ""hot"" compliments on employees appearance lately??"
Eyo
"I love her, was recommended various clips of her and she is so funny, the little hand thing she does when playing kids cracks me up every time, little hands big heads."
So funny we need more videos with the two of you.
Whoa! She looks AND acts just like my second wife. ABSOLUTELY uncanny resemblance!
"i might have posted this before, but will see part two on youtube or is it just floatplane?"
Putting long screws above fusebox will make every electrician to lose their breath.
I expected kris to be the chaotic one but the chaos is honestly 80% Linus
Yeah give a ton of stuff to the people who could casually afford it on their own.
Yeah Linus and ASUS should definitely visit starving somalians and give them a 5000 dollar tech upgrade.
"Now watch the whole thing again at 1.75x speed. This was more fun than I expected. Nice job, LTT."
OMFG.. One of the best LTT and KMK videos I have ever seen! I can't wait for part two!!! :DüòÅ
"To anyone who is concern about echos if you do put adequate sound dampening and there‚Äôs still a little reverb don‚Äôt worry the once you starting adding your desk and such it‚Äôll help to deadened the reverb, I‚Äôve found this out when I first moved into the house I‚Äôm in when I was younger."
This was real cringe but I like it
Kallmekris makes me laugh on a daily basis. This was an awesome team up!
"I was like, that's some weird name, until Linus said it whit spaces lmao"
"As a handyman, I resent the implication..."
"Love her tiktoks, what a fun collab! :)"
Yvonne at home STEAMING watching Linus flirt with a younger hot blonde for 25 minutes üòÇ
I felt like I was intruding on a first date!
Glasses guy sounds exactly like Robert Downy Jr..
Finally! Been stalking the channel for months now waiting for this...
Youtube unsubbed me from LTT today. I subed again of course but I don't get how it happen. Has anyone else ever had youtube do this before???
"Those TV mounts are ridiculous.  Whenever I see one I ask, how often do you move it?  9 out of 10 times....never."
Can't blame the guy who installed the panel.  It's only as level as the studs which usually aren't level for squat.  But level enough that you eyes will never notice.  You also can't trust your ceiling to be level.  Or your floor.  Pro Tip - basically nothing about your house is level.
When is pt 2 going to be released? #floatplanesucks
"her skin is so white
is she some sort of Goddess?"
"""PCI-E Express"" lul"
"But why is the AIO pump higher than the entrance to the radiator? Your own channel had a video about why that was wrong, at the same time Steve from Gamers Nexus did an in depth review of how bad that is. It's an i9."
All the faces the Kris makes in this video  ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Linus: ""Wow that's really level!"" Me, someone who has built stuff: That's not level in any way"
"Maybe it looks slightly off with the camera view vs looking completely level to the naked eye..? Could be onto something there.. or benefit of the doubt? Also, as someone who has built stuff for customers, that's just bs'ing some excellent service, as long as the customer is happy. 
But yeah that's nowhere near level from my view of it, sorry, not sorry LTT."
"""As level as it gets"" umm ok"
"The way the camera zoomed on the cpu, I was like ""Waiiiittt.... He's gonna drop that"""
"Ayeee, Love her videos with the multiple characters she's created, Especially the russian twins, Misha and Sergei. Those two are a riot. Hope this turns out to be Amazing setup!"
I love her content on Tik Tok lol she gets point for wearing a Prince T shirt.
kris is an amazing personality!
Easiest customer yetüòÇ
"Oh my god i have been waiting so long, i saw the community page about this video and i thought oh great, new Collab video next week but the next week came after such a lonnnnnggggg time!!!!!"
"‚Äú8 of them are performance, 8 of em are for another, more different thing‚Äù the tech information I come here for."
If Intel started putting this in their advertisements they would be reigning over the CPU market.
"Linus: ""I have lots of friends I just pay them.""
Me: Ah, he did a Conan!"
"1.- Linus Tech Tips.
2.- Linus Drop Things.
3.- Linus Rage Tips.
4.- Linus  Launch Things."
Linus got that rizz üò≥
i get madeline vibes when she unpacks the psu
I love how much more Linus's accent is apparent in this video
There was so much flirting and sexual tension between Linus and Kris. Maybe Yvonne should just skip this vid...
Don't worry about the age Linus. At least we know how to have fun without internet. Those Z'ers won't have a clue what to do without it.
Is there such thing as the perfect air circulation build PC that looks amazing?
LINUS IS OLD
"Videos like this is why I don't subscribe or disable adblock to this channel, hiding videos behind paywall."
IRL MICHAEL SCOTT CONFIRM!!!
Kallmekris is like an Asian liberation front.
"A thing people almost always forget when putting sound absorbers... They forget the ceiling. 

LTT should hire Kris as a presenter. She's adorable."
The collab we didn't know we needed
"1:58 linus makes a joke and waits for a reaction, but get's none"
I wait for this video like forever.. üòÑ
Kris is taller then linus lolüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
As a cable tech. I cant wait to rip down that panel cover when i have to inevitably fix the wiring üòé
Is Linus getting even more sloppier than what we are used to?
Wait... arent you NOT supposed to put the ins and outs of the rad BELOW the pump? Or am i being an idiot?
"OMG the TV left edge isn't level with the left grey panel, which is! OCD setting off right now. Great content love this build :)"
WHAT WAS THE SHELF AT 13:22 WHERE CAN I BUY
Ok .. so a strange thing happened. I'm a big LTT fan but I'd never seen or heard of Kris before about a week ago. I started getting loads of her videos in my recommended. I watched a few and they are great. Then suddenly Linus and Kris's are doing a Collab. Did the algorithm know this video was coming ? Did it figure I probably ought to know who Kris was before it came out ? Can it predict the future ? ....
Only took you like 3 months after making a short about it then deleting it and never mentioning it again
"As a drywaller framer myself, I'm really shocked to see such poor quality in that house. It's unfortunate what you get these days. Love your energy LTTüëç"
KallMeKris's ü•µ
"Kris in 1 year: why has my tv and pc caught on fire
Linus: no"
I shall not simp
Shame on you for breaking it up :)
Still flirting üòÇüòÇ
Wow
There was a little sexual tension at the start. But it died when she said Linus needed to go back to his wife and kids.
This was an amazing collab
"i'm sure you know the cpu heat spreader does not make proper contact with the stock cpu cooler, needs and 3rd party contact frame to not bend the die, right..."
When i saw the video was getting close to the end i was so hoping there would be a part 2! I am so happy now lol
you 2 are legit perfect together for absolute chaos! I love this! So much fun... i have never had so much fun watching people install things! This could be a channel all on its own!
@linus when colab with me? :(
does anyone  ever think that linus just drops things on purpose now? lol
what soundbar is that? :)
"Crappy contractors not doing outlets like they should when the house/apartament was done from 0
I know the pain, what about an electricity outlet at sink level JUST ABOVE THE SINK.
What about 1 outlet next to tv and no other outlets in the entire room, except the kitchen ?
What about no outlet next to where the fridge goes.
What about outlets behind and below the bed ? being no other outlets ?
What about ground being routed but not connected to the sockets ?
What about the front door being so crooked that the top lock doesn't work right, and it doesn't seal at all ?
What about no fan in the bathroom vent ?"
"NGL never heard of Kris, probably because I don't do tiktok but love the video, very entertaining and she seems like a right laugh. 
Definitely looking forward to part two and the haircut video.
Linus, when can we expect a ""How to"" home renovation video?
Telling us how to decide the best places to place outlets and conduit, as well as do and do not's."
getting Madison vibes in here.... ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Hilarious, luv it üòÇü§£"
"Linus: Ounces
Kris: Glazed Donuts per Bald Eagle"
"Kris is seriously a social media crush for me, this was so much fun to watch. Linus, you should hire her as a part time writer for your socials and mid video skits"
Damn she is awesome
Linus is so in love
"Me, I liked noticing how Linus acts around a pretty girl, it's like he has another persona. üòÄ"
good to know Linus still has PTSD after the twomad collab
Shes pretty :)
mommy
"Yeah nah, stick to LTT employees. At least they know what they bought and why."
The colab I never knew I needed.
TWO PARTS!
So much flirting hahah üòÇ
The collab I didn‚Äôt know I needed
this is the best collab EVER
"Shes awesome, I love this collab"
I LOVE this video BUT i HATE this video because i cant watch the second part:(
"I still can't get my head around people spending tons of money on a TV, and they get get a little dinky sound bar. Sound bars, even the good ones, are not that good. They are ""better than built in sound"", but that's about the extent of it. But I guess I'm just old school running a component home theatre setup."
+1 for Kallmekris haircut!
"Lol ... better titel would be ""Linus Destroying his Clients home before hiding it"" XD"
anyone else think that when he said is the any hope for this hair he would say that  the vid was sponsored by keeps
Is there a chemistry between these two or are they siblings?
Those videos always make me so sad because ill never have a nice PC like this T_T    Potato PC 4 life....
Hard pass
"When Yvonne see's this, Linus will spend the night on the couchüíÄ"
"Yea they aren't as pretty that way but I have all 6 of my LL AL120's set as intake side and bottom, Got a rear case fan and 360 corsair elite capellix exhausting out the top, Amazing thermals in my Lian li O11D evo! Such a sweet build"
Simps in comments ‚òï
what is the mouse like device linus uses on the wall before drilling
"everytime Linus makes a cringey joke (110% of all his jokes), a child in africa looses an RGB LED light"
love the hs8's. one of the best and flattest sounding monitors out there.
Linus getting crazy in presence of girls like he's not even married
Who is this?
Love this. going to watch part 2 now.
Anyone else notice the flirting going back and forth here?
You get the feeling of peeling the biggest peel in the world when Linus is insulted.
Thermal paste?
"I love this so much üòÇ
I've been waiting for this ü§£"
Who is this again? Never heard of her before.
"Linus Wife: Honey, why are you home late?

Linus: I had to teach a girl how to drill 

Linus Wife: Wait whut?!

Linus: What . . ."
To simply put it. Fun
Went to look at a house to rent and noticed a crappy paint job like this one. The owner didn't notice and was upset because they couldn't unsee it.
she is perfect for your show you two make a great team.
Why would anybody attempt to do this in one day?
LOOK AT THA FANNN
Reminds me of my current house. There's holes EVERYWHERE. Lots of them even have drywall anchors still in them. The previous owners must have had a ton of shelves or something.
Shamelessly broke it into two parts. üòÇ
"who cares, hit up Call me Carson lol"
"The goblin mode constantly jumps between Kris, Linus, and the actual construction of the house."
"Linus's t-shirt for the ltte store,
Don't worry I caught it with a foot.

Shirt number two

Linus makes Bob Vila nervous.

Shirt number 3  technology yes carpentry no.

Shirt number for every time Linus drops something take a shot."
More Kris please. She should co-host an LMG show.
"The white on white on white....Is very fitting..Hahahahaha
Im kidding everyone.
Jokes
:0"
"I have no idea who she is, but big points for the Prince/Purple Rain shirt."
she can be a twin of Rosamund Pike üòÄ
This Kris person seems really cool. Provided she doesn't do makeup tutorials I might have to check out her content.
i think this is the best makeover ive seen from LTT. this was hilarious and Kris was great!
"I haven't laughed this hard at a YouTube video in a long time, AND there's a part two?! I might just take a day off and watch the whole VOD on floatplane. You guys rock"
"Tech guy doest have a rotating laser for wall levels... Get with the program.
This is a great reach out to people that have been demonised over the last few years.¬†
You two did good.. LOLS
FKN Humans

;]"
All of these have been fun but this one is definitely in the Top 3
"Kallmekris is already very wealthy, because she is a famous influencer, why the hell does she deserve all new shit when she already has top notch shit.  You'd gain more social points if you helped poor people.  Like try going with a streamer that gets like 100 viewers or something"
Yeah but if it somebody famous then then bring more viewers because people recognize them
Who is this ‚Ä¶. Some Tik Toker ‚Ä¶. Ok skip video üëçüò≥üôÄ
Part 2 is not on floatplane atm
I really liked the chemistry between you two. Entraining video.
"KallherKlickbait, I guess having standards is just not profitable for you eh Linus. Quite the year you are having üòê"
"who is this girl?, I've never seen her before  ...she's cute, does she have a boyfriend?"
"I hope that's not an electical panel you covered up, don't want to be a nerd but that is not to code. And really unsafe if you need to turn shit off in a hurry."
LEGS 14:51
"14:48 did I hear ""let's go sideways maybe"" or ""let's go sideways Baby"" Should I call Yvonne?"
Why is everything crooked
she just said üê´
wow finally
He likes her. No blame. She's funny and attractive.
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them"""
"I've never heard of this girl, but I like her energy!"
She got money money she got personal in home client service with Linus himself! Thanks for helping to pay for the lab Kris
"This is great, please tell me Kris actually cut your hair after"
wow thought this video was coming out like 2 months ago
More Kris kontent
"This is 100% as chaotic as I expected it to be, but oh so much more satisfying."
Holy shit... 2 of my favourites üòç  üëåü§üü•≥
the variety of tool manufactures used in this gives me anxiety
Did they kiss after filming? ü§≠
"This was amazing. Hilarious moments, Kris is so damn funny!! I love her. Now I gotta follow on YT since she get nothing from TT."
That is wild she has made next to nothing from TT. Glad she is going to do more on YT.
Linus sounded like he died inside when he said I have a bunch of friends I just pay all of them
"For the love of god, bring this woman to LTT. She is such a good fit. Would love her as a host, and LTT does need a bit of feminine energy on the hosting side. She's a Female Linus."
Love it  they have the same energy xD
"Linus: ""So, you're really big on TikTok...""
Kris: ""F--k TikTok"""
Please wear safety glasses. Please!!
"I‚Äôm familiar with the bubble, Morty. I also dabble in precision, and if you think you can even approach it with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball and a bubble of effing air, you‚Äôre the reason this species is a failure, and it makes me angry!"
"when you drop your mouse, then see ""Your feedback will be shared with the creator"" and you're like ""wtf did i do lol"""
yvonne gotta watch yourself. these 2 got the chemistry
"I don't really like Kris's content since it's all really reaction content but, she seems cool and nice so that's cool üòé"
"""this is gonna take like 3 hours to build"" üëÄ me who can take apart my pc and rebuild it in like 10 mins..."
"4:40 minutes 
Her: am lonely I need friends
Linus: I don‚Äôt need to, I just buy them üòà
By they way Linus didn‚Äôt say that exactly"
80%!!! Damn!!! And that allllllll goes to China...
"So wait, KallMeKris and PaigeLayle both do lashes? üò≥"
"10:08 I think what we learned is that Linus needs a handyman for their tech channel, but a tech literate handyman like Brian the electrician, so that they have both good tech and good handyman work. With all the DIY stuff and tech makeovers LTT does, I wouldn't be surprised if they could keep a skilled handyman employed full time and keep them busy within their domain."
"@icezander Naw. Alex is definitely more of an engineer than a handyman. While they do have some overlap in skillsets and Alex could definitely try his hand at the role, a professional handyman would likely just do the job faster and better."
"@icezander I don't think so. He has an engineering background, not a contractor background, and when I think of all the handyman stuff I've had to do over the years, pretty much everything I learned when I worked residential construction. Being able to design and make awesome computer mods is a much different skillset than installing things in someones home in an efficient and seamless way."
"I swear that‚Äôs basically Alex‚Äôs job, right‚Ä¶? He‚Äôs got their own little LTT workshop and everything, he just wasn‚Äôt here for this particular collab"
thats me but im based in southern ontario. wont be going out to langley .
Just send dennis and colton for training.
can someone tell me how much this whole thing cost!
Purple Rain T-Shirt. One of the most awesome solos in history.
Being a girl is fun especially when u are ltt friend
Kris is awesome! Can't wait for part 2 - this was a super fun watch haha
okay 9:23 I've always done because it was the thing to do but I never actually understood you look for studs so you know what you're nailing into. TheMoreYouKnowFML
somehow i sat through the entire video laughing or smiling cuz its just too funny watching kris and linus do dumb stuff together
"The dynamic between Linus and Kris is hands down one of the best pieces of content i've ever seen on this channel, one of my favourite videos for sure!"
Kris works for you?
Asus ROG sponsor the video but even they've seen the @Gamernexus review and avoid their own case
This was pretty awesome fun. Keep up the good vibes Linus and team. Boyakah!
*Yvonne disliked this video*
Damn that was a joy to watch.
I love Kris! Great collab
I love the white/Black PC build!!!    Fun video!
NGL Thought her channel name was pronounced kal - mekk-riss
This was great chemistry! Might have to check the full vid !
Gotta love knuckle cracks
Been waiting for this for sooo long....üíÄ
Dislike the two part split.
"If linus helped upgrade our equipment, we could make one of the best cinematic looking video game show. Amazing upgrade as always LTT"
"This video is making me feel old, as I am much older than Linus.  Of course the video that he put out about computer magazines that he said he drooled over as a teenager was magazines that came out after I graduated High School, did 4 years in the Army, and had a job selling those components for Incredible Universe."
She's adorable.
quality video! LTT & kallmekris part 2?
QUIT BLOWIN HOLES IN MY SHIP!
This explains the haircut Linus has been sporting for the past weeks.    Bonus content - Tech makeover and Linus makeover.
Plz do a thumbnail of emotionless neutral faces
"Who is Kris Collins, never heard of her before."
thats why I love the way we build houses in germany! You can put Nails and Screws anywhere you want haha
Ahahaha a cool collab!!
I NEED AN UPGRADE PLEASE
I've been watching her for a long time when tiktok and what not and I've just realised watching her in this video I don't know if I am right or wrong but she reminds me of the girl from video game high school you know the one that's kind of them Luna lovegood type of person that's who she reminds me off I could be the wrong but meh
Is it me or was this a love connection?
clown
L
Literally who?
More Kris please!!!
14:06 anyone else get Trevor Moore vibes?
Y'all are such screwdriver teases
The collab we didn't know we needed lol
What is the model of wall mount for all the monitors?
"Ok, no one comment on the cameltoe plz. We are all adults here..."
Can someone do the honours a parts list?
Linus at his flirtiest.
10:45 HAHHAHHAH SIMP
"Why melt down the controller? It‚Äôs worth more money as a controller than the gold. So sell the controller to someone and buy NEW GOLD. If you have 10 millions subs, someone wants that controller and will pay more than the value of the gold for it. Be smart and sell the controller and buy new gold. Seriously."
"If he could have sold it, it would be sold by now.  I think you overestimate the value of Linus' celebrity."
The collab I didn't know I needed in my life.
@24:25 part 2 is not yet on floatplane
"Never sure when they do sponsors for big youtubers that could just pay for every thing, but so glad to watch this.

Kris is great fun and her and Linus work well together."
"O, Swiss cheese walls will be absolutely everywhere in a few years. They‚Äôre easy to patch. Studs can be hard to find. Specially in very old homes. I had to just drill and drill and drill to get my parents tv mount installed."
So in what way is this person you're building for problematic?
hands down best colab ever
16:23 his face is killing me üòÇ
Anyone know the brand/name of the studio monitors?...
Full Parts list?
this is by FAR my FAV LTT video so far..
BEST... EPISODE... EVER...
This had a low key flirting vibe kekw
she's tired of doing litteraly nothing the whole video while Linus is sweating his ass
love her shirt
shes really funny and cool
"what a baddie



kris is cute too"
"Linus Intel Tips, strikes again."
Pc looks so cool with  this white style!
"Every time......""we are just going to have our IT guys do that install, they can handle it"".  üòÇ"
You should at least introduce her... I know who she is but probably many people watching you channel does not...
"My dumb brain 18 minutes in: ""hey, she looks like that one small creator I used to watch back when I used tik tok"""
We have to stop filtering with ‚Äúyou might not get the reference.‚Äù We have the internet. There is no excuse for not knowing something and if you don‚Äôt know you can watch it immediately. Youth culture is dead.
This was amazing chaos
Didn‚Äôt they already do this video?
I‚Äôve been waiting forever
"Okay, I want Linus to makeover my little studio apartment now."
"Wait this a two parter, well I hope to see it soon."
10:43 hahahaha
she seems like a lot of fun i like herüòÄüòÄüòÄüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
"If I were listing folks to help me move, I'd not put Linus on the list.  Especially not with anything breakable!"
POV Linus: ü§ì
Any simps watching the video?
I love her she really makes me happy. I wish I had friends like her. I bet she‚Äôs a blast to hang out with
I work with someone in her 60's who still has this same kind of energy and can confirm it makes the whole office experience more fun.
WHO is she? ü§®ü§î
Do you really need to drill into a stud to hang up one of those acoustic panels?
"""can we have a Thomas Middleditch and Jennifer Lawrence movie?""

""We have Thomas Middleditch and Jennifer Lawrence movie at home""

Thomas Middleditch and Jennifer Lawrence movie at home:"
I feel liks i just got slapped in the face when realising she's the girl that does the russian skits üòÇ
"Kris is by far my favorite content creator on TT and it's a shame that they don't take good care of the people that make them all that money.

Enough of the doom and gloom. I loved watching this. She seems like a very fun person to be around off camera too. Impatiently waiting for part 2. 

Also if you wanna strike back at the YouTube's, upload a video with a 2x play speed. Viewers have to watch it at 0.5x play speed, effectively doubling each view as the algorithm calculates it based off view time/video length at 1x play speed meaning a 10 minute video is now logged in as a 5 min video with 10 minutes watch time per viewer. The algorithm sees this as the viewers like it so much they replayed meaning the video is extra good meaning they need to recommend it meaning it gets plopped down all over the place meaning it exponentially gets more views than it should, and will most likely end up on the trending page and the exploit is based off the entire way the algorithm is built so they can't even stop it from working without a massive overhaul of the algorithm itself."
Yvonne is gonna hate-watch this video ;D
You think you could make me a pc? It's like one of my dreams to have a big rig and I would love for one. Ik you probably dont even read these tbh but oh well üëç
"One of the best videos you have put out in the recent months, really good synergy in the video and genuinely made me happy to watch !"
"Linus please let me come install all your tvs! Lol no hate but please! Also as for Kris‚Äô OLED, whether it‚Äôs yours or someone else‚Äôs, PLEASE take of the back plastic on that tv!"
"Idk who she is but damn, this vid was so fun, how to say, a lot of chemistry? Pretty cool."
This is the best video! Your energies mesh so well ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Its so wild to me how many different pockets of YouTube there are. I follow quite a few different types and groups of people on YouTube but had never even heard of her (no disrespect to her). She seemed really cool in this video so decided to check out her channel. OMG she has over 6 million subs. I am one of those subs now. Great video, and love that with videos like that LTT‚Äôs audience gets exposed to other content creators who they may have not heard of before."
She‚Äôs super TikTok famous rather than YT famous!
Linus meeting female Linus.
"As someone that's painted longer than Linus painted and ran LMG combined, I have to put blinders on now when I enter people's houses to save my sanity. The overwhelming majority of ""professional"" painters today aren't qualified to paint a doghouse. Mostly because it pays terribly anymore."
Chemistry üòè
"I feel like camera man was like ""oops I'm filming her bum again"" and moves or uses Linus to block it. Kinda sad really that he has to do this like how thirsty are nerds online like jeez."
"Can anyone tell me what the mounting used for the LG TV was? I need something like that for my project.
These LTT videos are absolutely amazing and have certainly given me tons of inspiration"
"No wonder, I feel like I knew her somewhere @_@ ü§™,  she's the girls that has annoying brothers and sisters üòÖ"
WOOOOOOOO! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEA!
How often was the word friend just thrown around?
Asus Ultimate Tech Makeover > Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade
Oh dang Linus is so old he's almost as old as me ü•≤
14:52 bad time to point out the legs ...
The camera guy should have made her aware.. Moose knuckle is probably not what she wants to be famous for.
I subscribed to floatplane just for this and between last night and this morning I watched the full 6 hours. I don't understand how or why it was worth it but it was.
It's been 3 months you said you were gonna upload this
"These water bottles are nice, but you should drop this imperial Oz nonsense... Let's go metric !
LTT Water Bottle : 1 LiTTre"
The way they're so advanced technically and use brushed drills in 2022
"1:36 - Percussive Maintenance.  works everytime, 50% of the time."
That acoustic treatment made a difference the second they brought it into the room.
Alright congratulationsüéä you have been selected among my shortlisted winner's.
"Been watching all YT videos on double speed lately, and I like it."
I've seen the post so long ago I thought the video was never gonna release lmao
ok who is this?
callmekris
"Kris is a cool chick and yeah, this stuff always takes way longer than expected, they haven't even installed and updated Windows yet. Mind you, there was a lot of faffing about about as well! :)"
I'd love to hang out with Linus and help set up equipment like this! Another great makeover.
Evon watch out üëÄ
pineapple
"I still don't get why widely known companies (not only tech) still have to sponsor these absurd amount of moneys (intel extreme upgrade for example, for LTT, but cameras to others, furniture, cars etc), to the rich and not just drop their prices or spend the money to R&D"
17:00 linus starts rapping
no windows license huh 0:18
After Linus visits your home for the first time: *Repaints*.
It's like brother and sister.
"It was only about a week about youtube started sending me kris' shorts, and now she's on LTT?  the algo at work"
"Linus gets in turbo mode from minute 16, XD"
They should have called in the Perkins Builder bros... üòÅ
"i dont know who that is, i need some context"
what great video made me laugh alot but where is part 2
"just love seeing people who can afford the kit get it for free. Not. Skip to 16 mins to actually get some tech (TVs are barely tech, mostly) and finish watching bad DIY"
"""Tik Tok doesnt pay Jack**** right?"" 

Aww look at YouTube out here taking care of their creators, very good. Love ya YouTube"
rich people getting more free stuff. yay
Franklin Sensor's stud finder is a game changer. Through out those other POS.
I have been waiting for this for so long!!!
"she looks like a holy wood actress
 ^^"
but why would you even want to avoid the studs just screw right into them it¬¥s way more stable than any other dry wall anchor
Waited forever since the shorts
Waited forever since the shorts
Had no idea who she was but she seems like such a delightful person! Very funny vid :)
"This is easily my fav makeover video so far, by orders of magnitude. The chemistry/vibe is perfect. Hope she gives Linus a makeover of his own, he needs it!"
Why did she not act in different characters throughout the vid
Yes! Two of my faves collaborating! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
"dude that collab was amazing, i've had so much fun watching the whole video!"
"From ghost hunting with Sam and Colby, to now building computers with Linus. Kinda curious on what happens next üòÇ"
Most chaotic client? Twomad?
Linus has a lot of friends because he pays them
I have no idea who this girl is but she was wonderful and hilarious. 10/10 Collab.
Finally I waited 8 Months for this
wow the comment section for this vid got akward AF
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them."" - Linus
This is like the only life advice that matters this century.

Edit: Best crossover so far."
If you ever hire a handyman I'm your guy. I know my tools and my tech. By graduation piece was a wall mounted walnut desk with led backlight and a pc embedded into the tablet top. Btw what you just call level gave me the chills.
"Providing Linus with a nail gun immediately had me concerned, lol!"
short linus moment
Amazing on screen chemistry. Too good to be a one off.
You guys are adorable <3
"Hey ASUS, wanna send me some pc parts?"
"21:15 Why doesn't anyone realize that thermodynamics, in that heat rises, gets thrown out the window as soon as active airflow is introduced? It doesn't matter whether the bottom is intake or exhaust, or whether the top is intake or exhaust. The law that heat rises plays basically no role here, so there aren't any physics to 'fight'."
"The buoyancy of hot air does not get cancelled in any form by airflow. It can get counteracted to the point where the heat eventually ends up being cleared regardless of the direction of air, but it is easier to move hot air out from bottom to top, not top to bottom. Not to mention the fact that in case you are moving the hot air down, areas with less airflow such as around the fans and behind the motherboard will accumulate heat and start to radiate it, creating a greenhouse effect. Also the freshly expelled hot air from the bottom will rise on the outside of the case and get sucked right back in by the fans on the top. All of this might not make a huge difference, especially with enough ventilation, but in some cases it will, and it will never have 0 impact on the performance, because you can't just erase physics completely, unless you do such thing in zero gravity."
"5:37 As a bit of a Goth myself, I approve of this message."
18:08 learning about TikTok
"Oh man. PC and laptop totally died in the same week :( 

Got some much editing to do and no kit!"
"Isn't that exactly NOT how to install an AIO, with the pump being the highest point of the loop?!"
OMG i cannot wait until Nicolas's extreme upgrade
My favorite Youtuber and my favorite tik tok person.....   BEST VIDEO EVER!
The Cringe! It BURNS!
"If ya'll enjoyed this you need to be on Floatplane. All 6 hours, unedited.. it's hilarious. I still have like 4 hours to go lol."
camel...........
Those screws that are above the panel look slightly too long.
is it me or is the aio the wrong way up ???
Build stuff on a honeymoon is legit a better idea
Ever use a level for a project and then discover that the entire structure you are working in has settled and is no longer level so all of your stuff that is parallel to a tangent of the earth's sphere but is totally crooked relative to the room? Pro-tip: sometimes a square is a better idea.
KallMeKris? Isn‚Äôt that ‚ÄúKallMeWhateverYouWant‚Äù üòè
Who
the best advice for linus' hair is to keep the beanie on
The last time Linus flirted this hard was with iJustine
Finally
Yep. Once a painter. Always a painter.
This is hilarious because I just discovered Kallmekris a month or so ago. This crossover is just what I needed.
another tip for finding studs... if it wasnt obvious. all power outlets are mounted directly next to one! theyll either be on the left or right of the outlet. and all studs are 16 inches apart. useful to know info!
All I.T guys are vertically challenged Linus does she not know
"Why did i downvote this video: Don't misunderstand me, she might be the best and nicest content creator that ever existed, don't misunderstand me here; sorry but the fact that she get sponsored a tech upgrade as a successful streamer does make me angry; there are enough people out there that can't even buy a cheap pc, moreover get a whole new setup, but if you are successful, you don't even need to pay for it. For this kind of money, you could make a pc-building marathon for people who can't buy one, with average specs that can't affort this themself and really turn things around. And yes, this might be a hard case of whataboutism. Still this is the reason i downvoted this video."
"@Nothing I don't give anyone the fault out of it, but it still disappoint me. Just wanted to point out that not everyone who downvotes are haters."
"She doesn't decide if she wants the sponsor or not, she asked Linus for help and ASUS saw this and offered to supply and sponsor Linus for this upgrade, it's much more worth for the business because they get promotion and get to stay relevant as opposed to just giving parts away to strangers like a charity."
"Linus: ...""eyeliner""...
Yvonne: *waiting him to come home*"
"15:47

linus: shit thats right i have a wife.

19:55

linus: shit thats right i have a wife AND CHILDREN"
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS OMG
I didn't see this coming.
The rich will became richer indeed. While a peasants like us will rely on giveaways and stuff to even own a GPU...
"The blur/pixelated effect to cover the outside of the house in this video improved a lot over the way it was at linus's house, it was really distracting to see the blurry effect cover not only the outside but linus too, in this video the cut between background and person was was done great!"
This might be the best crossover in history.
TI stands for tiny improvement.
Linus on heat :/
this is like a crossover from 2 universes
Why do you wear a beanie indoor?
How long do we have to wait for part two if we don't floatplane?
She has better setup me and never worked as hard facts! Unless she has built houses for homeless in south America c and ran Rice up mountains and clothes.  SMH if only video was ubiquitous
linus focusing on the paint job is so ADHD. I see myself in this :D great makeover. love the ltt makeover videos :)
KallmeKris should do a review of the install by her Characters. Wanted to see Linus react to the Kids
Paint rant all over again
Ummm news flash Linus if you pay them they are NOT your friends .. lol üòú jk
"These guys have great chemistry, it's clear why they are both popular internet personalities."
The personalities in this video merge perfectly!
6:23 makeout coming in 3..2.....1
Ill give you a like and a comment - please give us the part 2
"Lol minus Linus didn't even catch himself ""She screws! But can she drill"" I dunno let's see get the peg Lol üòÜ jk this will get blocked"
"17:00 Let me translate that!
""Don't worry i caught it with my foot""
Means: Don't worry I kicked while it was down..."
Its so funny to see these NA videos where everything needs to align with a stud or they need to make some sort of makeshift beam for it. In Europa you just drill into the brick and its not going anywhere after that :D
damn linus looks like he is sun tinted compared to kris :)
"OCD kicking in; if that left panel is level, WTF did happen with the TV mount?"
You know Yvonne was watching this video very closely. And she‚Äôs watch the next one even closer üòÇ.
nahhhhhhüíÄ
hey linus did you hear the emergency alert today?
This was so much fun to watch :D
"Day #12
Kris is getting a less jangky setup with so many holes I think.
Watching something which I'm never gonna be able to purchase sucks but you know I love watching these Linus brother I wanna be in a rig reboot or something üòÖüòÖ"
That was incredibly fun to watch
W Rizz
"I cant stop laughing; my stomach hurts! And then, linus says he shamelessly sliced it into two parts!!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Kris is absolutely amazing.  I always love her videos.  So glad you got her the tech she needs to make more content.
"Question: Shouldn't the AIO reservoir be mounted the other way with the tubes going up, or at the top of the case to help prevent air bubbles going to the water block/pump?"
"No, OK here. Pump isn't at the top of the loop."
Only knows it in ounces.. my disappointment is immeasurable
üòá
Where's Chad
I can see the wife watching this....screaming...
"The question is Linus is your lever leveled? The video don‚Äôt show all, did you turn the level the otherway to make sure it‚Äôs correct?"
"I loved the ""We're going to need some help!"" knuckle cracks!"
"üëÜüëÜüëÜ
Thanks for your feedback,
Expect more videos soon
Inbox me on the name above, I have something for you"
"""She screws but , does she drill""
* rock eyebrow raise"
*bumps cheif keef
"I see all these comments and I just hear Yvonne going ""It's funny how..."" and Linus going ""I swear it was just a tech upgrade, we're not even friends, I'm not paying her"""
@Don't see me bruh
@Don't see me lol
Gay member.
what happend to NCIX techtips
"22:30 

The real reason I like when people pick on you is because you're so cool about it.
You don't get offended, you just go with it and you don't have an ego that gets in the way.

It's just nice to see that you're actually just a really down to earth tech nerd like most of us."
"It's like how friends are always roasting each other - except Linus doesn't know us, but we feel like we know him from the videos. I think they call it a parasocial relationship."
Probably moreso than most tech nerds I know!
"At least Linus has decent tools, üòú, never mind dewalt yuck!"
Most chaotic? You trying to forget about twomad huh
16:26 The moment when linus's entire life flashed before his eyes. ü§£
awesome vid & yes Linus were getting old bud
i thought linus was married
RGB lights are the worst.
Loved the collab!
They finally brought sam and colby fans and linus fans together
"""I have lots of friends, i just pay them."""
Cool !
"üîùüîùüîù

Seen some of her content. She is pretty funny.
"OMG, I love this collab with Kris! She is so great!!!"
no
Intel will reconsider of fabrication facility tour for Linus after seeing how he drops intel cpu always!
never saw someone meet the chaotic energy of linus so perfectly
She is overreacting but doing well so no complain on that!
DROP THE NEXT PART ALREADY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
why melt down that controller a one of one controller too. just lost all its value.
"""all intake, all the time"" next shot: exhaust fans :D"
"my first reaction clicking this video was ""WHOAT""? Kinda love her"
Linus putting holes in the wall perhaps he was a woodpecker in a former life lol :D
Dang. Props to the editors for making Linus sound like less of a misogynistic asshole :D
great collaboration!
is the mallet to help seat the ram?
üòÄ
Been waiting for over month of this and it was worth it. Linus and Krish match good. It was hilarious!!
It's awesome to watch you go through the process of building this stuff. These videos are really inspiring. :)
Yes
"You can just tell when someone is an extrovert. Either that or she just has lots of energy. 

In any case, this was a joy to watch."
The only thing truly chaotic about this was the sexual tension.
"I'm not a fan of morning shows, but LMG and kallmekris have the best natural interaction I've seen in my 40 years"
‚ÄúI bet I can find the stud‚Äù Linus. Points to right beside the electrical outlet. Lol! For anyone who didn‚Äôt know those electrical boxes are usually mounted to vertical studs. Knocking on the wall will tell you if it‚Äôs on the right or left of the outlet.
In the US light switch and outlet electrical boxes can both be mounted to the vertical studs per NEC codes I am not saying that they cannot be mounted to horizontal bracing It's just not required. If your drilling into a stud how do you hit a wire the wire isnt traveling inside of studs it may pass thru but typically its at the same level as your outlets and I have not found any reason that i can think of to put photos or shelves below my knees
"@Codex 404 He meant light switch, it wasn't an outlet on the wall when he pointed at a stud right above a switch."
"Hmm really? Over here they are almost always in between studs on a horizontal piece of lumber, so you avoid drilling into it when going for studs."
"Linus is either kinda short, or she's kinda tall"
Anyone know what the name of the speakers he was referring to? Around 21:25.
"Gonna say it, I'd ship these two..."
Damn she is qute af
"Why is her biceps as big as Linuses? 
What does she do or better yet, what doesn't Linus do?"
I think Linus found his work wife!
16:25 Linus in shock lol
"we need more of Linus and kris videos, the gap on their personalities are sooooo huge its amusing"
Is this video slightly sped up or do they have the energy of children?
Sponsored by asus ?? Isn't she that die hard apple fangirl ?
This collab was fucking 15/10
So that's what hapend to your hair.
Flirt much Linus? üòÇ
RGB Furniture?
she is very pretty...
üò± Ma OCD is so angry right now. That TV might as well be hanging sideways ü§£
"Linus: My Most Chaotic Client EVER
TwoMad: Am I a joke to you?"
"When setting up a studio, you might do the acoustics at the end to get the sound right. Unless you're Filming the process. Then it needs to be done first."
Well been waiting for this..
One of the funniest videos in a long time. Just wholesome and had me laughing the whole time. Good job all of you!
1:28 it wouldn't be a LLT video if linus didnt break something
"I had no idea who she is, but I don't expect to and I don't get the outrage from some of the Bro's.
I don't expect to know everyone, I don't use TikTok, and if people don't want to watch content they shouldn't."
Linus' face when his screwdriver was complimented was amazing üòÅ
"From where i'm from, building pc-s is not at all appreciated and so, even if you love doing it, you can't. It would be so cool to do this kind of tech room designs!"
It's a trap!
One of my favourite collabs ever!
17:00 the i9-12900k (Linus approved)
So who is Kallmekris anyway?
"No part 2 on floatplane. Bummer. Does have the full 6 hr day vid though, but man that's a long viddie lol"
"Oh man, Kris is funny! Linus should hire her and be friends with her. Actually, I wish Linus would hire me so I could be friends with both Linus and Kris... :("
The ltt screwdriver is the strongest personality in this one.
"SRB
 Sweet /..../ No joke / ...oh wow /. /.,."
"as in a good tiktok tradition, the video is split in two parts... amazing"
"""We don't even need a stud finder because your paint job is so shit"" 
I really feel that pain."
1:38 flex tape moment

What a weirdo.

this is one of those cases in which your accidently turn on your mic in an online class lmfao"
The rich are getting richer xD As If she dose not have that kind of money her self.
Is Linus really that short? Or is Kris just really tall?
"Put her on more videos PLEASE. She is funny and clever, I want to see her face and listen to  her voice more."
i have a feeling this video will make a lot of money via monetization
Im a huge fan of kallmakris and ltt
When h says most chaotic is he trying to pretend they never built for two mad
Omg I have been waiting so long for this üòÇ and I was not disappointed üòÇ Kris and Linus are hilarious together üòÇ I need more Linus featuring KallMeKris content üòÇ
My favorite collab you've done!
"i have lots of friends, *i just pay them* üòÖ"
"they have such a great dynamic, I would say mostly because they have such similar personalities"
The big guy's voice is so soothing. Love it.
This was a Kris-tastrophe.
Not a tech tips video if Linus doesn't drop something
12:39 I legit freaked out with the white screen. I thought my screen died on me watching another LTT video in full screen. Jesus H Christ
I really  liked the video
"The collab of the ages, we need more of Linus X Kris"
"Kris and Linus has such a same energy level and humor  on video, that this is the pure entertaiment üòÉüëç"
"The crossover i never knew i needed
and now i want moar"
She's so pretty.
That guy with the glasses that kept helping out sounds exactly like tony stark
Try running phantom forces on roblox its one of the best gun games better than arsenal
what is this? a crossover episode?
"She got her pulling trousers on, no doubt she's a woman in them."
"Watching this and Linus gets a ball-peen hammer in his hand. And then a single mention of ""peen"". I honestly expected there to be a lot more ball-peen hammer jokes from Linus. The man can still surprise me."

Linus and Kris are so similar lol
Linus can be such a flirt!
2:25 f1 fans lol
Nice chick.
"People need to come away from these rip off platforms that only exist to make billions from other peoples creativity & spy on us all.

Linus Drop tips was on FIRE in this episode
"Hell yeah, been waiting for this vid for ages!"
I Did that on purpose!
They do have chemistry
Linus fighting with other people's painters HAHHAHAAHAHHA
she is cute
I'm a big fan of the toe. Just saying.
Cant wait for them to enable Dolby Atmos to get surround sound on Windows and start getting that nasty sound glitch you get with the 30 series cards and the ARC on the C series TVs.

So this is where the complained about hair cut in the WAN show came from.

This was a fantastic video - Kris and Linus matched each other's energy and it's a great combination.
Finally! This video reminds me of my first visit to my dad's newly completed house and I found a dip in the middle of the main room's floor
Long have I waited
Literally the best Intel Tech upgrade yet!! ü§£
I run this case with all intake and it's perfectly fine
Who is that girl? üôÑ

Yesssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!
I think Linus got a crush on kallmekris
lol first time seeing her besides the funny tiktoks.
This is up there in the greats with Madison's rig reboot
after 20 years this video is released... my gad finally
It was good until you mentioned she doesn't have a server. Even for the sake of having a 2nd workstation....That's a situation that needs to be fixed and storage is cheap these days.
"10:18 ""You collab with the tech channel, the handyman is stuff is going to suck"" - unless Linus brings Brian the Electrician... Which, tbh, should be a standard requirement from anyone expecting Linus to do anything to their apartment."
But that i9 can be cooled with that aio? Or it still stay at 85¬∞ when working?
man i was wating for this for so long.
"I was like she's so pretty, why does she need to work at a tech company, she could have been a model or something and then they said she makes videos on tiktok."
I didn't expect this but OH MAN IS IT FUN TO WATCH
"the pc isnt airtight, therefore there are no disadvantages to all fans intaking as the air always has somewhere to exit from, infact if the fans all have dust filters, the PC will also stay cleaner this way due to clean air always being ejected from the unfiltered holes in the case and dirty air always comeing in through a filter."
love the dynamic in this Video xD hahahaha
What's the name of the Speakers @ 21:30
The energy between these two is almost scary
"YEAH KALLMEKRISSSSSSSSS
Next to madison's collab this is another of my favorites"
"Such a nice collab, it was really fun even though i had no idea who she is before! :)"
How about we learn from our mistakes and SCHEDULE MORE TIME.
üê™ üë£
first setup without any stolen office items
"Typical LTT viewer - ""i wonder what Linus with drop this time"". Typical safety officer watching LTT - ""i wonder when Linus will fall down..."" :D"
"I fucking love this collab, Linus and Kris just have that humour that easily flows between them"
If I had a dollar for every thumbnail I see with a persons mouth wide open ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so shocked like O M G you guys‚Äù
How un-Canadian of you Linus
i usually skip this part
Sometimes (allways ) leveled doesn‚Äôt look leveled ....better too eye level to surroundings
"If Project Farm does a video on this screwdriver, he doesn't even have to give it his best rating but I would pay more for it now that I know its ""that good"". Ether way I am buying one. Please make a stubby one. You could use some of the R&D you've already done with the ratchet, shaft, coloring. I want something easier than what a crazy tech guy keeps on him for me to be able to take with me when i ride."
"How cool is Kris, in everything she does.. She‚Äôs amazing"
Linus Flirt tips
kallmekris is like a mature version of madison
That's a horrible fan arrangement for IGD but that's ok she doesnt know what that is. lol.
the strange colab we never knew we needed
"Man, low-rise jeans really need to make a come-back"
Of course Linus would notice the paint. ü§£
Why did they rush him? 6 hours?..
"There should be a part two, where Kris talks to Linus as her characters (Janet, Katrina, etc)"
I thought you lost the footage
This is an extremely unexpected Colab. It‚Äôs also one that I am LOVING.
Kris‚Äô hands are significantly larger than I remember from tiktok
She sure keeps 'em high and tight.
Fun FAct- Linus was actually bald and he grows a hair each time he dropped a thing and now he wants a haircut.
Linus ..Why the hell would you not put more time aside for Kris :)
who?
This video was long overdue!!!! Love it.
Oh my God Linus used real acoustic panels for once I can die happy.
Best wall mount installs
"Hammer and Peen, the Peons choice of tool"
This video is 3 hours too short
I have no idea who this is. :p
3 months ogay
I wonder what its like to live life on easy mode.
I love her so much!!! This is so chaotic and amazing!!!!
"""How many liters is it?""... Whoever she is, I love her :D"
When is the video of Linus getting a Kallmekris haircut coming out?
God I love her üòç
Top of the line hardware and you're using Ikea furniture...
"Linus, the grey!"
"Soon there will be a multiverse of linus tech episode. Where he and Mr. Beast will be there. 

Wouldn't that be epic."
it's not level!!!!
someone needs to introduce linus to construction adhesive lol
"I guess I'm old and out of touch, I have no idea who this is."
I had anxiety kicking in when linus held that gpu 21:42
Finally why did it take so much time to upload that
Every time Nick appears in this video my brain gives a WWE celebration with pyrotechnics and loud music
"Next to Linus, Kris looks like Lady Thor."
So new so beautiful. She didn't say it's big.
"You should Collab with Kris more often. I'm Subbed to her, too. Love her content and positive energy, and she's always with the compliments to us. Great video"
Linus and Kris mashup I didn't know I needed! Love it!
Linus would bone vibes aplenty.
Kris has the same energy like that little girl from minions its awsome cuteness @.@!!!!!!!!!!!
Linus's face when she said he had grey hair
Mrs Linus is gonna love this üòÇ
Gen Z in mom jeans? Is that supposed to be ironic?
That PC build is actually sick! Like go to the hospital you have a fever sick!
Finally I saw this as a teaser on YouTube stories or insta can‚Äôt remember and I‚Äôve been wondering when it was coming out
It's not a true LTT video without Linus dropping something.
the flirting is unreal
Nice setup.I liked the ddr5.Great Sound acknowlegmet white and black. two infos out twow infow in.Sponsored by oracle.....create a hoodie in the ltt store head blocking the waves............NO information from girls. I am lisenced for an alarm system.
I saw everything ! I will tell Yvonne!
peng
Kallmekris and linus wow i love both of yall
She's like the other annoying/cringe girl that worked at LTT but awesome
You do not use a smithing hammer for woodworking!
And the Youtube Nobel Prize of on screen chemistry goes to
"Linus, after all the comments on the paint... we need to know... was it f***ing eggshell?"
what that wat it ? i need more now ! üôàüòÅ
"Serious Madison vibes too bad u guys fired her for no reason and refuse to actually tell us why.

Ya not a good look guys"
She literally quit
Linus just over there giving Kris tips like if you just get employees you‚Äôll always have friends
"wait... arent the tubes allowed to be below the cpu block ? doesnt they have to be above it, so you dont destroy your cooler."
This was 50% collab and 50% flirting
"She's a lot like Justine in character and cheerfulness, but she's actually capable! Love her jolliness, will subscribe ü§üüèª"
Linus speedrunning the build in panic is pretty funny. xD
This was so natural and funny could not get enough üòÇüòÇüòÇ
It's so funny seeing linus being so unprofessional while on a professional job
UM WHAT I DID NOT EXPECT THIS HAHAHAHA
She screws but does she drillüòÇüòÇ
Linus why are you wearing a hat inside during summer
"The fact that they only made it a part 1, hurts my soul‚Ä¶ thanks Linus‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to let my water cooling leak all over my pc now‚Ä¶"
"Casually dropping Intel Core i9-12900K, yup that's the Linusiest thing to do it."
knock him down..ppl love to see a hero fall
"""She screws but does she drill......hahahahahahahaha double entendre to the max"
duh
Im pretty sure Kris understood everything when Linus was rapping the components of the PC at 16:59.
"My girlfriend likes to watch Kallmekris
and i likes to watch LTT

and somehow they are doing this video it feels nice tho"
20:58 you shouldn‚Äôt have mounted the radiator for cpu that way. Because now the rad will have to push harder and the rad will not last very long. I understand other mounting methods won‚Äôt look that clean but still it is a matter of concern.
It will be fiiiine
"Am I only one, who doesn't know who is this?"
My word this video lifted my spirits... Kris's energy is so contagious
"I know it sucks being a bit older Linus, but at least you aren‚Äôt poor, lol!"
They so much like siblings
"So, will the 2nd part be uploaded here on YouTube at some point, or is it going to be only on Floatplane?"
Its been like 6 months since you promised this
FINALLY LINUS
I want to be wrong but it seems that either the TV or the sound panel is a little bit crooked
i saw a short about this like 3 months ago i swear
that's true  22:31
Gotta love the shameless flirting lmao not sure we'll see another collaboration between these two if Yvonne gets a hold of this video!
WHY DID THIS COLLAB TAKE SO LONG TO COME OUT?!?!?!
"Just a heads up. Buy some small super magnets for finding studs (ie, the nail heads) and you can leave them in place to outline the stud vertically instead of marking up your wall. Not every nail is perfectly centered on the stud so with 3 or 4 magnets you can more accurately find the true center of the stud. Plus it makes sure you don't accidentally drill into a nail head. 

The previous homeowner left me with 4 holes where he mounted his big screen TV. Problem is, I could see from the magnets that he drilled too far off center, splitting the wood stud all because he drilled just above the nail that was also off center, (""but that's where the stud finder told me to drill."")"
"Hi! Ehm i have a problem, I have a i7 9700K and a RX 6600XT and when i stream with my CPU my pc is extremely laggy but when i stream with my GPU its totaly fine but i get little but less frames plz help. I have 24GB of DDR4 2666mhz BTW =)"
Energy off the roof bro
linus's wife isn't going to like this collab
i would love to know how Linuses wife felt about this client
"Dude. Giving rich people who can afford this shit on their own is such BS. Maybe help actual people in need, not Internet personalities with more money in a month than the average American makes in 10 years."
"""My most chaotic client EVER""

Me: Did you forget about Twomad already?"
"Before i watch this Twomad was your most chaotic client 
Will edit this if this one is more chaotic"
"These collabs are only as strong as the chemistry between Linus and the creators, and this is one of the best ones yet."
I LOVE KALLMEKRIS SHE IS LITERALLY THE BEST!!!
"The anxiety that linus gives me is soooooooo high when he is trying to be quick.

Been subbed for many many many many years though so it can't be that bad ha.

Edit: Balances restored, Linus getting knocked down about 15068373 pegs in a video makes me sleep at night. Stay humble Linus ;) 

We all love you."
"Linus If you drill holes and want to transfer them to something. Tape over the holes and mark them with painters tape then remove the tape and you have a blue print of the holes to drill buddy :)
Use it all the time when hanging up stuff that has pre drilled hole"
I like the people who actually have a personality and don't just sit there confused or just be in slience
i didnt know kris works for linus
"Welp, Linus noticed the paint. There goes a full hour. :D"
"What I like to call, ""ADHD Extreme Edition"""
Funny How Kris posted a Video with this Room all done around April. Wonder why the multi-month delay for publishing this was.
22:30 you can literally hear the sound adjustment in the video because Linus' scream was so loud the audio clipped LOL !!! also i didnt know Kris was from here ! SO COOL!
Yvonne feels personally attacked by Kris
this was fun to watch
"Idk who she is & how famous, but I really loved this"
She TOTALLY wants you bruh...read the signs.. #cameltoe üòèü§™üòÇ #damnsheissofine!!!
"It's racist that you feature so many whites on this channel and also racist that you employ a lot of whites, Please fix this."
twomad?
"I'm not sure if the TV is too close to the door, I hope not, as the door handle should not meet the TV..."
"wow, cannot wait for hair cutting sessionüòÇ"
Did he just call Yamaha hs's ballin studio speakers
i want Kris vs Maddison
No Dan?
the 6 hours unedited version is available to the highest bidders!!!
So who is this? Another staff member? Just some rando?
Brought to you by ADHD üòÇ
How tall is Kris?
I have been waiting for this forEVER YESSSS
i like her a lot better when shes not trying to make me laugh.
6:26 kris's face is like ¬ø8|?
So who is this exactly? üòÖ
it's funny to see how the lingo has changed xD
Yay finally colab with someone i like to watch :)
Who?
This was really fun
Its not level my ocd is crashing‚Ä¶.. tv and panel üò©
How mad was Yvonne after this?üòÇ
"We're just gonna glance over the (possible cheeky?) ""she screws, but does she drill?"" are we"
the 12900k is a very watt hungry CPU too. 241w through the CPU area.. it needs those beefy capacitors.
Finallyyyyy. After seven teasers here and on other platform I started to think this was gonna be the same as the screwdriver. ‚ÄúSoon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù
This is basically just a video of Linus dropping things and getting distracted
So famous I had to Google who she was....
I am always so confused when North Americans work on the walls of their houses...what the hell is a studfinder and why are all of your walls made out of paper?
"Been waiting for this collab for so long ever since Kris hinted about it in a video, Guess ill go subscribe to Floatplane now to see the rest"
Why do y'all look like you're about to buy a van and go live out in the boonies...
"The best way to install acoustic panels ,is to leave them off the wall about 2 inches, so some of the sound traps behind them. If you are doing soundproofing, its a different thing. It aways makes me cringe to watch these kinda setups, the acoustic treatment is always subpar for the money. Acoustic panels don't meant crap if you don't install them correctly. And YT is full of ACTUAL AUDIO PROFFESIONAlS COVERING THIS STUFF."
Kris is lovely! As was Linus' interactions with her :) I like this collab!
been waiting for this since the tease way backkkk
"Covering switch boards isnt a good idea, you might wanna reconsider, there are vents on the door for a reason. Before you start renovating, you really might wanna consult someone who is a professional."
"OMG linus and kris giving off the same Canadian nerd, crazy energy, I love it"
Perfect combo
"well that was a lie, part 2 is not on FP yet, the 6 hour cut is though"
"linus next channel should be all about painting, he seems to be very very passionate about it XD"
I hope you are not metric  Supremacist not knowing liters I bet you measure in inches and feet too and I'd guess about 1.2l I figured a liter is like 33oz I'm sure I could Google the conversation but I know I'm close but I'm also not a metric supremacist
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them""
Honestly, if I ever become the CEO/owner/founder of something, I want that as a mentality. Be the friend of the people that work for you"
@Neon Dreams you're fun at parties.
"I don't think you understand what he means there... He's saying they aren't real friends, he just has people he pays do things that friends do, like help you move, because no one wants to tell their boss no."
@Gabriel Radu Taranciuc we'll see in 10 years
@Jonah Thrane We can talk about this in like a decade or so when that won't be literally ALL the money I make
I'll be your friend for 90k a year with a 3% increase every year.
"Had no idea who kallmekris was, looked her up, hated it."
I *love* the dynamics in this video.. absolutely tops the Madison x Linus video by a ton IMO
This is the colab I never knew I needed
You need one solid handy man on deck at all times my G. hit me up lmao
"The rest will eventually be on YouTube, right?... Right? ü•∫"
Linus installing the AIO upside down hurts me
7:55 Linus is secretly american üòÇüòÇ
YES FINALLYYY
She is every nerds dream .....
Nice attention to detail by not adding any black part in build
As someone who uses a level for a living that was so not level. You would have been better eyeballing it.
Omg Kris on lmg? Yes.
"Me : Chris Collins
Also Me : I'm a girl ?"
Meaty very toight Jeans
80 percent!!! holy hell!!!
Asus when they find out who is getting the upgrades WE ARE NOT UPGRADING ALL HER CHARACTERS HOUSES!!!!!!!
Can LTT just employ Kris? This is just the goated Collab and we need more
This needs to be a series!
Man this has been processing for MONTHS since you posted the short
after this linus found dead.....................murderd by evan
I have been waiting for this Video for so long
When Kris is taller than Linus üò≤üòÇ
22:29 WOOOOOOO YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
"Linus said ""Zee"" 690. I'm so proud of him."
what fans are these white ones?
"Yeah, that‚Äôs a 14-16oz ball peen hammer, it usually goes by Mechanic‚Äôs hammer. Actual forging hammers usually weigh 4+ pounds to help move metal better."
Kris and Linus. This is delightful!
finally
What case is it ?
pay her to be ur friend
the orientation of the AIO hurts..
"FINALLY
IT'S HERE
AFTER MONTHS"
"""she screws but does she drill?""  i feel like that was a joke that went unnoticed, or do americans not say screw?"
"kalmekris be liek everyone when they listen to their dad talking about something "" oooh ahhh yeeesh"" 20:20"
I hope his wife isn't the jealous type.
"Hey linus, No offense but your massaging tool sounds like the ‚ÄúAhh‚Äù snoring meme."
Unfair due to inflation
She's amazing and more fun.. Linus old guy move along
WTF‚Ä¶..she has made millions on TikTok‚Ä¶ she can buy her own stuff.  Lol
Sponsors do üëç
TikTok doesn‚Äôt monetize outside of the USA
Tik tok doesn't pay as much as youtube
But does the screwdriver have a light on it for using in the dark? ü™õüî¶
Been waiting so long for this collab and it was great! Can‚Äôt wait for part 2!
You think there's actually a part 2 coming?  Sounded like it's paywalled on Floatplane.
Now she'll have more subscribers
Ahhh finally at long last!
Linus SOOOO coulda hit that.......just sayin'
Linus's wife must be a little less happy after seeing this
Aaaah I do love a shitty PSU and dying Asetek AIOs...
"""How uncanadian""
Please forgive his wretched soul, he's pandering to your southern neighbors"
This collab worked
Cmon linus... i need all that stuff more than she does. Come reno my office! If i had one...
I like her purple rain t-shirt. Rip prince
Omg that was a smart move to remove the cardboard box of the TV. I've had a lot of work and in two people to remove the TV from the cardboard box !
"I watch your channel much more, but I love this grils videos.  This was good."
I am having strooong deja vu right now.....
FINALLY WITH THIS VIDEO JEEZ I‚Äôve been waiting for this for EVAAAA
"2:28 Cant say it's the purpose of it, but I use it for flattening nail heads, so they dont protrude past the wood for instances where clearances are tight and it'd catch on something else"
RIP that water pump.
Linus new wife?
I was waiting for this one
Congratulations you've been shortlisted among my lucky winner's
Who is she ?
took too long to upload üò∂‚Äçüå´üò∂‚Äçüå´
"I was wondering that too, this video was probably filmed 2 or 3 months ago."
They smashing
"instead of melting down the controller, couldnt you sell it to some uber rich rapper or some similar rich person that loves bling? You could do them a custom PC at the same time and do a video"
Also wait.... i finally found her YT channel no thanks to the LTT description section.... she has 6.67M subs and shes not even a youtube!?!?!? Shes mostly a tictoker? God damn Linus thats almost half of your main channel and she aint even trying....
Anyone else feel slightly awkward watching knowing his wife will see this? Tech flirting‚Ä¶.
LTT 5 Minute Krafts
review the prism+ monitors
FINALLY ITS HERE
I'm fukin dying
I don't know who this woman is but she is cool af
"""I have lots of friends.... I just pay them"".

Oh.... That hurt more than I thought it would."
"So I found out about Kris a while back. She's probably the only TikTok ""Star"" that I actually like, and this crossover is FUCKING WILD"
YouTube star too! I'd class nearly 7 mil subs at star level.
"Wow, Kris is super cool. Love seeing her take the piss of you Linus! Very good wit.  Work her into more videos LTT, very clever on camera & watchable lady!"
"Guess I'm old, idk who this is."
Linus life tips
Intel doesn't wanna sponsor an actual big name youtuber's extreme upgrade?
"I'm loving this tech-house-renovation-with-a-crazy-person-in-charge channel, keep it up!"
wasn‚Äôt this supposed to be posted like a year ago?
Why not wear a midriff top instead of w/e she's doing to that poor t-shirt LMAO!
who is that pretty girl?
üò≤üò≤üíúüíúü§òüèæü§òüèæü§òüèæ
"a non-controversial, sane collab? what did u guys do to the real linus"
I love Kris
this was so much fun
Linus the handy man you ordered from wish
A good collab for sure.
"When you invite Linus over to help you with handyman tasks, you should expect a solid amount of jank during the endeavor. Like, a good 6.5-7/10 on the jank scale."
@2:17 I thought she will say LTT Hammer from LTT Store üòÖ
EEEEE VON holler at me youre man flirting with this rando is cringe
"So I have no clue who this chick is ( and I dont say it that way to demean her but to say like.... not all your viewers know everyone ) So why dont you have a link to HER channel or pages, like immediatly under the links in the description that are directly making you money. You can do better here LTT. Your a whale now and when you collab with others you should be charitable, not greedu with 100 sponsored links, and other links that just route us back to you. I expect more... Honestly I dont even know if you linked her channel in the description, I got so exhausted of looking at line after line of your corporate nonsense that i gave up trying to find her channel or pages. You guys are in a power position now... please do better. We will keep supporting you, but dont make it harder than it needs to be to find and link up with the creators you collab with.... youre too powerful for this powerplay nonsense. Shoot us the viewers and the receiver of your collab a little charity with a easy to find and higher in the stack link to their shit. Youre not a scrappy underdog anymore ( sure you are compared to some outfits ) but for all intents and purposes LTT has made it and it did so EARLY, it should help lift up the next generation, not hord all the sellable space for disgusting and miniscule greed reasons. Come on, I know LTT is better than this."
Well her name is in the title and her Youtube @ is displayed at the start of the video... and she has 6.7 million subs??
"Little Kris knows, if she actually let's him know she's moving, he will assemble the lmg friends and march to aid her"
Logistics avengers.
"with how much he talks about their ""relationship"" and it's rate of progression lmao"
"Lets be honest there 1 in the same person.
They both drop everything and have a shit ton of energy and honestly there energy's match perfectly and its hilarious to see"
"Jake: I love you man. I loved your money first, but now I love you too"
"I have no clue who she is, but this sure was entertaining."
Wow this screwdriver is a epic in the making.
What is this the second coming of mom jeans.
"Linus Tech Tips Ski Mask edition, for all your tech based instore robbery needs"
Sus
"One: she's so cute
Two: if only linus can upgrade my 2nd gen i7 pc üò≠"
Why vertical mount? Just go the simple way making the fans work normally too
"Linus Home Improvement Tips?
Linus Carpentry Tips?"
I was saying in my head the entire video WHERE'S RILEY
@ 18:55 Linus its a Kall mE kRiS uNboxIng video Kris *INSIDE* ha LOL Voice Crack
"These walls?  skim-coat, none of that plain sheetrock s#!%"
this was like watching siblings nag each other xD
OK I need to know how much is intel providing for sponsored videos
I haven‚Äôt seen this much flirting since middle school. #ivegotlegs #doyoulikebread
"but wait, isn't that AIO upside-down...yes I went there."
so coool please part 2 now I don't even know who she is but Linus's charisma makes it so worth watching
"Linus I love you, man..."
"Omg, she's amazing!"
"I'm not one to complain about how people do their content, and I'm all for having exclusive content on other mediums, but it's a big step in the wrong direction to release part of something in one space and the other half/part in another."
I know that Linus is for sure loyal to Yvonne but I just can‚Äôt help but feel like his personality is so flirty.
@Sunny I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to say that.
She is probably the most beautifiul white woman I've ever seen. Y'all white chicks need to step up your genetics game.
Rich people get free stuff lol
23:29 Then he proceeded to get a haircut from Dennis after this
That panel ain't level!
oh floatplane ftw!!!!!!!!!!!
"She‚Äôs great,  more please."
Poor Linus - simpy cannot help slamming a bad paint jobüòÅ
She completely  roasted linus. Whaoooooooooooooo ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
The rich get richer.
Paint rant \o/
"Linus: Kallmecurious
Kallmekris: I'm also curious
Linus: No you're kris üòÇüòÇ"
OMG the collab I didn't think I needed üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤ü§Øü§Ø
what are those studio monitors?
We love Kris!
Is it legal/safe wherever you're at to cover an electrical subpanel?
So good that Linus decided on a sequel
Where's the link to the TV?
Someone please sponsor me
yo she bad asl???
Linus went FULL punny in this shoot lmao. I love it.
I wish  I had a gaming PC I had a Xbox 360 since 2010 and finally got a ps4 in 2019 and still have a ps4
"Here's the great thing about being internet famous: she probably has millions of followers, but I have absolutely no idea who she is."
Is she the girl who does the misha and sergei skits?
that look of fear when kris mentioned a gray hair lol!
*realizes Linus has not posted the PC with only 4 minutes left* I wonder how long we have to wait for part 2...üòÇ
I think the two mad build was by far the most chaotic thing I seen on this channel
I love this episode. Kmk is hilarious
The sexual tension here
I haven't seen Linus be soo nice haha. I love it. He was in such a good mood.
"Cable tech comes in, ‚Äúwhere is your panel?‚Äù Um I dont know. Extra hour trying to find panel for a 15 min hookup. #techlife"
"did he ACTUALLY get a haircut??? It's a huge improvement, damn. Kristina is a legend !"
Glad to see you two had a nice honeymoon! Lol
"Linus, stop sitting on the boxes!"
"I've seen the ProArt on line, but never anyone who used one. The specs look great, so why is it so obscure?"
Linus Drill tips
"I don't know who she is or what she does, but she seems fun."
"For the initiated, you'd think Linus was flirting.  But he's like this with guys as well"
It sounds better in there because you drilled a bunch of extra holes for the sound to escape through ;)
"Not even surprised TikTok takes 80%. Fund that Winnie.
Cancer platform that promotes all kind of garbage and doesn't moderate shit."
pro tip: 100% able to watch this video on 2.0 speed 12 min vid! wheeeeeeee
I‚Äôve been waiting for this for so long. It has 100% lived up to expectations and I can‚Äôt wait for part 2
"Kris need to work at LTT, she seems soooo cool as a host, idk"
Linus grampa
"Finally! This has been teased since last year.
I love Kris, she's the reason I made a tiktok account, her skits are amzing"
"Title fix 
Linus flirts for a whole video"
"Is Linus that short, or is she that tall?"
1 more super lovely female staff who we would like to see her more often in this channel.
I thought the Sony sound bar was the best one you have heard as of yet?
"I have lots of friends, I just pay them üò≠üò≠üò≠"
she looks older than u lol
Wait... Yvonne wants to do What to the gold controller??!! üò≠üò≠üò≠ DADDY NOOOOO
Deja vu
"I've never heard of callmekris before but they look so familiar? Have they been on TV?
Oh, nevermind, they're on TikTok!"
I've had such a crush on this woman for forever ü§©
Can I get a $5000 tech upgrade it was my birthday 4 days ago
yes
I love Kris‚Äôs vessi adds
"Very entertaining part 1, can't wait for part 2.  Or maybe I'll just get that floatplane membership for exclusive behind the scenes.  Anyways a great and fun collaboration.  Kris should be at LTX next year, as a guest speaker :D"
"Dont' worry Linux, you would always be ""that youtube kid"" to me! ‚úåüòÖ"
"1:25 I'm sorry but you CANNOT cover those panels. That's illegal. Electrical panels must be accessible. But hey, you do you."
"@MegaMech and anyways, when you saw electricians destroy stuff (in whatever country that was) did they destroy the stuff because it was illegal? Probably not. More likely they destroyed it because they couldn't access the panel. Am I correct?..."
"@MegaMech have you seen electricians destroy hvac and other shit in Canada? No you haven't.
So you are wrong and I am right."
"@Jehty I'm not wrong. You cannot cover access panels. I've literally seen electricians destroy hvac and other shit that was placed in the way. Tbf, I have no idea what country you are in. So maybe your laws are different. But I'm pretty sure Canada and at least some of 'murica would have similar rules on that. There's a specific number of inches away from the panel stuff have to be. You aren't even allowed to paint electric panels nor electrical stuff in-general. Like you see people painting over walls and they paint over the electric stuff too? Well some city employee has to come and re-do all of it costing the city thousands of dollars just because of paint. (is it a stupid rule? Sure.)"
"@MegaMech well, you are wrong. If you think otherwise then please cite the relevant paragraph."
"@Jehty It's in the electrical code-book. All electrical panels must be accessible. tbh, it's a home, nobody gives a shit. Especially since one of the panels is just telephone. But if one of those panels is an actual breaker box. It's a big safety nono."
Linus would go nuts in my house.
"This was awesome... I recently found kallmekris on youtube and have been enjoying her special brand of quirky and the energy of Linus and Kris together is akinda awesome, I can totally see them being friends."
I thought she looked familiar then linus mentioned tiktok. ü§Øü§£ü§£
damn kris and linus brings out really positive vibes
Were do you watch the second part to this video
Who is kallmekris?
Its three stooges meets abbott and Castello. So great. Kris need to visit LTT for a sever build or just fun episode.
"This is the type of setup video that only makes you feel worse the longer you watch it, but it is very entertaining"
where the smoll hand kriss? we need to compare it to linus's
did you guys ever update the mounting system for her system? since the factory one is known to bent and have poor contact?
"Every time Linus drops something a tech angel gets a pair of wings.

Love CallMeKris!
"Hey Linus, It's Jim again. Love Kallmekris, the youtube and the TikTok are both super funny! Now to the nitty gritty. This combined with multiple prior offers on different videos is my version of a trade. For new home wifi faster than what I have now, a gpu (rx 6600 or above) or even an entire pc, and something like or a Hyper X Orgins 60 (reds) because I have a small desk. For all of this I will give you authentic Canadian Maple Syrup that is in our nicest bottleing that was made in my backyard. 

Looking forward to your response,

Jim"
"That radiator connection below the heatsink and pump level is bothering me üòÖüòÖ I had done something like that once and it killed my AIO within 5 mins. Steve from GN did a great analysis on this: https://youtu.be/BbGomv195sk, I hope it doesn't affect this otherwise amazing setup. You should try fixing if possible, it will also improve the overall performance, and with 12900k , every degree counts ü§ì"
I haven't seen that kinda energy since ROG Rig Reboot 2019

"love kris, or callmekris, but then again she said I can call her kris so I will call her kris. 

However, does she workout her shoulders? She looks buffed in the video!"
"Asus and LTT going from giving away pc's to people who genuinely need it to this...idk who enjoys this ""look at my stuff"" content anymore. This horse is soup"

best collab in a long time
I have lots of friends...i pay them. LTT STAFF. older u get more and more u just high friends from work. movers are like that too

Is it me or the left panel is still not leveled
This guy having intel and asus fighting for the better sponsored videos lol must be great to be Linus these days üòÇ #hardworkpaysoff
God damn she's adorable
It started with the home invasion of iJustine... Another victim falls to Linusism
So is this why Linus' hair suddenly wasn't meh as of a few weeks ago?
"Kris: I'm really good at falling...

Don't worry, Kris. We are all good at something, Linus for example is really good at dropping stuffü§£ü§£ü§£"
"I can't believe how happy I was to see ""To be continued..."". IT MEANS THERE'S MORE OF THIS DYNAMITE DUO"

I'm so jealous of her room>...>.>>.>
seems like Linus  having affairs with his  hot female employees undercover intel tech upgrades/ renovations
These two have great chemistry on camera
Best collaboration  ever
Linus cant age..................
yeah JB HI-FI called... they want their sale stickers back
"man i thought she was pretty before but now she a knockout without body shots of her compared to youtube shorts i see her in(short youtube videos not shorts you wear, lol shorts with Youtube logo on them)"
"Well, This is not what i was expecting.
Very welcome surprise (: 
She be funny af!"
OMG OK 1ST OF I LOVE CALL ME CRIS AND RANDOMLY AT A STORE I SAW A LINUS TECH TIPS WATER BOTTLE AND IT MADE SO HAPPY ANYWAYS HAIIIIIIIIII HAVE A GOOD DAY
2:45 find yourself a spouse that looks at you like Linus looks at someone complementing his screwdriver
Linus has more cake than Kris
That 3080ti is chonky af
dayuum shes hawt
It's so annoying that Linus has family and needs to hurry all the time...
This is why you buy a studdy buddy. Finding studs on that type of wall is just a pain.
I couldn't for the lufe of me remember where I saw her at! I don't watch TikTok or reaction videos lol
Linus should not the aio be rotated 180¬∞
she works for you?
I've been waiting for this video since Linus teased it on the WAN show months ago. Great colab! Would be awesome to see more in the future though I don't know what they'd be seeing how they are 2 different channels.
I like how the Sonos soundbar's mounting thing is called Sanus.
"In the first 8 minutes of this video, this guy manages to shill his beanie, his hoodie, his screwdriver and his waterbottle. How anyone takes this guy seriously is beyond me lmao"
Krissie really collaborated with the most unexpected youtube channels
I guess not enough people joining Floatplane so you do a 2 part clip and tell people if you want to see the second part join Floatplane how BAD is that. Did not think LTT would do something like that how disappointing of you.
I think the title mean ‚ÄúThe Most Chaotic Linus Ever Been In A Tech Upgrade Video‚Äù XD
"If anyone is looking to add even extra enjoyment to this video, you should watch it at 1.75x speed. I did it accidentally at first, but then just enjoyed it too much to change it back to normal."
"Dude, you‚Äôre telling me I have to sign up for Floatplane to see the rest of this? Nah fam. I can‚Äôt be the only one that would unsubscribe from LTT if this becomes a thing. Right? Am I overreacting?
Edit: also I just saw, 6 hour cut?!? Folks, is this a thing you pay for???"
Yeah.  We can see what's happening here.  The magic twinkles in the eyes.  The raw animal connection.  Divorce for the big L in the near future?  Empires have been toppled over less...
She put as much effort into this as her reaction videos...almost zero.
"can't wait for a part two, and thank you for having a part two! one episode was not enough"
Your tv is not level
this is just sad lol
I think Linus just met his next wife.
FINALLY!!!
God i waited ages for this
"So much fun... so little time, for part 2."
cant stop laughing ...damn linus
Free stuff for rich people üòÄ
Can't believe Linus finally found someone to collab with that won't immediately cause controversy.
"""I have a lot of friends i just pay them"" linus"

Actually all intake fan cooling is fighting physics...pressure creates heat."
im glad someone other than me finally called him out on his uncanadianness with usd in the store and oz's on the water bottles
Huh. The full haircut convo wasn‚Äôt in the Floatplane exclusive.
Bruh you need to pay to watch his stuff on flowplane
"Kris just come over to YouTube. Tik Tok is to be discovered, YouTube is where you become an artist"

This godamn motherfucking screwdriver man
i have NEVER smiled so hard at a video title
WHAAAAT two of my favorite Youtubers :) this is a fun watch.
"Linus, I've been watching since your NCIX days, and we are definitely old."
Linus just married her . She is the other half
"Next time Collab with a handyman channel and a tech channel Linus comes in after its done right or the handyman teaches Linus to do it right, lol."
Yeah buddy lightweight üòÇüòÇ 6:04
Caleb was here
i get to sell soundbars. the ARC is nice because of it's features . sound quality wise there's soundbars and systems that cost half as much and sound immensely better. Sony and Klipsch come to mind.

Anyone else in hopes at @13:30 she was going to touch Linus with the stud finder?
Together they look like cute hipster couple.
the aio water cooler is upside down
Build the pc with all little hands!!!!
she's actually very dissapointed and impressed by Linus
CHaotic not....it kinda looks epidepic hilarous...
A collab I wasnt prepared for
YEAH!!!! Rich people getting expensive stuff for free!!! That's sooooo cool!!!
"because we love you Linus, and because you just roll with it perfect. makes us crazies feel like unpaid friends!!"
This was awful. I hate these.
Funny to see Linus go off about the poor spackle sanding for the paint job after the spiel about tech work vs handywork and which is more important.
The collab I didnt know I needed
Do you think Yvonne watches these videos and mocks every time another girl laughs with Linus? I just want to know if there is a jelly side of her hahaha.
Blame Canada
"Okay but that haircut looks *great*, no cap."
Who dis?
"It's not anyone's fault Linus, but people feel like your ego should be approximately the same form factor as you. :)"
How many CPU‚Äôs has he dropped by now???
you people just waste a lot of resourses
I have no idea who this is and twitch is my primary platform
This video was so much fun!  I love this woman!
Would you be able to make another video on ‚Äúmaking a pc using Facebook marketpage‚Äù

Is his hair shorter in the outro? I‚Äôm down for a third video that‚Äôs all haircut.
That genuine concern on his face hearing he might have a grey hair.
Never heard of her

This kind of chaotic energy reminds me of Madison's ROG Rig Reboot video from 2019.

Wasn't there a whole big thing about NOT putting your pumps at the top of an AIO loop? Are the tubes supposed to be higher than the pump? Or is the pump in the middle in this case bc the end of the AIO is higher than the pump?
"At first, I was like ""who is this absolute gem of an employee?!"""
This has to be the most fun Collab i've seen yet!
Been patiently waiting for this.. not disappointed
Shrimp pyyy üòèüòà

"Linus I wanna be your friend, I have own place in Mexico to which you are welcome.

I'm a motion graphics/ video editor too if you want a friend you can pay"

This is like watching 2 middle schoolers trying to make friends.

"Linus: complains about paint that not even the home owner has noticed

Also Linus: drops hundreds of dollars of computer hardware and doesn't bat an eye

He is who I aspire to be"
You can tell it's fun when it takes long
We absolutely need to see that haircut as a part II on Channel Super Fun
Yo but can we talk about the absolutely disgusting monetization split for TikTok creators??? TikTok takes 80% for basically doing nothing????
You're lonely? 'll be your friend. We can play minecraft together.

How did this collab even happen? I love her
This wouldn‚Äôt be a house vid if Linus didn‚Äôt complain about painting. Lmao
"Watching Linus throw around really expensive tech like it's a piece of trash is quite annoying.  I get it, he's rich,  gets most of it free from sponsor deals, and overplays his whole 'clumsy guy' persona to the point i think he does it on purpose now - but it really shows how wealth makes you devalue things that other people would treasure. One mans treasure is another mans trash i suppose."
"""The F*** is this"" -Linus looking at bad paint job"
"""WHO PAYED FOR THIS"" -Linus asking who payed for speakers"
wooh first video i have seen where im fairly sure linus has a bit of a liking and a thing for this girl :)
"I like her. More collabs with Kris, please. üòÅ"

Yes! Been waiting for this one!
Bring Kris on board with LTT!!! She's fun!!!
"So ahhh, can all LLT vids feature Kris now?"
Yup this was worth the wait. I love how well they complement each other's humor and energy. Excited for the next part!
@Ein Frosch~ lol
"ngl the first time I read your comment it looked like you said ""complement each other's horror and energy"" xD"
Funniest LTT video ever!!!! I could watch a ver and over.
kallmekris is one of my favorite people to watch she's awesome
Same paint job in our house. Fuckin crappy Canadian builders rushing the job and charging exorbitant amounts
she looks like she works at LTT lol
Who is Kallmekriss? Some kind of introduction would have been nice.
"I think Kris ( @22:02 ) nailed it (she's also very lovely and so wholsesome BTW), you don't want your friends and favourite celebs to have too big a head for their shoulders. Besides, any of my friends coming out with that would have a big barrell of sass waiting for them. They would do the same to me to be honest. The derty shets that they are! (but I love em tho).
Eagerly waiting part two!

[Edit: The height thing was a bit harsh though. Kris didnt have to be that short with you... ;) (sorry, sorry, sorry) ]"
"Part 2, only via paid subscription service. That's low, even for LTT."
"Not me thinking ""Wait is she the Russian tiktoker that pops out in my instagram?"""
this is the colab I've been waiting for
"To be _fair_, she was about 14, when you started NCIX videos..."

linus is the most alpha he‚Äôs ever been
"Linus thinks THIS is a rushed paint job?

I can see the manufacturer stamp on the dry wall beneath my paint so I know exactly what brand, type and minute of manufacture my drywall sheets are.. because the paint on interior walls is so damn thin.
And this is on top of the fact that our houses get to single digit temps (celsius) (<50f) inside each morning during winter. Who needs insulation? or double glazed windows? or sealed walls without gaps in them? Not me, I for one enjoy seeing the sunlight shine through the gap between my window frame and the wall while ants decide to come through.

Weee Australia"
Linus is so weird with the sexual jokes doesn't he have a wife
Why does that matter? He can't make jokes because he's married now?
Kinda sad no Kevin cammio. Great video and loved seeing Kris on Ltt.
I‚Äôm glad there are 2 parts
"In the 6 hour cut, does it include Linus sanding down all the walls in the house?"
Not a proper linus build till he drops a important component
I also have the LG C1. Best TV I have ever owned. Picture quality is stunning.

I can't believe we found the female version of Linus. This was hilarious! üòÇ

"Great Video Linus‚Ä¶ but

WHY ARE YOU MELTING DOWN THE CONTROLLER!?"
OMG Finally. I was wondering when this was gonna come out
"Man, she's so pretty and seems so damn cool, one of the few tiktok creators whose content I enjoy."
Really deleted my comment? Sennheiser AMBEO is waaay better than Sonos Arc Junk. Dem toes...
19:48 thats what she said?!? üòÇüòÇüôà
Wait... wheres her sisters? :(
Oh was this why Linus got the cool sidecut haircut now.. Nice !!
FINALLY!! I was waiting for this for so frigging loong! At last! :D!!
"THere is clearly some attractions between them. :D But tbf Linus`s wife is good too, so not to worry haha"
"Nooo, melt down is not the answer!"
"i'm a huge fan (haha) of these lian li fans, they just make life building a PC so much easier, and less cables also look better. Even as a beQuiet fanboy, i've put uni fans into several friends builds by now, and my next PC is also gonna have them."
What in the crossover event is this shit? Love the energy in the video!
24 minutes of just laughing my ass off. i think seeing the 6hrs is going to make me sub to floatplane
"Brilliant collab! So much fun to watch. Guess I'm signing up for floatplane now. This is peak Linus. Awesome.

Oh, and F* TikTok for taking 80%! That's downright predatory. I thought I was supporting creators on lives, not the platform."
That sonos arc is cracked on the right?
She's cool
She's lovely X3 hysterical too
Woooooo! Yeaaahhhhh!

Damn i havent reacted that fast for a video in ages
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them"""
"Kris always gives me the grandma vibes, but the youngest grandma in the world with more energy than a teenager"
She really earns the server storage! Keep it up Kris! :D
Yo! Great Collab!
That's why u need double bricked houses
I knew she looked familiar from the thumbnail but I didn't put it until I saw her walk into that empty room at the beginning of the video (i didn't know her channel name). I was correct and it's awesome that you're doing that for her cuz she makes really good content to
22:28 It's because it almost always appears that you're in on the joke and having fun in spite of it all. And because you dish out as well as you get. lol
"I've been waiting for this ever since I saw it was happening. Did not disappoint, love the dynamic between Linus and Kris."
it would be so crazy awesome if I could somehow work with y'all (whether it be a collab or a job lol) been doing Nintendo Switch OLED content since November and so far at 339 subs and 140k+ views! small numbers but lookin to learn & grow with experience!
"This was the best one yet, the energy and back and forth was spot on.  ü§£"
"""She screws, but does she drill?"" Never waste an opportunity to drop a mildly inappropriate innuendo."

She was one of the few tiktok creators I actually enjoyed watching before I deleted tiktok. Glad you two did this colab

"I love that she has the white Lian Li 011D Evo, such a good case. I am gonna be finally building in the one I bought soon."
LOL I didn't except that ending XD no wander why LTT did a real big push on the fact there was a full 6 hour cut.
FINALLY IT TOOK SO LONG I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR THE LONGEST TIME
fuck sake.. to be continued?!? i waited all this god damn time
You should have another collab with kris where she cuts your hairüòÄ
Are you even Canadian if you don't have a mullet.
"Truely said like people that don't drink alot lol 
""How may liters is 40 oz?"""
THE FLOATPLANE FULL EPISODE IS SO GOOD!!!!!
"it's not just Linus being a painter. If you've ever done large sections of drywall in your house, you know how easy it is to immediately spot imperfections you had ignored for years. Had to redo a 12'x17' section of ceiling in my house and began noticing all the imperfections in the drywall in the rest of the house"
"""Is that bad?""

""Ooh yeah, we're fucked."""
"Remember, there is a difference between level and parallel to the wall."
Ok this has got to be up there in LTT's funniest videos.
who?
Bad contractors should be named and shamed.
linus drop tips lmao
one of the best collabs ever. kudos.
"""I have lots of friends I just paid them"" best quote from Linus 2022 lol"
Oh that quote goes back well before 2022. He is just reusing it here.
"It's the young Michael Scott strategy.  ""I want to have 100 kids, so I can have 100 friends."""
"She more convincing at what she is doing on this video, more than Dennis."
"I'm Enjoying this, When is Kallmekris visiting LTT?"
ADHD Linus activated. üòÇ
Dude just dropped the cpu like it's cookies üò≠
She‚Äôs so funny and gorgeous too
"I feel like they really clicked - felt really wholesome to see two people get along so well, like seeing two friends you have known for a ton of time become a new couple and watching them enjoy the honeymoon stage."
If you are going to put part of a show behind a pay wall (even temporary) please advise at the start.
0:50 - Dang just standing them in the room made it sound so much better!
I love that energy from you guys :D It was fun to watch :D
Hey linus how do i get one of these?
It's the girl from the finger hands video
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but the purple rain t shirt."
Can't wait for part 2 this was super entertaining great energy between the two. Please actually make the haircut happen I really wanna see that üòÇ
@Darkrezz didn't he just get his haircut by Dennis on channel super fun? This might have been filmed a few weeks ago or longer.
the last scene... i think it shows him with a new haircut.... i think
18:31
"How does a hairdresser afford a million dollar house, and fund a hobby tictok career in her 20s?"
Hire her Linus...she'll get along with Sarah!
"Kris, use Gentoo GNU/Linux"
can't wait for part 5...
"Linus... I had to break it to you, but...
You are old"
You forgot to say stop
Before you said hammer time
"Linus was definitely flirting with her, Yvonne is going to be mad..."
That's explain the new hairstyle in latest vids
so. much. anxiety
22:40 i would never let that slide
I've been waiting for this video since that community post 3 months ago.
what is the case? please tell me!!!!!
I think Linus had explaining to when he got home.
I would have NEVER thought that Linus and Kris would make a video
This was way more enjoyable than I had expected it to be.
Mirror this on odysee plz?
smh an tik tok chick LTT getting so desperate for views
How about a link to the person you collab with in the description section so that people can find and follow them. ü§î                                                                                                                                                                                                 ü§î
Who is she ?
"This is so cool, why do I want a GPU painting guide with Callahan soooo bad üò≠ü§£"
I absolutely love her!!! She's so damn funny and not bad on the eyes. This was a blast to watch.
Holy shit I didn't realize tiktok was that bad lol
"Should people Linuss age be up on ladders? 
What if he falls and cant get up?"
the further along the video it went the more kawaii it got
"hahaha, that was chaos fun"
Is this the PC build they were going to make her that they talked about like 2 years ago?
"She's taller than Linus, lol."
who?
Put out the second part now I want to see it finished üòÇ
Love you guys tho
The back peel on the tv!
Hey I took offense to the handyman tech comment lol I could actually work in your outfit!! Can do anything construction related and have been working on computers since the Tandy TRS series...some people just like learning about everything.
"So many life quotes in this segment. ""That's the thing about good plans.. it's what you should have done in the first place."""
Great synergy :D
First unproblematic colab in a while.
Is part 2 only on floatplane? If so that‚Äôs a bit of bs.
The collab we all knew we needed
O-M-G-uh
yay! i've been waiting
2 parts lets go
Who is this broad and why is she wearing one of my mom's outfits from 1985?
did someone drop the arc sound bar? right side is popping off!
Kallmekris is so wholesome and wonderful addition. That was so fun to watch!
"Damn, part 2 on an entirely different website and paywalled?!?! Yeah I think I‚Äôm good lmao."
Those korean pants are killing me.... I would feel so claustrophobic in any pants that are above my belly button
Ok ngl this whole vid is my mind on a daily basis
the fear on Linus' face when Kris said gray hair amazing haha
Kris needs to consider twitch or YouTube even via shorts to take advantage of YT monetisation. Or Floatplane ofc üòè
Wait that‚Äôs the same tv I use no way
Man. I never have any clue to who these streamers Linus does upgrades for are.
I so hope the haircut happens!!!
You can tell Linus is into her lol
Linus got his ass beat by his wife after she watched him flirt for 6 hours.
"Finally, someone with whom Linus can see eye-to-eye."
"@JediS1138 she wore shoes and he wore shocks, so i think it evens out"
@Unpaid Intern I think he is still a hair shorter than her
Sooo... shes kinda short?
"I love Kris, she's awesome. Awesome Collab one of my Favorite Videos Now"
17:01 whale song lol
"Soooo uhhh... it's not just part 2 up on floatplane... it's a 6.5 hour uncut video

If y'all needed a reason to sub to floatplane... well there you go"
Yall both have the same crackhead energy and I'm here for it been waiting for this lol
"5:18 I have same ""monitor"".  It's great.  10/10 would recommend."
6months forward.... Kris gets a Jellyfish
This girl is very easy going how refreshing.
Kallmekris be like mmm yes yes I don't understand anything mmhmm yes
lets hope for the best. she teaches dennis to give linus a better haircut...
Been waiting so long!
I‚Äôve been waiting for this video for WEEKS so excited! Two of my fave comedians together lol
"But why are you wearing a sock hat indoors, in the summer lol"
Linus is such a flirt ‚ù§Ô∏è
Linus Drywall tips
"Yvonne....*high pitched condensending voice* ""should be a superpower "" hrmmmph. ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Why does this remind me of an episode of regular show
This was a great roasting session on Linus. 10/10 -IGN
"You get what you pay for

I use to work in home building and remodeling... but the ""work americans aren't willing to do"" under cut our prices so much we just weren't getting enough jobs any more.
Many of the homes built this year are already falling apart and people keep trying to sue over it.... but there is no one to sue. (You get what you vote for)"
"""You're the kris in my chrismas""? Tf does that even mean?!"
Most of the time she looked like she was laughing so she wouldn‚Äôt cry.  At least there was no jake
"Just say the holes were drilled by the one and only Linus Sebastian, then offer up the footage of him drilling as an NFT. Doubled your money."
ngl she bad üòª
"Hello, I coming to you from 5 years in the future to tell you the LTT screwdriver was a long-game prank from Linus! üòÜ"
I wish she was in a bra and panties for this
"Sometimes it seems like Linus knows everything and I‚Äôm like dang what wrong with me, when trying to remember computer stuff. When Linus didn‚Äôt know what a ball peen was called or for I just grinned and remembered we all don‚Äôt know something."
"Man I love Linus, but he does drop things a lot. lol."
"Linus: The painters messed up the holes
Also Linus: Messes up the holes

The irony is great because he at least covers up his mistakes better than the crap the painters tried, haha"
"What a great way to end/start the week

* how to timeskip to part 2 *"
"AIO watercooling mounted on bottom? Come on, guys ^^"
I will thumbs down just like the other 590 people for not doing a part 2 on here and forcing people to join your other plateform
"Come for the tech tips, staying for the paint rants"
"Not meant as a slight on Jake, but this chemistry matches all of Linus‚Äô house vlogs combined"
"Lemme sing something
Welcome to San Andreas it's CJ from Grove street"
eyvone replacement but more white
"Ture linus fashion. You end up with a sick set up, but everything gets destroyed along the way"
She's really cute.
This is the best collaboration ever two of the best YouTubers ever. Love Kris so much just started watching her videos and find them funny and entertaining. Great job guys keep up the great work from the UK üá¨üáß
"just what a creator that has lots of money needs, a ton of more free stuff"
"16:59 Don't worry, I caught it with the foot.  ü§£"
This took so long to post. It‚Äôs been like a month and a half since the YouTube short came out for it.
Dam wasn't this recorded like a year plus ago.... üòÖ
Why do I get the vibe Linus and the women he helps with tech upgrades wanna fuck ü§£
Linus without Jake is like Apple Pie without gravy
And now your 5 for 5 with picking collabs
Kris has callabed with nearly every YouTuber I watch
Linus is a good guy. We all love linus
"collab with tech guy, the handy man stuff gonna suck, collab with a handy man, the tech gonna suck. this is why you collab with brian the electrician. the handy man stuff will be amazing, and the tech will be all vintage stuff he has horded over the years."
‚ÄúF***ing EGGSHELL‚Äù kinda vibes here Linus
"I hate part 2s, no like."
Lucky to have so many paid friends
Your wife was glaring at you the whole time during this video....
"Damn, i love her. So gorgeous and so funny!!"
Who is this chick? She's wearing mom jeans.
his wife gonna be nervous
And again linus kills an aio lolol
"I love how there's like 4 different brands of power tools in use here. The manufacturers were like ""buy all of our tools so you can share the batteries"" and you were like ""No"" and everything still worked."
Linus has been knighted. Sir Dropsalot.
"I'll be your friend. ""THIRSTY"" lol"
This is rly dhit i want to see the results here
That gpu design makes my ocd go crazy ü§£ü§£
kris is so cute omg lmao
Imagine if they had a child. The energy that thing would have could power the SUN.
"My God, Yvonne must trust this man with her life. I've felt jealous half this video, no idea how she felt though."
Love watching rich people get free stuff
we got to build this computer. Meanwhile Linus 23:41
"Well, I'm old. I have absolutely no idea who she is. Time to head off to the rest home."
Me neither and I'm 18.
Hi Linus. since I'm currently 67 you will always be a youngster to me.
hey can we get cards to videos shown
the energy in this colab was amazing c:
MY MUM HAS LIKE 8000 FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK
What happens when similar people come together. Not 6 hours not 10 hours but 15 hours of none stope distraction war. Also how called beeny-man 23:36
why would anyone turn their monitor on its side like that?
FINALLY
I don't mean to sound rude but I have absolutely no idea who this woman is. What did she become popular for?
"me:
bruh pc was nasa pc 

kris got a nasa pc legit
bruhh i9 üëÄ

bruhh what gen 12

also me: 

 chaos's üòÇ"
12:37 oh my god the moment this scene came on I was like YES PAINTER LINUS PAINTER LINUS!!! TIME FOR A GREAT RANT!! And I wasn't disappointed!
Jeez Linus you think you could get any more static damage into the computer parts? Rub a bit of styrofoam over the processor maybe?
üê™
wait so will part 2 come over to youtube at all?
That's a mistake
How much does linus charge for these services?
Love her TicToks!
Rog prebuilts are kind of bad.  It was good that they sent parts.
When two worlds collide!
you get the $5000 in tech and furniture but he causes $5000 in damages to your house
Gonna be blunt... I have no idea who Kallmekris is
another Linus smashes video
I laughed so much during this tech makeover. The absolute chaos was something I really needed
Linus finally did a collab with somebody that isn't controversial lmao
"Linus : *drops the CPU*
Kris : *visibly freaking out*
Us : ‚ÄúFirst time huh?‚Äù"
Ahhh Linus Drop Tips back at it again
@Speeder just like in viva la dirt league
Well she obviously doesn‚Äôt watch any ltt videos
@The Cool Axolotl Logan Nailed it ! üòéüòé
Don't worry they need a few taps to remove the air bubbles. Improves performance...
So part 2 isn't up on floatplane
Linus is clearly not a networking guy. I have a glass side panel on my rack so I can look at my glorious patching!
"Linus ist ein Grobmotoriker ich finde das nicht gerade sehr sympathisch, er sollte daran arbeiten...."
"Bro i just firsthand gotta say that i love both of u guys soo much
didn't even believe the thumbnail at first
keep going both of u"
"Kristina is a perfect fit for you Linus, better than Yvonne."
I think you need to start bringing a handyman with you
Yvonne won't be happy about the flirting
Omg my TikTok and YouTube preferences have collided. It's learning.
SMIC is now at 7nm
18:10 hehehe....doo doo
SMIC is now at 7nm
Wow
love the energy here
"She doesn't even know, she don't want Linus helping her move... his signature move is dropping stuff, after all..."
cool seeing her on here. i love her tiktok skits. super funny
I like her she is super funny.
Finally! F**king finally!
networking closet is ugly?! I'm insulted. It's beautiful!
LinusPaintTips at it again.
How Linus acts working around a cute girl
its weird watching linus act different in videos where theres a girl involved.
"no bro you did 2 parts booooooo XD
love you"
"Don't know who this person is, but they seem nice. Always happy to see colabs :D"
It was great! Best collab
One of my favourite tropes is Linus getting angry at bad paint jobs.
The energy between the two is epic. Wish I could meet them but I gotta say this is an awesome video.
no white motherboard??
Yall have no idea how high I‚Äôm rn and I‚Äôm still gonna write this comment. Cn yall feel that world turn too or is it just a high sensation side effect sorta thing?
I just know it's grippy
"being older than Linus, I personally love it when seeing him get ripped into about age.. makes me feel less vulnerable"
"Hey, old guy! <----Gratuitous ageism meme thingy....."
This was great
"‚ÄúI have lots of friends, I just pay them‚Äù gets tons of respects"
What is that sound bar with the mount called?
who?
Kris is horribly unfunny I can't believe how popular she is
Krinus
Wil floatplane ever be a downloaded app like for TV
So part 2 technically isn't on floatplane a 6 hour full video is on their 6 hours how am I suppose watch that lol
"Drops the maybe the fifth thing that day (including the i9 twice) . . . 
""I did that on purpose"" 
Sure Linus, we believe you."
Im from the uk... Who is she?
Is it me or there is some tension? üòõüòã
You can call her Kriss!
That was cringe.
"16:26 the face he made on the grey hair spot it, it's, it's, priceless"
"‚ÄúYou screw but do you drill‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you touch my peen‚Äù 

Are you kidding me Linus"
You at least pretend to deal very well with stress. I wish more people could deal with it like that. The video was really fun to watch! :)
"Never understood some of these, like let‚Äôs sponsor it for the type of person that could actually afford it. Never really made sense to me"
"No, don't melt down the gold controller! Auction it off for a charity like child's play! <3"
"jESUS, SO MUCH CAMELTOE..."
So THIS is what happened to his hair in the previously posted videos...
"Idea: move out of that country and come to a place you can actually make money doing the stuff you love

I‚Äôm sure Canada is great in its ways but not to be political, but that‚Äôs the main issue up there is it‚Äôs a socialist dictatorship"
I like both of you guys
I wonder if the drilling near the electrical panel was cut to avoid comments about safety and risk of hitting an electrical line...
I would like to see Kris as a guest host on some LTT videos ngl
When are you going to use your pool to cool your computer server whatever
22:41 okay that‚Äôs a sick burn üî•üòÇü§£
shes kinda cute
Been waiting ages for this to drop.
@18:10 just another reason to despise tiktok. That platform should have been banned years ago.
"Now that they're pushing Floatplane a lot more now... I was signed up a while back and then realized that they didn't have 4K at all as an option for videos. Is that still the case or can I watch videos in 4K on Floatplane? If so, how's the bitrate compared to YouTube's 4K?"
Stop lying about the screwdriver coming out soon
‚ÄúI have a lot of friends I just pay them‚Äù -Linus
they legit went thru every stage of friendship in a day
Linus asking if she gets the hammer reference while she is wearing a purple rain shirt. Is peak observation.
That knuckle crack was aggressiveüòÇ
"Fun fact: me as a tiktok creator, makes 1-2 cents per 1000 views (on a video)"
"Holy shit this was fucking hilarious - and now TWO PARTS ü§£ 
That build is looking sweet though gheezus. I might have to steal some ideas here."
"oh my god guys he actually got his hair done by her, and he looks fantastic"
loved this!
Why did he say 3080ti was the best  why because of 4000 series that prolly won't come out for awhile
Closing those stupid network covers is always a limited application of percussive maintenance
I like this. Linus doing the tech equivalent of pimp my ride for creators. It‚Äôs Fresh content like this that keeps the money rolling it. Good on ya!
"You guys kilt it, would love to see you guys host some more LTT videos soon"
was this the first time you guys met? i live in toronto i would love to meet linus
"Linus leaving on the tv peels is only mildly, infuriating"
Next cut.... 3 exhaust fans at the top.
I'll always try to be here for you with anything
it seriously looked like they had fun during this shoot
FINALLY
"14:35 You know what they say; Everything's a Dildo if you're brave enough.
HIlarious video. Kris is exactly my 'kind' of funny. Quick thinking and slightly rough. Love it. 
Nice dynamic too, maybe hire her? Not sure for what, but that's not important."
I was waiting ever since Kris mentioned you two are gonna do a collab tech upgrade üòÑ so worth it
FINALLY!!!! JESUS IT'S BEEN MONTHS!!!
What speakers are that.  The white ones
is she taller than linus
And the ritch gets richer. Yay.
"They were talking about this video on a WAN SHOW like two months ago, and when I finally get to see it it's short and cut in half?! 
I bet, the other half will be just hair trimming! :D"
Looks like Kris hired the people that painted Linus's house
"Never heard of her. Anyone else?

Cool video :)"
That gray hair tells me that Linus is turning from that prepube that finally grew a beard into a tech daddy
Linus totally crushing on kris
the perfect duo man jajajaja the complement each other's ADHD XD
I need a podcast with these two
NeEd MoRe MeLaNiN!
Awesome episode!
Awesome they are neighbors in the same blurry neighborhood üëå
"5:58 Did she just do the Philadelphia Collins ""bam"" hand movement"
this I one of the best crossovers I've seen in a long time would be fun to have Kris guest in future
"Me looking at the video chapters. Sees ""Linus gets a nailgun"". Oh Shi-"
"""it's hammer time! Idk if u get that referance"" said Linus to Kris WHILE SHE'S WEARING A 'PURPLE RAIN' T-SHIRT! *facepalm*"
Welcome back to Linus Drops Shit
Who is this?
"Linus looks 25, its insane to hear people make old jokes at him"
The tubes on the bottom look so bad but everything else looks great.
"Linus: You know what I think people should do on their honeymoon 

Linus sounding kinda sus"
Love that Purple Rain Tshirt <3
"Thoroughly enjoyed this video. Great chemistry, can't wait for part 2!"
It wouldn't be a Linus Tech Tips video without him dropping a CPU or GPU on the ground üòÇüòÇ. Much love you guys love the content.
omg shes so lovely
linus is too exited!! I've never seen him this even with the Threadripper CPU!!
Now i know what happens when 2 people with short attention spans meet each other üòÇüòÇ
Oh my God she literally used to make my week on tiktok she is so entertaining
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry
Linus Flirt Tips
"I know fewer and fewer YTers are doing Collabs these days, but I always love them. Especially when the collab is with a creator who does things differently, it feels like it expands the universe within the channel."
Linus is really creator tech support huh
"The thing with plaster is that when it's sanded, it's smoother than the drywall finish  but it still shouldn't be noticable"
"""I have lots of friends, i just pay them"" Michael Scott energy lmao"
Wow it only took 3 months for this video to be released wth happened
kris is actually tall
This video proves why I always tell all my female friends to have a guy with them when dealing with contractors. They will 100% take advantage of your lack of construction knowledge. Same with car mechanics.
@Miria Jiyuu good point. And point taken. Did not mean to offend
Knowledge matters more. Plenty of guys get taken for a ride and have no idea
This is so dope üòÇü§ôüèΩ
"I love how Linus does setups for ""famous"" people who are way less famous than he is."
Bro Kris is taller than Linus.
All the flirting is going to make Jake jealous
Collaboration we've been waiting for!
"When Nerds try carpentry,,,,, still a fun episode tho lol"
Next video: Kallmekris joins Linus Media Group...
Poor Kris
"You know, I think by this point, if it's not LTT staff you should really give back to the community instead of giving it to people who already have a lot, there's people that follow you that a computer would really make a difference, while most of these videos are fun, it doesn't seem like for people who already bought houses or spent 10k on magic the gathering card game a tech makeover would make a difference. I still love the videos, just sharing my thoughts."
@Toasty you are right
"pretty sure he had a whole series about that a while back, also pretty sure it's not up to him, and that intel picks who, plus he's already promised his employees tech upgrades, and he has to get through that first, so i don't see him going back to giving thousands to his fans for a while"
"Linus: drops CPU
Other guy: *starts crying*"
I have that case! Dope!
"wait, a peen?!?!"
What was the soundbar model that Linus said so highly of?
Two mad was more chaotic
In this video: f*ckin' eggshell 2 and a heavy helping of Linus Drop Tips
"Linus likes to act like he's old as dirt but he literally had my childhood with tech and media and I was only born in 1993, I just lived in a town where tech was always behind and surrounded by boomers and their media. I literally grew up in the age where people were still getting free dial up from those AOL CD's."
i want that damn screwdriver lmao
Nice....she's pretty.
HUH I DID NOT EXPECT THIS
"So we got someone who is good at falling and the number one champion of dropping things, what could possibly go wrong."
this was wonderfully chaotic!
This is what happens when 2 Adhders. Try to get something done.
This is by far my favorite collab on LTT so far. Linus and Kris' personalities compliment each other's so well. I'm actually surprised its only 6 hours and not like 15
"@Marco Belitz Rude? Not at all - this is exactly how I feel about her in this very video. Why lie? She seems annoying, that's it. Is she in person? No idea :) I don't know her. She might be the opposite - like, ekhm - quiet, not blond and an intellectual titan! But if anything, she's 1000 times nicer and bearable than iJustine - that girl is just straight up unbearable."
"@Call_Me_Stan Glad you don't, with your rude comment. Not annoying at all."
@MonoLegion I don't know - she seems extremely annoying.
Right? They have big brother - little sister energy
"@vitti2801  She Also has a reaction videos, she has a personality that just makes you smile."
Dam that long
when are you going to open an online E- retail store so I can buy an MB and a GPU from you?
"""These fans are super cool"" ....... ba dum tssssh!"
"Next step shes working full time at LMG as a contractor on a deal where she gets 50% off all money from her videos ;)

what TikTok pays is absolutely shocking"
Good video but nothing will rival the hilariousness ( and the confusion on Linus's face) as the twomad video
"Gonna be honest, initially read it as ‚Äúkal-mech-ris‚Äù"
"WOW, I thought that TikTok is bad, but them not paying anything to their creators is straight up moronic."
Half the comments mention the chemistry in this video.... Should Yvonne be worried here?  ü§î
Kallmekris is a bloody delight!
Linus damn near gave me a heart attack with the fake dropping of the motherboard!! HOLY SHIET
POV: linus experiences true level vs eye level lol
Woooo! Yeaaah! Age-ism!
13:41 that is not level
Exactly lol that‚Äôs like 5¬∞ off
eThots are evolving
"I love how sexually ambiguous Linus is around women, it makes sense of the piercings and cross-dressing.

We love you too, Lianus."
Your employees are so freaking lucky. This is amazing.
üé∂He's got the Linus touch!!üé∂
"""I see a grey hair coming in"" linus's face changed INSTANTLY."
Where is part 2 on floatplane?
"""I have lots of friends, i just pay them"" 
üòñ"
You know you are fighting for my time between this and short circuit? Cause im watching yy before going to sleep. No negative but this time short circut wins.
Linus is the father figure who walks around your new house and points out all the flaws lmao
"It's not the painters that fk'd up Linus, it was the mudders."
how much does it cost to have Linus make a video in your house to setup new tech in a house?üòÇ
What about that gold controller getting melted?! One of those ‚Äúgenius‚Äù ideas
"Giant Linus doesn't exist.

Meanwhile, giant Linus: 9:01"
Anyone know what pc case they using?
I need a kallmekris hair cut
im next for the tech upgrade???? wink wink
"It wouldn‚Äôt be an LTT construction video without Linus freaking out about poor paint and construction quality

Edit: and it would be literally any LTT video without Linus dropping really fancy and expensive tech"
i say it alot but i like seeing different Ytbers i follow from different genres colab. even though it seems like several of them have actually been linus building a pc with/for them.
"1:58 linus sex tips ""she screws but does she drill"""
Linus made videos on YouTube when they couldn't handle more than 480p and gets upset when you say he's old
"Linus she's wearing a Purple Rain Shirt she better get the ""It's Hammer Time"" reference lol"
Just don't ask her to read ..LOL
"How can you afford to own a house, and have this sort of presence, and not make any money??"
A collab I never knew I needed....
linus put her in more videos wow.
I‚Äôve never seen you happier Linus
The sonos is broken on the end
"Man I love this. Just wish it was a series rather than one video... :(

Shame it was so rushed because it looked like they were having fun and it was fun to watch it."
because youre funny to laugh at linus!
Kris keeps doing all these super cool and unexpected collabs and I'm here for them. This duo is incredibly fun to watch
Never in a million years would I have dreamed up this collab.
Is it really a Linus build if he hasn't dropped at least 1 expensive part?
"Ok, living in a 3rd world country in the middle of Eu-rope - this is the first time I heard about Kris (KalmeKris) but I really love her voice and the energy, she looks such a positive person/human being.
And this makes the video so much better! üëçüèª‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
Also, now I'm torn between this one and Maddison' one being my top LTT video.
üòéüòâüòÅ"
"So, Linus. Is the streaming room a bit lower towards the window or are you slightly shorter than Kris?"
How cool is this?!? I freaking love Kris. She‚Äôs amazing and her page is awesome.
"_""You put the 'Kris' in my Christmas""_ - Linus S, 2022. Well Linus, it's good that you have 9 lives. Lmao xD But there was so much awkwardness in this video though, especially that bit about the motherboard installation and elbow tap hahaha oh Linus.. it's joyful to be smitten for sure."
@Noor Ahmed Entertaining? Damn right!
@Nura Galadanchi isn't it? Was entertaining though
You do have a point
"""You put the Kris in my christmas.' Calm down there Linus lmao"
My wife would kill me idk how Linus isn't dead......
please can we see more of Kris/ kallmekris?/
Finally this one comes out.
This video was sponsored by aSUS
"Wow, no one has commented on the jeans being pulled up too high, and the obvious consequence..."
What's with all the random sponsoring of absolute nobodies?
"ASUS aren't sponsoring her, they are sponosring Linus's video also she has 6.7 million subs?"
I love this woman.  Meeting her through Linus is amazing.
@Tygo Bermind Do I have to mine my own simpcoins? How does this work?
get ready to donate your simpcoins.
Nice
"I swear Linus, its like you're watching my youtube history :) I been mainlining LTT and KallmeKris for the last week or two... and BOOM. :)"
She's Canadian? Well I have to subscribe now.
"omg finally, been waiting for this collab"
She reminds me of Dee Williams
"I have no idea who she is, but, i like her a lot, seems fun !"
What case is it?
I could use an ultimate tech upgrade
"Such a great collab, the banter and energy was phenomenal"
That guy looks like Ravs from the Yogscast lmao.
this is such a good collab üòÇ
Disappointed Riley didn‚Äôt come in and asked what was happening
I dropped over 5k just on my pc alone lol
"watching Lines being bullied is a lot more fun, since he takes it lightly"
Who is this person?
This is chaotic good and I love it
Oof that soundbar mount
Who is this Kris chick and what does she do? Or did they just find some random chick on the streets of Canada and be like hey lets do a tech upgrade for you
studs in new houses are always 16 inches apart from the center of each stud
NIIIIICE
Wasnt this filmed like a month or two ago?
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them"""
even did the classic tiktok two parts
Damn she is beeeeeeautful
dayum linus. i bet the sexual tension between you and her could be felt by your wife's spidey senses. you made it way to obvious in the video that you guys were flirting. your boys (alex i think his name is?) facial expression said it all when the camera panned to him during the video. i know i rip on a lot of youtubers (you guys included) but you got some social skills when it comes to women. which is a rare thing in the computer world lol. i have never before seen you light up like that when talking to a women in any of your videos. your penis was clearly doing all the talking.
omg its so canadian
"4:35 ""I've assandaled"" wondering where she's got that idea from huh"
Yep could have happily sat here for an hour watching this. Can't wait for part two!
I still like horizontal GPU mounting. Oldskool!
She's cute and soooo relatable XD
what a wife oof
yayyy :D Kris is iconic :D
This video explains why Linua has a team.. What a mess.( you need a LPS person to manage your efforts )
I thought you weren't supposed to cover in-wall wiring cabinets:o
"üëè those cheeks 4 sure
Hahahaha"
W
This has been amazing. Thank you so much for the video. I was literally laughing tears the whole time
Leaning into that the panels weren¬¥t even is the right call. Just a little off would look like a mistake but a step down is deliberate.
We stan a short king that knows his way around home reno
Now I understand the Linus's new look in the 'I'm a Genius' video. Once he gets used to the style and finds the right hold product for the front its gonna look great.
Who is this? I feel like you need to into these nobodies.
"That is so fucking funny that the diva of all divas just ended up complimenting their new screwdriver without knowing it was theirs

The look in Linus‚Äôs eye as they are talking about it üòÇ"
I'm laughing so much because I had 4 wall mounted monitors is my Livingroom and kept moving them. THERE WAS SO MUCH SPACKLE WHEN I REPAINTED
This is epic
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
mommy and daddy :)
Which GPU vertical mount is that?
Banter reminds me of your build with Madison
"Don't drill above light switches/power points, because the wires usually go straight up."
Bruh I was waiting for this
i need an upgrade! when can a normal person get an Upgrade like this?!
"This is what happens when 2 adhders get together ü§£ the wall, the gray hair, it‚Äôs hilarious, this is like my third comment on this video I love it !!!!!"
From their short convo on TikTok alone I can already tell you I want her WAN'd up at some point. She complements the LTT vibe exceptionally well!
Linus paint tips
ROGRR 2022 and 3/4
My god the chemistry between kris and Linus yevonne might want to keep an eye on Linus lol
cool. i found kris for a few days ago. :-)
The sexual tension in this video is palpable
Intel 5k tech upgrade asus edition lmao
17:05 OF COURSE LINUS HAD TO DROP A CPU
Finailly yes thank you for this gem of a video
Yeah
"2:13 lowis hamilton exactly after Linus said that it's hammer time, be like: hi man, what the he'll is going on!? Why an I speeding up uncontrollably like this!?"
"DA-VID, DA-VID, DA-VID!"
I love this !!!
"This is one of the most hilarious episodes ever Linus and Kris, can they collab again."
This is no longer Linus Tech Tips this is Linus Drop Things
the collab I never knew I needed
16:26 linus gonna shit his pants lol cant believe a gray hair defeated him
Linus giving callmekriss YouTuber advice as if she isn't getting more views on YouTube then him is hilarious
linus runs a whole entire company that operates multiple YouTube channels
"Love Kris, what a super cool collab!"
vertical gpu is weird lol
Those in-wall network cabinets are a pain to install by yourself trying to hold it up and level and then it's smaller than the width of the studs so you end up with multiple problems
"they have just such a fantstic dynamic, the two hyperactive friends, that love hanging out together but never get anything done, because they distract each other constantly"
"2:13 lowis hamilton speeding up uncontrollably at the second because Linus said that it's hammer time, be like: hi man, what the he'll is going on!?"
Thanks ASUS for sponsoring these shenanigans. Me and my 10 year old ASUS MB send our Love ü§£
How is she soo tiny and yet taller than Linus
Wait does this count as a tech makeover? Cuz he didn't check if she had anything stolen from the office
"""she screws, but does she drill?"" ... that's a creative way to ask about pegging..."
like her content a surprising but welcome video
Who? Is she a controversial online personality? We all know Linus‚Äô strict collaboration standards.
Sheesh took this video forever to come out huh?
"Well played linus, Nice shot on the honeymoon"
"Immaculate energy, fantastic video, amazing tech! More, please!"
Omg fucking finally‚Ä¶
"My god Canada produces heavy stuff, never disappoints"
"i didn't know who kallmekris was, but after watching this video i wanna check out her stuff. this was such a funny video can't wait for part 2"
Will the second part also come to YouTube? Or is it a floatplane exclusive.
What's truly atrocious is those jeans on that girl
"@G.Fox I would say the exact same thing if you said ""on that man. I dont think you know what a whiteknight is. 


I am aware im a nobody, but atleast i dont act like im not"
u a weird fella
"@chrikke She will marry you, mr white knight."
@chrikke Thanks nobody
"I actually heard from someone she threw them out, because some nobody on the internet doesnt like them. But idk"
"Uh how does one go about becoming a client ?
Just wondering"
Asus are the best
"It's pronounced ""Tie"" Linus.  Jeesh...."
üòÇü§£üòÖ
Exposed alabster skin...me drooling
the paint job is bad but all that is on the finishers for not doing what they should
"Not gonna lie. Very fun video. So much ""having fun together"", but a bit too much? 
I need to resub to Floatplane and watch the whole thing.
The only question is - will Linus be in trouble with Yvone after this video?
Spoiler - probably not :D"
"I discovered her content about a year ago. This is exactly what I expected from a collaboration with LTT.  Love you both, thanks for the fun vid."
Downvoting only because of Linus's soy comment on twitter.
They didnt even miter the corners for the RGB trim
"I wish I could be hot, famous and rich......... Like Linus."
Loved the energy. I would have loved to help a friend kit out his place like this. We would make a long weekend out of it...lan party included üòÇüëç
This lady is fantastic.
"Holy mom jeans, she looks like a young Christina P

I like that"
Linus slept on the couch for 2 weeks after this.
"‚ÄúThat‚Äôs as level as it gets‚Äù literally 1/4 inch out in 2 feet, the shelf has 1% of flow on itüòÇ"
"Linus and that Goth Chick, could be a cool funny couple, you know."
"been waiting 2-3 months for ltt to upload this! wew

i didn't have any idea how long you guys do these videos üòÖ"
Yup my notification creator together is all I need. Asus is making Intel's sweating over here.
Who tf is this
"Best cross-over we didn't know we needed,"
Love those chainable Lian-Li fans!
She's so fucking cute
That is an *impressive* commitment to wearing a t-shirt wrong.
16:44 now that's some old shool ltt vibes from back in the days
Weird ass collab üò≠
Omg she is adorable.
One of the funniest yet. I can hardly wait for part two
who else wants to see that haircut vid? :D
big adhd engery in this video lol
Giving a computer to an already wealthy online personality is just VAPID garbage. Linus is on his way out. I'm calling it now - 2025 - linus is done.
the point of this video is to film the process and make more money from it. would you rather they just give her the computer and dont mention it and just spend money with no return?
WHO
SOMEONE WHEN U SICK OF ASIAN
Clever & cute putting part two on Floatplane first. I'm curious how many new users will be able to sign up.
The mullet looks great.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Who is this?
"Got unlucky and was shown a couple of her youtube shorts last night and it was some of the most facebook normie ""comedy"" possible, but faceobok normies are a big audience so good for her"
The large variety of powertool brands bothers me deeply
7:34 I feel like I've seen this 2 times before. But that's what Deja Vu does
Awesome lady
the tv appears ... not level.
"bye bye intel extreme, they wont be happy about this."
"Your wall looks like swiss cheese. Yea I know, it‚Äôs LTT aproved, Linus was here‚Ä¶"
1:58 Little uncalled for.
She is a Fresh Breath of Air üòÑ
I would love to see this done again but with Proton Jon!
"In the defense of whoever mounted the networking box. Its likely mounted directly to a stud, which means the stud is that far off of level.

He could have used shims or spacers or something, but then there is a higher chance of the box coming loose over time.

Just a thought though."
Do i Need to know her
Nice
a $70 screwdriver?! I never thought I would consider getting a screwdriver that expensive but I kinda want one.
That's not leveled
I dont get the whole point of going over the top with sound panels.. I think streamers are a bit misunderstanding like they go overly crazy with it and nobody notices unless they mention it.
"Linus ""She screws but does she drills"" Tech Tips FTW"
"Man i wish an interior finished job was as fun as these guys. In any other job it mainly consists of the boss yelling at us, or lots of f#%'s and Damit's."
high quality video thank
The peen is also used for drywall finishing.
"""My most chaotic client! So chaotic!""

Kallmekris: acts mostly normal.

Linus: ""Let's drill seven holes in your wall when you only need two or three, constantly get off task with random shit, and here, it wouldn't be a Linus video if I didn't drop half your expensive ass brand new PC"""
"Linus is so funny! Goes to the US, is handed a nail gun, immediately goes American with it. üòÇ"
"""I have lots of friends I just pay them "" just linus things"
great duo !
This is a crossover I did not expected.
"Okay I know it's been a running joke for almost 2 years now. But seriously when is the screwdriver coming? Is there an estimate at all? I moved in February and bought new tools and almost bought the snap-on one Linus used to use but said to myself ""the LTT one should be out soon"" I need a screwdriver Linus. I'm tired of using this harbor freight one from like 10 years ago that is literally held together with electrical tape. 


I'm just kidding I know you guys want it to be perfect so I get it. But I do really hope it's actually coming soon and not another 2 years........."
.
Hey Linus team! Have any of you heard of Tiny10? It is a lightweight version of Windows 10. I was wondering if anyone could make a video on it. Thanks.
FINALLY!!! Waiting so long for this!!
"Holy crap this was a absolute train wreck in a good way lol, also good way to say there is a second part linus"
I didn't think it would actually be so chaotic... Also poor Kris üò≠üò≠ the jank level is off the charts.. nothing looks in place and in themeüò≠
it took forever to get this one out and then you go and break it up into two parts
We really need Linus Paint Tips.
Linus: ‚Äú I have lots of friends‚Ä¶ I just pay them‚Äù has got to be peak self-aware Linus üòÇ (LTT is one of the few businesses I would actually believe the ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a family‚Äù thing)
"@SzG Kizmo that one of the main problems linus mention he had is that he treat his employees really amazing. even if only half of what he says are true it still extremely better than almost any other company. but because of the great benefit and fun environment people think it easy when in reality it actually extremely hard working environment. Luke even mention this on wan show how normal companies kinda let IT people do whatever they want even google, They know how long something really takes so you cant BS your way into taking 8 hours for 2 hours job like they do in most IT position"
"Linus' ""Best Colleagues""."
"Given that his stated metric for his success as an employer is that every non-probationary member of staff be able to buy their own home... yeah, I can buy the whole 'family' thing. As a person who was fired for bleeding on a new carpet tile during a medical emergency and who walked out of another job when a boss tried to pay my 25 hours of overtime with 30kg of bad beansprouts, finding a boss who understands responsibility to their workers is rare as hen's teeth and would qualify as a friend in my book."
@ionen you also get to fire colton
@Noy Telin√∫ its a gift and a curse
She did a really good job unboxing! She didn't drop a single thing‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è üòÇüôàüôàüòÇ
It's definitely NOT a Linus video without him dropping random things over the course of 6 hours üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Just take your time and build it . This build looks chaotic and rushed. Dropping things here and there,"
Take a trip to Florida and do my house please
You joke about building furniture for the honeymooners but my wife and I literally did that a few months ago üòÇ
"Was waiting for this for soo long, you announced this video last year."
"I don't really know who Kris is, but it was a fun video nevertheless."
omg do 39daph next!
"So much chaos, but it made me happy :D"
lmfao thos stud finder are a joke acording to that i got a stud in my pants lmfao no joke u be drilling 20 hols befor that tells u ware the stud really is
This mf thought she was to young for a hammer time reference while she's wearing a purple rain shirt
Why do you look like you broke in to her house and started building a gaming setup
"Men of culture, we met again."
"16:44 Funny how he says ""ZEE"" naturally when he isn't paying attention.. Proof that  ""Zed"" is wrong and he says it just to sound more Canadian."
"Oh boy, I watch both of yous, this should get interesting ;) :D . In a good way, I swear :)"
Finally! This is exactly what I have been waiting for
YAAAY finally the KMK collab and we getting two parts. Love it! Video on Kris' channel for the haircut when?
llinus should build the pc with baby small hands lol
I kinda hoped to see both the Rileys (Rilies?) in this
No Canada fund!!!!!! We love you Kriss
So Asus when you gonna pay for my new setup?
fun stuff.ü•≥
Who is this Kallmekris person? I have never heard of the person...
Finally! Let's go!
"Linus discovering wall pops in new builds. Give it a year, then fix them."
"Reminder to self: if I ever become famous enough to get a tech makeover from Linus, make sure my walls are in top shape."
Who is this person? She's kind of crazy. Kind of zany.
"Z690 Pro Art talking Points:
2x Thunderbolt 4 and 10G AQtion and 2.5G Intel LAN???
And for a relatively cheap price!"
evon wants to melt down the gold x box controler ??? somebody just dose not like that one as it is or what
i think this same concept with northernlion would be so hilarious
10:33 masked_crying_wojak.tiff
"How does Asus only have 6 USB A ports on their creator motherboard?

Anyway great vid and really like the energy of Kris"
no Effing idea who that is.
"It's like a pc biuld with 1,00,000$"
"This is the colab we didn‚Äôt know we neededüòÇ
Please have more people like did"
Best collab
It‚Äôs much better to do things your self than to ask for Lamus‚Äôs help
"Is that ""desk"" just a sheet of construction plywood? I can't say I don't enjoy the contrast."
I guess mom pants are back in style.
Linus is definitely buying his friends
you could mistake them for siblings
I absolutely ADORE Kris so much!
Linus' face when talking about the sound dispersion spiral is hilarious.
"This guy drops everything, doesn't he I thought it was a bit. I guess not."
"When the vided started I thought, 24mins isn't long enough for this awesome collab,  ""To Be Continued"" made up for that real quick!! lol"
FINALLY they tell us in the video how large the water bottles are in liters! :)
She is top cute i cant
Too*
notice how linus always wears a beanie after dennis cut his hair
"Yeah, great video, let's all thank ASUS for sponsoring a youtuber with 7mil subscribers, brings me so much joy watching crap like this again. No schools in poor districs left needing a pc or two? They're all good? ok"
"ASUS giving PC's to a poor school district is charity
ASUS giving and sponsoring LTT is business because they get promotion in return and an assurance their products will be used."
This was really entertaining! :D
"In comparison with Kris, Linus is so short‚Ä¶"
Going to laugh when that crown molding expands on a hot day. Oof
Fun fact: they're both an ENTP.
yet they put the aio pump on the bottom... fail
"""Why do people in the comments like seeing me taken down a notch so much"" IDK linus, do you remember how mean comments were on your early videos, your fare an interesting bunch"
2:55 guessing Kris is on the influencer special run list now?
"14:06 - 14:13
""say hello to my little friend"""
HOW MANY MONTHS WAS IT??!!
"The one and only who?

Also, why is Linus' house blurred everywhere, but hers isn't?"
Call me cris is like every russian wen someone is talking or filming thay gest stand in the dor way  and don't do enithing
Imagine having your entire house made out of cartboard and so you need a tool to see where there are wooden planks to drill into...
Next level cringe.
These videos ain't good man I don't like it
‚Ä¶ and no one was surprised AT ALL. Love ya Kris and Linus
Great duo! Wow!!
"13:43 My dad wouldn't call this level, lol."
"This had me ROLLING I was laughing so hard. I've been a fan both of you separately for quite some time and seeing you finally come together for a collaboration... It was everything I thought it'd be and more ü§£ü§£ü§£
Much love to you all to include the team behind the scenes and I can't wait for part two üòéüî•üî•"
"Kris has such a nice vibe, i hope she collaborates more with LTT 'cause this video was extraordinary and super funny."
"@Jyv Ben the paint rant was golden, I was uncontrollably laughing for most of the way trough."
"next time, paint job ... have you seen Linus paint rant"
"OK, I did not click on this video because of her. I love watching this kind of videos, but one thing I‚Äôm gonna say with all respect, but she‚Äôs really beautiful"
"22:35 YUUUUPP, Great joke !!"
This was the perfect collab. Awesome üòé
"Aside from the mashup of winning personalities that is 10/10 content, Linus took the cake with: ""That's the thing about good plans, it's what you should've done in the first place"""
"So we get part one for free on YouTube, but have to be a paying sub on floatplane to see the rest? Gotcha‚Ä¶"
"Only Linus can drop a fucking CPU flagship and say it's okay, because he ""caught it with his foot"" as he says."
"ME LUV KRIS, but you can KAWLMEKRIS... Do the haircut thing. That would be AWSOME... Damn, I sound like an indian bot. Just for the records: I might be not. BUT I LUV KALLMEKRIS."
!!! Guys mark my words he will come to eu and make em all his customers so ppls like me wont have money anymore from freelancing !!!!
"I love Kris, she's so amazing *-*"
"So basically linux bought himself freands instead of earning them.

Smart, also sad."
Please tell me the Linus haircut is a video!!!???!!!
i have been waiting a long time for you to post this after the channel post you made a while ago
"Looking at the bubble not in the middle. ""That's as level as it gets"" üòÇ"
Linus flirts with the pretty blond wife melts his gold control pad..................
Where is the other part?üó°Ô∏è
She screws but does she drill ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Awesome...off  to floatplane to watch the rest :)
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•...
holy frick please call out the contractor
ADHD: the video
Linus x kris
"13:05 this is what having ADHD looks like.
""I only have 6 hours to do this tech upgrade, so OH SHIT LOOK AT THIS DISTRACTION!!""
edit: 16:25 she knows."
i love this collab
Linus... You are married... but I love the chemistry lol
how do they literally have the same energy like exactly
Something to admire about LTT if you don't like a video its not a long wait till next one. (This isn't my cup of tea not worth a dislike as I know its personal preference not anything wrong with video itself just not into the Celeb build vids)
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
"Oh hey, I've starting binging all of her stuff on youtube"
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
"Man the pixelating , that editor deserves a raise"
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
theyre like best friends
The crossover I never knew I needed
"I think the fuse box was probably level, but the board was sawed absolutely crooked."
Do NOT let Linus's wife watch this
linus paint tips strikes again
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
"Putting my request in now, if you melt down the golden controller then team up with a smelter like bigstackD and make an event out of it. Might as well earn another buck off of it"
Maybe Linus should invite KallmeKris to join Floatplane!
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
And where without dropping something expensive üòÇ perfect
Who is Kallmekris and why is she known?
Tiktok
"linus tech tip, studs should be 16'' on center something something thanks asus segue your welcome.. i only measure in freedom units btw sorry."
never clicked a video so fast. Im a huge fan of you both!
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
if i was linus's wife id be soo jealous
"Somehow I'm getting oddly similar chaotic vibes from both Kris and Linus, I didn't know I needed this collab!"
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
Why not an updesk? Those are so much better in so many ways
21:33 what is the box? If its good i need to know.üôèüôèüôè
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
I love when Linus gets to collaborate with other cool creators like Kallmekris! This is the kind of collaboration I love to see!
"yeah i was like, i must be too old, I have no idea who this person is. I assumed she was a twitch streamer."
@Prince Vegeta lauren southern
"@Joshua Howard funny story, found her on youtube stories not ticktok"
@Prince Vegeta Yeah I was wondering the same thing haha. Got no idea who she is.
Is that a tiktoker?
Ye
This was so fun to watch. The chemistry was so good I was smiling the whole video. Favorite part was probably when Linus went AWOL on the paint job. This is one of those top tier 110% videos.
Someone should make a (linus making fun of callmekrisses house for 5 minutes straight)video
She's fine
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•.
And then he shoot a nail through the ceiling
THE FABLED VIDEO HAS DROPPED
Now we need a collab between a handyman channel and linus lol
Super fun! She seems so sweet and what a great setup you got!
then jeans should be illigal
The youngest will surely enjoy the upgrades
You bastards. How dare you split into two parts.
linus your married dawg üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
@DOOM SLAYER HELLWALKER dude was doing more than ive ever seen in these types of vids ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
It‚Äôs something called humor
they are such a good duo
Does Youtube get part 2 at all or only floatplane?
Must be hard for her doing a video without that face tune filter she usually uses lol
I knew the chemistry between these 2 would be great and I‚Äôm not disappointed
I KNOE HER
I‚Äôm not familiar with this creator but I can see why she is very popular. Seems very genuine
Given Kris has had this room featured in her videos for like 3 months shows how much long editing must take on these longer shoots haha
"Never heard of her before, but she is great and now has a fan especially for the Prince shirt"
17:28 the good ol PCI-E Express
That case looks cool. Is it the 0-11 Dynamic?
"Well, I can‚Äôt do it better than Linus üôÉ"
This video is amazing!
I love the synergy between them! Wish they didn't have to rush the build so much!
Linus the stud-finder...I like that üòÇ
Love her energy xd
i won't even look at the comments AT ALL
I've been waiting for this ever since it was mentioned on WAN show a couple of months ago
Linus is the type of guy who would install a light switch but when turning on the light the kitchen faucet would open.
Finally... Best daughter/dad video ..
Why Linus installed AIO upside down? Won't it degrade after time?
22:30 üéâü•≥üò¨
It's a love hate relationship Linus XD
Its clearly not level!
The collab I didn't know we needed
Call me Kris seems fun.
This is cool and all but giving already rich people more free shit is kinda of annoying.
the collab we didn't ask for. but the collab we needed
"As much as I love this video, I love Kris's shirt even more, such a great choice! Also a great choice on the Mackie monitors, I've got a pair and they rock!"
Will part 2 come to your youtube? Or only behind the floatplane paywall?
"Is the part 2 only going to be on floatplane, or is it a timed exclusive?"
I want to see more of Linus criticism of other people's home constructions and bad paint jobs. It's amazing how invested Linus gets with that stuff!
I can't believe Yvonne is still ignorant to the fact the controller is worth MORE built than it is as the raw material.
is she really this well empty or is she just acting like she knows almost nothing
I know your pain Linus got a sis just like her
Asus is the best. Love it.
brooo she is the best
Is it jst me or they both look like the sameüòÖüòÇüòÇüòÇ
FINALLY it only took 2 months
All the US folks rush off to Google (myself included) to look up who she is ;)
He is like at least my contractor wasn't that bad fuck.
More chaotic than twomad?! Hmmmm
Linus Renovation Tips
who's her?
what do u have in ur pocket
Ahh when mounting the acoustic panels and they open the door on the wall and we see cables going straight up where they are screwing üò¨üò¨
They painted it 4x bc they didn't even bother to prime the walls.
linus‚Äôs wife after seeing the jokes be like : üò†
title makes it sound like all the chaotic energy is coming from kris :D
"Linus, please give me your steam account."
Does she pay for Linus to do this or what? Cause I have no idea why her channel has viewers at all.
She has 66.6M subs now.
whats the device that shes using at 3:03? does anyone know please?
@Ding Ding The Youtube Buddy That¬¥s very cool. Thanks! I actually live in South America and we rarely use drywall here.
"@Erick C√©sar if you don't have one and live in North America just go to your corner and measure either 12 or 16 inches from the wall, then knock on the wall. If it sounds hollow do the opposite measurements(if you measured 12 and its hollow measure 16 and repeat). Alternatively you can just guess by knocking on the wall until it no long sounds hollow to give a rough estimate of where the stud is."
@Project X (new) thanks. its not so popular where i live.
It's a stud finder
Just make her a server already üò≠üò≠
i thought she was familiar. my lil sister loves her videos cause it reminds her of how her childhood was as the youngest
imagine company simping you
"Ooh the blurring at 13:00 is really cool, never seen anything like it."
16:35  And here i realized Linus doing a speed build will cause system crashing for the next month.
Kris is an absolute beauty.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"If you work with other creators, maybe throw a link to their channel or twitter or something in the video description.  sure you show her channel name right at the beginning of the video, but now I have to type it in the search bar to find it. seriously what year is this?

other than that, fun video"
14:16 thank me later
The rich get richer SMH
The CHAOS in this video is amazin
great video look forward to more like this.
Where to get the sound damper thing from
When chaos meets chaos... Let the mayhem begin...
Also how did this not become a total Canadian colab and you have Joel come in for the audio?
Love this!  This is like the Marvel Universe of YouTube with these crossovers.  All these YouTube Universe superpowers coming together for the greater good!  YouTube Avengers Assemble!!  Um....yeah... I know ....ugh....
She's way to amused to see Linus drill holes willy nilly in her own home. I would've thrown Linus out the window. üòÇ
2 equally Chaotic People in the same place!
That was awesome
"Honestly been waiting for this forever, not just because Kris and Linus are awesome, but because Linus was so excited about working with her ever since he first brought it up. Can't wait for part 2!"
Btw this fn great...because is how people do this nor all pre planed and tested ...this is what happens when we the people try and do crap...probly my fave now
this is great!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
I think linus has a gf now lol
kallmekameltoe
"On one hand, he is wearing half sleeves and on other hand, he is wearing a benie(or whatever its called)"
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!! The collab I had been waiting for soooo long
LINUS I LOVE YOU MORE! THANKS FOR THIS COLAB!
"From my perspective this person went from suddenly showing up in my YT feed for the first time to being in an LTT video, in 3 days. Ah, Canadian. They all know each other up there, right? üòÇüòÖ"
"I have lots of friends, I just pay them."
"I bet the watch time on this video will be 25% over average, and all the people in that pool know what i mean."
This is maybe two hours worth of work‚Ä¶ If you take time not to break the boxes. And I‚Äôve never heard of this person. But from the way everyone is simping for her like she‚Äôs some sort of a only fans model sticking things inside of herself for money‚Ä¶ I assume she‚Äôs a streamer? Maybe
@Karma.! I just did the exact same thing after seeing the Tweet. lol
@Linus Tech Tips hard to find this but i had to yk
"I think it's possible for you to sound more ignorant than this, but it'd take a lot of work.... - LS"
"Yoo, what case is that? It looks so beautiful and sleek"
@mufid baloulli looks like a Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO
Might be a Lian Li since the fans are Lian Li?
Awww gawd why didn't I know her? She's so cute & beautiful. :O :O :O
"he's just got tired, awesome dude"
Where have you been hiding such a beautiful lady until now  ?  :)  Big.... huge LIKE !   :) Greetings from Split :) By the way - where is Madison?
Can't wait for part three where Linus will repaint the whole house and then destroy the bed
"You can add so much to the ‚ÄúDropping‚Äù videos, where linus drops stuff!"
Thought a Tuk had ear flaps that just a benie
"I have know idea how Yvonne is going to feel about the level of flirting and anxious tension from Linus lol. It's so clear he fancies Kris so much, he's down bad with it and he's subconsciously aware of that and trying desperately not to let that show through in his body language, even the way he brought her up back in the stream ages ago with Luke. It's understandable, Linus is like the male version of Kris and maybe I'm 100% wrong and this is totally disrespectful (It is a bit sorry) but yeah, he might like her and that's ok, just because people are in committed relationships doesn't mean they can't have crushes, we are all still human beings. But I hope Linus has an Intel sponsored comfortable sofa in that new house for a few nights Lmao"
Nah u right. It's obvious as fhuk
you're analyzing this way too deep to the point of being creepy... It's a youtube video dude. It's not that deep.
"Disliked just because this is a two part video but didn't have ""Part 1"" in video title, I would have waited to watch both instead. Y'know, so the content is still fresh in my head."
im in love
12:55 Linus dad mode activated
"""You put the Kris in my Christmas"". I'm dying üòÇ"
11:35 ‚Äúit‚Äôs level‚Äù‚Ä¶ that looks very much not level to me
I think it's half the diagonal the camera is at and I think David is holding the camera at a slight angle for some reason.
"Okay, when the second part comes out I'll just watch this one again like I do every time a new season comes out."
‚ÄúShe screws but does she drill‚Äù -Linus
I loooove this women shes beautiful and does great accents while also being funny. Hmm shes my unknown future wife.
you guys work so nicely together lol
lol I love KallmeKris so much because she is a chaotic sweetie!
hey Linus is that aio upsidedown?
"I REALLY hope he means 12 Gb of SSD, not 12 Tb   (@_@)"
bomboclatt
who?
Everybody knows Kallmekris is Tracy Lords after her adrenochrome treatment
I can't tell if Kris is a man or not
Frickin finally jeez
Me deciding to become a youtuber so i can have asus sponsor me and linus build it for me!!
Just paid for part 2 on floatplane and there is no part 2 on floatplane. :(
Damn kriss got some muscles üí™
"She's so great, I didn't know she was Canadian. Canada you have now gone up a notch in my book, that puts you at notch one."
GRILL
Its incredible how evey collaboration linus does is with some Huuuuge YouTuber that i somehow never heard before... shows how big youtube is and how shelter i am xD
Not even a little bit mad that this is a multi-parter. I could watch this collab all day!
Anyone know what the sound bar is? I‚Äôve been looking to cop one
"Kris was literally wearing a purple rain shirt and you asked if she knew ""Stop! Hammer time!"" I'm ashamed."
"'i have lots of friends, i just pay them' - linus tech tips 2022"
What sound bar is that?
Why has she got 24 UNUSED ethernet ports in her apartment?
"im pretty sure this took months, i saw that instagram post about the rennovation so long ago"
"This is sad. Kris says she has no friends, but Linus is the one acting like he's desperate for actual friends."
Thanks for splitting it. My face is already hurting from laughing. üòÇ
She fine.
That hammer is used for sheet metal work in Sweden not to flatten metal great video
This is nuts last week I was thinking how cool it would be if my 2 favorite YouTube folks worked a project together!
So Intel and asus sponsor these just to make Linus install stuff for enjoyment
She's so lovely
Didn't you mount the water cooler in the wrong orientation?? Shouldn't the tubes be at the top and not under the cpu ???
glad not the only one who noticed it
"Damnnn Linus, you shorttt"
these guys are getting along too well
Oh man the Floatplane video is over 6 hours long!
"We finally get to see more of her house, she never gave a house tour"
"You would think that by now, they would book more time for these builds. Every single time, Linus is freaking out because they have 1 day to build a whole house."
Does the second part include Kris giving you a much needed haircut (with live commentary) ????
Omg two of my favourite YouTubers ever collabing!!!!!!!
part of me died with that 12900k today üíÄüíÄüíÄ
please tell me part 2 will be released on youtube
This is the coolest collaboration I've ever seen ‚ù§
Can't believe Linus finally found someone to collab with that won't immediately cause controversy.
@Michaela lot of people have done that lat least once. It depends on context so gage how bad it is
@nartin9 dropping the n word on stream is a pretty good reason to not like a creator.
@MrGrandBarbu I don't understand why people hated PewDiePie other than it was popular or others just wanted attention
"@king crimson He had the whole gambling stream thingy a while after their collab, basically said that gambling on stream knowing kids watch his streams isnt bad iirc"
@king crimson XQC was gambling and doing something related to advertising gambling to minors (I don‚Äôt remember) it‚Äôs all kindve blown over by now though. Same with Hasan and Dream‚Äôs.
"It wouldn't be a Linus video without chaos and him dropping stuff.
So, par for the course so far. 
Love the colab. üëçüëç"
nice being fans of both Kris and Linus the seeing this
This was an absolute fever dream in action
"Like every time, I have the same TV üòÇ
But mine is white on the back, it's very cool !"
lol
When they brought out the stu finder it reminded me of Anthony in the other video joking about studs.... Need to give the video of Linus's game room more love.
No way he says this when he had the twomad collab
Finnnaaaalllllyyyyyy
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them.""

Fuck why didn't I think of that"
Linus becoming an installation guide
Why are these streamer/tiktok types always such over the top cringe weirdos... üôÑ
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them"""
6x 120mm intake fans shouldn't need an exhaust fan - there should be enough positive pressure in that case that an exhaust fan would pretty much just get in the way.
Linus. Did not plan for 6 hours. It worked. I‚Äôm tired
"4:25 ü§§

3:51 PM
7/24/2022"
√ÜSS
Really great video. You all had so much fun.
Kallmekris bad asf
"Linus did a lot of flirting here, i hope his wife is ok with it."
12:52 the pure shock on linus face is amazing
2:39 ball-pin-hammer  one side is a hammer for flat stuff and ball side is for mostly for pinning pins.
This video was great ü§£ü§£ü§£
"Damn, you both seem like such nice people to be around. Very enjoyable duo!"
Don't break it up into two parts or at least feel shame!
"Linus, Kris needs to be on Floatplane!"
So...part 2 on youtube later?
Could fo d Part 2 on floatplane.... :(
the colab we never knew we needed
Kallmekris is hilarious! One of the funniest people in the world
"when linus get home...somebody gonna continue to say  "" is a vibrator""  guess who ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"She: ""I like this screwdriver ü™õ""
Linus: ""Now this job is top priority"""
I‚Äôve been waiting for this video for months
I‚Äôve been waiting ever since Linus posted a community post about it
"Looking at this motherboard. Its like
[So what IO do you want on it?]
[Yes]"
I NEED MOAR!!!!
someone at Asus was defo a simp with this sponsorship
The lovely amount of awkwardü•πüòÇüòÇ
More blutty pixelated neighborhoods
"Yvonne def gave Linus shit for this video lol, watching this made me feel like i was cheating üòÖ"
i love this video!
"Part 2 is not, in fact, on floatplane, I was LIED to!!!!!! üò≠"
"Only ever seen Kris on YouTube then Linus, who is collabing, thinks she doesn't. Lol, great video."
"""I have lots of friends..I just pay them""ü§£ü§£"
I wish LTT would do a GPU paint tutorial
"Did she get an almighty, Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 4K/240 Hz monitor as well? üòéüëç"
"Wait, why does Yvonne want to melt down the gold controller?"
Linus face when kris said he has gray hair. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
OMFG! The Crossover we didnt know we needed! :) :) :)
"To the painter: ""You know American Psycho? Do that please.""

Painter: ""I'm scared, let's do this quick & get out of here!"""
Never felt prouder to be Canadian. What a great vid!
This video was great worth the time you guys put into it and should be done more... linus tech setup tips :p
Did Linus install the AIO radiator upside down? 21:38
Linus finally found somebody who matched his energy. You would think you two knew each other for years watching this
"@FG yes, it's called a Friend SHIP"
@Arcturus ever heard of friends?
‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
I ship it
Omg finally i have been waiting for this video for more than a month
who dat
2 minutes in still hasnt explained who this is lol ill just keep waiting then
I think she got really mad
:p
This is true entertainment
"18:03 meow, didn't realise she was a cat girl. nice."
Just waiting for the day for someone to kick in her door and it rams into the tv screen
16:25 Linus midlife crisis SHOCK face hahahaha
She's kinda cute.
I'd really like to know what was said between the cut at 12:36
Linus looks like me when i talk to girls.
nice she is funny
"should have had Yvonne with you guys, would have made the energy better"
I guess we won't be seeing the KallmeKris haircut soon because Dennis called dibs on Linus' hair.
Painter Linus hyper focusing on the drywall mud sanding. Love it!
This came out way later than I expected bc of the short at least to weeks ago
blame the drywaller not the painter
The energy they give off together is so chaotic it‚Äôs so fun
"@girlsdrinkfeck Jesus Christ do you think you are some higher being or something we watch content creators because they are entertaining to us, I watch LTT because I enjoy the personality of the people there and building pcs, I watch kris because she‚Äôs funny and entertaining we aren‚Äôt some mindless lower people"
@girlsdrinkfeck yep people need to get a life.
"@Brivvr because its usually immature people/young people who follow social influencers ,they are too under developed mentally to have their own life ,so instead they follow others"
@girlsdrinkfeck i don‚Äôt get what that has to do with 10 years old but if you feel like you are better than everybody else that‚Äôs cool
"@Aryan i dont do personality streamers ,again im not 10 years old"
"They're like bffs already
I love it"
Wooooow! Unexpected collab. I Love kallmekris üíñüíñüíñ
terrible description of acoustic diffusion
Such a cute couple.
Where have I seen her from???
"I would like to configure a mini pc much like apple mini or intel NUC mini. 

I would like to to inquire whether liquid cooling is possible in such a small form factor or not?"
Lol .. also I wonder how much they got over charges for simple insulation covers in like a cloth? Or paint
i cant wait till my grandchildren can get a ltt screwdriver
"Intel: I will sponsor your staff.

ASUS: I'll handle every other YouTuber out there

Sweet"
Hi
Release the 4+ hour cut you cowards! we need to see you and Kriss both dropping things xD
1:33 I honestly was not even half surprised if Linus accidently broke the tab on that service panel LOL. It's within possibility ;D <3
I am so mad that she doesn¬¥t have stolen goods from the office :D
1:58 but she is adamantly abstinent
He said she screws. Ummm maybe it has a different meaning in Canada than in the USA. Lol
Who is kallermerics
"im so glad this was already posted, I thought I already died in my universe and my consciousness transferred to a parallel me and this universe doesn't have this colab cuz im pretty sure I saw this teased months ago lol"
"‚ÄúI have lots of friends, i just pay them‚Äù
Thats depressing and hilarious at the same time"
Aaaaaah floatplane ad. You done us dirty üëçüëç gogogo go to floatplabe
The energy of this video is so fun.
I was constantly laughing during the 8:30 segment. Haven't had this much fun watching a youtube video in a while! great content
"More of that? Yes, please, and thank you."
I hope Kris builds it fully next time.
"Literally nobody:...

Linus: on his way to tell you how shitty your house is."
The title is accurate this was very chaotic but I loved every minute of it lol
"I don't know who this lady is, but she's so cute, she could literally stand in front of an HD camera doing nothing at all in completely normal clothes and no makeup and still have millions of fans. And to be fair, that's pretty much where the world is at anyway.

Don't believe me? How many men are out there having to try so hard to become famous compared to pretty women? The worst part is that women watch these pretty women more than men do.

This video was great though and she does seem very charismatic and fun to be around."
"I had absolutely no idea who this lady is, but she seems like a LOT of fun, I have to go check her channel out."
I'd never heard of Kris before but she seems great and this is my second favourite collab so far (it's hard to beat smarter every day)
Her content is pretty dope. Definitely worth checking out.
"Those Lian-Li fans. I didn't know I needed them in my life..
Welp.. Time to replace all 8 140mm fans in my system with those"
Linus flirting so hard and its not for content!
We want to see the Chris Haircut on YouTube!!!
So you used a cable detector to find the cable so you dont drill trough it (right corner) and then still yank a screw trough the same spot?
"This is the best LTT video I've seen in a very long time. This looked so fun. If I wasn't so cripplingly poor, I would renew floatplane. Maybe next month!"
Part 2 better have kris cutting his hair and roasting his hipster beard.... This was awesome Collab....
The installation of that AIO radiator though...... :O
This made me soooo happy! I would have NEVER expected this collab from 2 very different people I follow! Seeing Kris interact with Linus was great and this was just all great
"Same, cant wait for next part"
Linus and Kris are the dynamite drop duo
Linus literally speed running building a computer
Linus is on the moon
I knew that my OG floatplane subscription was gonna get handy
"reminds me of the The Oregon Vortex House of Mystery (Gold Hill Oregon. it's all an illusion,  üòÑ"
Love this colav
22:20 we watch because luke is there
fucking finally!
"She sort of makes Linus look like a little boy in comparison, no? üòÅ"
"Wow, I only stumbled onto Kallmekris last week, and suddenly LRR is invading"
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY on to parts and second part behind the paied service?
Can not wait for the next part
You know you like her. üíò Be careful your married.
"These two are such chaos goblins and I love it. They should actually see if they can do more collabs sometime, they have awesome on screen chemistry (its probably that they both have ADHD lol)"
I don't know who she is but I loved this video. I'll definitely check her channel. Excited for part 2!
Kris is quite lovely.
Why do you need drywall anchors if you‚Äôre putting them into a stud?
Best video i've watched in the last couple weeks!
Goldy being melted to help cover new facility costs?
This is the most fun ive ever seen from LTT it even bumped ijustine a step XD Holy sheit!
"*hands linus a nail gun*
""Should i trust you with it?""
Linus:""Maniacal laughter""
""and that's a no then..."""
can‚Äôt wait for the next part! i loved the chemistry and the jokes and the level of tech-talk. perfect fit!
"""I have lots of friends I just pay them"" Im ded"
"Always awesome when the privileged get stuff for free. It‚Äôs totally earned right? If you work hard AND get lucky enough to become famous or financially well off, companies and people will not ask you to use the money you earned fair and square. They will GIVE YOU FREE STUFF. Doesn‚Äôt that make you feel good about the world?"
"@Nothing they get more than the free product. They get paid. The more famous and rich you are, the less you actually have to use your money. Doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt enjoy their videos, but I can still notice how effed up that is."
"It's called business, LTT worked hard with LMG to create a business and now they get sponsored by big companies like Intel and ASUS to promote their products and in return get free products for nearly every video."
Linus and Kriss' flow is so good! Loved the video and banta in it :) Can't wait for pt.2!
"damn, is that shamelessly! damn you! üòÜ"
Didn't know Linus was getting roasted again.
she seems to be fun when around lol
This is probably the most natural feeling collab; It's hilarious to watch!
"Linus: What's with the AGE???

few-minutes-later-Linus: You're like a CHILD."
the sound changed just from them standing there with the panels lol
GOSH I LOVE KRIS AND LINUS AAAAUGH!!!
I hope part two will be put on YT as well
I got so disturbed seeing the i9 fall
"""She screws, but does she drill?!""
Aka how you ask the gf if she's gonna peg you."
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that the TV mount instructions were a bit shit
Did anybody else notice his hair at the very very end?
Really like her hair.
the way he droped the cpu 2 times and then the mother board üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£
Probably his hottest client too ü§∑
Every hole punched on those walls cost atleast $1000 of the total value of the house
I miss her. Thanks for reminding me to watch more videos.
The hipsterness...  Its overwhelming.
"Don't know if you're old enough to get that reference.

As she's wearing a Prince t shirt"
This is confusing
i legit thought it was just another intel upgrade.
Who?
I love her really love her
"FINALLY, how long were we waiting? two months? Im so glad to finally see this video !"
I love that she had no idea it was their special screwdriver and very organically said as much and you see Linus immediately perk up. Great validation! Now that there‚Äôs outside endorsement: backorders? üëÄ
Just taking the acoustic panels in the room improved the audio by at least 80%.
"Hold on, when is my random guy from the internet extreme upgrade?!?? I like stuff"
We need to see this haircut collab...
Do luke davisons new house next üòÇ
I need part 2 now üò¢
Always nice to see the silent generation taking a Gen Z under their wing.
Are you releasing the second half here or do I have to be subbed to Floatplane to see it all? :(
She single?
Who? LMAO
I was a bit sad when I saw the video is only 24 mins after hearing you guys had HOURS of footage. Never been happier to see a 'to be continued' screen in my life!
"me : just recieve the exacte same GPU as Kallmekris
Linus : it's shit now
me :"
cant wait for part 2 lets gooo
Too bad all her different personalities couldn't pitch in to help...
No blur outside? But to late now.
What earc addon was that for the sonos arc? And what tv mount are they using
and the award to hottest girl ever on LTT goes to
Linus could pay me. I'm available for a long term/distance friendship.
You should be thanking them for sending components rather than a prebuilt space heater.
13:40 - nothing is going to roll off that shelf.
Damm where‚Äôs the next one:$:)
WOOOOOOH!!!! YEAHHHHHHH!!!!
OK I noticed in some of the recent videos that Linus had a new baller haircut and now we get to see where it came from.
W @Asus
that vertical mount looks completely sideways in the last shot before the outro
Use a magnet to find the screw in the drywall and there is your stud. No reason to drill a bunch of holes
Aww Linus pays people to be his friends
"""Googles Kallmekris"""
REAAAAAAALLLY looking forward to part 2!!
We‚Äôre all in love with her right?
1h
"sorry, bytedance takes 80% of revenue?  that's Insane!"
Finally!!!
Wait..... I thought Linus was married???? üò∫ üòÇ
I mean it's 100% worth seeing Linus being so energetic and exhausted in this video ..hands down best Collab yet
i always love when linus makeover some client or his friend and he really always drop something hahahaha
Really sad that there is no Riley in this video (By 17 minutes in anyway)
I want the haircut
Love the Purple Rain shirt coming from MN
Everyone waiting for linus to break something
Me and my wife have been waiting for this collab since the original tease
I'm not mad about this being a two parter. Just means I get another 20ish minutes of zoomers dunking on an old man.
5:36 Bex approves XD
This is amazing.
so much chaos packed into one video!
"I dont get it, why is it almost always the people that can afford it that get it sponsored."
@TheZudoke then they wouldn't agree to do it
@Jack just let them pay for it then lol.
Because it‚Äôs profitable
"views, more people are going to watch a video with someone famous in it than a video with some random person"
"God, she is just great. I'm not afraid to say I'm a simp"
FINALLY
"1:07: u wot?
1:09: ohhhhhhh"
"Love  this guy 
I need my setup to be this good to help my videos"
I haven't had so much fun in a while! Amazing collab!
"thats as level as it get... honetly when I put up my kitchen and renovated livingroom(studio appartment... I believe the english term is, english second language, sorry bad grammer/spelling) but yeah... that I would not accept as level when I was renovating my appartment...."
I vote Mullet for Linus
"lol, how many LITERS is it?
asking the real questions"
Wait do i know her?ü§î
"Not even two minutes in and Linus is already restoring to percussive maintenance.

Also when you are putting a box that close to the wall it is more aesthetically pleasing, and thus SOP for contractors to square it to the plumb line of the intesecting wall instead of making it level. Walls are never perfectly plumb and corners are never perfectly square."
Love if I could do that to my room
Not everyone is on floatplane Linus I can't sign up
"Love that computer, love white computers. Wish that more companies do gaming laptops in white and not in only black"
More holes in the wall means better airflow and ventilation
How long was this in the making?
And here I thought I was bad at putting up stuff on the wall with my tiny errors and millimeters of differentials between paintings etc lol.
11:03 Give me a Shirt of that ‚Äûthing‚Äú on the wall @ lttstore pls.
Linus house tips.
Deffo gives Daniel thrasher vibes.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS THANK YOUUUUU LINUSSS
This was so fun to watch
"Kris, you‚Äôve met your match on who‚Äôs the bigger Prince fan"
Roasted air Bud
"When Yvonne sees how well you and Kris vibe, you aren't going to be allowed to be friends anymore. RiP Part 2"
Comment best read with sarcasm ü§¶
in Floatplane theres over 6 hour version.
I‚Äôm glad the gold controller is finally getting melted. That client sounded like a mouthful
"""I don't know if you remember 'Hammer Time'"" ... dude, she's wearing a Purple Rain shirt. ü§£"
Two of my favorite youtubers in one video! I love it! Yall are amazing!
"Not gonna lie, i was looking up whether or not this vid is out like 2 hours ago xD"
too bad linus wife isnt as cool.
7:29 apparently Linus only hires his best friends..
its level but its crooked...
"Perfectly balanced, the right amount of chaos and comedy üë©‚Äçüç≥üòòüëå"
I'm here for the chaos. I haven't seen such fun chaotic banter since Madison's build
Lots of chemistry here...... Yvonne better watch out üòú
i love that they keep showing the walls because on my phone at 480p I'm just looking at white....
Finally someone who sets their AIO as intake instead of exhaust. I'll never udnerstand why people would wanna push hot air instead of fresh air through their rad.
That always seemed weird to me too.
both of them a entertaining gremlins
"now the real battle begins, amd vs intel who can renovate a house better"
nice video :)
"I didn't expect some collab, but I'm not surprised either."
If she stopped saying Like all the time - very nice.
"She has such great energy, natural youtuber"
Wooooooo CHAOS! haha
Linus's level of flirting is getting better and better.
Wow she's got such great spirit haha
Caos is the summary of the video
most chaotic client is hands down madison.
gib pc pls
I love this so much!
The talk Linus is about to get when he gets home is going to be real lol
LMAO I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS too
where did he say we can watch part 2 i can't seem to comprehend ?
‚ÄúNow that‚Äôs a vibrator‚Äù - LS 2022
4:46 Linus's Michael Scott moment
"I don't normally comment, but this collab was so flippin' entertaining!"
IT'S FINALLY UP GUYS!!!
"Such a great collab! Linus and KallMeKris, who would have thought it! üëèüôåüôèüòÇ"
"YEAH, PAINT RANT 2.0!!"
BEST CROSSOVER OF THE CENTURY
Worth the wait
"She doesn't make a dime, That's criminal. One of the biggest creators on the platform making nothing from it! I'm pissed.
Great video Linus dont want to undervalue it but damn."
@Jesse Weaver That's why I'm upset
18:11 for context. TikTok apparently doesn't pay Canadians because screw Canada I guess
So......Any takers to sponsor me stuff? xD
The editors and camera operators are the real MVPs in these videos!
oh boy The return of LPT(Linus Paint Tips)
This is amazing. We need more of these two together!
The TV is not level cant stop looking at the gaps
I really like that tv mount with the sound bar attachment
this is my favourite colab you have ever done. It was so damn funny
"Holy shit, I almost had a heart attack at 19:19. I've always been shocked and surprised when Linus drops things, but this right there, that's the first time I actually panicked."
"Surprised? he does that all the time, I hate it, sometimes I feel that he doesn't even care to improve. At 6:01 , he was bicep curling the TV, I was almost willing to bet that that TV is a goner."
Kris is really funny and awesome!
This was amazing! Almost EVERY. SINGLE. PROJECT. for me.  lol
can somebody tell me what case that is
Linus build tips ......
"I've been waiting for this collab for ages, it's like an early Christmas gift!"
Kallmekris is a very pretty woman. I like her personality. Her shorts are extremely funny. She's also intuitive and tech savvy.
"This was an amazingly funny video, amazing chemistry from the the two of them no joke fell down.
Each one of them would counter the joke of the other"
Great collab!
"Never heard of her, but how can someone have 6.6m subs in less than 2 years?"
that was lame to split it. will skip to end to check its not split for future videos
I need more Linus and Kris crossovers
I really thought that Linus forgot about this. They posted a community post about this video months ago.
Their chemistry is amazing. This was unbelievably entertaining
This is the video that got me to go to floplain
Perfect kris now has speed holes in her house
‚ÄúLinus sanding tips‚Äù lmao
"Is that true about Tik Tok taking 80% of the money you make?????
AWWW i wante to see part 2"
Tik tok just doesn't really pay. They don't have an ad revenue split. You either get paid for views you're trending for or you don't. Mr Beast made like 15k from all his Tiktok channels and he gets millions of views per video
Poor Linus. Painter sense tingling overload.
I'm curious how many of Kris's subs are simps?
Linus is so much fun around new people! Good content right here!
They're so chaotic togheter I love it
This is the best video lol
16:52 Linus Drop Tips
Who?
i love linus
been waiting for this for months!
"Best crossover ever. Now I can feel as simp and nerd in one video. üëç

Btw it's super weird to see two creators, that I thought live on other sides of the world and don't know about each other existence."
I feel like they shoulda told me who this is first
"One part was not enough, I'm so glad there will be a second part."
23:28 Dennis: yeaaaah... that ain't happening
10:18 I beg to differ. I believe that my tech stuff would meet the level in any of your make overs‚Ä¶ and I can build the whole house.
"I have no idea who is she, but she is so cute"
üòÇ
Drama King Vs Queen
How was there never the classic stud finder joke.  I'm very disappointed
can someone like assume how much the PC build cost
Asus pls sponsor me
Fun!!!
Fun fact: no-one gets 5K upgrade.
"im sorry linus, already paying for YT premium. not paying for floatplane..."
This wos very fun
*Linus pointing* These are my friends.These are my employees.. Um. Isn't that the same picture?
"I dont use TikTok so i never heard of her, she seems like a very nice an fun Person. BUT this was an amazing Energy in this Video. there cant be enough Chaotic Energy ^^"
My two businesses are handyman and tech. I'm the best of both worlds.
FINALLY
2 parts godsh darnit
"I hope she becomes more of a side-guest on the channel. The same way GN or others have been brought in for challenges. 

She and Linues play off each other so well. Almost like she is his little sister haha."
"oh no, not another series that takes 2 years.."
this should have been titled sleeping in seattle
can this channel go over some antivirus recommendations?
"Linus Sebastian butchers handy work like Taika Waititi butchers comic book lore.

The difference is that Linus isn't doing it on purpose."
finally after 3 months!
God I‚Äôve been waiting for this collab for ages. My fav tiktoker and tech guy and Linus
An introduction at the start of the video would be helpful. Who is she? What does she do?
I don't think Linus has ever failed to drop a special edition box of Intel or threadripper
I've always hated Linus' upright case building. Just lay it down and everything stays in place.
She's so cute ü•∫
Can you cover the breaker box like?
"Wow, I could hear a difference in sound just as he was leaning toward the panel."
Is she an LTT employee?
Who is she?
Nah
honestly please do another video with kris in the future you two play off each other so well im betteing this will be one of your most popular videos
Wow
TLC‚Äôs Room Makeover with ltt
"I missed the small hands from Kris, but luckily Linus brought them. <3"
"tfw suddenly influencers appear in your bubble you didn't even know they exist - like 2M on insta, 44M on TikTok WTF"
2:42... deserves a golf clap
I don't know how Linus made it through six hours with one of the most annoying personalities to ever appear on LTT.  She's somehow even worse than Soup.
Who
Is the indoor hoodie *ever* coming back?
"This video has ""Step Brothers"" vibes. ""DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?"" ""YEP!!!"""
This video actually makes me want to join Kris' Patreon.
12:55 Egg shell moment be like
Thats some American built quality house right there LOL
"Well Linus if your ever in France, don't forget to drop by the house and help me with my tech upgrade ü§£"
"Less talking, more tech stuff please‚Ä¶"
it's never too late to change wives ....maybe for a little bit ...just saying
"0:27 kris should call Dr. Mike now, Linus should be restrained ! ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÑ"
Why
"""She screws, but does she drill?"""
I have been waiting for this video for a long time
2 –ª—é–±–∏–º—ã—Ö —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ—á–∫–∞ –≤ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–º –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ üòÑ‚ù§
"invite kris for a fun video about roasting linus or sth funny with her wife.... the energy will be top of the roof and the video will go viral if the written plot or the way LTT direct it is good, that vide will be super awesome."
"And people say money cant buy friends. I mean, look at linus!"
"The way to a womans heart appears to be a power supply unboxing.. :) (Well to Kris atleast)

What a fun video. :)"
Linus attempts to do in 6 hrs what Geek Squad does every day in 45 minutes
"A link for Chris's socials would have been great, I actually don't know her and can't find her üòÇ"
Her name on socials is Kalimarkris I believe
This was a good one haha
Kris answering so many comments is even more wholesome lol
Hehehehe‚ù§Ô∏è
"She seems nice! Second time I've seen her in a collab video, presumably she's a content creator of some kind? Might check her out!"
Damn this took ages to come
This is what I needed
"6:23 Chris has a New friend from now on. I hope, that this is not only a work relationship but also a new friendship."
"just realized who she is, i had no idea."
That shameless Floatplane advertüòÇ.
This should've come with OCD warning.
Yvonne watching this......bitch.
"I think this tops the Linus and Sarah Intel upgrade as my favorite LTT video. The chaos, panic, and cluelessness is outstanding to watch!"
Best. Crossover. Ever!
"I am unashamed to say that I love kris and all her content, and I admit I have a small crush on her , and I‚Äôm not ashamed to say def watching this on 4K regardless of buffering because she‚Äôs so pretty"
Are we getting the haircut as a video though?
I have been waiting for this collab for a long time!
"Why not get jerryrigeverything involved for the handyman stuff, then best out of both worlds"
‚ÄúIt wast level‚Äù whilst using a level purchased from toysrus
I waited for this one and was so excited only for it to be 2 parts. Aw man! Can't wait for part 2 to be posted!
"sorry to say it, but JUST GO METRIC!!!"
First
honestly didn't know I needed this cross over until it happened. But I'm glad it did.
Throughout this whole video I got the biggest Dad vibes from Linus ever ü§£. Pointing out all the mistakes from a contractor and his stress level slowly but surely rising!
"I know they don't claim to be handymen, but as a Milwaukee fanboy it kills me that they were using a Ryobi nail gun when they have so many Milwaukee tools"
"FYI

Just because you have a spirit level it doesn't mean the spirit level is going to be level (new or old) you need to check first üòÇ


BTW... How cute is sheüòè reminds me of Kate Hudson üòç"
Been waiting for this a long time :D
"Never seen Linus so flirtatious? I mean I get it because‚Ä¶ good lord but still, Yvon‚Äôs going to see this. Oh to be a fly on the wall for that conversation. üòÑ"
"This is the probably first video I saw with a ""to be continued"" from Linus."
"Can we pause giving free computers to people that might be able to buy them themselves... how about choosing some really poor kid that really needs this stuff? ... I mean, don't get me wrong... I enjoyed every single video about Intel renovations and god I laughed with each member from LTT, they are all very lovable and funny but please...how about choosing community members that may be en real need and do not have the means to buy this stuff and access technology... How about renovating a school? how about a school for especial kids...how about that?"
NEW PAINTER RANT...IM HERE FOR IT
When is it my turn to get a pc makeover?
Why do people with money get everything for free?
"With all the sub par finish work in the area, you should definitely do some type of collab with Vancouver Carpenter"
Kriss has such a great personality. This video made me smile as much as the time Maddison made her first appearance on the channel. I wish her all the success in the world! :)
Well this was fun xP
now floatplane promotion goes so hard that at every video I would need to check the end first whether it is a part 1 of..
never heard of these people. lol.
Kris should host LTT Videos...
Wooh the crossover i didn't see coming at all. So great.
"I actually built nearly the same system just this weekend, but I went for a full Noctua fan cooling solution. Kind of wish I went with 120 instead of 140 mm fans since there are gaps between them that I need to fill with something, but I love the white/brown combo combined with some turquoise rgb strips I put in there. My case is SUPER quiet and cool enough for my 12700k and 3090 FE. 

Big shout out  and thanks to the ""How to Build A PC"" and your Noctua-only pc build videos to give me the inspiration for the look and the know how to actually put everything together!"
4:00 It is level... It's just that your piece of wood there gets thicker to the right side lmao
I was starting to think they had a falling out because of how long it took for the video to come out since they teased it on shorts. üò©ü§£
"oh man, the energy, I'm exhausted  just watching this but so much fun"
Linus spots a wrong paint job from across the globe
I love this ‚ù§Ô∏è
this is one of my favourite collab vid so far
"Ah great, something to watch at 8x speed."
neo realizes he's  a clone brain and they give him a body. then they take his sight.
Is it just me or is the Sonos Arc somewhat damaged on the right side at the end? There is some weird gap visible?
They make a cute couple
this was hilarious but could we also get more pc speedbuilding with linus?
"First time that i wait for a youtube video for a year lol, and now I have to wait for part 2, lol again"
TL;DR of the Video: screw TikTok and the people that worked on her house.
Linus legitimately seems like such a funny and wholesome person.
"@Akilla Game streaming means when a person plays video games and show live stream (like live sports) to sites like YouTube, twitch...

Game streaming is engaging because viewers all watch and experience at same time and write comments and interact with creator. And often streamer's commentary is enjoyable."
"I'd like to believe that but he has exactly the same personality and vibe of a ""friend"" I remember who's insufferable."
"I would actually love to have Sarah and/or Riley as friends. Even though Linus seems like a cool guy, I think he's like ""only friends while in workplace"" guy"
"@Professional Procrastinator His employees have already spoken about that. It's for the videos, he's actually not like that in even the smallest of ways in person."
@Prateek Panwar what is game streaming?
I'm building my pc for the first time next sunday after watching your videos is the ltt screwdriver going to be out by next friday? lol
FINALLY
It just like the intel one but more funny
THERE'S MORE?????
"It took 19 minutes before we got ONE accent, callmedisappointed."
tiktok woman
2 parts :O
4:47 When 2 lonely people meet
Shite
yo i painted my suprim x 3070 ti glossy white too
"I just noticed the purple rain shirt, officially in love now."
i love this dynamic i want more of linus and kallmekris
Poor Asus üòÇ
Who is this kallmekris btw?
interesting video
I love the energy in this video!
Linus house inspector show when ?
The HS8s are so overkill ü§£
Funny Russian girl
She looks 40 and 20 at the same time how do you manage that ?
"It‚Äôs okay future wife, I will help you put all the ikea together. üòç"
My 2 fav youtube creators collab'ing it up. Love it. Awesome video been waiting  FOR AGES in anticipation aha.
FINALLY
üéµLinus with a nail gun is a OSHA violation waiting to happenüéµ
she is so cute
breaking this up into two parts is so great. cannot wait for annother 30 min or so of this mess.
"Finally! You should totally hire Kris to be your new friend, or vice versa. She can go on LTT to break things and Linus can go on KMK to make fun of 5 Minute Craft videos."
I was gonna see if I could get those acoustic panels but holy expensive they are.
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO FOR MONTHS!!!!
"You can't call her a chaotic client with your handywork xD oh my god haha
EDIT: the dynamic between these 2 was hilarious"
657th
"If she's on her computer, who's making dinner"
Not even kinda funny.
f mah ahh CMOOON THATS SICK @@
"Her saying it‚Äôs okay the won‚Äôt be level because she‚Äôs weird, made me like her even more!"
More multipart videos like in the old times.
Great synergy between you guys!
I'm sorry about the guy who broke his finger at the intro of the video is he ok?
"Linus: It's Hammer time. (2:13) 

Hamilton: üèé aight then"
nice
Linus and Kris have such great on-screen chemistry. They should collaborate more often. üôÇ
please do more collabs this was amazing!
i dont think ive watched a full intel upgrade. i watched this entire video
Linus tech tips complaining about building a computer on a tech channel about building computers its just song to my hears :)
Linus really needs to do a channel dedicated to visiting other YouTubers homes and criticizing their paint jobs.
what is the case they used?
I saw a spark between them two...
Nah
Finally
What's the speaker you guys got?
"lmao, seeing these linus videos makes me realize how contractors in canada don't give a shit about their job"
I love this series im so glad this came out today.....been incredibly depressed and sick so this helps me pass the time
"Exactly, this is just temporary and you will get through it"
"@Skyline4727 i appreciate ur kind words......but no worries, everything is temporary....."
"I know those feels, hope you feel better. "
thought she was @KelseyImpicciche from the thumbnail
2:14 ok Lewis its hammer time
"Man!! This has been such a refreshing build after all those Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade vids. Btw, it was so much exciting to see such chaos. It's not always the best thing to watch as entertainment when things go smoothly, I guess. üòÇ"
Super cringe
who on earth is kall me kris lol
"One of the very few good tiktokers. She makes skits, mostly."
Finally
I have been waiting for this video since you teased it way way back! FINALLY IT`S HERE!!!
been waiting for this video for so long
yay they finally upgraded for someone that isn't extremely controversial!
"Thats the best video yet, the chaos energy is amazing"
Y‚Äôall saw how excited Linus got when Kris mentioned how good the Ltt screwdriver was lmao
@Bleu Mamba that was hilarious ü§£
"Def, it was not staged until he asked her to say something more"
@Dr Artiick 2:43
Minute?
that was so sweet because it came genuinely out of her and he noticed that <3 proud ‚Äûdad‚Äú (of the product) sort of :)
Yvonne wants to destroy the golden xbox controller? How dare she :o
I‚Äôm waiting to see the haircut
I would love to see Kris hosting an LTT tech video and Linus doing a cameo in one of Kris video. Btw this is also one of the best collabs in LTT history üòÇüòÇüòÇ
i was actually thinking the very same thing! she came through as a very wholesome person and would add a unique personality to the video
watching my 2 favorite content creators collab on something like this is awesome
been waiting forever for this video since it was teased a while back!
"Damn, Linus - YOU'RE TAKEN bruh. Let me have dat chemistry with Kris and we're good. üòÇ"
@Coffee Games :\ Well jog on then.
@Iron Fan not even slightly funny.
"@Coffee Games Oh yeah? üòÇ Dang, my 0% chance went down to -69%."
She's also taken.
Editing of that knuckle crack was very satisfying 0:31
Wait more than one part with this amazing synagy? Is it Krismas already???
"‚ÄúYup‚Ä¶ we shamelessly broke this up into 2 parts‚Ä¶‚Äù it‚Äôs a joke now, I doubt anyone cares because of that line alone lol"
Finally
"I love the synergy, it makes this more fun to watch then some other collabs"
Linus is such a 50 year old dad that thinks he's funny
The girl have 6 millions subscribers and i have never even heard her name until this video.. What the fuxck? Is her demographic from gen z?
Did Paramax build ur house?
I dont know why but I'd like to see linus in a white balaclava doing PC builds lmao
Sooooo part 2 is on floatplane? The 6 hour cut is part 2?
üëçüòÅ
vote here if u think this is the best collab on yt of 2022
Ironically linus is the chaos himself
Love Kris such a beautiful person
"""it has a safety on"", so did the nailgun I used to shoot my finger, everything can fail!"
I remember seeing a YouTube short about this like 4 months ago
"Didn't know who she was before seeing the video, was a good upgrade though"
"Finally, i have been waiting for this video, thank you"
nice video!
"Video should have been titled ""Paint Rant 2 with bonus WTF builder decisions"""
"22:19 I mean, yeah, we love Linus, but we also love seeing Linus get dunked on whenever possible."
man.. imagine being success AND just being given tons of free tech in the name of advertising. fuck me
"And who is she, she is beautiful üôÉ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Those tall white sound blockers just scream ""BANNER!"" into my face...."
tiktok warned me about this
get him kris Linus deserves it.
"""the one and only!"".....never heard of her"
And? That changes nothing. The sentence is still factual.
linus i can be your friend for free
This woman is whiter than the walls
I reckon this video was shot minimum 3 months ago!!!
"Dang this one was so much fun, great job guy's !"
Linus tap dat
"Before the 'shamelessly we broke this into 2 parts' , I was like .. this should be 3x longer. Kris is one of the nicest / wholesome creators on the platform."
It‚Äôs 10 hours on floatplane I think
100%
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Yooo. its the girl from tiktok
I guess Madison wasn‚Äôt a client ü§î
LTT about to start a new home reno channel
Ok but wtf why is their energy so well matched like if Linus wasn't married to Yvonne i would totally ship them.Still tho i see them as besties
Kris is dating someone.
Damn she has legit forearms
"Asus could sponsor me too, or sb, not ppl that have money to buy this stuff lmao"
or you collab with both channels and the tech and handyman stuff turn out great
Weirdest collab I've ever seen. And I've seen some shit
12:56.... PAINT RANT COMMING ON LOL He is not happy with the paint job..... ROFLMAO
where can I find application for  Kallmekris's friend position? üë•
"‚ÄúLittle bit lower than he is already‚Äù

*removes themal paste from cpu and gpu*"
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
More old amd short jokes incoming nice.
Tow bangers in s row
The collab I never knew I needed! Fucking amazing.
I don't know if this is because I'm super stoned watching this but wow is this ever a super fun video. I'm only at the acoustic panels and drywall not being sanded but wow I love this xD This is absolute W of a colab
The amount of chaos in this colab ü§£
"Poor Linus, getting all the flack from all the sides. Hang in there buddy. I'm cheerin' for ya."
FINALLY!!!!!
Boo Paywall.
Acoustic panels should be mounted at ear height
what is this collaboration??
I lost it when Linus went mad with the paint job around Kris's house ü§£ü§£ü§£
The AIO mount is incorrect! The pipes should be above the cooler
Some major moose knuckle happenin' here.
I like the world where someone can have nearly 7 million followers and I have no clue in hell who they are
well honestly I feel I grew up watching Linus LOL I'm 32 LOL
"This was just watching 2 bffs bff-ing for 25 minutes

10/10üëç"
Long time coming
She's the just female version of Linus lol
nice
Kinda disappointed i gotta pay for pt. 2 but i guess it makes sense
who ???
"11:49 how the fuck is that ""level"". I'm sorry."
I think it's half the diagonal the camera is at and I think David is holding the camera at a slight angle for some reason.
Boy I'm lucky that I've got a subscription on Floatplane
"Oh my god, I am waiting for this 3 months, very emotional today, thank you."
Can you make another video comparing the rtx 3090 vs rx 6900 in 8k enabling dlss and fsr 2.0???? plsüòÅüòÅüòÅ
I like her.
Who is Kallmekris?
"Linus is like a wide eyed child in a toy store and Kris is a wine aunt humouring her nephew, and it's insane to me that their age gap reflects nothing of the sort."
Linus the Canadian Termite ü§£
My ex used to work at a retail computer store. I really miss her. She gave me a lot of good memories.
That did not feel like 25 minutes
Nice to see you introduce us to someone I've never heard of before. Great exposure for you both! Great Job here!
"Had no idea who she is. Seems very nice. 
Entertaining video. 
Looking forward for that RGB goodness"
yes!!!
Im laughing hysterically at this
"It really took a whole month or smth to edit this, my god"
"Not gonna lie, I wasn‚Äôt *that* impressed with the motherboard until I saw the back i/o. I can‚Äôt imagine what it cost. üòÖ"
Four M.2s?! Like. Dayum.
"look, linus Tech, you're just not as cool as kallme kris"
no
12:33 That's a nice way of saying prebuilds suck.
Part 3: the files server.
Can anyone tell me who she is?
meow
"Finally, this video drops"
You can feel the agony when Kris sees how Linus is applying the panels
We finally found Linus' bully
miss the 'Nicholaaaaas' . still this will get 5mil views....
to be continued? thats a first on a ltt video. cmon. dont do this to me.  -_-
thank god for the unifans heh linus lol
"""I'm weird, like, stuff can be weird"" is my new mantra lol. Love the vibes great content as always!"
Words to live by ü§åüèª
Great chemistry in this video. Linus and Kris play off each other so well and it feels like they‚Äôve worked together before this vid. Loving the chaos that exists just in the first 5 minutes!
"@Pepes but maddison is more... Savage with words, I think."
Ayo this comment is hella sus
She gave me madison vibes tbh
I'm too young to know Hammer time means MC Hammer but I associate it with Lewis Hamilton
I‚Äôm soo excited for al that yellowtec mika stuff
Man she is beautiful!
Linus showing off in front of girls is funny ü§£
Wow she is a natural. Great energy and camera presence. Was a fun watch.
Anybody know what studio monitors are those? 21:30
its just so hilarious
‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•..
Claim your ‚Äúhere within an hour‚Äù ticket here
Three days ago I have never heard of this person and now she is everywhere. Recently YouTube is recommending her to me like crazy and now she's in an LTT video. Super weird.
Finally!!! Time to jump over to floatplane to watch this
"Stud finders are generally unreliable, and for the love of all that is good, stop talking about paint."
I love this video
He charges in USD for products sold from Canada. Yeah LTT kinda suck for Canadians.
Bruh now THIS is a cliffhanger. Also Nick seems like a literal handywork powerhouse
FINALLY!!
Do they think people being able to see the trees outside the windows is going to allow someone to triangulate their position in Canada or something? Because they blur windows in all of these.
"These two should make more videos together, love the Chemistry between them"
"so happy there is a second part, i was worried when i saw it was 24 minutes for so many hours of filming. one of the best collabs you did!"
Where is part two?
Looks like they have chemistry üòâ
Bro he has a wife
Look at that guy is 2 person in one. Nasty.
Worth the wait üòÅüíô
the collective chaotic energy they exude is terrifying
so sick of rich ppl getting even more expensive stuff for free
Man I love her vids. That was so fun!
‚ÄúHow un-Canadian of you‚Ä¶‚Äù
As i said big drop linus 2 time that poor cpu what the hell damm linus
Such a fun collab!! Looking forward to part 2!
"I have no idea who this lady is, but she's hilarious"
FINALLY
That was incredible
i like this collab so much.. more please!
She's taller than him ...
how to spot people that have just completed or are in the middle of renovating their house . rofl
"Where's my setup -,-"
Linus and kris would make a cute couple ü§óü§≠
Nah
"Yvonne noticed that.
reputation -1"
21:28 what speakers are those?
That girl is awesome
Chris finally got to meet somone as chaotic as her self. Lol
@marestic Can't see the diffrence.
twins
Facts
Paint rant 2 electric boogaloo
"I'm subbed to you Kris, and 159 other You Tubers"
"Never heared of her, lets see what the video brings^^"
"32oz=1L, so, LTT water bottle is 1.25L."
FINALLLYYYY ITS UP!!!!!!
This is awesome! Hire her and after her upgrade then you can do others as well together. Y‚Äôall mash so well it‚Äôs hilarious.
"I love Dave, such a cutie"
Why don't Asus sell the 3000 series white edition in Sweden??? I want to build a white PC but i can't buy it from a legit website.
I feel like this series will end with Linus building a new room or house.
"little bit of a nit pick for the 0:33 time stamp, it's sound TREATMENT, not sound proofing. A very common confusion when dealing with acoustics. 
sound proofing involves keeping the air trapped inside the room. Sound treatment is dealing with the sound when INSIDE the room like reflections."
"Chris pointing out a single grey hair when I'm half grey and 4 years his junior,  harsh.

Hey Linus, Love ya, even if all the whipper snappers try to drag ya down, you'll always have this old man here ready to prop ya up!  Looking forward to the continued growth of your company and what the lab and engineering teams put out!"
I'm 2 years older than him and don't have a single grey hair on top of my head. My beard however.....that's an entirely different matter.
This was so fun!! Thank you so much for helping me create the most bada$$ office ever üôåüèªüòé
Lol
I definitely can't watch your videos the same way again XD
@)Peron1-MC( ikr
Okay your personality is downright infectious and any friends you ever have will be more blessed with you in their lives.
@Taziko Windex
"I wasn't sure about collabs with TikTok stars, what with their style being so different, but it really brought out a different, chaotic kind of energy to this vid, and that backdoor knowledge of TikTok's systems is pretty cool. But srs, 80%? WHAT ARE THEY ON?!"
Makes me wonder even more than I already did why TikTok got so big.
Its so weird to watch one of these colabs and have no idea who the supposed celebrity is. Anyways i like the vibe of these tech makeovers anyways no matter who the person ltt is colabing with. The girl is kinda cringe but its tolerable
some instathot I think so the cringe is expected
13:51 Chris Maher has some amazing RGB content you should check him out

"Oh like. They are way more similar than I realized before now, personality-wise."
"22:35 man, how not to love KallMeKris after this one?"
This is better than the Infinity War Saga.

‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏ècongratulations üéâ you are among our shortlisted winners claim your PCüì•üì•..
YESSSS IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE FOR SO LONG
"i can see the ""controversy"" time stamp in the next week's wan show."
Linus being late home to his wife and kids because he was spending all day with a pretty blonde is the funniest platonic thing ever
"@Benjamin Walburn Could this be considered flirting in isolation possibly, but if you look at how linus is in other videos its clear that he's just being friendly"
@Despicable One FFS!!! HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF FRIENDSIP?!!!!
"@chrikke Obviously not. Flirting is flirting, even if you can't recognize it."
"@Benjamin Walburn so in your mind every time a man and a woman have fun together it is flirting?
That's kinda sad."
@Benjamin Walburn flirting and having fun is not the same
Is this the tik toker
Honestly surprised nobody lost a limb
Kinda cringe.
damn it linus
I loved this
Hi
That screwdriver endorsement made linus' eyes light up
goes imperial and gets slaughtered by one of his own. lol way to go kris
Wait the water pump is the highest point for the loop
WARGHHHHH WAITED FOR THIS FOR SO LONG!!! ü•∞
Russian kid wer?
If we didn't mess with you or like seeing you get messed with we wouldn't like you. Don't get it twisted either Linus you know how to dish it out too.
"‚Äùshe screws, but does she drill?‚Äù nice one, linus"
"it's like a superpower, but it's not"
Who?
The Gold controller is being melted down!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
You guys finally released this video üòÇ
i have been waiting for so long like finally
Linus getting angry about paint and people's bad work ethic never gets old
@Andre Vandal part of that is for the meme of it
And yet he puts stuff up so crooked
"Kris - ""I see a grey hair coming in""
Linus - üëÅüëÑüëÅ"
I know this was recorded awhile ago but I really hope Kris added tiny hands on the PC Power button
"Look, I get that you guys aren't specifically trying to build hype on your COMING SOON screwdriver, but all these teases you've shown in all your videos is really doing it for me. I mean, I HAVE the orange Snap-On, and it's great, but at this point I really want to get one of yours."
yessss been waiting so long for this
"Rolling up your tee shirt in the front, is that a style thing with girls?"
Why didn't you link her socials?
bro was having a date with her
"""she screws but can she drill?"" That was pretty f:ucked up. I don't think she understood because she just said ""we'll see"". Lol"
Incredible video! Editor did a great job!
16:25 that look of realization that Linus is getting older.
new WR for speedrun pc build with comments xD
Sometimes people just click together because they share the same single brain cell
the fact that kris doesnt understand shit and gently nods for linus 16:59 lol
WAIT WHAT IT'S A MULTIPLE PART ? WHAT IS THIS SCAM I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG. Pogger vid tho.
Me making up answers in exams and linus making up key points for ASUS is kinda similar manüòÇ
"If I have no idea about how old Linus could be, I would say this girl looks like his doughier, they are so comfortable and close around each other.
Btw I really have no idea who is she"
"Linus: ""Wait.......this paint job"" 
The video productivity: ""Oh s**t"""
"Linus, please stop using those shit little drywall anchors before something ends up falling on somebody and hurting them. Use metal self-drilling anchors instead. They are way less likely to have a catastrophic failure."
can asus sponser  me please i need a new PC my current laptop runs 80 degrees in idel
4:54 under ratter common Linus W
If Linus wasn't happily married super fans would ship this as if it was a sappy tv drama. I like ltt but have seen some crazy invasive comments of people who are way too invested in the ltt personal lives.
Please keep the intros!
Wish I was rich so I could get free stuff
You are our favorite victim
this is the best video i have seen in a while ngl
"Chris Maher finally getting some recognition he deserves, definitely look into him if you‚Äôre interested in some fun and unique DIY RGB projects"
@Maevwat Sounds like something a bot would say.
I just commented this exact message then saw your comment and felt like one of those youtube bots
Linus has quicker reflexes than I thought.
Ohh she is really cute!
New cast member in the Linus Cinematic Universe.
"HOLYSHIT

THIS VIDEO TOOK SO LONG TO COME OUT"
ISN‚ÄôT SHE THE ONE FROM TIKTOK
"""you're too young to get that reference."" She is wearing a Purple Rain shirt."
When people with ADHD try to do literally anything
I like the guy on this video
Two of My Favorite People in the same video....Damn...Damn..Damn...
Asus and Intel now going to go to war. üòõ
Linus collab on Kris's channel when?
12:23 is not censored you should do that for the TV reflection as you did with other window outlooks
"Technoblade dropkicked that child in selfdefense
Linus dropkicked that 12900K in selfdefense"
Somebody should put a description of who this person is?
Fun fact Linus there was a j box on the stud too. Didn't need to look at the bad paint job to know there was a stud there.
A very salty Linus.
It‚Äôs not a Linus tech tips without an intel chip dropping hahaüòÇ
Wow this became home improvement channel for nerds. Neat
The best Collab of all time!
I need an ASUS tech makeover. Come to Missouri!
Linus don‚Äôt worry about the gray hair. Everyone knows your a boomer anyways.
omgg new leanus tech tip vido!!
"Linus, the Tim (The Tool Man) Taylor of tech."
This is the best tech makeover linus has ever made
THE LONG WAIT IS FINALLY OVER üêã
Linus paint tips lmao
Linus run an outlet up there for her it will take you guys 10 minutes
who?
"You upraded the crazy chic from two years ago pc build, I see. Forgot her name"
I don't know who this person is.
1:57 smh jeez Linus ugh. And it keeps getting creepier and creepier. ick.
"Noooooooooo! Melting the controller?
No whale stepped up? :("
This was so completely hilarious!
Finally! I've been waiting for this since I saw the post
I really wish they'd list everything the client got somewhere in the description...
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE
"This has been teased so much
Litarally the only youtube shorts I have ever watched"
More Linus paint tips!
finally
"""we only have 6 hours. we need some help""
*enters steven seagals from linus media group*"
"Asus if u are watching, i need an upgrade as well lmao"
These two have great chemistry üôÇ what a cute couple
I'm buying a screwdriver because of kallmekris!
14:19 never sniffed my screen so fast
"Ah, Linus is judging wall paint jobs. Again."
This girl look like Elisha Cuthbert.
so... judging by the outcomes of your recent colabs: what horrible thing did she do?
I love when people who absolutely don't need free stuff get stuff from companies
@Tin Suƒçeviƒá go back to my original comment. She doesn't need the free stuff. I'm sure she can afford top of the line streaming gear
@Sam Diamond but then she would have to pay for it and she would smartly budget her build instead of buffing it out with all the bells and whistles
"@Tin Suƒçeviƒá it could be if she bought the stuff too? Just take the stuff you‚Äôre given, give it away, purchase identical parts for the build. Not difficult"
"@Sam Diamond yes but then it's just one video, like this every piece of content that kris makes with the machine in the background is marketing for asus"
@Tin Suƒçeviƒá they could just as easily do a giveaway for the free stuff to a viewer or multiple viewers and have the people buy their own equipment. In fact I think you would significantly increase engagement and viewer retention if they gave away the equipment at the end of the video
The amount things he dropped tho üòÇ
Yvonne's reaction to this would be interesting!!
"As few as we see of Nicholas here and there in the background of other videos doing the Craftsman-work, it's always good and i know something will be done really well when i see he does/did it."
Who she is ?
"25 year old KallMeKris wearing a Purple Rain tee from 1987 when she was born in 1996 and she calls out Linus' age.  Linus born 1986.  Weird stuff.  She is probably 5 years out from her first ""Maam"".. that will be a fun moment for her."
Someone should tell her to peel the plastic off the back of the TV. I  have the same one and wasn't sure if it was meant to stay or not. later found out it needs to come off. It could cause it to run hotter the normal.
@saad! ikr!!! what a dumb statement ffs
@skywalker8510 watching hermitcraft account. watch 5000 usd upgrade vid. in one of them they kept it which later the person was like caused problems
@skywalker8510 watching hermitcraft account.bro its literally the back of the tv. no one would see it getting dusty plus it's good if you peel it off for cooling
But you have to keep the peel on to keep it clean. Lmao
"Kris is so cute, and very funny."
Here before a million views
Linus is his own most chaotic client.
"Use the aged a lot since you first got here I think I see a grey hair coming in 
Linus üòê"
"Not gonna lie, saw Kris her Announcement months ago on TikTok. I'm happy it's finally up. I'm going to enjoy this. Also they make a great video together. They are funny together"
her vocal wpm is 5000
the way linus always perfectly matches his clients energy is amazing
Just like TikTok the videos need to be many parts
.
FINALLY the colab betwen the diva with multiple personalities who drops a lot of things and Kris ü§£
You had me in the first half
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
They had us on the first half. Not gonna lie.
One of the greatest comments in the history of YouTube.
I read this comment literally right as he was dropping something lol
the TV wasn't level lol
"either Kris is much taller than I remember, or Linus is shorter than i realized"
I've never heard of her but YouTube constantly spams me with her videos
the pure fear on linus's face when he heard he had a grey hair was incredible
"He really went
:D = :0"
@Ckingc05 thanks
16:25 its GIF worthy
Man lost all emotion
"@Kallmekris meh, getting old is a fact of life. I see it as just hair, sometimes graying can look damned good on a person."
I waited for this for so long
Gen z is so weird. With those 1990s mom jeans
This Toe was sponsered by Intel
"Imma be honest, watching Linus build stuff never gets old. Fking 6-7 years idek how long its been but I still enjoy these videos like day 1."
Linus was worried she wouldn't understand 'Hammer Time'. Passively calling her out for wearing a 'Purple Rain' shirt.
*Two of my most favorite content creators in one video <3*
Am I supposed to know who this girl is?
"Finally
Lets GOOOOOOO!!!!!!"
"i think the round side is for kneecaps, but i'm not sure"
Linus should offer to let Kris have a streaming office in one of the LTT buildings
"LESSGO KRIS! Can't believe she is on LTT, this is throwing me iJustine vibes from way back when!"
Never heard of her
Is this the least controversial Creator Linus has put in a video? üòÖ
love to see 2 youtubers that you like do a collaboration
not even mad for the 2 part series. I Want to see Linus in a kmk Video
FINALLY
"The room I moved my computer and filming equipment into was like that. You could see all the drywall seams, no need for a stud finder. Worst framing, drywall, paint, HVAC, plumbing and electrical work I've ever seen... we gutted it."
what brand of TV mount do you use?
Ive been dying for this Collab since it was announced.
Am I the only one here who doesn't have a clue who this is?
"two of the funniest people on the internet: Kris, and David"
WE NEEDED THIS!!
Been waiting this for a long time.. Thanks LinusüòÅ
YAAAAAAAAAY FINALLY IVE WAITED A FEW MONTHS AND NOW ITS FINALLY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
do dunkey next
I understand the struggle with the C1. I have that TV and it's a mess to wall mount lol
i love this collab so muchhh!!!!!!
"hell yeah, yalls chemistry was great"
She is finer than frog hair split 4 ways.
"I have never heard of this person, but I love the energy and wit."
"She's an tiktocker (yuck) haha, but I've seen some of stuff via YouTube shorts, and I won't lie, she's funny, she has great charisma"
Never thought I would ever say that but I actually know her from TikTok.... xD
Second I thought he was going to say new furniture RGB couch
Another classic Painter rant in 3 .. 2 .. 1 ...
first
who dis
everyone talking about how they have waited so long for this meanwhile i have no idea who she even is
One of the most charismatic people alive
"‚ÄúShe screws, but does she drill?‚Äù Ayo what?"
Kris!! ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ I been waiting for this video!!! Yaaaahhoooooo!!!
WWWWWOoooooooooooohhhhhhhh lets go
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them""

~Linus Sebastian, 2022"
He's not lying. üòÇ
@HanmaHeiro yeah
and 2021. And 2020... lol
9 months later......
"havent seen the full vid yet, but i hope there tiny hands involved"
Months.... I HAVE BEEN WAITING... FOR MONTHS!!!!! YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
"Who is this?  Can we get more of a lead in that the ""One and only..."""
for everyone that has a problem with this video here's an idea you don't have to watch it you can just click the video off
The collab we never knew we needed
"5:20 LG WebOS is so stupid. Very few apps only, Very Dissapointing."
I have been waiting for this video for almost 2 months
Eyy Kris in the haus! XPLR Rep ‚úã
I love her!!!
Everything is this video was Chaotic.
Imma1st
I‚Äôve been waiting on this one.
"""she screws but does she drill?"" lmaooo"
I love both of these creators so this is great
I've been waiting over a month for this video. I remember seeing a short with these two and was excited
2 mins in and the vibe is just awesome
This woman is gorgeous
Lol on floatplane there's a SIX HOUR cut of this video. Not kidding.
"Interesting to see Linus going ""full house"" recently, moving out of computers and competing with the Property Brothers and so forth."
Mike Holmes is cringing...
I could see them doing a smart home series
Lmao could you imagine that though
Nicolas will be a great father figure
was waiting for this a longgg time
Finally
the crossover no one deserved
Hey it's the chick from the thing that does the funny moving pictures
"""Uhh.... We did not put in drywall anchors...."" 
Isn't that why you used the stud finder? So you would need them?"
either kris is taller than i imagined or Linus is shorter than i imagined
The collab we did'nt know we needed
24 minutes and we didnt even see the computer setup and pc turning on or playing games on it.
"Because she *totally* can‚Äôt afford that, right? Maybe someone who can‚Äôt afford all of that should get it?"
Isnt she like tik tock famous or something? She looks very familiar
I pay my friends to be my friends üíÄ
"Discovered Kris‚Äò channel just a few days ago and instantly fell in love with her‚Ä¶ i mean her personality‚Ä¶ i mean her channel.
‚Ä¶
Shut up!"
LMAO 'She screws but does she drill'
This video was hilarious! I had a dorky grin the whole way through!
Yes
I‚Äôm so happy!
Uhh
Best Collab Ever
"Never assume anything is level, I installed an electrical sub panel in someones house and, well, my panel is level but uh, the breaker box it's next too? All I have to say is ""lol""... Should've taken a step back and looked, or checked how unlevel the breaker box was."
i knew i seen her somewhere
I love this series. This is so fun to watch. ü§£‚ù§Ô∏è
No LTT intro?
probably one of the videos that has been waited on by a lot of people
Been waiting for this one.
Who the fuck?
"Linus says ""She Screws but does she drill?"" like he has first hand experience...ü§î Is linus a lowkey P--I-M-P?"
Linus breaks everything lol
Sorry who
eggroll
It has been months since I've been waiting for this video
"""I have lots of friends, I just pay them"" - Linus."
This seems like a parasocial relationship
@Panic PowerhouseThat's the joke...
Thanks everyone for making it my most liked comment ever. üëç
news flash with linus net worth he has to pay for friends otherwise they could do very bad things like spend his money... and not monetize it
This video seems a tad short
That knuckle crack at the beginning was. . . scary
"""I want the curtains to be as black as my soul"" should have fricking stared into the camera to make it more of a golden moment üòÇ"
@Despicable One I thought goths were native to the west?
@( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) straight outta africa
@FireFly what's that?
*Black moment.
linus has a very squeaky voice
who is she again? was she a winner of a giveaways by chance?
"I have been waiting months for this, I remember Linus announcing on the Wan show."
"Ok fine, when is that screwdriver coming out? I might be purchasing it to review it on my channel."
sugar daddy
LTT collab with one of my fav ytuber
First 10
You should do more Crossovers! You should supply all Youtubers lol
"What's with soo many youtubers calling themselves ""CallMe(name)""?"
But why a multi millionaire? Why not help joe schmoes?
"Kris is either way taller than I thought, or Linus is much shorter than I thought."
22:37
@Carl Gunderson americans
@Carl Gunderson 1.859 yards it is.
@HanmaHeiro I just Turned 14 and im nearly that.
Finally!!
linus please give me money
"If anyone wants that Prince shirt it‚Äôs from Target. Not talking sh, Prince is üî•"
Been waiting for this video for a long time
Bro when you rich you get richer without doing anything. They just give you shit
hello linus
Linus goes into a girls bedroom. chapter:2
Oh ü´£
"im so happpy to see another person in need getting help buying a $1000 system. not like all these other channels creating $5000 systems for peopel who litteraly make that money in a day and could easilypay  for their ""upgrade"""
"@The Farming Chong. That's not what i said. I said it's Asus that decides who gets free stuff, not LTT."
@Ren8 yes i did read it and my response was what i comented. from what i understand you are saying that the ROI is higher  by doing 1 videoo giving 5k worth of stuff to some influencer then by giving a system worth half that to a person who  needs it ?
"@The Farming Chong.  You didn't read my message did you, pretty sure asus decides when it wants an rog rig reboot and also those vids have only one sponsor, asus"
@Ren8 2 times ROG rig reboot would fit a $5000 budget it would give 2 videos and it would open up at least 1 sponsor spot along side the asus sponsorship so it would even make sense on a business level as well.
"It is unfair indeed, but it is purely because the sponsors don't want to give shit to a random dude. You can't rlly blame LTT for this, tho they are going along with it so maybe a little."
"man, this channel is becoming quickly obsolete the way you're peddling retail fantasies on this dying planet"
Linus and kris have the same kind of energy lol
"yeah the vibe was very high, there was definitely something more there"
this is the next wife haha watch out yvonne...... lol....
"@SlamTheFart shh , Yvonne"
Right you can tell he really liked her!
ADHD energy! Madison from the ROG Rig Reboot also has it IIRC
love this video
THIS IS THE BEST CROSSOVER
the crossover i never knew i needed i love this
Who?? Not being rude I honestly have no clue who she is.
Server Coming?
This episode of Intel- I mean... ASUS Extreme Tech Upgrade seems a little different.
2:40 Linus: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna make you touch my peen now‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£
Im so used to seeing kris in tiktok that it feels weird to see her just being her. And OMG she‚Äôs so beautiful
mario
This collab weirdly just makes sense...
Im glad this is finally here
From ghost hunting to tech hunting
Wow insane keep it up
"Giving tech upgrade to a click bait YouTuber... Yay, good vid...."
why did this video come out after what feels like months
very gamer
–õ—É—á—à–∞—è –∫–æ–ª–ª–∞–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è ))
gives perspective on how short Linus is
Her commenting on the screwdriver was funny
Finally. I‚Äôve waited ages for this
"Kallmekris is awesome, only found her channel a few months ago, I doubt I'm her target audience but she is just funny. Lot's of other try hard Youtubers could learn from that, just act normal, talk normally stop trying to talk like chills."
She needed an upgrade so she can steal content faster
Been waiting for this one!
iS lTt iS oN tUrKeY???
Lmao. Linus posted stories about this months ago.
Why this content creator in specific is what I thought when I saw the title of the video
Wait wtf. Is that how I'm supposed to pronounce ASUS?
Finallyy!!
"Not crossover I expected, but delightfully welcomed! Love Her so much"
Fr lol
"I'm not gonna lie I read that title and thought it said ""my most catholic client"""
HOLD THE LIIIIIINE HERE COME THE SIIIIIIIIIIMPS!!!!!!!!! üíÄ
linus dont be a Karen üòâüòÇ
It's finally here!
The meaning if chaotic is in a state of complete confusion and disorder.
i remember seeing the story and got excited and now its finally here
YES!!! FINALLY!!!!!
Forecast: This will be one of LTT's most watched videos.
"@RavenousJoe Posts daily content, 6.6m subs... That ain't nothing, concidering her fanbase is probably not the ltt fanbase at it's core..."
"@Ethan White madison, the girl that was on one of the rog rig reboots, i don't think she was even in social media. and her video is one of the most viewed videos in this channel"
@murphy7801 she does TikTok
And no one knew who Madison was before the ROG rebuild. If this takes off like that video did there's a really good chance this pulls many views.
I also never heard of her but this was a really entertaining video
"2 makeovers in 3 days????


NOICE"
‚ÄúMost chaotic‚Äù Isn‚Äôt that every Linus video?
I am very excited I‚Äôm waiting for this for a very long time thank you for uploading it she‚Äôs my favourite TikTok or YouTuber Instagram her you name it she‚Äôs my favourite girl thank you for uploading this video and we have been waiting for a very long time so thank you we‚Äôre will be waiting for months for this if this video to come out
Kris is Mummy.
The collab we definitely needed
Nice! I love the collabs with other content creators
O.O ! This is awesome
Nice
nice
damn
"0:31 - Aww hell naw man, who invited this kid? üíÄüíÄüíÄ"
epic vid lol
I was not expecting this but am I ever happy about it
Fun fact: Linus is also his client's most chaotic vendor.
@Snow Fox I am surprised he doesn't Collab with Matt Risinger for the construction videos he does for his house or someone similar
"Reminds me of that toast meme. Different types of closing the bag. Chaotic neutral, and so on"
Fun fact Linus is not always right and he‚Äôs usually wrong when he‚Äôs talking about construction lol.
Ur great
"@ilovefunnyamv2nd I wouldn't categorize him as a retailer. Yes, he sells goods but that is not his primary ""job."""
"Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen"
"honestly Kallmekris isnt my favourite of people, but this is still a really great video and I always enjoy watching linus make stuff for other creators/people"
"yooooo my fav youtuber and fav tiktoker in the same wid lets gooooooo
                            







e"
Wow !!
Finally
"i have waited for this for SO long, probably one of the best yet."
yeees waited video
WHO?
HOLY FUCK IT'S FINALLY HERE.
"Wasn‚Äôt this video teased on WAN Show months ago? Either way, glad it see it finally go up. And I‚Äôm curious if ASUS will continue these types of upgrades going forward."
"@PikkaBird its almost two weeks old, but point is they teased this ages ago with a short"
"@nickskier1 Right, he talked about that. I believe she was moving and lived in a different area at the time, but I'm not 100% sure on the specifics. I dont live in Canada so I'm not familiar with how the restrictions worked."
"@Anas Malas The haircut Dennis gave him has been in several videos before this one, so it's not THAT recent."
See the thing is... The haircut gives this away as a recent shoot. So I'm also confused
well yeah this video is months old lol
finally
"I was wondering when this video was going to come out, it took its time but will be an incredible video"
lmao I made nearly the same comment
This series is so fun
"OMG Kallmekris actually? Wow, that's a collab I never thought I would see. I've been watching her for a while on tiktok"
Finally!! You‚Äôve been teasing this one for awhile now!
Too late üòÖ
Love the vids
Oh my god finally....this got announced so long ago that i thought I missed it but here it is finally
I‚Äôve been waiting so long for this. Wasn‚Äôt it announced months ago üò≠
Ikr
lmao
"So great! Of course she gets the best one haha. Asus sponsored like damn she's so lucky! I'm sry but she got more like a 10k dollar upgrade maybe more haha. I bet the entire team is so jealous right now!
P.s. Linus always drops the cpu luckily this time it was in the package still haha someone please explain to me how she got a white rog gpu with the metal accents? Usually the white is all plastic umpire the gray/black one."
he painted it
@John Mon crazy idk I thought it was new from asus lol I do think best bet is painting the gray/black on it just feels mroe quality for some reason as weird as it sounds. I wouldn't buy the pure white one based on that alone. Weird right?
They painted the gpu
This one took awhile
The tech support of youtube community is back‚ô•Ô∏è
He is entire IT department of youtube
never left lol
"""My Most Chaotic Client EVER""
Me: well this is going to be a chaotic linus drop tips"
Read the name and didn't click how to say it till linus said it rip
finally it has been published
More colabs yay
