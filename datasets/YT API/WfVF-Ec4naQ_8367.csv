You rock man !!! the best method ever !! thanks for sharing !!
"As a Computer Science and Machine Learning graduate, I must say that some real skills must've gone into developing  the algorithms for these features"
"I wanted the new MacBook Air just for the better camera, but if I can use my iPhone as a webcam, I will just get the old mba and use my 13 as a cam! More economical"
I love customization in lockscreen and that alone makes iOS 16 a little better than previous versions. And to know that it cannot cover my precious wallpaper which I mostly edit myself is a good addition! Dragging those photos in messages is really cool and satisfying!
So another nothing update of any value. Thats all you needed to tell us. No Added value
The safari ones good‚Ä¶
Apple just pulled an Android-like feature there. I love it!
Proud of you man. You‚Äôre really representing the black community in a positive way. You inspire us all. The ancestors are smiling down
Does this update have the battery % on show or are apple still 10years behind android.
Quick question how do you get the weather on top of the time?
"its time to make a ""Dope intros""series"
The lock screen sucks
I‚Äôm obsessed. Can‚Äôt wait.
"Apple is finally adding things to iOS that sold me on an Android a few years ago instead of the iPhone 10. I have since switched back to iPhone, but it's nice to see these improvements."
Ouuuu
M A N L Y
Ah yes Apple just copying what android does.
Took them 10yrs to copy android! ü§£
"Some good new features, but some really unnecessary ones too. The latter just add more and more processing burden on the device, forcing us to buy dearer and dearer devices just so that every widget is animated and virtualised and so on. Also it all just wastes battery to boot!"
I wish they would make it so when you‚Äôre on a call or FaceTime that you could control the background volume separately from the call volume
apple has gone soft i mean theyre adding font customization and lock screens to ios now that was available on jb long time ago
Horizontal face recognition! Finally!
I truly like iOS 16
"Wow the package tracking is dope! This is why I love apple, they are pioneers"
Can't stand haptic
Please tell me they‚Äôre fixing the audio recording on iMessage! It‚Äôs terrible and they never do anything about it! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
bro why am i not geting this  ubdate
"If you call this innovation and your happy with it, you should be a little more critical.  Why should you be happy with a lockscreen?  You present it as something special.  Why? Be critical.  Where is the innovation?  This is a $2 trillion company.  Shouldn't you get a lot more with a major update? Like you say it. See through the hype."
What is that your using to hold up your phone to the back of your mac
"It doesn‚Äôt quite go into the sa level as detail as Lypur‚Äôs videos, but it gives you a great overview of the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù - so that you can start"
man i love apple
IOS 42 will finally allow you to arrange your apps on the screen and keep its place. So difficult to implement? üòâ
Thanks!
I just commented to check the haptic feedback üòç it‚Äôs great
That Lock Screen update is huge
üëãüëç
either useless features or ones that should have been in years ago
Still shitty and far worse than android.
me with my iphone 6s that doesn't support any of these features : /
Seems like my iphone 7 is now a grandpa :'D
Nice intro!
Crazy how jailbreak had all these for YEARS and they‚Äôve only done it now
I've been a samsung fan for a while. But Apple is looking really nice. S23 better come up with something to make me stay with these phones
Still we cannot restore WhatsApp chats from Android to Apple. Only this 1 reason is holding me back from purchasing an IPhone
That intro !! Damnn
Something about Marques channel makes everything feel so satisfying
Snorefest
"Finally i found it, keep it up!"
intro‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh man. Making the spotlight search more obtrusive is annoying to me. The search feature has been a pain to me the entire time I‚Äôve had iphones. I never use it and accidentally bring it up a lot. Would be nice to have the option to turn it off or remove it completely.
0:31 oof too late making it my main
wow props to apple these new features they are so crisp and clean. I think it finally adds more use to the focus modes now.
That intro. üî•
"And this is why iOS is damn amazing. I've had 9 different Android phones in the last 12 years and I just had to come back to iPhone after they finally got their shit together with 6 gb ram and 120 Hz. I missed iOS so much. My 13 pro Max has been an utter joy. Let's disregard it's the strongest, most advanced SoC out there. The whole live object thing is phenomenal.
Edit:// Ok, I just saw the part about the weather app. FINALLY. That was such a HUGE disgusting oversight. The search part I don't get. I use search a lot, but I just pull down on the home screen. That seems way unnecessary. I hope that ""search"" won't be stuck down there if I don't want it. 
The haptic keybobard I've ALWAYS disabled on every Android phone. I don't care for it at all. Didn't miss it."
kyanite
Apple really makes some useful niche interesting software..gotta hand it to em üí´
Will this update be on the iphone se 2020?
"the ultra wide feature that i can use with my macbook is awesome,i needed this"
will that work on the iphone 13 the desk view web
Face ID in landscape!!! OMG! Can they just do it in any orientation? Cause my iPad needs it in upside down
i have a apple watch SE and the new losckreen stuff reminds me of the watch faces you can add. So cool
Some of these things i been doing with jailbreak
iphone lock screen is now a watch face lol
"with live objects I like how apple seems to be taking imessage down the route of here are some tools you can use on our messaging app, what are you going to do with them.

it‚Äôs a creative way to interact with other iUsers. the same way you can make a funny sticker or graphic using snapchat or instagram live objects opens up a bunch of possibilities"
"nicely advertised, un-subed"
"As always, awesome video! Any idea when or where I can buy the Belkin mount? I would appreciate any info on it as I have ios 16. Thank you"
I‚Äôve seen people have the Apple Music cover albums as their wallpaper how do I do thatttt
"‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è contact him for fast help, he's fast and reliable"
This iOS beta is HORRIBLE!!!! DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS BETA!!! I have had nothing but issues. It‚Äôll be great when its actually working
S22 still kicks ass
That is one seriously ugly brick of a phone.
I swear I am switching to iOS right now
When iOS 16 comes?
this september
Now they just need to make able so we can jailbreak üôèüèæ
You've made me want an iphone
Dude about to hit 16 million
"As an Android User since the the iOS 2 update demolished my first iPhone.... it's really nice to see the competition actually innovating, rather than improving on someone else's innovation. As consumers we need this type of competition; everyone wins."
this got me hype this is gonna be awesome
It‚Äôs funny they finally updated the Lock Screen because their finally starting to remove the desire for jailbreaks
Are we getting a battery icon with percentage?  if not hope you can convey how  unnecessary inconvenience it causes to always swipe down to see it from control centre or adding a widget.
Does anyone know where I can get that photo he used as a wallpaper?
"Man his intros are always amazing, the time and money he spends on his editors üòÜ"
dude the intro oof
I'm so happy that they finally added wallpaper slideshows
Where I can get the Belkin mount?
9:15 omg they are idiots. whyyyy ??? it looks bad like that ü§¨ü§¨
My fav feature is the edit and unsend messages. I can now text other girls without my main girlfriend knowing.
"Great video, makes me look forward to ios16 !"
Jerry: Let's get started
I‚Äôm guessing none of this works for IPhone SE?
"i might get much hate for this.
all these feature are amazing and all but already iOS 16 and still no quick dial options ?!
why do i have to suffer looking for a specific contact ?
i don't want to add my whole list of contacts on favorites or use SIRI, i want to use the numpad and use it to type the letters of my contact name and that's it.
it has been on Nokia phones way before iOS and Android. please just put it on iPhone as i almost crashed my car trying to call someone..."
So nothing really AMAAAAZING in iOS 16.
3:34 thats awful
If they want to be an android they should just say so
Kearny! my home town
Can anyone help me figure out how to nest the clock into the lockscreen? I have an iPhone X and it‚Äôs running the most recent iOS 16 beta. Am I doing something wrong or is this yet another feature that isn‚Äôt available on the ever so capable iPhone X?
love it üíó
where can i get such beautiful lock screens?
That intro... ‚ô•
FINALLY AN EDIT BUTTON FOR THE MESSAGES no more ‚Äúinsert word*‚Äù cluttering the chat lol
iPhone is better then Samsung because one reason apple doesn‚Äôt have lagging problem as Samsung it‚Äôs nuts and I switch to apple and happier
"Theyve had haptic, iphone has had lighting."
OMG I love the opening animation. So amazing
Love Chris‚Äô photos you used for a couple backgrounds. Photography NFTs for the win! Hahah
"I love the new IOS refresh coming up so far but I just wish that the webcam feature wasn't just for ""the apple ecosystem"" or apple products. In fact, I don't like the way that Apple is so restricted to the point where you have to spend so much money just to get trapped in their ecosystem. If features such as the iPhone webcam feature could be used over other devices then that would've been way better."
I really wanna know which fps you prefer now lol
Every visual update is what‚Äôs already been on jailbrike. iOS 11+ with XenHtml2
"*THE BIAS is still as strong as ever.*
You can listen to Marques' Android reviews and will not hear about how it gains functions that were present in iOS for years."
Ngl not a fan of the lockscreen update as far as widgets
When is Apple going to be mature and adopt RCS?
"Sadly after all those changes they havent figured out to make a change to remove or move the home / lock screens flashlight toggle.. that thing always turns on when its in my pocket , and drains my battery every time.. Its as if they designed it to be there for that very reason.."
"#2 is a meme. Gimmick city, and I'm sure you'll have to spend $150 on the official iPhone mount for your Macbook to make it work.

iPhones are cool. iOS is a disaster."
Finally more jailbreak only tweaks. Lock screens have had widgets since the iPhone 4 lol. Well jail broken iPhones
üíØ
"My iPad Air 2 is finally losing updates. Oh well, I can't complain, I bought it *8 years ago.* That's an amazing amount of time. ü§®

I still use it in one of the cars and definitely got my money's worth, even with 2 battery swaps."
I‚Äôve been waiting for the Lock Screen costumization! Really excited for this change
YESSSSS
Apple is  just copying samsung now
Dope intro! üëåüèº
The Musik widget on the lockscreen can become bigger and much better looking if you press on the little picture
will new wallpapper be included ??
"All I want is wallpaper in Messages, custom wallpaper in car play, and the ability to tap and drag a song to rewind and fast forward a song I car play."
I‚Äôm still waiting for notification badges on app shortcuts
Love watching the videos and when you play for PoNY! I saw that AUDL YouTube notification you got @mkbhd
"Android phones have been doing that for ages, so nothing is new or to be proud of."
"Landscape unlock is something I‚Äôve been yearning for for ages. 
Lots of nice polishing here. I still want Apple Cash in the UK after all these years ü•π"
Can‚Äôt wait for it
How come I‚Äôm not getting this iOS update? When will it be out and able for me to Download?
Bruh why let the other person know we unsent :(
The exact same thing
I must say I like their new features but still not leaving my samsung!
"Yeah, but did they fix the Contacts >> Long Press >> Copy Number >> Accidently FaceTime everyone!?!?!?!"
Is there a way to make it switch Lock Screens depending on what time it is
Y‚Äôall 15mili
Nothing beats your intros for sure‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..i even get goosebumps üòÖüòÖ
Does continuity camera work on all macbooks?
No update to apple pay.....?
ios 16 bricked my phone
"I Love how you convey information; up until now, I've never been envious of anyone!"
Music or podcast widget in Lock Screen. It blows up To a big square that fills the Lock Screen. The moment you touch the small album art on the lower left.
you really live in New Jersey ?
"Decided to be an apple user in 2019 and wont go back to android for my daily device, this is great!"
"How long do you have to unsend, is that 15 minutes too?"
Where did you get the stand/thing you used to connect your phone to the top of your laptop!! I need one!
Let's go with the Chris Hytha photography!!! Proud owner of a Highrise NFT
Literally the thing that i would really like to see is custom themes. Android already has this for so long and it adds some much personality for the phone. Maybe Apple someday will actually add it. (Even tho a doubt it.)
"@James Milligan III yeah like, apps having a different icon and all of that. And it doesn‚Äôt even have to be made by Apple. Fans can easily do that. Maximum what Apple can do is just make is Skeuomorphic Theme to pay respect to ‚ÄúLegacy Design‚Äù. At least i think it would be kind of cool."
"Wdym by custom themes, you can change fonts and get app packs. Do you want something more integrated?"
"Well, honestly I just unboxed my S22 Ultra and find it way too big. After watching this, I'm seriously considering returning it to get an iPhone since I can't find much reason to keep Android (for my uses)."
Tbh I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily for someone who‚Äôs iPhone to customize the lock screen unless you‚Äôre switching from android
jailbroken iPhones have had some of those changes for years. Amazing how APPLE can lead from back in the pack.
Wher rhe fuck he lives man he had 85 C
"If they would implement multitasking features it would be the perfect OS.
Maybe with the new iPhone and it's stronger processor we will get that."
Excellent review!
The intro is a next level banger
5:05 Wrong
Could we secure our apps with face-id cause it works on messenger of Facebook?!
Wow that live object!!!!! So many possibilities
Just putting decade old features n u people going crazy ü§™
Cool You really help me Well done!
Another cool thing missed in the review is how you can have the album cover of the track that is currently playing replace the wallpaper on the lock screen. Just tap the mini album cover.
"What's the point of a lock screen if you're still interacting with stuff, soon we'll need a lock screen before the lock screen.."
Nope not gonna make my phone slower
Thx for the great review!
I would like if you could make a video on whether or not there will be improvement for the screen reader on iOS 16 because I use voiceover
Anyone know the wallpaper at 8:46?
Wow! Messages editing and deleting !! Apple is truly ahead of the time üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
I just want app icon and name changes without having to do shortcuts.. I wanna bring all apps back to like 2013.
You already know apple will make a $39 dollar version of that Belkin phone mount and people will literally buy it
Anyone else notive the roman numerals for 16 on the bookshelf?
Will the pro camera work on macbook m1 2020?
"very very gooood, thaaankss maan"
The press and hold for the photo is very impressive but a lot of the other stuff inspired from android OS
man that intro is sick
mark ass brownie
Are those vape bands on the table?
"The best thing about the beta is I can get back all my android haters for the liked ""blah blah blah"" message. Now I just send edited ""blah blah blah"" message to my group texts lol."
AAAA the spotlight feature is amazing i love it i love it i love it
"That picture shit when it cuts the back ground is dope af
Now I can delete this app I don‚Äôt pay for lol"
"What about clock alarm volume no one ever noticed that u can‚Äôt set volume separate 
 from your  ringtoneü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so f‚Ä¶. Stupid for years now."
Very helpful tutorial. Thanks
Best editing ever
"Makes your phone better because flashy lights and cool stuff, but only better if you ignore the continuing degradation of your privacy and right to ownership of your device."
Live tiles from windows phone once again prove they were way ahead of their time.
The best quality content on YouTube hands down. Thank you Marques!
"So we all do realize that the foreground / background separation for the lock screen to nestle the clock in is just another application of the live objects algorithm, right?
It‚Äòs still an impressive algorithm but Apple was just looking for something to reuse it and make that look sweet."
now they gotta do that to the home screen lol
tbh not a fan of the clock cutout i rather it just float lol itd be cool if u could move the clock to the bottom
"Instead of buying a nice laptop üíª buy a phone and a laptop Genius idiots will buy anything now a days 3,000 ++$"
"Nice one! My favorite feature is the new lockdown mode for enhanced security. And no I am not into politics, but I do appreciate Apple‚Äôs efforts in security."
The introüî•
"That‚Äôs gonna demand more gb of your limited one like the minimum 64 gb.

Basically apple is gonna improve everything (obviously not all at once cus they want that increased profit streak), so what‚Äôs bad about it? 
It‚Äôll cost you more $$ cus we all know 64 is starting to not be compatible with most people nowadays."

All this and I still cannot transfer my whatsapp chats from Android to iOS! Dang! :/
"lockscreen change is amazing, just one more year and they'll discover parallax lockscreens from android 5. can't wait for when they catch-up with 2014 nova launcher."

"Meh, all the lock screen stuff they added has been available for jailbroken phones for years and is more polished."
Yo bro did you put the sos on?
a widget what the heck is that .. thats too much for me ..
Am i the only one who hate those fonts
its crazy how professional these vids are that intro was so crazy
"the webcam thing, imo is still done better by EpocCam from Elgato, since it works with all phones and all computers via software, and has good quality, but everything else is hype."
"These are the first set of updates I have ever looked forward to so much; and all equally so. Your vids never disappoint!  Thank you!
Love the live objects and desk cam continuity!"
"never updated, its just gonna slow the device"
6:51 but what happens if you have a live photo as a wallpaper? will the live photo not work anymore or will you not get into the settings?
being able to unsend or edit sent imessages is a horrible idea when i think apple cant possibly outdo their own stupidity they actually surprise me. you can fake screenshots so easily with this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù smh. time to throw my iphone away.
What about split screen mode?? Nothing yet it‚Äôs that difficult??
No always on display ?

Keyboard haptic feedback? Cool. Too bad keyboard itself stays so buggy, it's horrible to type anything longer on it."
Cheating boyfriends and girlfriends can now unsend messages!!! Wait they just delete the message anyways lol
I'm an android user but iOS 16 looks pretty cool.
I wanna be pretty and happy
No way! I totally thought the webcam thing was an stage trick or a purposefully set up demo. I guess the tripod's not needed anymore hahaha
if apple ever decided to crush adobe they could. What a bad ass feature!
"Remmeber that rend where people place images to ""edit"" their text sent to a person? Well apple just did that AND i know how people can use this for bad."
"Slick.. üëå

Number 2 doesnt work for me :(
I would have to disagree about it not being stable‚Ä¶iOS 16 beta is the most stable they have ever released
"Hanging a 1k phone off the top of a 2k laptop, in order to get a decent web cam is absolutely ridiculous"
Highkey my favorite feature is editing the lock screen wallpaper and clock on the fly but all in all i can‚Äôt wait to get it
"What about live wallpapers for lock screen ?

They call it live but you have to actually tap them to see it moving. And it's completely useless. Nobody is opening their iPhone and just long tap the lock screen to see that pretty animation and then unlock the iPhone to use it."

I wonder when they gonna fix the calendar to show right week I can show holidays red days. And fix‚Äôs you can do more custom on Appel music app on the phone like cut the music so I start earlier or later and be able to save all your music mp3 that it still on the phon. If I go to iTunes it well remove some of my music.
Android fanboy checking in. Might be time to finally get an iPhone and see what all this is about
How about the ability to customize the shortcuts for the flash and camera button that is default on the lock screen . I feel this should be customizable as you can already access the camera by sliding to the left and flash in control centre.
What a intro!! Congrats team.
Can u send me the wallpaper
Aahhh the introü•µüíï
That introoooooo!!! üî•üî•üî•üî•
Can we finally deactivate this horribly annoying torch & camera button on the lock screen? I cannot be the only one who's torch is switched on by accident all the freaking time.
Still needs finger unlock
Looks too much like an android ü•π
The major UI overhaul on next iOS is probably if Apple will finally add a theming engine to its system.
fck you Apple for not updating iPhone 7
man. im still downloading the 15.6

"Hey Brownlee , I'm from Ghana West Africa,  I recently broke my phone by sitting on it. Please if you can gift me with any smartphone I'd appreciate it."
see clear cleaning services loves your channel and loves you
good job marq
To see the clock change to 5 p.m. in exatly that moment  (at 7:54) is the most satisfing thing I've ever seen.
Now I love it even more!
"when using continuity camera, is it compatible with all Mac models? I have a mid 2012 MacBook Pro 13"""
i really love the way this video was edited! you can tell a lot of effort and thought was put into it c:
Awesome
I hope we can know which ios update they are on so we know if it will edit/unsend on their end. Instead of just guessing.
Where can I buy that Belkin mount shown at 5:22?
Apple still sucks imagine my shock
"My prediction before seeing the video: iphone will still be design to frustrate infuriate and literally insults its customers, and none of my list of complains after 3 months of iOS agony would be resolved.
Edit after looking at the video: yep I was right. Dumb unlock, icon placement from windows 3.1 is still future tech for apple, widgets are sill worse then ever were on android, 3rd party apps still are not allowed to run well, 3rd party apps still can't run at service level and list goes on"
Does the continuity camera works with MacBook air m1 2020?
top de mais ajudou muito
the lock screen thing is so cool
"Using the camera as a ""doc camera"" is huge for educators. So not much black magic for us. We have  been using doc cameras for years now. We have always had to purchase a doc camera to show students what is on our desk. I am sooooo excited about this...thanks for telling us.
This is great!!!  Now, where can I find the clip to attached my phone to  my monitor?"
APple lets you change the lock screen now while I am able to change how my lock screen looks and change the always on display for years on samsung phones hahahahahaha apple is soooooooooooooo behind!
"Can you give me a iphone please üôè
It's my dream to use a iphone üôè"
Buy one yourself. its not that hard. SMH
I‚Äôm so ready for the update it‚Äôs taking too long to get here
Amazing
Steve jobs got out of his grave and hit a few people with a baseball bat in the company. That‚Äôs why this update is so good
"The thing is, nobody outside of the US actually uses iMessage"
I was going crazy over these iPhone that has been locked on icloud for 3 months but thanks to Daveunlock ave unlock on lg for unlocking my iPhone 13 pro
Is there a way to somehow mask the air conditioner mild background noise in your videos?
Welcomeüíô üíôüåº
grabbing images is pretty nice.
please update us when you  update the program! this is awesome!
By how much is the performance of an iphone 12 affected after upgrading to iOS16? What are the benchmark values? Any noticeable dip in performance ?
Is ios 16 version be available for iPhone 6s
I just upgraded to 13 pro max from 7plus. Perfect timing üòÑ
"Widgets and wallpaper. wow, Great. Can we now have a keyboard number row? Any chance we can now dial a name to get the number from the dial pad? Can we charge the iphone while it is switched off? Can we have a setting in there to stop us charging past 85% to protect the battery life like Android? Can we have REAL wifi/Bluetooth toggles? Oh but Widgets and wallpaper. wow. My God guys. That's AMAZING??? No its not. And I'm an iphone user since 2008! It's lame and pathetic."
"9:46 You can see him move the phone after noticing in the display that it is not aligned to the center of the screen.

His detail and aesthetics eye is freestyle level. Improvising on the spot.

Unless I am mistaken, then I am overthinking this lol. He's still great though."
Thank you ryan
That intro üòç
"#5 edit/unsend messages
#4 live objects
#3 little details
#2 continuity camera
#1 new lock screen"
"I know what I‚Äôm
Live imaging First üòÇ"
i hope these features are also enjoyable with my new ipad mini 6th gen! will upload too soon
Most of the features are already in Android. Apple is late.
Brooo
Yes this is genuine hack and works as promised in my case. Thank you very much.
Great as always Marques! What i'm missing is the opportunity to remove the flashlight from the lockscreen. I always seem to click it on by mistake when im holding the phone in my hand.
Sick freaking intros. All the little things
I know it‚Äôs apple so the answers probably no but will there be a way to use your phone as a webcam on pc?
Killing intro
They really need to let two Bluetooth devices connect to the same iPhone. I remembered they did it before but I‚Äôm not sure if it still works
Thanks for the hack. I'm waiting for more
"Make a sticker out of any object‚Ä¶hm, nudes are about to get a helluva more interesting ."
Thanks for the share
Now I love it even more!
Umm I downloaded the beta and it seems nothing has changed on my iPad ._.
‚Äúit‚Äôs about damn time‚Äù
Great video tutorial it's working on my device iOS
You deserve million subs for sure! Thank you for sharing this with us for free!
This method works perfectly .. thanks for sharing ;)
clear guide worked well with for sharing.
that notch is so ugly.. i wouldnt be able to handle it.
Can you turn the camera off on the Lock Screen?
"I just beg Apple team, to make good morning‚Äôs alarms, do I ask for too much?"
I just switched from android to iPhone yesterday. 14 years with Samsung phones!!!! I bought the 13 pro and love it. I can‚Äôt wait to play with these new updates when I get the iOS 16.
Will it allow the square apps to be circles?
Me having an iPhone 7 üò¢
"Love it. Animations, everything, kudos for you and your team for making such amazing content! :)"
"#5 you can already delete a message ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
#4 deep fakes are going to be GREAT!
#3 meh and meh
#2 lame / and awesome
#1 watch items now on phone ‚Ä¶ pretty cool
Have said for YEARS they need to add the Crown to the phone‚Ä¶..no more blocking the screen period! No finger scrolling etc!"
I‚Äôm a beta tester and I haven‚Äôt gotten iOS 16 yet.   Not sure how only reviewers are getting this.
I have a iphone 7 plus üò©üò©üò©
Still no way to show battery percentage other than a stupid widget or using the control centre‚Ä¶
I just want fricking splitscreen like android has. One of the reasons I will return to Android
HAHAHA....So finally IOS is becoming more of Android
Why don‚Äòt built the iphone cam in all MacBooks?‚Ä¶ much more genius!
"Awesome, can‚Äôt wait for them"
"Thank You, very informative"
Just give us the ability to make mp3‚Äôs as ringtones directly than use garage band. In fact use mp3 for any notification
god i really needed that haptic keyboard
My favorite feature is that my IPhone 8 Plus can still take advantage of most of this IOS.
Still no swipe left-right gesture navigation. Still users have to touch left top corner by using other hand to go back. At least it should be optional because Android users can do everything by their one hand/thumb.
Are we finally getting live time find my iPhone for contacts? This was supposed to come a year ago
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos
"Amazing innovations Apple. And they even upgraded iPhone 8 design for the second time with the newest internals as iPhone SE 2022. Now can you please, please return the 3D touch that makes moving cursor and selecting text a breeze üôÑ"
Keeps you creating ;)
After 5 years of Android i am ready to switch to iOS back for a while i think. iOS 16 looks great and if the new iPhone really gets rid of the notch i am all in
"@Marcus Abrahamson i had the iPhone 7 back in the days and the SE absolutely looks and feels the same. I really don't want to get a phone next year, that feels like a device i used years ago. Especially not after using nice, modern Android devices in the time between :) but i get what you mean man."
"@TheKatanaRider I'd argue it looks like it's from 2017 or so, since notches and teardrop cameras are a fairly recent phenomenon. Besides, you don't notice the bezels when you use it."
@Marcus Abrahamson that thing looks like its from 2010 so no thanks üòÖ
There's the SE if you don't like the notch.
I've been on android since 2012 but this update looks sick
Great video.
Can you please do a video on the iphone13pro fake 120hertz. I notice it every time I use my 13ProMax and it's very annoying when using an s22ultra right beside it. Golden reviewer so far is the only yt reviewer who acknowledged it so far and the comments of the video feel it too.
Okay but the intro‚Ä¶üëÄüëÄ
"help me please ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
i am on ios 16 beta 3 . 2 
and i‚Äôm using it on my iphone 12 pro max
in settings it is not showing E-sim option to add E-sim
can you help me please how to add E-sim on my phone"
I think that I'm the only one who hates any haptic feedback in any and all of my phones.  LOLOL!
Bbb
"The only thing I don‚Äôt want is seeing my notifications popping up from the bottom, I hope I can change that and just leave it how it is now if now idk if I‚Äôll update."
"Keep adding fancy stuff while the basics have stagnated for 10 years.  This is what happens when you have duopolies.  If this seems overly harsh, there was once a time when this technology was evolving and improving rapidly.  But apple decided it was good enough, so they just started adding window dressing."
"I would tell that start from next year, the quality of the iPhone and other apple laptops would decrease drastically. As one small mistake, a genius user would need to purchase a new iPhone, and a powerful Apple laptop. Nice play."
That bs App Library is my favourite part of iOS
I‚Äôm thinking of getting rid of my smart phones and going to a dumb phone
Do you have a link for that clip you used to mount your phone to your MacBook?
Where do you get the part that help hang your phone to the MacBook?
"What about Multitasking apps , when we can open to apps in same time !"
Case of technology making people dumb. I mean really nothing productive has been added here. Like programming on your 1000 dollar iphone. That would have been a lot better. Quite frankly its just crap.
I really like this trick thank you.
I tried this on my xiaomi
üëçüëçüëç
Should i abandon my S22 ultra and buy an iphone?
Is apple going to bring split screen this year?
"iPhone, users sand up! üëçüèæ"
"What do you think about Magsafe so far? Did you have or use a Magsafe Accessories?

Also did you use a Shortcuts or automation on iOS?"
"Maybe section the videos in parts, everyone does it, keep in touch with technology man.."
"Great review it's getting there, still I am surprised that when you click on the share button on one of the videos in camera roll, after you choose Facebook story mode it still limits you and doesn't allow you to add music or typing in the story mode (only if you clicked through the share button)

Samsung Android phones are way ahead of Apple when it comes to user share ability expereience."
Does anyone know if the camera feature where you can copy objects also includes removing unwanted objects in photos like the google pixel 6
People are gunna make stickers from their dicks.
I don't want undo resend for messages like nah
No really important feature in this release
Would love an always on display
"The photo editing is voodoo magic. 

Repent your sins."
The fact that you can lift objects out of photos and paste them anywhere is so cool. I'm switching to an iPhone just for that. Along with it be an outstanding phone and IOS
"Android users be like (Bro you living under a rock)
We literally have these features for ages.üòÜüòÜüòÜ"
I hope they make changes to Apple Music one day.. so many bugs for me and I have the latest phone üíÄ
I can‚Äôt change my Lock Screen like that ?
Holy Shite Man!!üòÅüòÅ
markass brownie
Wasn't it supposed to be an always on screen iPhone?
"With the edit/delete a text, how does it change the already present notification"
You‚Äôre not jidion
Okay like always most futures are stolen from app devs.
0:55 15 minutes is way too long...should be 1-2 minutes.
But how do you use your live photo now as background??
Where can we get the belkin mount from? üòä
that is so cool!
How can i get the no 4 fature at my android mobile?
iOS blows and Apple is a terrible company.
I still don‚Äôt have it
Gotten iPhone 13 back in November used to have the 7
"Been using a camera app called 'camo' way before and it works great. You'll just need it plug in, having it wireless would be a game changer but I think there's other apps that offers wireless camera from pc to iphone."
*that moment when you realise you just made it to ios 16 with a iphone 8*
I'm looking forward to the iPhone Air
This is all very cool. But what I'm waiting for is that new carplay.
Do they have a good calculator app? Why cant apple think of a good calculator app? Please ask them? Thanks
Dam this intro looks like something apple would make!! Love your videos man!
Marques has the best into tunes.
"No 1 intro is the best the editing and all the work in it 
No 2 his voice is so smoth and calm makes me understand everything
No 3 its apple i cant afford it"
"you can have a different Lock Screen at home with your wife on it, and then another with your gf on at your gf's house. smart"
"Not updating my iPhone 13 to iOS 16, as well as to any newer version because I don‚Äôt want the phone become a brick in 2 years thanks to all those updates"
@Eloska my IPhone X was top of the line 5 years ago. Now it barely moves with all those updates
"You have the newest Iphone. If it couldn't handle it, it would likley not come out."
Can we get on iphone 7+?
The I send this does work for ppl on iOS 15 I still tried
in iOS 16 my favorite feature is live copy any text
Those Anime limited editions Realme GT neo 2 and 3 surprised me.
My personal favorite is the live text in video and the photo cutout thing ‚ù§Ô∏èüòò
"32 seconds in ""not stable enough to make your main yet, just warning you, but..."" me with ios16 beta on the daily driver üòÖ"
Create a problem (the bad camera on the MacBook) and sell the solution. Damn it.
bro this update is amazing
Nice! With all these changes I'm not sure anymore whether I go back to apple (I left 6 years ago) or to a foldable phone.
Where did you get your Belgian Iphone mount? I can‚Äôt find the same one üò´
"About the video player, have they FINALLY done something about how it adjusts contrast (or something) during viewing? Some scenes in movies look awful because of this automatic adjustment thing. I freaking hate it!"
Main highlight is lock screen ü§£
I have done those steps
Idk... This is a 1 year long work of Apple when it comes to software main uptade?
"I'm a die-hard Apple guy but all these mediocre updates were available on Andriod over 10 years ago. But the ecosystem on Apple is the best on the market, hands down."
"as someone who has never had an iphone, its so weird to hear that ios didnt have haptisa for the keyboard, and ive been using them for so long that i just cant type without haptics... kinda excited to find a iphone in some store and try typing on one to see how they feel compared to my phone"
DOPE intro!!!
This video is a masterpiece
"ORRRR, they just make the webcam on macs just as good?? like come on bro"
"@marques do you have a link for the ""belkin iphone mount"". I can't seem to find it anywhere. And I wanna support your channel if you have an affiliate link =)"
ohhhhhhh a bunch of jailbreak features!!!!!
"Number two amazes every mind
specially ultra wide camera ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø"
"I'm ready to be an Iphone user. right now I have s22u, which is great, but i've been waiting for something worthy from apple to really make the transition, this is it, iphone 14 + ios16"
"we make  various types of amazon gadget review videos,  so visit now and enjoy it !"

Just so advice for people watcNice tutorialng tNice tutorials video for the first ti
i‚Äôm so excited for the new lock screens!
can we get a rotation lock where we set the orientation
That top-down view is very nice.
Sa
TNice tutorials comnt from you is legendary. Uncomplicated like your video!!!
"ughghghgghgh tNice tutorials reminds  of coding, knowing what to do and how, but not knowing syntax uhughudufgdf"
"you gotta tune the instrunt, by right clicking on it in the channel rack"
But that comnt is 4 months old
can they just allow us to scrub through voice messages sent via text??? Surely it cant be too difficult to do this...
They completely bricked the iphone 7!!!! That should be criminal.
I still wish Apple can implement the landscape function in Youtube App when user can navigate videos without rotating the phone back when watching a video in fullscreen.
Anyone else download the beta in their main phone?üòÖüò≠
4:29Lizzo reference
"I want to have a passcode on my messages and phone so that I could control who can see and read my messages and only I open the messages, contacts and phone app"
Do you know if the webcam for the macbook would work on a macbook from early 2015 (i have an early 2015 macbook pro)
amazing
That black bar on this phone is hilarious!
Wish they did a overhaul on the home screen and Notification Center
The intro though
"I must admit that this is a great video but know Crypto-currency trading is very volatile one as such is too risky for bigginers without basic knowledge to make good fortune out of it, I suggest you invest with a reputable broker and enjoy your returns."
how much exactly does she make of you in every trade don't mind me asking Ilol.

I like üëç
I am a Sony fanboy but love those little details that Apple is inventing. Getting jealous lol
"This is the first I, hearing about the new Lock Screen and WOW! It looks great. 

But also between that and haptic keyboard, it kinda reminds me of my old Google Pixel‚Ä¶3 versions ago"
"I have said the unsend feature is so old. I use wechat for years, this feature has been there many years lol"
Good to see Apple is taking inspiration from Jailbreak based innovation
Yes my friend
Sa . It's hard when you look at the software
Apple.. cause if i pay a lot more for something.. it must be iBetter... lemmings ... so sad
People
where did you all get those sick wallpapers from?
Fell asleep twice
"Can you shift lockscreen's clock to the side?
Or should you wait another 5 years for that feature?"
When will it be out for us?
Anyone else find the new search bar kind of useless when you can just drag the screen down to pull up search
This is adding in a lot of features that are great to see and some of them I have wanted for ages! Great update and video.
Lol
Continuity camera? How about you just give the laptop better cameras?
Thank you so much Sensei! You are a blessing!
I am very grateful for the hack thank you so much bro it is a very good game easy to use

I wonder if that top down camera will be usable in drawing apps to replace some basic drawing tablets.
dunno how this worked
I have done those steps
Not me wondering why I didn't have Live Text on my phone and finding out I'm still on iOS 14.6 and haven't updated in a year üíÄ
New step toward iAndroid üòÇ
"I don't own an iPhone, but the ability to copy something out of a photo and paste it anywhere is SICK. And the text copying feature is amazing as well. Maybe the iOS hype makes a bit more sense to me."
tested on ios12 as well. so far it's good to use
You are my favorite featureü§≠
So would this work with an android user?
Great information Thanks for creator

Cal Toe Productions It‚Äôs worth it
"Still bluetooth W-lan  isnt turned off completely when you disable it via the controllcenter. Still no easy way of using custom ringtones. Still no fast way to activate and deactivate location services. Still no fast way to close background apps, really 3 fingers to close 3 apps is just stupid. Still no fingerprint unlocking, you always have to give your face to apple. Still alot of problems when you want to connect your iphone to a windows system. I really dont get why apple still is so against ppl from the android and windows world switching there phone. The onboarding when you are not already completely using apple products is just horrible."
How are your new Golf clubs going?
Worked very fast
tested on ios12 as well. so far it's good to use

incredibaly awesome but i am really waiting for the iphone 14 this year but let see what the hill happened to it we will cover out that this year  .... thanks for descovering the new features
Lovely post with helpful information. This tutorial ha really helped me a lot. I do like and enjoyed this cool video.
THANK YOU!! ‚úå

change it to Analog app 1 TE
tNice tutorials tutorial was very satisfying
Wow thank you very much I am a 12 year old and I really like making EDM soft I used to use GarageBand and once I opened up soft
I just download soft soft. Are you using the paid version or the free tutorial one? Because your screen looked way different than mine.
I like how IOS adds the most basic features ever and apple fans are like OMG THIS IS AWESOME
"I ain't got exams per say, but I'm tryna study for an IT certification... TNice tutorials is more important tho"
"Who else wants Apple to give users the ability to opt out of those spam notifications (ie the ‚Äúa pizza sure sounds good now doesn‚Äôt it!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúAmazon prime day is ending soon!!‚Äù). The same way we can do this in marketing / advertising emails. 

Some apps give the ability to opt out but a majority of offenders such as Amazon and many more don‚Äôt give us this option and it results in a messy notification screen that is a mixed bag of useful and non-useful notifications. 

Please apple, stop Amazon and other apps from cluttering our notification screens"
that‚Äôs deadass  rn
sa lol
"Still no ""close all tabs at once"" button... Apple. Please."
I wanna put my name on Lock Screen. Can it do that?
thank you
U can drag a photo out of a photo is just fantastic and the Lock Screen is also so good!! Really excited for iOS 16
"loved everything else, but i must say, i've probably never used my lock screen throghout my entirety of using my phone. i p much unlock it right away and look at notifs in the drag down view. really wish we got some similar customization for the home screen page."
I did
I‚Äôm good I‚Äôm going to stay on i0s 15 I‚Äôm not interested in the update
Thanks man! You nice tuto!!
I‚Äôm old school too much high tech for me I‚Äôm only on i0s for cause one of the iPhones was givinen to me since then I updated to iPhone 13 pro max
How do some ppl already have it
im typing this with haptic keybaord
norman is that you
how
i hope i can still change my notifications to go to the top
I'm gonna keep the older ios so I can see who's playing üòè
"FINALLY Home Screen customizations! 
Only thing I wanted was ability to archive (hide) iMessages instead of deleting whole thread"
So is it still possible to see the message before they edit it?
FINALLY A HAPTIC KEYBOARD!!!!! YESSSSSS
"IF YOU ARE ON BETA TESTING AND GET A NEW PHONE, DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL THE BETA PROGRAM WHILE YOU ARE STILL SETTING UP YOU NEW PHONE. IT WILL NOT WORK"
Big fan of the update. If android users ever considered coming over I think the next few generations of iPhone will do it
"The webcam feature is amazing, if only it had some way of working on non macbooks"
Too bad I have an iPhone 2GS..
"I hope side loading eventually becomes a thing, I would ditch android forever, this is the thing that has killed iphone for me since jailbreaking was mostly halted years ago"
"Hi, I have updated my iPhone to iOS 16 beta but the clock feature where is sits behind the subject in the photo doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôve even tried downloading the photos that were used in the video and linked in the bio. The feature where you can pull out and copy and paste subjects from an image also doesn‚Äôt work, as well the older feature of highlighting and copying text from images. Does anyone know why this is. I have an iPhone X, thanks."
Apple start playing with lockscreen and customisation - I hope to finally see AOD option next year
who looks at their lockscreen when they open their phone???
I‚Äôm in the zoo with the lions
Did you actually told mrwhostheboss iphones take better photos than a pixel?.....what is happening to you mh
How do I get the desktop view camera mount or enable the feature?? I‚Äôm on iOS 16 already!!
The best feature on the iPhone is the Samsung screen and parts other than that nothing else lol
Too bad I can‚Äôt get it cause I have a iPhone 7
"Yesssss, thats what i was looking for.    hanks for helping"
Legend has it he never ca back later.
I try to the apple iOS 16 beta on mine iPhone 13 it almost break mine iPhone so I never update iPhone 13 again because it almost break mine iPhone and iPad 2022 so yea I like it but it just not good for mine iPad and iPhone
Love live text 100% will make my job soo fuck easy
what a fucking intro man. wow.
Apple really listened to jailbreak
Haven‚Äôt got mine yetüò©
"Meanwhile me with an old android, I really want an iPhone but I don't have a job yet üò≠üò≠"
"Why apple operating system device‚Äôs photo gallery is not organised ?
Why can‚Äôt we have a seperate folder for iphone back camera clicks?
Why rear camera clicks group with unwanted gallery pics and screenshots?"
"for anyone who's really interested In Continuity Camera, have a look at epoc cam by elgato"
"Are there any more increments on the volume control??? It has been a big bug bear for me for a long time, as one click, too loud, down one, too low... A simple software update surely."
We gotta stop giving apple praise for putting in features that are older than the iphone itself. Haptic keyboard are you kidding?

Thank you very much for clarification I must try this

Sir..i want to say something
Bro trust me
what is the discord link ?
Still no ability to use 2 apps at the same time on the screen? Really?
"5:14 oh very innovative apple, we have this on android for more then 15 years"

I‚Äôd like to change the color of the bubble when texting other peeps on Android. The green gets on my nerves üò©
"Yo, I am so hype for all the new changes coming with iOS 16! Cannot wait!"
iPhone 13 gang wya
I just feel like I'm watching an Android OS feature run-through (oops)
I love you MKBHD
got a dislike for that pillow behind you
How about a simple battery percentage up top like I had in1999?
"The ""make a sticker out of any subject"" feature where you can copy a subject and make them their own icon is amazing, and my personal favorite. The masking algorithm to isolate the subject out of the photo seems incredibly accurate. Personalized memes are gonna go to a whole new level now, makes it really easy to make collage art too."
"As someone who has a mildly famous Instagram page, that feature is a game changer for me, I‚Äôm gonna use it so much lol"

I wonder if it could be used in thumbnails too
Smashed the like button right after the intro
Does it still auto play music or video when you start your car while you don‚Äôt want it to? Thanks.
So so so maddening!
Apple always takes from jailbreak tweaks. The Lock Screen should‚Äôve been here years ago
Why would you ever use haptic feedback lmao
I like this update. I still want more lol. But I guess this is pretty big.
Yep
I‚Äôm using the public beta iOS 16 it‚Äôs really refreshing
J'√©tais tellement m√©content de mon iPhone SE inactif acheter un cyberpass rapide sur lg d√©verrouiller mon iPhone SE inactif si fiable
Wtf I‚Äôm on iOS 15.5 and it says no updates
I‚Äôm wondering.  Does it spy on you even more than 15?  Maybe checking your texts and emails to make sure you‚Äôre not ‚Äúspreading disinformation‚Äù.  Lol.  Can‚Äôt have anybody disagreeing with the narrative.  Not with midterms coming up.
"Looking forward to it, thanks.

But #1 The Lock Screen ? Really ? It‚Äôs a Lock Screen ‚Ä¶. don‚Äôt get it."
3:34 does this mean you can‚Äôt swipe down from the top to open search?
very excited for this
"IOS getting some pretty nice upgrades. Still too expensive to gamble on something I didn't like in the past, but it's still interesting to keep up with what's being updated."
that new live text drag and drop feature is kind of mind blowing to me
These features we had on telegram on 4 years ago lol
"I've had all the latest high end Android phones, pixels, Samsung's, etc and still have no idea what haptic feedback is despite every channel talking about it."
Shame there‚Äôs still no option to get rid of the horrible dock background though
Apple just became as customisable as android
"Live objects, that‚Äôs awesome!"
"I kind of don't know guys, I'm on the edge. If you use your iPhone as a webcam then how do you use your phone during a call? Type a message, answer a call, authorize a MFA authentication. Unsending a message is cool but if you are unsure whether the other party uses iOS 16 then.... I'm probably less excited than MKBHD üòÅ Let's see when it rolls out."
apple is great. they just wait for everyone to come up with cool stuff and then just copy and implement in their new IOS.
Good one üëè
I love ios16 so far but you didn‚Äôt mention the now playing feature on the lock screen! Tap the album art and it expands the album art and blurs the background behind it (which shows a variation of color from the album art). It looks dope af!
Message editing and unsending?? üòè I thought it was 2022
I love the new timer feature for my charcoal grilling. The webcam thing will be nice too.
let me guess they will say live wallpapers are ground breaking with video of your cat instead of same static screen on iPhone 1 to now.... when they add this feature to iPhone twenty
wow it's an Android
100 unlocks a day? Wtf
"FaceID unlock in landscape mode üôåüôåüôå

Live image is cool.

Don‚Äôt care much for the other features. Continued software/security updates always welcome.

What I‚Äôd really also like to have:-
-Number row by default on the keyboard? All third party keyboards I‚Äôve tried suck (buggy / laggy as hell)
-Advanced search / filtering in Messages (e.g. search within specific thread(s), by date range,etc)."
Ok
Ok
I love Jidons videos so much
I appreciate that intro! Very nicely done!
#5 Just use Telegram!
looking forward to more cool ios updates
to be honest this is actualy the best video of MKBHD and team. keep it up!
"I like all of the new features, when they get it right it's going to be amazing. but it is soooo buggy. I wish I never downloaded the beta."
"wow, the new camera thing is brilliant,  especially for streaming and video making."
"6:32, great, time to order my S22, I've waited long enough lol."
5:41 except now you can't use your phone in a meeting lol.
apple needs to just sponser you from now on uve made me excited every review i watch bro big love from south africa
Never used a haptic keyboard on my Androids. Rather save the battery and type faster.
please let me put apps on the bottom of the screen
feature like samsung payish?? otherwise fk that.
I‚Äôd like if the haptic would work for me. It‚Äôs turned on but it doesn‚Äôt work at all. üòî
This guy his amazing
Live objects looks like the smartphone trick in 2022. Damm. Really nice update overall!
Thanks
Thanks for the hack. I'm waiting for more
Never used an iphone before. You telling me it never had haptic keyboard all this time ? So why did nobody mention this before in reviews ? This is so hilarious üòÇ
Apple catching up with Android as usual but doing it better.
It works for sharing.

"Help! I'm not sure what to buy. I've been a diehard Android user for a long time, currently on the Pixel 3 XL and I love it, but it's time for a new phone. I don't like the Pixel 6 design and I've heard a lot of bad things about it, buggy, gets hot, battery dies quickly. I am also sick and tried of dealing with horrible SMS/MMS messages since everyone I know refuses to use WhatsApp. And I have literally never received an RCS message, so I'm not holding out hope for that. I should also mention that I primarily use a Mac, and using Android messages on web is also pretty terrible.

A few questions about iPhone: How easy is it to connect it to a PC and transfer files between them? Does AirDrop work okay for that? Is it restricted to certain file types (i.e only photos)? 

Does Dropbox work okay on iPhone? I've really come to dislike iCloud based on my friends/family experiences, I find it unintuitive and everyone I know seems to be constantly running out of iCloud storage.

Does Google Maps run well on iPhone? I'm not a big fan of Apple Maps, whenever my friends use it it always takes us on weird routes and the lane directions aren't very good.

Does Firefox support extensions on iPhone? On Android I like to use Firefox because it supports all the typical extensions I use on a computer."

That intro tho! ü•∞
"3:22 yeah, I know what you‚Äôre thinking"
I hope iPhone fixes their notifications and makes them useful like Android. A back button and updated calculator that‚Äôs not from 2008 would be nice.
"@Jon Green 
Yeah I don‚Äôt mind the notch too much, especially with how much tech fits inside it, but swiping is way better than a button imo. Having a fake lower bezel to house a couple buttons that can easily be replaced with intuitive swipes isnt really something I would want."
@Burb swyping is not that functional or universal compared to a button. You have to close entire apps sometimes. Bezels and a notch waste more space (I don‚Äôt mind the notch look tho).
"Back buttons are useless space wasters, just swipe to go back."
Looking forward
"#2 is nice! 
first thing I remember is this project on making old Android phones act as web cam/security cam. 
still, this is nice! reminds me of doing demos."
Hands up if you‚Äôve rewatched the intro more than once. First time playing this video I had to pause after the intro because whhhhhaaaattttt? Whoever does these intros is a freaking boss! Good job!!!
Will it come to my blue iPhone 5c??
"Have you seen new ‚ÄúMagnifier‚Äù at ios16?

"crazy how they just added the home screen widgets and customizations, jailbreak has had that for years, just proves apple is not letting us use the full abilities of the iPhone OS"

Definitely like the whole Lock Screen customization
This iOS looks veeery cool.

My friend already downloaded the update (they are beta users) and OMGGG their Lock Screen got me crying off aesthetiness
Dat intro !
"I installed the public beta on my phone but I honestly don't like it so much. Don't get me wrong. It's not a bad update, but it's not interesting enough for me. I don't need half of these customization features that Apple added. The only reason I downloaded the update is being able to schedule mails in the mail app now."
"However what I‚Äôm mostly looking forward to is 3rd party applications taking advantage of widgets on the lockscreen like WhatsApp and focus-based settings like receiving WhatsApp messages only from a specific contact when work focus mode is enabled or something like that. Apple published the focus API, I hope devs will make use of it."

I might change to iPhone next phone."

No I cannot do the nestle with the clock on any photo that‚Äôs a total lie you can only do it on certain pictures
it works perfectly! Thanks buddy
"This new lock screen seems to me is all show no substance. It's been how many yrs people have been expecting an AoD for iphones, but no, probably as with the haptic keyboard, it will come when nobody cares anymore."
That desk cam system is great for YT
Continuity Camera is Fucking genius !!! damn
Can u confirm that the new update wid put a passcode or Face ID on certain apps and also in hidden in photos?
You confirmed something I‚Äôve know for years but iPhone is sick admitting with the cameras in the phone. Spying! They‚Äôve always been able to do it cause it‚Äôs interesting that I don‚Äôt have to change any hardware in my phone to get the upgrades. ü§î
Finally some cool and useful (for me) updates. Can't wait!
Aye had some of these features years ago with jailbreak but still glad to see them implemented now in 2022
I wish i could afford iPhone one day :(
üëçüèª
"Common apple..people also need back screen button n battery percentage on top bar i think.. In some app u need to use x on top to go back screen,whyyyyyy... Just put back button like android or old ios lollllll....stressss"
The number one feature you're wrapped about 4 iOS 16 has been something Android has been doing almost since it's Inception. That is totally insane. In a bad way. I wish they would get rid of the notch then I might consider buying an iPhone again.
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos
"0:43
1:38
2:48
4:47
6:27"
Super fast and easy tutorial
Wp Apple;)
I‚Äôm so curious as to what app that is in 3:35 with the yellow check and half blue circle
Here‚Äôs an idea‚Ä¶ why not take the camera in the iPhone and put it on a Mac? Why do I need to buy all these extra accessories when Apple its famous for its ‚Äúsimplicity‚Äù
"With the new Lock Screen features coming in IOS 16, I can‚Äôt help but wonder what will happen to Live Photo backgrounds? Since they require you to press and hold for you to see the Live Photo, will they just stop working?"
Exciting! I‚Äôm looking forward to iOS 16. I love them all. The webcam and Lock Screen are pretty cool. Thanks.
THANK U BOSS!
i subbed hope u do more reviews and tutorials in the future bro
wow so amazing
Only working generator you'll find
I searched for tutorials like this on YouTube
I followed the instructions and it easily worked!
This is one of the most interesting iOS updates in a while. Actually kinda looking forward for this one.
@Usu√°rio 321 no kidding Apple never listens to us!!!!!
"@Walter White the only thing that really matters and should‚Äôve added by now is the battery percentage thing, which is just ridiculous‚Ä¶"
Hello
@Rainy Day read above üëÜüèª I explained in great detail why
Love the intro!
your videos are amazing
Insane intros man! Kudos!
Shared
Ohh fantastic!! This video tutorial is really interesting and amazing. Thanks a lot .
Fantastic hack! I did everything you showed here and it worked! Thanks a lot!
u downloaded the apps so fast!!! my internet took a while lol
ha ha. the number 3 best change in iOS 16 is all the little changes in iOS 16.
W
Great video tutorial it's working on my device iOS
"With the right to repair movement making strides, the rumor of apple switching to USB-C, and now ios 16's new customization, I'm thinking about finally switching back to apple... I'll still hold on to my android for the Vanced YouTube app, but I know that safari now has adblocker add-ons, apple has slowly been closing the gap on what I want on my phone (even if not by choice)"
they should add a seconds thing to the clock on the lock screen
What is that magsafe attachment you put on to allow you to hang the phone on your laptop please?
"The stopwatch number placement should be on the left, and for the pause/cancel button should be on the right. It makes it easier for us to pause with our thumb."
I've been so disappointed with my s22 ultra. Especially with the battery life. Iphone is looking so good right now
Still no GIF wallpaper
Are they gonna make the camera better? Because my note 9 camera is better than my brand new 13 pro max. Sad
"Thank you, Apple !
You guys have really done so much work on the iOS 16. Can't wait to have it. I have a 7+ and a 12.. Sad I won't be able to use it on my 7+ but I am soo gassed to see it work on my 12."
Finally catching up to some of the extra Android features that I can't live without... I might try an iPhone
I hate the pesky little search button in the top left when using spotlight search
Love how people have been doing the lockscreen editing with widgets using jailbroken phones since like 2010 and they're JUST NOW putting it on the phone naturally lol
I‚Äôm getting the best battery life I‚Äôve ever had on iOS 16 beta lol
"iphone is getting worse, they will destroy humanity üëé"
me when I saw the intro :0
When should we expect the update?
"Reminding me of the jailbreaking days on iOS, downloading all these tweaks just to get some form of customization. Now Apple has taken these tweaks and put them into their designs"
Using the iphone camera as webcam also works with ipads??
Hidden photo folder now requires Face ID or passcode to open!
I‚Äôve been on iOS 16 for two months‚Ä¶
"Unsubscribed... this  channel has fully just become an indulgent joke of an Apple fan boy
Used to be an interesting tech related channel. Hope Apple is paying you a lot buddy if it's worth alienating over half of your viewers."
He's just talking about the new update like everyone else it?
Apple finally stepped it up !
Where is Mac air review
Am I the only one who just now realized you can grab something (picture etc...) and hold it and drag it into another app using another finger? ü§Ø How long has that been in there?
ios 12‚Ä¶.
Think that was introduced in iOS 15 so not long.
"I will be able to get iPad OS 16 for my Air 3, but my iPhone XS broke and the replacement a friend gave me is a 7 Plus, so I WILL NOT be able to us iOS 16 AT LAUNCH! I‚Äôm not too upset, I only need the 7 Plus until the January sales come, when I plan to get an iPhone 14 Pro! I am REALLY looking forward to that iPhone 14 Pro: 1TB onboard storage, 120hz display, almost no notch, MagSafe, LiDar scanner, 8K filming, I am so hyped! Because my XS broke, when Kunt and The Gang dropped their new anti-Boris Johnson song a week before I got my 7 Plus, I still bought the song off Bandcamp, but I loaded my download of the song onto my PSP!"
I am here for the 24fps slander. üòÖ
ITS REALLY WORKED LOL THANK YOU DUDE
"I had the Public Beta on my 12Pro. I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who dislikes the update. Maybe it‚Äôs due to the massive visual bugs und the new design being to much (for me personally).
WatchOS Beta was Horror. I didn‚Äôt knew that I can‚Äôt roll back and had to return my watch. That‚Äôs my bad. Don‚Äôt do the same misstake. The new Sleep Screen is bad, really bad, you need to press your crown for like 5-7sec. That‚Äôs annoying, I really like the ‚Äúscroll to unlock‚Äù thing in sleep focus"
How to you change your youtube settings to stop seeing apple stuff? I don't even have any Apple products.
"good job, use H2, we will fix the lib new order, AI will take your job, sign up to be a cop, and clean police rapists, anyway the weapons don¬¥t get to Ukraine, we take them from donators, thank you, and anyway, nato squeezed china and russia too far, so now prepare ww3, if you ban gold, then we will shock you, thanks for handing the new order to russia and china, the yuan is getting too strong, so we buy rubles now, and rands, and russia gives us cheap oil, so we capitalize, and please buy btc, tesla, apple, and amazon, so our factories pumping, we on giga 4 now, all you need, and order with features, so we can see you better, leave africa to russia and china bz it is ours, you can have leftist south america for free"
"ios 16 sucks, so many bugs"
It's still in beta so the bugs makes sense.
üôåüèΩ
come for the intro stay for the vibe
Question! When will the new iOS be released? Will it be in September perhaps?
Live text still available on IOS 15.5üòÖ
Apple will always be superior to Android!
"Wait, I just went into my settings, general, software update and it says my software is up to date iOS 15.5‚Ä¶ sooooo how do I get iOS 16?"
iOS 16 is literally just a jailbroken iPhone
Great video mkbhd
mark ass brownie
"Great updates, maybe they will finally add separate sound volume control for clock alarm or at least search field in recent incoming calls with more than last 100 calls. 1K + phone should have it but they know better"
"What‚Äôs the oldest version of macOS that has to be running for that ‚Äúblack magic‚Äù feature to work?? Also, any hope of it being available through iPadOS later?"
So I have had the beta for iOS 16 for about 8 years ‚Ä¶
"To be honest, the unsend message feature sounds good in concept but in legal cases of domestic abuse, text messages can make or break a case. I'm curious if Apple will keep track of these messages so they can be brought back in legal situations? If not, I could see this feature being somewhat dangerous."
@notstarboard best case is that they're stored internally on both devices and still able to be accessed thru some means
@Jacob Cable Isn't the whole point of iMessage that everything is end to end encrypted? If so there's not much point in saving the deleted messages on a server somewhere; in theory Apple can't read them regardless.
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre still stored in a server somewhere for legal reasons
well thats why you can only edit them in a 15 minute timeframe after you sent them
Do you recommend install ios 16 beta version or better wait to the official one?
That intro has to be the best
Haven't had an iPhone since the 6s+. But iOS is finally allowing you to customize the phone like you want. I'm probably about to make the switch because my Google pixel 6 pro has been a disappointment
i'm still waiting for apple to make apple card available internationally :/
"big downgrade, who the hell wants to edit lockscreen, then buy a samsung or something like that. But its ok bc i dont need to use it . but the new timer animation and the small musik widget. bro why. Now it looks like a ugly ass samsung, i dont need a small music widget, and the timer was so small and nice before, elegant."
great vid!
"5:13 LOL, I've been using an application called IP Webcam for the past 3 years, to use my phone as a webcam... Apple just implemented this idea in their software üòê"
Why is my iPhone stuck on 15.5 and doesn‚Äôt show a updated for the 16
they took away live wallpapers shit lame
what if you have a live wallpaper that you‚Äôd usually hold down to animate
These intros are keep getting better and better
Fantastic video as always mayne. Short and informative. Appreciate you
"Having the clock go behind the object on the lockscreen is amazing! I always have pictures where the faces of the people in my pictures would be hidden by the clock, so this finally fixes that! So so SO excited for this update"
This doesent work with ur own pictures
Sheesh‚Ä¶The intro manüî•
Nah switched to Samsung s22 ultra. This iOS update is nothing impressive in my book.
10:11 but you still can't have more than one timer tho right?
how can somebody not press the like button on this
With all the new features in the home screen's clock; does it show seconds?
This update isn‚Äôt even out
The IMessage Feature is so nice but unfortunately in Germany unpayable because of the MMS Costs.
"Guys, who has found the wallpaper with Transamerica Pyramid in San Francisco? No link in the description has it. Much appreciated !"
I think it‚Äôs amazing that Apple provides updates for phones all the way back to the iPhone 8. There is no other company that gives updates for this long on their devices and this is what makes apple a very special company.
"@notstarboard There is legitimate reason to slow down old phones.. those who were insistent on being able to download the newer IOS were at risk of their iphone literally burning up or exploding which is a potential lawsuit. If old samsung phones were slowing down because of a feature, that would be considered a bug and not necessarily malice, and yet they didnt issue any statement and paid the fine silently while apple got roasted by the whole internet"
"@eLaf l There is no legitimate reason to slow down old phones. Also pretty sure Samsung phones slowed down because Touchwiz was garbage, not because they were intentionally slowing them down. Why tf would they intentionally their phones slow down like 6-12 months after buying them? Those things were practically DOA for years. Don't blame on malice that which can be explained by stupidity, or in this case, negligence. Features are marketable, even if they're gimmicky and hurt performance. ""My phone is fast two years after I bought it!"" is not really marketable."
"im planning to become an iphone user soon but really you cant think that way.
most of ios updates are stuff that android had for many years before. like keyboard haptic feedback for ios16 just sounds insulting.
again no hating im planning to get iphone 14 anyway but i aint looking away from facts"
"@Stephen Newell Plenty of companies using android (samsung being one of them) were involved in that lawsuit too, its just that apple gets the spotlight because a lot of people die hard hates them for some reason. The difference being is that apple had a legitimate reason to slow down phones (some would catch on fire or just outright die after the updates since their hardware werent good enough) while samsung and others just simply didnt have a reason"
Sos???
Jidion
Kinda been doing this for years with jailbreak‚Äôs lol
wow! you mean i can use all those features available in android for years now? great stuff!
Not interested
Yes!!! Customization!
"why can't I update my phone, I have an iPhone 12 Pro max."
I have iphone12 but doesn‚Äôt know why people get mad when iPhone gives these android updatesüòÇ
Video on I phone vs galaxy. Pleaseü§ûü§û
They still havent changed the alarm and the ringtone being the same volume then?
"face ID unlock so everyone can play Among us log in more easily LOL
So many Dope Features  and look better (fire)"
"basically, its android 8 lol"
This looks like a pretty good update for customisation.
WHAT.... Haptic.... I didnt know this. Literally something I have been waiting for for yeeaarrrssss.
great video!! thanks
Mark ass brownie
Siri needs to make calls on speaker if you ask. So annoying u have to press the speaker button after u say hey Siri call Jeff.
Bad choice with editing front screen font. Looks cheap.
I‚Äôm enjoying the ability to continue to watch YouTube videos when you leave the app in IOS 16
Wait you‚Äôre Jidion????
What the üçµ
üëç
That intro was so cool!!!
I think this is the second iOS update I‚Äôm gonna be super excited for
Well they need to take the little message off saying we unsent it cause I might not want that person to know that I texted them in the first place üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Very slickly produced videos. My big gripe on iOS is no Android-like keyboards with long press punctuation and characters. From SwiftKey to stock, I hate having to go to a second or third screen to get the characters and punctuation I want. Major Apple fail...for decades now."
"I've been pretty unimpressed with my 13 Pro. Buggy as hell, I have issues with the camera that no one is seemingly discussing like the auto macro focusing even when turned off or the over processing once the photo is taken or the constant blurry camera when you're trying to take a photo that absolutely will not focus until you close out of the camera and reopen it...

This update makes me hopeful that we're moving in the right direction with things in this ecosystem. Everything is becoming more tied together and finally catching up with the Android curve of customizing things. So happy we're at least getting a good refresh this time around and not just some generic update like usual."
Intro goat
"ive seen lots of phone customization for years, those lock screen, wallpaper, and widget are boring.

the interesting one is just the webcam continuity"
I don‚Äôt care anymore about new features. I just want it to work without problems. But Apple won‚Äôt deliver that.
The bigger interface for music was so much better
Still waiting for the update that deletes texts from phone when deleted from watch and vice versa
Switching over to Apple for the first time since I had an iphone 5 as my first phone. Last phone was an Oppo so excited to see what IOS has to offer
Shame they didn't fix the keyboard to be like a ipad keyboard - and no analogue clock on the lock screen
What would it take for Apple to roll out scheduled text messages in an iOS update? Being able to send my texts at a later date right from the message app is just about the only thing I miss from my android
does it come with those lock screen wallpapers or are those your own?
I still have a  I phone 7
Haptic Keyboard!  Finally!!  üòç This is the number one thing I've always wanted in an iPhone and I'm always super jealous of anyone on Android who has this
I rewound that intro numerous times. That intro is super dope.
"I use an iphone myself, but it is ridiculous to me that some people marvel at widgets on your lock screen. Its 2022 xd"
"I love these! Probably the Lock Screen one is my favorite. I also liked the computer and iPhone one, but the computer probably has to be an apple computer? Amazing things, can‚Äôt wait."
That intro üî•
"Still crappy folders with limited icon, same boring 4 icon/folder in a row bullcrap. Still no point having the MAX thanks to these limitation. Also no screen split for 2 apps. Apple is so damn behind competition that it hurts. I do like iOS and all the integration with my other devices but i wish they could add some basic stuff like possibility to customize the homescreen."
Still no PIP for YouTube ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Great job Apple
so underwhelming
if i let my iphone stay at ios 15 how long will it last to be fully functioning? ( app support and all )
You think its gonna be shitty on 13 mini?
"Wow, that live objects feature is great for creating online shop listings. I volunteered at the charity shop Oxfam the whole summer of 2019, and the amount of time I spent on background removal sites for the online shop was unreal."
"Honestly,Android Had All these for years especially #1 but it‚Äôs understandable that Apple always wait to master a function before added it to iOS."
It would be much better if apple increase the call record history size with search feature and background noise cancellation. But sad these basic features not added yet in iPhone13P.
Without jail breaking apple would have taken another decade to have basic customisation on the lock/home screen
Only thing I noticed that the newer iPhones gonna be much more expensive than last year.
Non of these is new to Jailbreak users. Apple should try harder.
Can‚Äôt wait
that webcam is perfect for cheting on online tests lol
can't say I care at all about more customization lol. Still have the lock screen my phone arrived with a few years ago
Where do you get your Wallpapers?
I totally forgot they didn't have haptic keyboard
Ever since Tim apple took over the company has stopped innovating. Really want to switch to android more every year
Continue to ruin advertising
I havent used text message for 10 years
"Wow that photo copy paste thing with the masking is extremely interesting.  I'm pretty sure I am going iphone for my next phone, just using my Note 9 till it dies, it has everything I need and I enjoy being content with things.  But once it dies I'll feel fully vindicated in getting myself a brand new iphone, but ONLY if the next iphone gets rid of the notch.  I refuse to switch from a gorgeous Android phone (my note 9) that doesn't have a holepunch or notch, just has a pure unbroken rectangle of glorious screen, to an abomination with a massive notch.  Just too fucking ugly.  

I might put up with a holepunch, but even then, like fucking why.  My Note 9 is sleak as fuck, I'd much rather have a top bezel than to have you put holes or notches into my screen.  Apple is stupid af."
Apple will always play with your brain by releasing same thing over and over again . Apple is tiring
"I have a question, Can I do the number #2 feature with my Windows Laptop? (I dont have a mac)"
"I'm an Apple user and i think we are not ready for customization. I love Apple for their ""limitations"", for the pick and use. We are going to use an Android system. Even if, I love the new features and just a last thing: you are making good"
Is that web cam feature can be used in windows lap? Can any techies answer?
"I have the same question let me
know if you get the answer"
Please apple add a minimise keyboard button and an option to get rid of the grey area at the bottom of the keyboard
So I have been running iOS 16 beta for the last 27 months or so and I know some stuff... :'D

"Hate haptics 
Off
12 max Pro

Desk view is a creators game changer"
intro is quite amazing
At least I don‚Äôt need to jailbreak my phone. üò¨
You can now have a lock screen for each side piece üòÇ
and still cant put icon wherever i want.
I could not get the media player UI to look like that on my lock screen. The album cover takes up the entire lockscreen and I can't even see my lock screen. Any suggestions?
Android user here some of these features are appeasing and I would love if Google implemented/will implement. But also some of these it's like okay cool but iPhone is getting closer to android every year. Not a bad thing. Though some of these are super cool. ‚ú®
iOS < android
Thanks for the feedback Expect more videos soon send a direct message i have something special for youüëÜüëÜ.
"Apple made custom lock screen but didnt give option to remove flashlight and camera shortcut on locksceen, this flashlight shortcut always make my iphone flashlight accidentally turn on"

honestly i don‚Äôt like the new lock screen

And still no always on display
i have a iphone 7
Phone > Contacts > Press ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù again and it give you a new ‚ÄúList View‚Äù.
Still no pip for apps? Or split screen liku android? Lame
mark ass brownie
Hoping they come out with more notification tones in the future. Always been a fan of their sounds but there is so few!
When is the release date?
Still can‚Äôt play YouTube videos on lock screen. üò≠
I have issue with keyboard hope this update will help
Now if only you could have a live photo as a wallpaper that would constantly animate in a loop
I have wished for T9 dialler since my iPhone 3GS. Is that too much to ask?!
I‚Äôm sad to see the Live Photo view go from the lockscreen background when you long press it
"Excellent video, and excellent content. Just now subscribed. Impressive channel Marquesüëç"
My lock screen doesn‚Äôt work like you. I mean the clock is not stay behind my picture
Your edits are always top level. Beautiful intro. Major creativity
Live notifications with google maps is going to be so good
Dont forget tapping the music widget album art brings back an iOS7 like lock screen music experience with large album art!
all stuff that has been on android for years
"I'm from Ukraine. We have been at war for 146 days. But I didn't come to complain about your channel. I just wanted to say thank you for the great video. God, how I would like to visit the United States in this life, and I'm only 17 years old. And I have already experienced such that many will see in more than one life"
Can they just make it where its easy to change my battery lol
That life photo is ridiculousl
Oh man. The Face ID works in landscape mode? That‚Äôs pretty awesome. I can‚Äôt wait til the update is ready for my phone.
"Hilarious, people doing crazy stuff with their Lock Screen. My life doesn't seem so small now lol."
But why don‚Äôt they just adapt the camera on iPhone for the MacBook?
I still can‚Äôt believe that we don‚Äôt have a wheather app on the iPad
Sooo whats the best frame rate??
That was the BEST intro I have ever seen!
I wanna start of by saying that the intro was amazing and I was wondering if the clock would do the same thing with live photos ?
Tom cruise
10/10 intro
I don‚Äôt understand why Apple doesn‚Äôt allow the ability to record with your front camera and your back camera at the same time. It seems like such an easy feature to build in with software but it doesn‚Äôt exist.
loved the into! replayed 5x times
apple for life!!
""" you been warned"" üêê"
So as time passes IOS is copying android (Samsung) more & more or becoming more android with time üòâüòÇ
"I really never used haptic feedback on any phone (never personally owned an iphone but i need to work with a lot at work because we fix them literally everyday, any model), not only it's distracting af and energy consuming, it's also so uneeded, i can see and know what i pressed by the time my finger pressed a button, there is no need to annoy me with additional things, i know when things work and when they don't, is this just me or what?"
Why no one is demanding the Pause function for videos? It must have been there since day one and it's missing even now.
"iOS 16 is my main, Ik it‚Äôs risky but I live live on the edge"
"can you make a high fps video of this feature you told at 8:48 about screen fading. i want to experience it properly, might be you can put it as one of your youtube shorts....another idea you can start making such short videos in future for special features and effects which are not noticeable to naked eye and needs special attention..."
This is actually a really sick update. Can‚Äôt wait
how do i do download
Iphone has the best haptic feedback . Can't wait to try it
"I'm excited for this. I also plan on upgrading my 11, I can't wait."
Ios16 is dope
Will we finally have new txt tones? ü§ûüèΩ
"That webcam mode, only works on MAC or also in regular laptops?"
I need nothing from the iOS 16 but only this intro as bootstart ü§©ü§©ü•∞for my XS Max...Ghana üá¨üá≠
Every time you explore everything in a short intro with good react
I‚Äôm having trouble getting my cellular to work on my watch. Is it because I‚Äôm using a different os than what my watch is on
I believe ios 16 was the highlight of WWDC and a big step forward for the iphone
"Change your lockscreen, change your life."
Sick intro.
hey soft soft pls mind your own business
"When are they going to update the calendar. I have used Iphone since the second generation, the calendar is the worst thing about the iphone."

"There‚Äôs something that I don‚Äôt know if it works with apple music, but now, with spotify, you can have a dynamic lock screen, which is probably what I love the most. If you play a song in spotify and lock the phone, then press on the cover of the song, it will change your wallpaper to the songs cover."

Great video! Can you do a new video about how 5G has not lived up to the hype? There are times when 5G is worse than 4G. It has been years since its rollout.
iOS 16 is legendary ofc I have the beta :)
Anytime I buy a new iPhone I feel like an absolute mad lad
"Despite being an avid and an extreme Android (Samsung) user, I have a large and uncountable level of respect towards Apples' simplicity and eco-friendliness in their systems, especially with these added features in IOS 16, it never fails to impress and to make love to such device, I wished i had two phones, but for now ill stick to one but have a MASSIVELY HUGE respect towards Apple."
Bruh did you make a whole video on telling us to go to the link below
THAT INTRO THO
Excellent features; pretty psyched for the release.
So Apple has put icing on the android cake‚Ä¶kinda sorta‚Ä¶ü§°üòπü§™
Brooo
"Me: Man the new lock screen customizations are great.
Also me: I will probably end up keeping the old default : P"
Best video editing and intro
"This is why I always say Huawei was or is ahead of these guys. Mate 40 could unlock face ID pretty much any position, that's 2 years ago, you could recall text in few seconds, landscape/portrait with just your head position. Apple is hype but video recording is better than other phones,"
Nice vid can‚Äôt wait for 16 üëç
"At 1:59, in the picture, what is MKBHD holding?"
Is iOS 16 going out to ipad
"Those features are incredible, but unfortunately i don't have iPhone.  I wish I have one üíîüíîüò≠üò≠üò≠"
The desk view camera thing is really cool. You don't have to worry about mounting an overhead camera and blocking it with your head when you're trying to film something
Where can I find the wallpaper at exactly 0:17. The one with the blue background.
not an iphone user but these new features are really nice
Been ages since there has been any update for  Apple 6 IOS. Many apps don‚Äôt work anymore
the iphone webcam to mac is a huge game changer especially to those who do vlogs or wants to film videos and the desk view is great!! that‚Äôs a great help for aspiring vloggers.
mann i wish all these features existed like 5-6 ago when i would‚Äôve used em all like the second feature
worked for me on my motorolla
Good stuff! I‚Äôm still waiting for them to make it possible to switch from front to back cameras while recording video
"The only thing I've missed since switching from Android has been customization, I'd never go back anyway but this lock screen customization is great."
Face ID in landscape mode biggest mprovement for me. It would be great if iPhone could remember that you have been in landacape mode last time and after face id it lounches in landascape mode again. People who ride motorcycles and drive cars with their phone on stand know what I am talking about.
Thank you
How to download iOS 16 ?ü•∫
Thanks for the hack. I'm waiting for more

"I wonder if Apple will ever introduce the most basic Android functions, such as 'pin to screen' or simply having a small YouTube video playing in the corner, while having the rest of the screen available for other tasks."
"@Burb Yes, for the YouTube videos - that's old news. How about Google Maps? Or simply keeping a screenshot pinned to the screen? 
It has been an option on Android for over 5 years."
"It‚Äôs called picture in picture mode and as the other guy said, it already exists on iOS."
"Just wait...one day apple will invent those functions you mentioned. I remember when they were first to introduce big screen phones.

üôÑ"
@Tom Drew that‚Äôs a lie I can watch yt outside the app while doing other things and I have iphone
Mine does? I‚Äôm able to leave yt and watch my videos still and do other things like play games and text people and I also have iphone
Its already 2022 but still Im stuck with android. Hoping I can already finish my study so that I can already have work and can buy apple phone so that I can also catch up with ios updates.
Can I download this new ios
This is by far the best update of IOS
I got an iPhone and I regret it. Feels like IOS is a watered down android.
Me watching this video on my 2years vivo y12
"Keyboard needs an update the numbers on top instead tapping the 123,"
"to me it seems like the great feature of it is this ""partially covering the time"" on the lock screen"
2:02 üòè
?
does voice recorder still take whole screen when locked?
Where can I find that Oakland Tribune wallpaper?!?
"When you are in middle of replying someone on whatsapp from the locksreen, and they send another message there is no way to check the new message unless you delete what you were typing and start replying again on new message."
There no upgrade fam
"I bet $100 Apple will remove webcams from MacBook designs after iOS16, giving you even less hardware, but asking for the same price. It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm sure we will all be so happy renting iPhones anyway."
"Thank you for that video. And yes, super cool intro!"
Don‚Äôt works on my iPhone ‚Ä¶.
The only feature i was waiting for is the face id in Landscape mode. It feels so irritiating when your playing or watching content in landscape and when it gets locked we were forces to turn pur device in potrait mode
can't wait for my iphone 14 pro
Android phones still have better and cooler features from the past then the new apple do now still with the new ios 16
I have an Iphone 7 so I wont get it :(
"Im 14 too, but i got an iPhone 13"
@Ram Casino I can't. I'm only 14 and my parents won't get me a new phone. They won't even let me buy a new phone with my OWN money. I have enough but they are so strict. I'm hoping my Iphone 7 breaks soon. I've had it since it came out.
"Get a newer iPhone like the iPhone 11 so you can get it, its only $499"
i think i'll be switching to ios
I like almost any content you create for us
So it‚Äôs pretty much an android? Like androids have had this for years now
Brothers and sisters where can I get the MagSafe holder?
I love iOS 16. I have an iPhone SE 2
"thank God now Android lock screen widgets will reemerge, thanks Apple"
They're finally releasing some original stuff and not copying android. This is very good üëè
Hehe he mentioned our discord üòé
He introooo?????? Litttt
An ‚ÄúApple-grade‚Äù intro
The same people that were hating on Android are now saying how good this update is even tho all the ‚Äúcustomization‚Äù has been part of android for over 10 years.
Not updated to always on display is a joke on this update
Can you explain to me why there is still no Touch ID on the screen? I‚Äôve been stuck on the iPhone 8 because of this reason. I really dislike the Face ID.
Contact üëÜüëÜüëÜ him he will help you out
"Nothing new to look here . As an apple user I hate the old tactics apple uses over and over again over the years ; adding one by one feature android phones has had for more than 10 years ago isn‚Äôt innovative, it‚Äôs laziness, but apple is very well protected with all these so call YouTubers ‚Äúcelebrities ‚Äú like this guys that  claps like seals ü¶≠ for every stupid thing apple copy from android. Pathetic!!"
IOS keeps getting better with these updates
Amazing share

Could you tell me where I can get the Belkin Mount please?
Does it have fingerprint?
iPhone has finally made it to the big leagues. They take forever to implement software but when they do they do it RIGHT! I looooove the fact they stole live/animated wallpapers from Xiaomi. It‚Äôs not as great as ‚ÄúSuper Wallpapers‚Äù but still very nice nonetheless.
"That webcam feature might be good for people looking to start streaming, making videos."
no time stamps!
those landscape face id mode finally apple did it!
Best iOS yet

Big support for the channel and keep on making awesome content and guides and giveaways in the future as well. Worked for me
The text thing is on my iPad and I don‚Äôt have iOS 16‚Ä¶
That Intro was amazing
Holy fuck this update is amazing
So people with iPhone 7 won‚Äôt get this update ‚òπÔ∏è
"Some amazing improvements. However, the youtube app still cannot be played on Lock like the music app. This I believe is crucial because once you lock your phone, youtube stops! it‚Äôs the little things like this that also improves usability!"
"@notstarboard ah, I see. I don‚Äôt have premium but I though this could have been a basic feature from the app"
Isn't this a YouTube Premium feature? Can you not do this on iOS even with Premium?
Does it have system wide dark mode? Eepecially on the internet browser?
"I have been using the iOS16 Dev Betas since beta 1. I am on beta 3 now (the second version, if you're on the betas you know what I mean... they released ios16 beta 3 twice. The second version brought the full screen artwork for music on lock screen). I absolutely love ios16 but dev beta 3 has some major battery drain. Using iPhone 13 Pro Max."
This is working without any problems guys
yeah its working for me thanx for this video
Leave it to apple to sell a 1400.00 webcam and a laptop with a notch to compliment it. Greed solving a problem always
Amrani big hole
I 've been searching the whole youtube to find a solution and get around this
Super fast and easy tutorial
where did you buy the phone ring??
This is working without any problems guys
thank you so much for sharing this method with !
Good method
Thank you for the share
I followed every step as you showed in the video and i'm very surprised by how this hack works! Thank You!
"I Blinked, Lost a lot, ended up watching multiple times"
Thanks for the share
niiiiiigaaaaa)
#2 wasn‚Äôt Apples idea. They just sherlocked it out from Camo app. Poor dudes.
I recently switched to iPhone 13 pro max  I was pissed I couldn‚Äôt change the clock or the color I like this future update  when should we expect this to be released ??
Intro video was awesome!
I Don't like notch display
I love how YouTube finally added pip not a ios16 feature but it‚Äôs lit
where did you get that phone holder for continues camera
Apple products are all junk -- idiot's favorite.
"Even though I have an iPhone 7 Plus and won't be getting rid of it anytime soon, thus won't be able to take advantage of any of those features, one that I definitely would NOT use is the haptic feedback keyboard.  I've used my friend's Android phone from time to time, and I can't stand the haptic feedback (which is a little surprising since I use a mechanical keyboard with my iMac).  But the rest of the features do look and sound like they could be pretty useful.  Will have to see what new features, if any, will work on my phone (which I won't be upgrading anytime soon, in fact, I'm getting the battery replaced tomorrow, so I'm planning of keeping it for a few more years)."
"ok, i have an 8 and i still dont have alot of these features, especially the photo/text thing that lets u isolate elements. feels like iphone is starting to brick my phone to force an upgrade from me üò§"
"They have taken away the old wall papers and the new ones look and feel like android ones. 
Ios is kind off ‚Äúloosing its charm‚Äù
They did the same with mac os. I miss my old styling of apple operating systems.
We miss jobs. Gaycook has taken away the aura from apple.
See how macbooks turned so ugly and fat recently."
"seems like ios copies android and extends things to 10 years 
so every year oh new sht comes up huaray,, (was on android 5year ago)"
"I hope apple updates maps, Google maps allows you to interact with your music while in the app. I wish apple would allow you to do that with maps and Apple Music or maps and any music app"
It seems like black magic lol
get an android that does all that 4 years ago xD
Lowkey looks like a good update
#4 is going to put photoshop out of business
"Cool wallpapers, where can I get them ?"
"Weird question, could the iPhone ‚Äúwebcam‚Äù can be used for a streaming webcam?"
"where ""Hi MKBHD here""..?"
A screen customization???really???this its a paid review right?
3 out 5 features already found on Android. But the live object and the camera feature are pretty üî•üî•üî•
"No Soundtracks Sound effects or whatever, just Listening to your Voice and what you Show. Thats extremely calm and gives me a relaxing watch experience tho. I really enjoyed watching and listening to this Video. thumbs up."
"i like your phone, can i get it"
You also can add cvc to the saved cards
That intro though. Fire!
"I don't know why.. but when I pick up an Android phone, the UI just feels like a fisher-price version compared to iOS..."
I hate the undo. STAND ON YOUR WORDS
How about they let YouTube minimize the screen when you leave the app. Because of this I regret switching from Samsung
Android
What wonderful new features it definitely wasn‚Äôt in Samsung for like since 2018
The video editing looks fabulous
Fuck iOS 16. Make all the older iPhones laggy to urge people buy their new phones. Extortion strategy
"After deciding they were willing to confuse grandmothers everywhere by letting people add serifs and color to their clock fonts, it amazes me Apple still hasn't figured out how to put apps and folders on any part of the home screen."
Will they ever let you change the font without jailbreaking your iPhone
So glad I can finally edit and delete messages lol
Great so now people can threaten people and harass them and delete it right after to prevent people from capturing it to report to police
Watchin this on androidü•≤
not me with an iphone 7
"What's New on the iPhone,  üëâ the same dam thing since iPhone 4s....nothing new. Time to throw the iPhone in the üóë"
Can‚Äôt you delete normal messages already?
"I love how ""customizing your phone"" is a feature of an update in 2022 but it's a feature I had on my java enabled nokia phone in 2003. Nice work Apple."
I can see some people having different pictures of their ‚Äúloved ones‚Äù based on which house they‚Äôre at
I think apple killed jailbreak lmao
I remember when iPhones weren‚Äôt customizable at all and it was just a dream
iOS still sucks
I have iphone 13 pro max and Samsung S22 Ultra and most of those features Samsung has been using for years except the delete the unsent the message but Apple still wont feature the always on display so you need to wait for another phone/year to have it.
Currently I‚Äôm living in UAE and I‚Äôm using an iPhone 12 pro max. But my current software update is 15.5! How comes you guys have iOS 16??!
I guess you're starting to catch up with Android.
"That vast majority of iOS QOL improvements fall into the category of ""it's about damn time apple."" They're such solid improvements because they're usually way overdue."
Still unable to remove background apps with one press
Face ID working in landscape is an amazing touch.
‚ÄòLive Objects‚Äô is mind blowing! So excited and stoked about this feature!
"I would like to see a feature, which ""disables"" the Lockscreen (automatically does Face ID) and you don't have to swipe up to unlock your Phone. I use an Android and i love this. I pick my Phone up and it is automatically unlocked and turns automatically it's screen on"
The live objects feature looks really cool and very good except for around the hair but that takes a really long time doing it yourself so for it only taking a couple of seconds it is an amazing feature
"So much talk about the most usleless thing like lock screen, and its #1 for you? really?"
"Not sure I understood the edit messaging part. So basically you could say "" oh shit I killed my neighbor"" ,to "" i love my neighbor"" just before you get arrested? In case that might incriminate you.
I'm open for a debate"
i hope they allow for complete customization of certain app widgets. For example I really dislike the new spotify/music lockscreen widget but really like the timer one. Maybe in the not so distant future we can expect to see individual settings for each app?
"It's the year 9056 the earth is dying, human race is moving to another planet called plannet Z, enter MKBHD, "" hello MKBHD here, so I've been in planet Z for a month now"""
The lock screen looks EXACTLY like Android nowü§Ø
"Seriously KILLER intro, guys. I'm floored. I love coming from other videos and getting that feeling. **Shia applause gif*

Also, I've been an android die-hard for a long time. iOS is so close to calling my name. So close, and Google's Pixel 6 Pro bombing hard with their software is another nail in the coffin for me. They dropped the ball hard and I'm sick of this phone. Like Samsung's but they also have their own problems too. I'm almost ready to welcome iPhone problems.

One more thing; I will be forever grateful to you guys for introducing me to Alltta and their individual talents as well. üôå"
"This feature look Kool that you can take any object from any picture and place it wherever you want, such as in WhatsApp messages. I also like the camera capability to view objects that is place lying in front your laptop with your phone place on the laptop bezel."
Please I have problems with my payment method I can‚Äôt change the default one and I can‚Äôt add a new one‚Ä¶ Am from Nigeria
so we‚Äôre no longer able to have a lockscreen AND wallpaper ?
There are so many unique features in the S22 Ultra which never get such in-depth coverage.
"Typical Apple. Having their costumers use their phones to ruin the battery instead of just building in better cams to their laptops in the first place. I like the lock screen stuff, looking forward to that as well as the taptic feedback."
mark ass brownie
The continuity camera feature was something I‚Äôve been hoping for üôåüèº
"Finally, the public beta is out for us to try!"
I have iphone 16 its cool
"the only feature i think is productive is the one where you can take the object out of an image , rest are basically not that practical and won't be used by everyone."
I just know some people aren‚Äôt going to update their phone so they can see peoples messages they unsend or edit. Or maybe I‚Äôm reaching and people aren‚Äôt that crazy
Am I the only one that‚Äôs now going to go download the beta regardless of the warning of bugs üêõ
"I wish you would tell us more about the photos update which allows us to make a shared library based on a subject. For instance photos with little ones from both parents phones merged in a one shared library on icloud rather than sending to each other photos,videos and have duplicated content on family shared icloud. For me that is the best feature as it gives us real use and less space used on cloud."
Wooohhhh that intro was just awesome üòé
"Still hoping for more freedome on my iPhone tho without having to jailbreak it. But hey, apple right."
Does anyone know when that Belkin phone mount will be available?
whats the charts on his t shirt represent?
Mark ass brownlee
They did get rid of the live wallpaper Tho
Interesting
"Installed ios 16 on my iphone 12 pro max but the face ID does not work for me in landscape, please let me know if it os for iphone 13s only ?"
"I‚Äôm most excited for iPhone 14, and mainly because they finally removed the notch on the Pro models. Im still using my iPhone XS Max from 2019 so I‚Äôm excited for a worthy upgrade. But also the copy paste imagines and editing texts is going to come in handy a lot"
@TreeNoox all good then
@RUBEN I never really got into the habit of using 3D Touch so it‚Äôs fine
"Get ready to lose 3D Touch tho. If you‚Äôve been using it a lot when you write (cursor, copy/paste) you‚Äôre gonna have ‚Äúlearn‚Äù to live without it. 

It was pretty annoying for me after 6-7 years of using it daily"
Does anyone have the link for the wallpaper he used in 8:26. I looks like the Transamerica Pyramid but I cant find the exact wallpaper
Can I get a t-shirt with that that intro sequence on it?
I wonder how much the haptic keyboard will decrease battery life? It‚Äôll be interesting to see if Apple includes haptic feedback usage in the battery usage calculations.
They need to make the images from pics that you copy into texts smaller. They are waaayyy to big and get cut off.
Apple is the best!!! Buy stop making this guy rich
Okay i want it. Now
Camera for Mac and desk view got me
I like that apple is trying new things and some of them i want to be added to android at some point. But... it still doesnt compare to the features you get on a flagship samsung lol the smart widget is by far the most useful widget integration ive seen! i use it all the time the ability to have 4 widgets in one is amazing!
@Burb sorry 2 years üòÖ but they only became interactive a year ago or less or am i wrong?! Wtf is the point at the beginning if they werent  interactive?! ü§£ü§£
@jon ludwig years*
@RUBEN year*
apple added Smart Widgets years ago
Ok so all the the majority of updates are basically things you have been able to do for 20 years on Andriod? Well played Apple
I still have the Iphone 7 plus :(
best iOS update in quite a while
I still can‚Äôt get landscape Face ID to work. I‚Äôm on a XR. Does it only support newer devices?
"All great changes, can't wait."
mark ass brownie
Why I don‚Äôt have iOS 16 update ?
Will i get this update on my iphone 6?
Still no split screen
"The camera continuity feature is really cool but most of these features android has already been doing. The lock screen customization is cool but android has alowed you to do that for a long time, and it doesn't stop at the lock screen. I love that I can customize almost every aspect of how my phone functions and looks on android which is a big reason why I won't switch to iphone any time soon. If apple let you put custom launchers, allow you to customize widgets, the look of app icons with built in gestures, etc, I'd probably be on board."
Can‚Äôt wait for the new iOS
"Thanks for watching and commenting 
Message right away I have something huge for you üëÜüëÜüöÄüöÄ"
It looks like Android phone this new livery. I dont like it.
"Thanks for watching and commenting 
Message right away I have something huge for you üëÜüëÜüöÄüöÄ"
"I am disappointed the wallpaper must be the same photo as the lock screen, unless I am wrong and don‚Äôt know how to do it‚Ä¶"
The last phone manufacturer which made me go wow was Nokia.
Markass brownie
I‚Äôm still struggling with widgets on the Home Screen üòÖ I‚Äôm never satisfied with how it looks or how useful they are in my day to day.
Is haptic feedback on the keyboard that big of a deal?
I can‚Äôt find where to turn on the haptic feedback for the keyboard? I‚Äôm not getting it or finding it.
Will it be available on xr
Does continuity camera work with iPad
"8:36
wait, is that Lego DJI drone legit? is it a Lego prodoct? does it fly? looks so neat!!!"
Love your videos
CAN WE GET THE FAKE AMERWUELESEUSESE SBOWNWEKEWNENE ACCOUNT???
I hate the unsend option. People need to accept the truth of what they send.
HAPTIC KEYBOARD!!!! OMFG THIS IS THE BIGGEST GAMECHANGER; IM FUCKING DONE WITH ANDROID!!!!
I‚Äôm so disgusted with you saying 24 fps is the worst framerate marcus
"How about being able to set a ringtone for saved contacts, instead of from not saved numbers, without having to set a ""custom"" ringtone for every individual contact?"
U are great :)
"Apple is so slow on these changes. I'm waiting for a true font changer, icon minimizer and especially to fill that blank space under the keyboard. Then i'll stop jailbreaking."
The lock screen is a big deal. When is the update coming? Can't wait!
does continuity camera work with ipad? meaning ipad instead of macbook
mark ass brownie
"Repent and Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will obtain eternal life. 

Glory to God our Father"
"I do have a question, how do you use live photos on lock screens if you hold on to it to edit it?"
the update uis pretty nice but since its beta it has alot of issues for me. Wallpaper turning black. Ramdom spots on my screen freezing or turning puple. Time not changing and just not unlocking the phone. I had to revert to 15 and Im gonna wait for the release some time next or more months
‚ÄúTop 5 features on ios16!‚Äù *talks about every feature in iOS 16*
Edit is huge for me! I always have typos
Personally i think every phone should have a driver app for long drives when ever if one's eyes closes an auto alarm starts in car
That weather icon in the background tho
Very good update!!!
"And still can't ""customize"" the ringtone :D"
Mark ass brownie
meh
Excellent video. I learned a lot.
"With this newest update, this is the first time I might actually consider getting an iphone"
Wow so much customization!! Looks like iPhone is finally catching up to Android üòõ
"Hey, where do you get the Belkin mount that he uses in this video for the top of the Mac?"
No app lock option ??
So still no multitasking‚Ä¶. Smdh
Hey Marques what's your daily driver?
Y‚Äôall truly are the GOAT! The whole team needs their ass ate!

I rarely watch you. But when I do I always enjoy the experience!!
"We have truly come full circle in terms of smartphone OS'es. I remember being able to fully customize my lockscreen on Android years ago, then Google took it away some years ago. And now, in 2022, Apple is adding it back in. Now just to wait before Google remembers they used to offer this level of customization."
Thanks for the video. I love the new ios 16 personally!
iOS 16 looks amazing wtf. Im blown away
Which iPhone u using currently???
And yet in all these years we still don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúpinch to close an app‚Äù feature or ‚Äúswipe to delete a contact‚Äù. It‚Äôs so tedious to delete a single contact and even more tiresome to delete multiple contacts.
love that they took lockscreen editing mechanic from watchos
Apple does so much but wont add the battery percentage on the top right corner with iPhone's with notches
I've been a note and ultra user for years. I'm going to be going to iphone this year when the new iPhone comes out.
I still don‚Äôt understand why Apple still don‚Äôt have a pause button when filming. It would save a whole lot of time editing especially as I‚Äôm an actor that has to do a lot of self tapes and a pause button would help massively.
"I hope they fix picture distortion because my iPhone 13 takes pixelated photos when you zoomed in. 
If any tips regarding this will be appreciated üôÇ"
"The iPhone 13 doesn't have a telephoto camera as far as I know. That means any zoom is just digital zoom, so of course it's going to be pixelated."
Still no always-on display???
It would be epic if you could add emergency contacts to the widgets on lockscreen that can be accessed without unlocking the phone.

"""bUt AnDRoid HaD thIs foR T3N yEaRs""... yeah, but it was implemented poorly and odds are the phone it was installed half-assed the hardware part of it."
"Whoa, didn't know Apple didn't have a haptic keyboard, that's super weird."
I hope we will be able to have Locket widget on the lock screen
"Usually, there aren't many things that I'm envious of when it comes to Apple products, but this gimmick involving cutting out objects from photos is amazing!"

Shit update iphone is a lie
They way the clock went from 4:59 to 5:00. So satisfying lol
Why are some features no available for iOS 16
Finally a good weather app
Not a fan of the new Home Screen. People are absolutely going to accidentally edit them all the time
"Lots of useless incrementalism.  Yes,  during NYC‚Äôs 1964 world fair futurists predicted that by the year 2000 we‚Äôd have: cities on the moon, cancer cured, flying cars, hunger eradicated, free atomic energy, and the list goes on.   Instead in 2022 we have:  free Internet porn and the ability to buy Chinese mfg crap by slave labor,  American fascism alive and well, Uber enabled rides via quasi-slave labor, in America more mass shootings than days in the year, social meeting as the main vehicle in enabling the overthrow of fragile democracies, and the list goes on.   And yes, I‚Äôm typing this message on an iPhone device that was mfg with quasi-slave labor.   Way to go humanity!"
I don't think the live text/object will work on older iPhones that support iOS 16
what about the new apple carplay feature
Apple is amazing
When is it releasing?
#4 - copying an object from a photo does not work for me. Using a iPhone 8 plus.
Welcome to Android world
"I love how everything except using the camera as a webcam, Android has had enabled for years..  lol"
They will really do anything to avoid video or animated lock screens.
I have a 7 plus I won‚Äôt get this):
sounds like Microsoft Teams :-)
"Is IOS 16 an update available or is it a phone you have to buy, I‚Äôm really confused‚Ä¶."
"hands down, the timer on the lock screen is the most useful feature. Cooking steaks I use the timer on my apple watch, but I'd rather it be on my phone :D great review!"
"That top down view is so sick, love it üòç"
Im sorry i luffed at if the other person isnt in ios16 yet they wont see the edit or unsend theyd still see everything.... the sender on the other hand has all the confidence thought he got it figured outü§£
Can you remove the flashlight option on homescreen?
"apple reached ios 16 and I still dont have I phone, ...................... big loss to apple"
great video once again :)
I don't think the live text/object will work on older iPhones that support iOS 16
Very informative video. Fantastic video production. Keep up the good work.
Hasn‚Äôt reached üá∫üá¨ yet
"Yeah we have the continuity camera on the Mac, so why don‚Äôt Apple just remove that insane notch on the new Mac? It‚Äôs really ugly in my opinion"
Android is still betterü•±
"DO NOT UPDATE, update 15.5 already makes the camera not function for the 0.5x lens."
Let‚Äôs goooo we can finally mess with our Lock Screen!
üçé is the üêê. üëê ‚¨áÔ∏è
intro is amazing bro
Damn that intro ü•µ
I'm going to learn how to code because that phone as webcam thing was a concept I've dreamed about since like 2012.
I‚Äôm so excited for this update. More customization is always welcome!
@Solemn Modz u know apple hates jailbreaking
@Vilgax oh boy
But theres no way he said the top thing in ios 16 is customisability that android has had for ages. The top thing should be something fresh
"@Wubi 
The inventors of those tweaks CARE, iSheep."
"I would call this a ""Reachability Update"" good stuff."
Sick intro. The update sounds nice! But is anyone else hoping the new iPhone will have USB type C port?
They discontinuing the 7+?  Man am so devastated

Picture thing is crazy
is there any chance of always on display for the new ios or is it still android exclusive?
Will the live object thing available for iPhone 8?
‚Äú Androids are more *customizable* ‚Äú - üòÇüòÇüòÇ I can‚Äôt wait to hear somebody say that again.
Can you add the Apple Music widget onto the lock screen in the iOS 16 beta update?
"2:07 has me like: Get outta here man, no way, c'mon, this can't be real lol"
Does the timer app hold multiple active timers at once?
I‚Äôm starting to become impatient.

great thinking apple. works only if the other person also has iOS 16. I still don't see the point in iMessages when there're far better messengers such as the one that starts with T for example
Samsung's Goodlock offers so much it's criminal
Sick intro!
Thanks!

"@marques you are constantly making excuses for mac hardware, yet you say apple has the best.  it's a contradiction..  Common you are putting a phone on the top of your laptop because they couldn't be arsed putting a good camera in the laptop.  this is utterly mind blowingly deluded.  get over the mac addiction man and call it what it is, ridiculous"
Steve Jobs would be crawling in his grave looking at that lock screen!
"ok i know this is not a video about pixel but i need to know, is it normal for the pixel 5a 5g to get hot while using the camera app?"
Great vid as per usual üòâ 4:00 Haptic Keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è will that not eat into your battery? Can you share so info on this please.
Android users hit a like
"the virtual top down view would be very useful for class, i love this magic. and im not the type of person to customize home screen widgets, but im definitely have 8 lock screens with this new update."
MAn I got iPhone 7 :(
"Man #4 Live Objects is really useful, Great Feature"
This is one hell of an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù haha it‚Äôs like getting a new phone damn near!
"Apple maps doesn't show the Peak District, I want to see the national park but I have to go to google maps to see the outline."
The fact that Apple can't manage to fit decent webcams to their laptops is just embarrassing
So now we get one camera on hunter biden and one on the crack scale!
meh
Samsung has all of it decades ago
It is probably the lock screen customization is probably my favourite it would be cool if they added moving lock screen so stuff in your lock screen to move it‚Äôs so annoying how they don‚Äôt have it do you know why they don‚Äôt have stuff at a moving in the lock screens like outer animated
"6:07 About the webcam feature, as soon as he says ""works pretty well"" , I've noticed the fingers are very distorted. One looks very short which doesn't make sense...
Might be the angle too, though."
How you managed to to have  IOS 16 and it‚Äôs not released yet ?
Can you do a comparison of how it looks and how the functions work on the older iphone models?  maybe till iphone x at least.
"Had a 13 Pro Max for about 5 months and yes the way they work alongside my iPad is really good and some of the software is very very good.
However can someone at Apple please go get a S21 or newer Samsung and learn how proper gesture controls should work.
Apple gestures are simply useless, back only works from the left (ridiculous if you use right hand) of and then the back gesture just stops working and you‚Äôve deleted an email, just crap. 

Let‚Äôs not even mention the fact that the back glass is about as fragile as a fragile thing on a fragile Friday.

Cone on Apple you can do so much better with the actual iPhone"
the little things really do make big impressions
New to this channel üëç
Apple better consult MKBHD editors for the next promos.
but can we finally use videos as wallpapers?
I don‚Äôt like the new iOS. Sadly seems they are following androids path lol

The imessage part is finally here!
"Getting more and more Android-like, but I get it. Androids are awesome."
This intro was......... ü§îuhhhh amazing üòÖhaha
iOS update does bring some useful features.  But why don‚Äôt they thought about battery drained. Many people found their phone battery is ruined by the update. I am really bummed out.
How you get the beta
"Haptic keyboard prob is a battery drain, no? And the foreground loading before background doesn‚Äôt sound like a nice touch, it sounds like lag to me"
What the heck is wrong with facetime. So frustrating
Continuity camera would be nice for the iPad Pro 12.9 to compensate for poor placement of the built in front facing camera
"I'm seriously excited about the haptic keyboard. It's something I've always wanted to have, and it will make a little keyboard like mine (12 mini) so much more tactile to use."
That second feature is really helpful for editing
Bro‚Ä¶ What an intro
Still not coming AON display?
"apple fan boy again
apple just think about money
trash company
1000$ for stand 
no charger
not type c usb
not finger print"
The message app is Joke here in India. My msgs don‚Äôt get delivered in 99% of the time. It always gets failed‚Ä¶ poor
Ehhh Seams a little too gimmicky
What is with the audio? Why there is a constant hum noise?
"This is a long shot, but are the colored circles on the top left of the thumbnail XLR IDs?"
"Grandpa: ""We used to have to trace things in photoshop by hand!!""
""Lets get you to bed grandpa.."
Where is M2 macbook air video??? I cant wait to see ya. All utuber are already uploded but u dont..why?
iPhone is catching up with Android features.
"I've had the beta for a while. It's been working surprisingly well, and I now have it on almost all my devices.

IMPORTANT: I had a issue where it was asking me to verify the family organizers Apple Card. Every time I tried to verify, nothing happened. I eventually solved the issue by downgrading my iPad to iOS 15."
@GabrielF11 I don't get why it's so hard for them to bring always on display
@Michael L Nope. I wish.
Is there always on display?
@GabrielF11 oh ok thanks !!
"Can we finally get a battery manager app
Where we can see Bluetooth devices connected to it in real time
And also show the exact battery percentage on let‚Äôs say a JBL or Sony speaker 
And also show if it‚Äôs charging
We need a brilliant apple engineered battery manager app"
So excited
Like the new Features but i wish Apple bring the AOD to the 13 Pro(Max). I know that will probably not happen.
And still no AOD... üòÇ
"""not stable enough for main yet""
me running all betas as every chance i've ever gotten over the years and have been perfectly fine even on first builds **"
When is 16 coming bro ?
I have a 8 plus I am so scared it‚Äôs coming for me
the intro was fab
what about youtube working even if you close the phone
Still the freedom is in the ANDROID.
Anyone has a URL to the Belkin magsafe clip?
You can now multitask with YouTube minimized!üôåüèΩ (Not sure if I stated that correctly) i was able to do this with my Samsung I had years ago. So happy it is on iOS 16!!!!!
Can we get a audio slider so when ur on FaceTime and u are watching YouTube you can fine tune ur audio to hear the video over your FaceTime call ¬ø androids had this years ago
I love my iPhone 7 üò≠
Are they coming out with any new Ringtones or Alert tones? Have not had any new ones in years.
Could you test if you can use continuity camera for a FaceTime call whilst airplay mirroring your mac screen to a big TV? is there any audio issues? could we finally see Apple TV use this feature for FaceTime on your TV?
car play??
This is nice and all but when is apple finally going to give us live widgets and let us freely move apps around on the screen? That‚Äôs all I want left
damn your videos are so crystal clear i feel like i can walk into the tv and shake your hand lol.
Was gonna send my ex a very angry dick pic. Thanks for the heads up
i swear apple has a doc full of features they're just gonna slowly rollout when they feel like lol
The haptic keyboard is awesome
"My is that no more those st!@# ballons info about 20% battery... oh, wait."
"It seems that Apple, as well as iPhone owners, like Android, but I don't know that yet. üòÅ"
checking the weather at parties is gonna be even better now
When is the public release for 16?
But still cannot move apps anywhere you want!
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve more excited about an update
That intro‚Ä¶ my mouth dropped
"It's not always about who does it first or for a long time, it's about who perfects it, rather almost perfects it."
"Can anyone access those widgets if screen is locked?  Because I know right now usually when your phone is locked, the only thing that someone can access is the flashlight and the camera to take new pics. That‚Äôs how I like my phone to be, hopefully IOS 16 doesn‚Äôt change this ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÆüò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞üò∞ü•π"
Haptic feedback is actually #1. That is a HUGe feature and will completely change the typing experience. Great to have this on IOS!
Ë∞¢Ë∞¢‰Ω† Â§™Ê£í‰∫Ü

I think this is it guys. I'm finally ready to switch to iPhone.
nothing newüòÅ...android has it for years...good job apple in copying android
If users still can‚Äôt change the damn icon skins then iOS still sucks
I'd like to bet that apple will soon get rid of webcams on their laptops (not ipads)
The future is exciting.
why not make the macbook camear better to begin with?
"THINGS I WANT IN MY IPHONE ASAP!! (They either had it or need to have it) 

1.  Keyboard hovering over other text. - I HATE YOU HAVE TO HOLD ON THE TEXT- can‚Äôt even see it with your fat finger where you are trying to hover the text placement. LOVED IT WHEN IT WAS ON THE KEYBOARD - you would just hold the keyboard and scroll left or right to Land where you wanted on the text placement. 

2. MAPS. are so ad invasive. I want the old map where it shows where I need to go with detail -INSTEAD OF BEING MAPPED AND SHOWING CRAP PLACES IM NOT GOING BIGGER THAN THE STREET NAME. 

3. Apple Music needs QUEQE On songs you want to be next but not disturb the current playlist you have. I HATE THEIR PLAYLIST OPTIONS - I don‚Äôt want apple options I want actual users. The reason why‚Ä¶. When you start a radio they just don‚Äôt get it right."
this phone is amazing. i have an unboxing video on my channel of my white iPhone 13 pro max. 10/10 stars.
Had to revert. Too many bugs to deal with.
"My favorite feature is that when media is playing and you press the cover art on the lockscreen, it becomes the spotlight and everything takes its color."
Still no am and pm by the time? Lol
"8:51
Hey,
'ever Android user here,
How does this 'associating thing' for work/gym/sleep get 'associated' exactly?
How does it switch profiles like that; and apart form the lock screen, is there any other places we can see this happen?"
"So, anyone else testing the beta think they are grabbing their phone upside down, now that the cards are coming from the bottom?"
That was cool..
So tht feature of erasing a message won't work on android

"Hi man, I am actually see the whole size of music when there is the Lock Screen, is not as your in the video. How can I change the size"
Top-notch intro.
"So basically more and more like an Android, without Apple admitting it. If you are going to be like that, Apple, at least add split screen multitasking, like the HTC i have for more than 5 years now......"

Whats anyone actually using the live objects for
I think smartphone makers aren't innovative anymore. Or maybe these devices have reached their peak. Nothing here that's adding any value to the day to day running of the smartphone
About time apple users get the haptic feedback when typing
"As an android user, I would say that Google forgot what made Android great in the first place, and that is the visual customization. There is not enough focus on the visuals now compared with revolutionary ideas Android had to offer in its humble beginnings."
Its actually crazy that the iphone 8 still supports this version
iOS 16 is looking good.
"not really like Apple had the idea, look at DroidCam, available for both Android and Apple but the app is a bit tricky, now Apple got the already existing idea and bump it through the ceiling by incorporating it to their ecosystem"
This is a pretty insane update.
"Apple 10 years later ""alright lets do some android shit.."""
I‚Äôm shocked that there is STILL no ‚Äúkill all apps‚Äù button or gesture. I could safely say I‚Äôve probably wasted hours of my life swiping and closing apps individually. I know you can use multiple fingers but it‚Äôs still a hassle
Just switched from android to Apple again and I am so happy about the lock screen customization and change in notification pop ups
"Marques, you had it for a month already?  Tell me something new"

IOS 16 hasn‚Äôt released yet for the public
"Are these features better because Apple refined them or because it's Apple, lock screen feature is standard on Android smartphones. Is IOS better than android and why?. I prefer IOS but sometimes I miss Android."
üî•üî•üî•üî•
"Good features, but I'm still waiting for that always on display. It's a very convenient and helpful thing to have."
I really dont get that. Dont miss it
does it finally have a freakin haptic when person answers your call?
"#5 lol....that should be standard feature on every bloody messaging app and not something ios16 whatnot 
#4 now this is interesting and is already too late to the party. This should have been a thing for several years now, but you know, corporate attitude give less and less ask more and more
#2 Yup, that is sick . I am amazed of that thing.
#1 lol Fing LOL. Welcome apple many many years later to what android has been doing. This should be put on the hall of shame because of the hypocrisy apple kept spewing they do not do customisation, is a simple os nothng else because their customers blah blah blah BS. Scammer company is scammer and idiots buying Apple products allowed it to happen."
I don't even have iOS but I like the editing and his videos lol
Will continuity camera work with intel macs?  Looking to use on a 2019 MacBook Pro.  Thanks
The only update they need is USB-C!
mark ass brownie
Sick intro! Had to replay a bunch of times
Can you use the webcam thing on windows too?
Bro the message theme I was just saying I need to get that chance to delete a message.
that intro üî•
"for music, you can also have the album art ‚Äútake over‚Äù your lock screen !!"
"As soon as I saw that the first public beta was released, I instantly installed it on my main (and only capable) iPhone. No regrets thusfar, even with the few bugs I've already encountered. I'm just sad the the webcam function only works on a Mac, because I don't use my mid-2012 MBP any more and have switched to a gaming laptop with windows and linux. ;("
"@Night Wing It isn't sadly. The newest officially supported version is Catalina. I have tried running Big Sur or Monterey (can't remember which) via some unofficial tools, but I just don't have enough ram to do so comfortably, so I downgraded back to Catalina. I look forward to the day when I finish university, get a proper job and maybe can finally afford a cool mac again :)"
I have the same gen macbook as yours and i don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs supported as it can‚Äôt update to newer os versions anymore.
Deskview and Live Text are the best most useful gamechanger to me.
Android users were terrified of the day where apple adds more customization to their devices....uh oh
when does ios 16 will officaly announced?
GREAT VIDEO as usual! I‚Äôve been watching you for years! üòç
When‚Äôs IOS 16 will be released in Canada?
No. 2 makes me feel very concerned us to what have cellphone manufacturers been able to look at for the past 10 years‚Ä¶because it is only software and not hardware!
Nothing special. Pro camera mode is what would be great.
Its just genius
Do you have links to these cool wallpapers for the background clocks?
"Android user here that used to say would never buy an iPhone because even though they were powerful and reliable, they were too basic and boring for me and my family. After seeing this, makes me want to jump into apple eco system (I hope my family don't see this üò∂). Btw, killer intro"
Needs an always on display. The main thing I miss about my samsung
"Wtf apple didn't have a haptic  keyboard ?

Also amazing how much more customized apple is now. And how this lock screen stuff has been around for so long.

The phone as a webcam is cool. But why not just make good webcams. So odd. Fixing their own problem and making it look futuristic."
That‚Äôs hard
There‚Äôs no reason to have an android anymore
Question üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èwhen  I download the beta when the public release comes out for everyone I just update my phone and it goes to the most updates software out for the public ?
Any idea when the Belkin iPhone Mount will become available to everyone?!?
Hi
"Are you guys really so happy about ""lock screen"" features? Damn apple fan boys are built different. 
This is literally what a single developer can do over a month.. üòí"
Ios16 and there‚Äôs still no undo button for editing the Home Screen
It only took them forever..
I thought this was Jidion
I can‚Äôt wait
Oh my.. those intros are getting better and better!!!!
OMGGG
What an incredible intro!!!! I‚Äòm losing it right now
"Basically if you have an iPhone 8 don't update cuz they WILL be targeting your phone to shut that Boi down so you upgrade. Apple: ""well ya know phones just sit down after awhile."" Bitch this Nokia 2 has been going strong since 2004 fck are you talking about."
just came here to watch the inttro
Please make it possible to change the snooze time
Where do we find that continuity camera mount you used?
Laughs in android
Apple is top !
Please review the M2 macbook Air
I‚Äôm on iOS 14.3 and have had all these features (besides camera stuff) and more thanks to Unc0ver üòÇ
"When you click on the music cover pic on the Lock Screen it changes the Lock Screen background, super cool."
I have a doubt now.. does ios 16 still support the live wallpaper theme.? Coz I really love it
I have an IPhone XS and iOS 16 is pretty good
You didn‚Äôt have to snap on the intro like that
Dude they should just called this Android 16 lol
"These are cool changes and updates, but all I want is the ability to schedule  text messages and iMessages to send at specific times like you can do in the Google message app. I really miss that feature from my Android phone."
Does the landscape Face ID work with devices older than the 13?
They need to work more on iMessage
"Man... as android user this made me want that new IOS now. Tbh, I've always said it not only my close friends but also to my family that I really hate IOS and Iphone (stemmed on my frustrations on using Itunes and Iphone 4 before)... because of that I use Android for almost entirely of my life but now... with this updated IOS that has some shades from Android but still retaining itself as Iphone like always... I might consider myself coming back as being an Iphone user after 5 yrs since then."
Did you say muschi?? ü§£ that is pussy in german
Und zweiten wenn man sowas sagt man gar nicht vielleicht hast du keinen Respekt von anderen Menschen gar nicht

"jokes on you, i made it my main and now i look silly"
"I think if iPhone could just duplicate android functionality exactly, most customers would exhale in relief, and applaud apple for finally figuring it out."
As the jailbreaking dies down more and more Apple is running out of what to lift from Cydia lol. They're really digging the bottom of the barrel to lift LockHTML as a highlight OS feature lmfao.
Still no super wallpaper?
Nothing big ha
Ik I'm 3 days late but the easter egg was the notebook in the back that has xvi implying 16 for ios 16
"Love watching these MKBHD videos, knowing I'll probably never own an iphone. üòÖ"
Intro is insane
I agree the steam deck is trash
everything you've mentioned has been jailbreak tweaks for so long it's kinda crazy that apple is doing this now
jellyfish lockscreen
"I need that camera continuity/desk view feature. It would help me a lot. I've also installed iOS 16 on my phone and it runs pretty well. Does get pretty warm sometimes when I'm using new features so I hope that gets ironed out. All in all, I love the new look to the lock screen and can't really find anything wrong other than the temperature thing. I've also only had it for like a week so I'll edit this if this opinion changes drastically."
‚úåÔ∏è Anyone know where to buy that phone mount?
üòé I‚Äôm wondering where to buy the Belkin iPhone Mount.
@MoreContent if you don‚Äôt have any duplicates it won‚Äôt show up
@North y‚Äôall know why I can‚Äôt see the duplicate feature? Or how to make it appear I have iPhone 11
PUPPET!
"The magnet camera should have been without that stupid accessory. Only youtubers ""like"" Apple because they have to play the game.."
Does the new update affects battery performance?
"Well, if you turn on that haptic keyboard I'm sure your battery will be worse"
Amazing Animation and intro ‚Ä¶ just nailed it .. your team and you are working so hard .. i just love everything about your videos ‚Ä¶ from start till the end .. everything is interesting
Why would I want other people to experience more clarity with MY camera? I want other people to be more clear to benefit me.
"this man has a way of explaining everything in a way you are entertained, but also learn so much.
and it is AWESOME!"
"5. Message edit and unsend. Meh, other messengers had it for years. Who even uses iMessage anymore when you got Telegram
4. Pull picture out of the picture. Cool but useless imo
3. Weather, video player updates and other small things. Alr, cool
2. Use phone cam as webcam. Meh, prob requires a $100 dollar accessory (typical Apple mark-up), prob only works on mac, and what if someone calls you while you are streaming as a webcam? The top-down view feature is cool, good for taking product photos for e-commerce.
1. Lock screen customization. Meh, you must have a lot of extra time on your hands to adjust clock fonts lol"
That intro... WOW !!! amazing
"I wish they changed the icons too, it‚Äôs been years with the same icons!"
"I just want them to add RCS, is that too much to ask :(("
I see easy deep fakes happening as a result of this.
Apple iOS in 2022: we still don‚Äôt allow you to resize your icons.
We need built in call recorder feature
I have a 11 pro max. I thought about upgrading. But why? Since all of these features will come to my device. Well done Apple.
My fav was the dope intro your team has made!!!
Would be happy if Apple allows downloaded music to play in music app. Like we can use music app as music player without iTunes. Many countries don‚Äôt have iTunes. It‚Äôs difficult for us to play music in any other music players.
Love it!
I‚Äôm not sure about the new Lock Screen yet. Customizable features are always a plus but I think it looks too much like an Android Lock Screen and part of the attraction of iPhone is its distinctive font and style that lets you know it‚Äôs an iPhone
"That Live Object feature is unreal, like Star Trek levels of technology"
"I don‚Äôt care to play around with my phone anymore, so none of this matters to me. Especially when every damn day I have constant connectivity issues in which I have to turn the phone off or turn 5G on or off to get stupid crap like maps or google maps to LOAD."
"I have been using an iPhone (12) for the first time for about a month (my work phone). It has been an adjustment from Android. I have consistently watched Apple tout their new features like they're incredibly innovative for the last thirteen years. Android has had most of these features for years and Android does it better. Simple things like a ""close all"" option for open apps or a back arrow or gesture are just so simple and it is mind numbingly simple to implement; I don't know why Apple doesn't incorporate them. Seriously, it's taken Apple fifteen years to add haptic feedback. Really? I can honestly say now that android phones from years ago are more intuitive to use than brand new iPhones are. The only thing I've been impressed by with the iPhone is the camera. That's literally it."
Got an se for frew not long ago new in box and well atleast ill have updates for a few years just want my android back lol
"OK, I'll admit, IOS is finally getting to a place where an Android user might consider using it."
"Om my god. The phone is so much better, when it's off....."
I‚Äôm waiting for iOS 16
Holy shit. That intro is amazing
nice foresight !
sick intro bro!
"its amazing to see how ‚Äúcreative‚Äù they are and how 70% of iOS is totally not stuff they ripped from jailbreak tweaks
Edit: Dont get me wrong, i dont have a problem with it at all, hopefully one day there wont be a reason / need to even jailbreak in the first place."
"Brilliant updates üçé!!
The intro too MB!"
Nice background now ;)
"They need to fix the face camera, I swear it makes me look 10x worse lol."
I feel you don't do phone reviews more.
That intro is so sick üòÄ
Widgets better be able to do battery life of AirPods and watch
What's the name of the messaging app MKBHD uses that has a blue circle around a yellow check mark?
damn that into went hard. Shout out to your motion designer!
Another reason to not speak to GREEN BUBBLE PEOPLE
Boring I‚Äôm going android
Had to watch the intro multiple times soooo dope
Jidion
Love from India üíï
"I love apple in their stuff just works and works great, I use Samsung while it feels like I have more gimmicks and features, they kinda suck as far as stability or usability, like taking a picture sorta stutters for a second then it's good, lift to wake works, but it just doesn't feel as nice as ios"
I liked the taking pic out of a video/photo
So basically only one feature was worth it - lock screen customization. Welcome to a feature of Android from 2016.
"Brilliant, using your iPhone as a camera on top of your MacBook... Adding a good camera to a MacBook would be so silly."
Hello there Apollo
I love the preparations for your videos the desk setups music choices notification name the intro everything is just right
There is lot of things need to change
Intro üî•
What abt Call Recording Truecaller Live Caller ID ??
When you think the intros couldn't be anymore slick.
I used to be able to have 2 separate photos for lock and home screen. Can't see how to do that now. Not my favorite.
Apple really needs to start innovating at one point in their journey..
Sellout
To be honest i am a samsung user but i kinda like the iphone webcam and vertical flat video its gonna hella for unboxing videos
"Have you heard of any map updates for the iOS maps app? We travel a lot and find it rather irksome when we need to stop for gas or a bathroom break, the app keeps trying to reroute. If there could be a pause button on the screen or a break button that could show alternate routes that would include nearby gas stations, charging stations, etc."
I like that .. ‚úå
Now I‚Äôm sad because I have no iPhone 8 or higher:(
‚ò†Ô∏è
I won‚Äôt lie the picture thing is cool. And the unsend this is something I‚Äôve wanted since iPhone 5 ü§£ü§£. VERY late. Lock Screen is late too. All I‚Äôm excited for
Awesome
"I don‚Äôt like any of these. iPhones are supposed to give you a pain. Why are they becoming so versatile like Android.
At this point, i would just downgrade my iPhone.
Not excited for iOS 16 at all."
I need the wallpapers üíÄ
Nakukubali sanaaaa....
Who cares.  Go Android.
worst design ever
They moved the spotlight to base. Now the iphone became an android lol
Holy crap the photo lift feature is amazing
"Live objects is great, it will raise d*ckpics to a new level :D"
Fake reviewer.
People always complain about how Apple is always late to doing something that android had years prior but it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt just dish out new features they fine tune everything for their customers and that‚Äôs what puts them at the top ü´°
My iPhone 7 :nope not for you dude
Still android better üí™
Great. My iPhone 7+ is gonna be obsolete soon.
Great video
"Man, I really wish iPhone used USB C so I could buy one. These are pretty cool features but not enough to get me to change from a USB C Android phone."
This dope as hell
"hii marques ..........
we are waiting for the camera review of nothing................
you are the deciding factor man please come fast 
üòã"
"$44,344 in your account Marques... Big man! lol"
atp i can't defend android anymore bro üò≠
Can you share your wallpapers
Am I missing something or .. I used to have an iPhone 8 and there was haptic feedback for the keyboard.
Still refuse to switch to iPhone unless they add an AOD. I kno they want u to buy the Apple Watch for the time/notifications but not interested. So still a hard pass.
"Nevermind, turns out they‚Äôre dropping support for iPhone 7‚Ä¶ at the normal rate they would‚Äôve only dropped iPhone 6 this year"
"Would be nice if there was more discussion about some of the smaller quality of life type features that make using a particular OS easier, helpful and less cumbersome than the other.

This is where iOS still feels horribly stagnant and stale to me and makes it difficult to switch back to iOS where I admittedly still prefer its superior hardware, OS design language and its brilliant, cohesive and almost flawless ecosystem of products. 

Just to name a few features (most on Google's own Pixel line) on Android:

Swipe back from either side of screen. 
Dismiss alarms without turning them off or deleting them.
Multiple & labeled timers
Screen orientation on screen prompt
Choice of default apps (links opening in correlating default apps as well)
Far superior AI (Assistant vs Siri)
Hands/eyes free Assistant read feature for most on screen text/articles (powered by Google Assistant)
Far superior Google Translate app and Live Translate on pure Android (Pixel) working in most messaging apps (Whatsapp).
Phone app AI features: Hold for me, Spam & Call Screen & Direct my call.
Screen attention (prevent screen from turning off/timing out when looking at it)
App level settings (don't have to go into settings app to access a specific apps settings)

Gboard vs iOS default keyboard: iOS 16 will add haptics and almost rivals Gboard's dictation, but still lacks ability to clear previous text, sentence or full paragraph with swipe across backspace key. iOS still requires to hold down backspace to slowly clear previous text or cumbersomely select all text to delete.

Apple is always slow to the party in the name of perfection and implementation, which is why for example the iOS 16 lock screen is arguably superior even though Android has had it for years. But in my opinion Apple has to catch up on these smaller quality of life type issues/features as well as competing in the AI space, and I really hope they do.

Please share your thoughts and make the argument for Apple as well."

Who else wants the setting to automatically send a text message at a certain time?? Or is that just me.
"ok i had to freeze the video, i was that impressed.  that intro, oh my god how beautiful.  I think it's great that your intros have turned out so well and I'm super happy that you spend time and money on this.  I have been watching your channel for a long time and love to see that you keep challenging yourself.  ok i'm going to watch the rest of the video now.  hope you see this"

'lockscreen for work' now everyone is safe at their work place. no one gonna be nosy üòÇ
Nothing .... Worst update
you cant find any mkbhd video with an iphone where he dosent say dark sky ü§£

"What about the choppy slo mo video that should be at 240fps, but it usually hits 177 to 208fps in my case?  Is that problem addressed? iPhone 13 user, and I have to carry my iPhone SE II, that records 240fps consistently. Help?"
I currently have an iPhone 7. Do you guys think I should upgrade to the 13 pro now or wait until the 14 pro and get it then. My current battery on the 7 only lasts just over two hours now
"Uncommon opinion: If you look well, this new lock screen doesn't have much to do with Apple's design policy, but the crowd still loved it. This thing of covering the clock with a part of the wallpaper, in reality, gets in the way more than it tries to be cool. The clock is to be clearly visible, because it is an element that must be shown instantly to the user. But, as Apple has never been about customization, when it launches, then the crowd goes crazy...

If you value wallpaper so much, then why aren't you still bothered by the lack of personalized organization of apps on your home screen? Maybe because iPhone users don't care about it, or only care when Apple does it?

It's really funny, it has more to do with brand worship than actual contribution to the industry."
"Bro, WHAT AN INTRO!"
I think removing the background is a lot easier with the extra cameras/sensors because it can detect the depth
"Can you tell Apple to give iOS 13 for iPhone 6 Plus. Because I still stuck in iPhone 6 Plus and I really want true dark mode. Also iPhone 6, 5s users want too."
Come on old iphone users who poor like me. Support this comment.

I'm really excited for the haptic keyboard! That's one of the few things that I miss from my Android phones.
I could downgrade from the 15 beta when I put it on my main phone so I put the 16 beta on and learned that I cannot downgrade. I‚Äôm stuck on the beta until iOS 16.1 üò≠

"Finally!! Different lock screens for each time! 
Children of immigrant parents are rejoicing right now 
We can finally have our cute Lock Screen and then the ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù Lock Screen"
the one thing i wish they would do is let me reorganize a few of the apps that it auto organized into a folder that doesnt make sense
Man you are obsessed with 30fps
That intro was ice cold.
It's amazing how much of this could be in apps instead of embedded into an OS update.
0:13 DUDE GIVE YOUR EDITOR A RAISE WTF üò®
"I personally would have loved to see support for voice/audio messages. It's so annoying that they A.) Don't allow for the user to scroll through the audio or speed it up by 1.5x, 2.0x, etc. and B.) The screen will often time out, causing the need to start it over from the beginning. Super frustrating, especially for those people who don't understand the concept of calling if your audio message will exceed a minute or more lol."
I have no idea why you Americans don‚Äôt use WhatsApp. I‚Äôm an iPhone user since 2014 and have never used the Messages app
You can already scroll thru audio messages. Unless I‚Äôm misunderstanding what you‚Äôre saying.
No kidding. It's not like they haven't seen WhatsApp doing this for years. I don't listen to audio messages that are longer than a minute.
Why do you want voice mutation on voice messages that‚Äôs kind of a waste don‚Äôt you think with the limited features we do get every year
"Hi! I have a question about the Desk View, when you record a video. Where does it store? On iPhone? Or in the MAC PC? Thank you üòä for me, that desk view is a game changerüòÆ and maybe it will start to compete with the webcams now. The image crop as well is also good, instead of DL an app that do that, they now incorporate it in the OS. Nice one Apple"
Dope Intro!!!
Please make a video on wired android auto disconnecting constantly. It has been a known issue with hoards of people since sometime now.
I‚Äôm waiting for the day when IOS adds numbers on the keyboard to the same screen like most android phones have had for years now.
Awesome descriptions Brandon! Thanks! G
Good vid.
Why don‚Äôt they add Call recording and application Lock in IOS??

"Something Marques missed from the homescreen is the ability to expand the album art of whatever you're listening to, to the whole background. Small feature but I love it."

"Despite being an avid and an extreme Android (Samsung) user, I have a large and uncountable level of respect towards Apples' simplicity and eco-friendliness in their systems, especially with these added features in IOS 16, it never fails to impress and to make love to such device, I wished i had two phones, but for now ill stick to one but have a MASSIVELY HUGE respect towards Apple."

Not only that you barely have a chance to get your old whats app back up from drive over there(ony by using scammy 3rd party software) but also the features that you are used too in android are just not there in the IOS or just VERY limited. I still consider bringing that phone back, since its so annoying to have so limited options"
This transition is amazing
"When will these idiots bring T9 Dialer feature?
Don‚Äôt know how iPhone users survive without this or they just don‚Äôt know that anything like that exists.
Got pissed of in 2 months not having that feature. Every time I try to call someone I have to search in the contact and then call. That‚Äôs frustrating."
"Only lock screen 
No major update"
"Me: gets iPhone 7p
Apple: * is releasing update for iPhone 8 and later *"
"I wish they‚Äôd add a feature to iMessage to make specific message replies less cumbersome. Telegram let‚Äôs you simply swipe a message to reply directly to it, and it does it all in line without bringing the specific conversation to the foreground. What would be perfect is if you could do the swipe to reply, but then you could also tap the reply to quickly snap back to the text in question (something telegram also does) or long press the reply to pull up the thread like iMessage currently does. Right now though, I hardly ever use the specific reply function because it‚Äôs just tedious to long press, select reply, send the text, then tap away from the zoomed in conversation. It‚Äôs just too many steps."

I had to let my iPhone 7 plus lay to rest when I read that it wasn't getting  this iOS 16ü•∫ I just refused to pay for that very expensive phone upgrade.

"‚Äã@VikiN Norway This ""it just works"" idea is just marketing. Most operating systems, like Windows, Linux, or Android, ""just work"" too. However, when you inevitably run into a use case that isn't well supported by those OS's, there's usually something you can do to work around it. Maybe there's a command line utility you hadn't even heard of that can help. Maybe there's a registry key you can change. Maybe there's some freeware program that solves your problem. Spend a few minutes on a forum and you can probably find a way to solve your problem. On MacOS and iOS, you often straight up cannot meet your needs. ""It just works"" usually translates to ""No, you can't."" Other OS's are more ""Yes, if"". In software, business, and life in general, ""Yes, if"" is a better answer. 

For normies (which I don't say as an insult) who don't have a lot of needs, pretty much any OS would be fine, iOS and MacOS included. For power users or people who for whatever reason don't like the default configuration, iOS and MacOS are a prison."
"iOS 16 adds nothing that would push the iPhone from ""not viable"" to ""viable"". The keyboard vibrates now, there's an extremely gimmicky way to help a minority of users improve their laptop webcams (like, if you're already using your phone camera for the call, why not just take the call on your phone? Or why not use your totally adequate 1080p Macbook webcam?), there's an equally gimmicky cutout feature in the camera, you can edit messages in iMessage, the lockscreen can look different, and the UI for playing videos looks different.

Every single feature in this video is in the ""bells and whistles"" category. Nothing helps with productivity, performance, battery life, privacy, or other important pieces of an OS. The new customization options are mostly cosmetic; they're an improvement, but they won't help you remove clutter, or turn things off, or keep better organized. They just let you say ""Oh cool, my clock is obstructed by my wallpaper now! ...although I do wonder what time it is"""
"1. Able to edit the message which already sent within 24 hours.
2. Able to use iPhone camera as web camera
3. Able to edit lock screen with multiple widgets like iWatch
4. Able to identify the objects in any photo
5. Able to view weather by individual day; home screen has search functionality;"
Good small improvements. One thing I wish Ô£ø can include is the feature to remove/close all background apps at once instead of swiping them up one by one.
"@notstarboard 
That‚Äôs essentially the exact same thing I was saying. There‚Äôs no reason to kill apps because ram management takes care of it. Whatever slowdowns the person thinks they‚Äôre getting due to having too many applications open in the background is just a placebo. I‚Äôm curious what you think is misleading, because you‚Äôve essentially said exactly what I did."
"@Burb This is a misleading post. RAM exists to be used. If your OS is clearing RAM aggressively when it has RAM to spare, that's just going to hurt your ability to multi-task for no good reason. Neither iPhones nor Androids are going to slow down just because you have apps up in your recent apps screen. Both OS's are plenty smart enough to kill apps in the background as needed, such as when an app won't release RAM or has been backgrounded for a while without being used. For normal users there is no need on either OS to manually force quit or clear apps from your recents unless those apps are misbehaving."
"@BL 1505 
The other guy is correct, jetsam doesn‚Äôt allow apps to constantly run in the background for ram‚Äôs sake. It‚Äôs the reason iOS is so much more efficient at memory management than Androids. There‚Äôs no possible way you‚Äôve ever had 10 apps actively in the background, even if they show up in your app switcher.  Background processes in settings are different and a better way to think about them would be like services in Windows. They‚Äôre not making your phone slow. 

Chances are you‚Äôre just feeling a placebo, because during the extra time you take to use the app switcher and ‚Äúclose‚Äù another app, the app you want to use has continued on and finished loading."
@BL 1505 thats fine but iphone 13 dont slow down with apps in the background thats BS
"@VikiN Norway ermm, ok im not gonna continue this discussion. Just so you know there will always be background apps running/refreshing unless you turn em all off in Settings. And also, FYI Im using an iPhone 13 on iOS15.5 üôÇ"
"5:30 Genius, ha... Obviously haven't heard of  similar web-camera apps on Android.."
"‚Äã@Little Bear Camo, DroidCam, Iriun, iVCam, XSplit COnnect.... But the genius here is Apple, of course. Others are simply not Apple..."
"I dont know if this comment is sarcastic, but I haven't seen anything like this either"

"Live Objects seem nuts, faster than Photoshop"
So after iOS 16 there is no difference between Samsung and apple. All copied from Samsung
Where the hell's the hotspot on the new updates??

How is message unsend/edit an OS feature? Apple has really got the terminology messed up. Why club native app updates with OS update? OS updates are supposed to introduce new UI design languages or features that are not particular to a single app...like the haptic feedback on keyboard or the background and foreground copy paste feature. But #1 can easily be done across all Apple devices irrespective of their make...Just push an app update to all.
bro what the fuck was that intro
Some what update 16 ios
that intro is sick!
"The Continuity Camera feature is really weird solution. It's like Apple would say: ""We'll keep equip Macs with mediocre cameras, but if you got really sick of that, you can attach your iPhone, using another crutchy accessory"". üòè As an additional secondary feature ‚Äî yes, it would be cool, fun and sometimes useful, but they push it as one of the primary things, and that causes some questions.

Long time ago Apple ditched their bulky external webcams iSight in favor of built-in cameras, very bad, but very compact. Now they turned back to the old concept, except now ""iSight"" costs up to $1K. Something weird is going on at the company, really. As if Apple would want even more money, despite their products are pretty expensive already."
"2022, the new iPohone software update now lets you customize the lockscreen..."
And boring
"Anything that needs a charger and a plug, is already outdated technology :("
Da oggi faccio parte di questa grande famiglia. sono davvero grato Marques!
That intro
I like how they added customized home screens... 12 years after Android lol.
lmao right
"Finally, I can quickly switch to my side piece's photo when she comes over"
"Why don't apple add something like ""you can't switched off your phone without your face id? This is how stealers can't turn your phone off and you will track your device immediately"
They have redesigned Books app too. Reading mode looks gorgeous)
ios tries to become android more and more
Hi
Split screen?
I have this on my iPhone 11üî•üî•üî•üî•
So iPhone 7 won't get any update?
Nope
Lock screen!!!
Send me one iPhone 13...
"For me, face ID only works in vertical. (IOS 16 PB)"
if you also tap on the cover art for the music your whole lock screen changes to the cover art it‚Äôs really cool
Will the iPhone 8 handle it smoothly? Or just slow down and start lagging and‚Ä¶ then your screwed ‚Ä¶?
IPhone is just terrible
"I am having more and more respect for apple after knowing the pluses from iphones, this makes me respect them even more. Still prob wouldnt buy iphones anytime soon"
That intro!!!!!! Dope to the max!!
Lock screen is my fav üò±
Can‚Äôt wait for it
All that and still no AOD.
Some of those custom lock screens look ugly af ü§Æ also results in more of a disconnect with you and other iphone users
No call recording yet üò¢
Editing team is awesome!
Include video chapers man you have to provide atleast that to the person's who see your video.. that makes viewing easier.....
does this mean i can‚Äôt get ios 16 on my iphone 7
Love watching mkbhd videos in 144p due to data caps
nice intro
Can you possibly make the clock look like the OG clock before 1.16?
Desk view for non-Mac!!!
7:48 pinterest is gonna go crazy 10:04 nooo i liked the music when it was big im gonna cry
Why this useless feature are exagerated more i dont think feature interms of android can beat ios
Do this work in se gen 3?
I just noticed with this video that the iPhone's keyboard didn't have any haptic feedback and I was blown away. The first I do on my new iPhone is to install SwiftKey. It's just way better anyways.
You forgot to mention the Lock Screen album cover feature when you tap the album cover
its jidion
"There is no link for the wallpaper on 08:47
Ironically, that was the one I liked. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Keyboard sound on by default?  All respect is gone now.   So disappointed.
When will Apple ever update their keyboard so it'll have symbols on them? They make typing so difficult. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Apple really did good here
No one cares
Will it work oh ipad
"New ios lockscreen is a f""ckin material you android look like"
Dope intro. Just blows my mind. Better than iPhone advertisements ‚ù§Ô∏è
kinda hate the idea of unsending messages
"All i want from the keyboard now is bi-langual support like SwiftKey has, then I can finally delete SwiftKey"
the lock screen should be optional. i have 0 use for it and not being able to directly see my home screen after i unlock is infuriating 100 times a day. just make it focken optional
"i. cant. have. iOS. 16. on. my. iphone. 7
and I really need the feature for weather."
"features that adroid has for 10 yearsü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ god apple is a piece of garbage

Thanks for the video! Looking forward to it!
6:50 iPhone turns into an android more and more. In a bad way.
Apple will always find a way to make it worse
Apple slowly turning into android
Hello brother does Redmi phone work in USA please Reply
"android used to have the best lockscreen, called widgetlocker.
but for some reason, they stopped supporting it.
the devs just moved all their efforts to the amazing launcher (Nova)."
will iphone 7 get the ios 16?
I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever been this excited for an IOS to come out üíÄ
Totally nailed the intro bro
Nice Video
it looks like an android now lol
When is iOS 16 coming out?
"Who ever did the intro, give him a raise."
"I have been holding back on updating because I jailbreak, however this kinda make me want to update"
Too late. Well over apple a long time ago
I use it on my main lol
still Apple ü§Æ being a few years behind the android phones...
This intro is LIT AF
"HEAR ME OUT!

Someone please make and share a Vecna clock lockscreen!"
When is apple going to let us put the icons anywhere on the screen we want. So they don't block the parts of our background photo? Android has done it for over a decade.
That intro ü•µüî•
"How to only view my photo captured with my phone, not to mix with others? Is it so hard to put iPhone camera album itself? Anyone can help me with this issue?"
"Here we see Apple trying to catch up to android. Maybe now, it might worth changing to Apple."
I swear that Apple is so bad stilll
"The feature I like the most is the ability to sort songs in music playlists on the phone itself. Another 15 years and we may be able to rename songs on the phone. Equally important, Notes seem to not auto-format anymore. Yay!"
"1st feature is ultra-useless if it doesn't work with other OS
2nd feature is awesome
3rd feature is ok
4th feature is nice
5th feature is good to have"
That intro üî•üî•üî•
Man I wish I had an iphone
"I wish apple would optimize their software to reduce the number of taps, instead of adding dumb features.

How many times do I care about the font of the clock: zero.
How many times do I need to rotate a picture I take with their camera: maybe 50%.

It takes 3 taps on separate parts of the screen to rotate a picture, vs. the pinch and twist motion on android. Add that up for hundreds of pictures it‚Äôs a h*cking nightmare.

plz for the love of dog make it faster to use!"
sad for Indian ios users who doesn't use i messagesü§£ü§£
"As an avid android fan, this is good to see. This time there is actually new and innovative things from Apple mixed in with the usual copying of android stuff. I'm a fan of this"

@Rohan Warkhade you kinda sound triggered yourself. ü§î
"i thought it was just every company copying and one-upping each other in order to try to stay relevant, and the thing is that apple is just one phone brand using its own os, comparing to multiple phone brands using an open source google os"
Most of the features are already on Android.
"apple did a great ""job"" to train zombies to buy newer products and toss away old ones."
I want it on iPhone 7 as well üò©
üòçLove the animation and intro üëåüèª
Being able to pick objects and drop on different backgrounds is the most impressive.
I appreciate the effort put into the intro.
"No thanks I'll stay with my Android until apple brings real multitasking, pip for YouTube, back gesture and so on"
iPhone needs custom widgets or more 3rd party app widgets.
"How is 24 the worst framerate, Marques? Shame!"

OMG what an incredible Intro üòµ‚ô•Ô∏è
"I wish there was a feature where I could just turn off all the notifications except from one or 2 apps for few hours.
That would be lit
I don‚Äôt wanna go through all apps setting n turn off notifications and then go back to turn on everytime.
We so need that feature to disconnect from everything except really important ones"
@MsQueen damn I need to keep learning abt new features everytime there‚Äôs new iOS
You could make a focus mode literally just for that.
Can we change where the clock is placed on the Lock Screen? It‚Äôs always covering the top. I‚Äôd like to put it in the middle.
Link for that Belkin mount?
Can't afford any iphone but still watching ü§ß

"As a long-time Android user (10+ years) the new iOS makes me excited! I've been looking to switch to iOS for a while now. While iOS 16 still doesn't come close to the flexibility of Android, it's a giant leap, I hope Apple continues to make its OS more flexible over time!"
i'm seriously tempted to take the plunge and get a 13 (I have a galaxy s10 atm)
Cant say i miss anything from my time with samsung
Just switched from being a Samsung guy for about 9 years and with 16 not far off Im very excited that these kind of features are coming! I hope they bring more stuff like this with each big iteration over the next few years
üò°ü•µüò°ü•µüò° when will APPLE üçé bring call record option ü´§ü´§üòê you know how good this call recording option helped in Amber heard case üò©üò´üòñ it is one the best feature in ANDROID phones ‚òéÔ∏è we are waiting decades for this one simple feature dude ü•∫‚òπÔ∏èüòû

Why can't Apple just bring back battery percentage on the home screen? SMH
so should i go for ios 16 beta or just wait for the official ?
Very well done - I've been on the Beta since the beginning and did not know a portion of the stuff you mentioned.  Thanks for that!

"Hey Marques. First off, I've loved your videos for a long time‚ÄîI watch a ton of them. I wanted to make a small bit of constructive criticism: make your sound better. I can hear hum and some hiss and you sound a little distant in this video. FCP has voice enhance, Audacity (free) has fantastic noise reduction and EQ, and I like the company iZotope. I would also recommend you read the book Sound Design for Film by Tim Harrison. And lastly, listen to a brief episode of the This Week In Tech podcast (I think you were on that once with Leo Laporte) and Leo's voice in particular. There's a ton of dynamic range to his audio but it's not muddled; it's crisp and clean from the bass to the treble. So yeah, I would recommend being more careful with the sound in your videos because it doesn't match the crazy good production values you have on the visual end. 

Anyway, longtime fan and I always look forward to your reviews and am very much looking forward to what you have to say when Apple's big events happen this fall. Keep up the fantastic work!"

dang... now i want an iphone :')
Why has he not spoke anything about one thing ?? Come on man give explanation bro
I loved everything
Im on iOS 16 beta and the native Youtube app has Picture in picture mode now!
This is awesome! I have had iOS 16 beta for 2 days and the only thing I have encountered was a frozen settings but that was it! Everything is so smooth

On the music player on lock screen tap the album cover for the cover to be full view centre of the screen! I love that! It‚Äôs the minimalist I appreciate.

"Beautifully done video as usual but seriously, these minor features constitute a major iOS update? Where's the advanced battery tech that will make the phone barely there slim?

When's Apple gonna add numbers to the basic keyboard without having to switch to another screen?
"Great review, would be nice if they added some things that actually made phone easier to use like, no shifting for punctuation and numbers. When making a call, if you‚Äôre on the keypad, if you start typing a person‚Äôs name or number, it list all the similar names or numbers and you choose from the list instead of the current cumbersome way. Just saying."
24fps is the best frame rate üòè

For #2 you could already do that with an app like Iriun Webcam for example it worked very well on windows just like a normal webcam I don‚Äôt know about macOS tho
And it still lacks a basic back swipe feature that works universally throughout the whole system making it slower and less ergonomic to navigate than android. I really don't know why this feature hasn't been implemented yet as it's been an android feature for over a decade.
agree. people are going gaga over features that don't even affect your use of the phone as much as a simple back swipe would
"Elon musk is creating AI, self driving cars and trying to create a colony on mars. Apple is making custom lock screens ü§¶üèºüòÇ"

"the thing that it's mind-blowing for me, it's that apple doesn't release any software update to optimize the battery anymore, they are so way above the competition that they don't need to do this anymore."
So music control is going to be harder now because the controls are smaller?? How is that good? I‚Äôm so confused. You‚Äôre not making me want this new update. ‚ò†Ô∏è
I hope I can opt out of the fading in lock screen. That kind of stuff makes me super seasick.
Is it iOS 16 released pls
Keyboard haptics is the best future of ios16 period.
Lmao. A good decade after we finally got rid of having to have an external camera on a computer and now they‚Äôre bringing it back. ü§£üòÇ
The thing I am most excited for is haptic keyboard. I was shocked to find this was missing when I switched from Samsung to Apple back in 2019.
Came from the Pixel 2 to 13 pro ans couldnt believe how bad the weather App is..
Good editing but your video editing makes me seasick. Please stop zooming in and out. Just keep the camera steady please.
"I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs up to a whole new prime update with some Lock Screen customisation and background editing
Let‚Äôs just call it iOS 15.5.1 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
They changed the ios video player
that intro is amazing wow
I don‚Äôt really think Apple needs events for these minor changes
"I downloaded the beta on my main phone and I can‚Äôt uninstall it anymore, oh well I guess it‚Äôs okay"
"I've been team Android for 12 years, just switched to iPhone.... 

Apple for the love of god, 

Add: 
- an ability to make your keyboard just a little bigger 
- scheduled text messages (I've been able to schedule texts for years on Android) 
- I saw the recent YouTube screen in video or whatever apple calls it.... Android I was able to minimize YouTube and play with other apps completely, game changer 
- predictive text needs some love"
"Just the fact I could change the colour of the time on my lock screen so I can see it with curtail wallpapers is making me happy! 
But some impressive changes here, as usual Apple go that above and beyond with expectations. The top desk/ down view is very impressive!"
"Heck, u can't even change 2 lockscreen shortcuts like flashlight and camera.."
"Above and beyond?üòÜüòÇü§£ 
Interactive widgets?
Custom icon?
New design control centre?
Smart suggestions for quick reply?
Lock individual apps?
Ô£ø is far from above and beyond.."
"I have it on my main iPhone, it works great the only thing is my apps crashes sometimes but besides that it is fantastic!"
Amazing intro. üòç
"My main question.. when is apple going to let people move apps to wherever they want? Such a small thing, but would be such a huge improvement. Why do I HAVE to align things left to right, top to bottom..."
JIDIONNNNN
"I don‚Äôt really understand why it notifies the other person if you unsend a message, isn‚Äôt that the whole point of unsending a message?"
"Android: Uh oh, Apple went Super Saiyan‚Ä¶ not good!"
It‚Äôs crazy how well the photo cutout works
Ngl I have been using it on my main and it's stable enough. Haven't experienced any significant battery problems or performance issues.
The introüòÆ‚Äçüí®
Can‚Äôt wait for iOS 16! üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº
I wish Apple had a white unity watch band
is anyone else experiencing no notifications (screen doesn't light up/ no notification sound) when lock screen is activated?
All that and the keyboard still has no comma
Why is you voice and face always so soothing üòå so nice too watch your videos (the content is obviously great too) üòõ keep going you‚Äôre the best ! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
What they need to do is fix the music bug where the album artwork on songs is extremely blurry. It's been a year and they still haven't fixed that.
24fps is the best frame rate ‚ù§Ô∏è
NICE  AWES0ME KEEP_IT_UP! ‚ú®üéâ‚ú®üéâ‚ú®üéâüéâüééüé≠üééüé≠üééüé≠üéóüéóüéóüéëüéëüéëüéëüéëüéëüéë‚ú®üéÜüéÜüéÜüéÜüéÜüéÜüéÄüéÄüéÄ

Hey! Don‚Äôt forget that Jesus Christ loves you and he died for you have a blessed day‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
This dope intro was better than what apple did!üòÆ
Holy sh*t that intro.. ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
love your fkng hands
"You can hate Apple all you want, but when it comes to software features and AI, Apple is second to none! Can‚Äôt wait to update to iOS 16. Such beauty!"
üëç
One of the first times Apple has exceeded expectations in an update
"Maybe I am wrong, but I think the desk view thing might not be that crazy. It's pretty simple to do that with the opencv library, python, and your own computer"
do they call this an upgrade ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
"I‚Äôm on ios 16 public beta, but i do not have the background delete feature. any reasons why?"
"Gestures 
New icons 
Keyboard with long press to select symbols 
Settings within the app"
Oh my Gosh that intro! üî•üî•üî•üî•
XVI (Roman numerals for 16) on the book in the background‚Ä¶ nice touch :)
THE INTROü•µü•µü•µ
Been using beta since day 1 .. been quite stable
Omg this haptic keyboard is craze
"bro edit it, it is M2 NOT M1 WHO GOT 1080P CAMERA"
Love the first transition actually feels like you‚Äôre watching Apple video
Did you say you can click on an object and lift it? Dick pic senders must be thrilled.
Do IOS updates still slow phones down/otherwise degrade performance ?
"Holy f*ck, that intro."
Is that in the couch the gay flag i hope I‚Äôm mistaken‚Ä¶what heck is happening in the world‚Ä¶ Even the people that we admire for certain topics have gone even further..
"I like the idea of the unsend iMessage feature but what‚Äôs the point if it‚Äôs gonna alert the other person that you unsent the message or amended it. Defeats the purpose in my opinion, just creates more questions behind the message being sent or not."
When your gonna give full review of Nothing phone 1 . Sir

I‚Äôm dying for that lock screen!!! ü§ìü§ìü§ì
I love the graphic design of your videos üëèüëèüëèüëè
Thanks for another interesting and informative video
Lmao. Those edit and endo massage thing have in android like 5years from now
I love the fact that you can click on the icon for the music you are listening to on your Lock Screen and it will make the entire song cover your Lock Screen while you listen to that song
"the ""smart object recognition"" was here since 1984 in apple's macintosh XD"
"I feel bad about people getting excited about all these ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù
Like isn‚Äôt there something better in life than this for them? Sigh‚Ä¶."
"The other stuff is cool, but the unsend feature is extremely dangerous I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea"
My favorite future is that finally after 15 years the interface will be in Bulgarian language
What is that phone to MacBook mount you are using?
this is the first time as a hardcore android fan that I can say that I'm a little jealous of the iPhone right now. I don't think I could genuinely recommend and android over an iPhone right now if someone asked me what they should go for.
The desk view is crazy! But you know what‚Äôs even crazier‚Ä¶your intro
Ios 16 photo features
Android phones been doing copy and paste text from pics for last 3+ years ü§£
THAT INTRO THO!!!! üî•üî•üî•üî•
Hdj
"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."
That intro‚Ä¶ üî• In the top three easy üôåüèª
I don't understand that in messenger before IOS 16 we weren't unsending messages?
"Hi there MKBHD! üëãüèΩ
Maybe you could ask Apple IOS developers to include allowing iPhone users the ability to FINALLY leave a group chat with non-iPhone users? Just thought I‚Äôd ask!"
First time in my life I wanna buy an iphone. Good job apple!
I will keep the haptic keyboard off. Feels really off.
Why only up to 15 minutes in message editing?
"Dm
üëÜüëÜüëÜüëÜ"
Haptic keyboard finally! üòÇ. I switched from android to IOS first time and I cant believe this option isnt here üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"All the stuff you can do, you when you have a beast of a CPU under the hood... Damn"
"It‚Äôs been a while since I had actually been excited for an Apple iOS update and this seems to give, nice review Marcus"
Interested to see continuity camera vs something like the Opal C1
I would really like a copy / paste editing feature for the Photos app.
"Dm
üëÜüëÜüëÜ"
Landscape Face ID isn‚Äôt working on mine
Didn‚Äôt mentioned the fullscreen music widget on the lock screen. One of the best improvements.
@8:10 I thought he was going to do a magic trick
To be honest I wasn‚Äôt too excited with recent iOS updates but I would definitely update it just because of the clock and wallpaper thing.
"This might be enough to make me convert to ios. 
Please make a downside to ios video to convince me otherwise üòÇ"
The webcam features are fire! I hope they implement those somehow on Android phones.
"Also, the lock screen is underwhelming IMO. Nice update but still feels fairly limited."
"Okay.. that intro was insane üî•
I didn't need to be, but it was üòÇüî•"
if u tap on the music album cover it becomes the wallpaper while ur listening to music
üëèüëèüëè thanks for your üßês as always loud and clear üì°
Immediately liked this for the intro.
It is good we are getting all dis but how du we Enabling it Det is the dumb thong
What makes it unstable? I‚Äôve been using it as a daily with no issues. What problems have you found?
Where you get that dragon ball phone case
"you got the intro music linked, but what is that outro piece? just a short melody literally for your channel or is it a real song?"
0:13 transitions are getting better and better.
I love the haptic keyboard
can smb tell me where can i find thiis transamerica pyramid wallpaper
"within a year or two, apple will ditch the camera on MacBooks so you have to use your iPhone.. and everyone will follow..m sigh RIP webcams üòî"
Where‚Äôs my apple fam at?
I know it's still miles behind android but I'm so glad that we're starting to get some customization options on iOS. I've started to really prefer iOS but have gone to and from android solely to be able to look at something that isn't completely stock.
"@RebornAsASquid The thing is, you never miss something you never had, and not everybody with an android device even knows how to customise screens. I‚Äôve had several android phones and the pixels are the only ones where I can work out how to do it and remember in the future, and I just change the wallpaper or live video. iOS‚Äôs platform stability, performance, Apple environment integration, app availability and fewer security worries are far bigger deals for me overall, but everybody‚Äôs different."
"@Neil McMahon Yeah that's true. I was just saying that it's objectively lacking in customization and if it wasn't, I personally wouldn't ever feel like I miss having an android device."
@RebornAsASquid That's just your opinion though. Millions of iOS users couldn't give a flying fcuk about the customisations you are talking about.
@Neil McMahon In terms of customization? 100%.
miles behind Android? lmfao
SUPER COOL INTRO
The intro is talk of the show! love that!
"SOS!!!    Lives  Ukrainians also matt

Apple is really catching upüëçüèæ
U r always biased to ios....android is anyway and anyday better than ios...go see pixel features and come
That damn intro üî•
Sickest intro I have ever seen or at least in a long time
That intro scene though. Damn
I don't have any of these features and I have a iphone 12 and iOS 16.5. Is there a setting to turn it on?
LMAO 24FPS is trash on that 30FPS now thanks brownlee!
creators.
Face id in landscape does it work for all iPhones or just 13 ?
Intro is dope
You can take a photo of a document and scan it without the background.
I would like to see imessage app and another dedicated app for normal messaging (SMS and MMS)
Me watching on an iPhone 6 knowing I can‚Äôt use any features above iOS 12:
Intro was awesome!üíØ
Awesome Intro
Where can I get the Marylin Monroe Wallpaper? üòç
The Fact This Is All Free!!!
"Haptic keyboard is something I've missed since moving from OS to iOS. 

5:40: that sounds like a great idea. It also means apple doesn't have to recreate new devices. Very smart and an efficient way to use what u already have.

7:00: FINALLYYYYYA! coming from pixels and Samsung's customization is theeeeee biggest thing for me."
The messages feature
I wish they bring back the volume control on lock screen option
I can always rely on u to get awesome vids out at a great time. üòçthanks
OMGü§Ø That freaking intro though!! That‚Äôs as close to an actual Apple ad I‚Äôve ever seen any creator get. Freaking insane!!
i think the lockscreen is the best one for me
Still trying to put live activities my Lock Screen
Hi. I'm having issues with my microphone of my 13 pro max after 15.5 update
"Coming from a LOYAL Samsung user, whose had 10 of their phones, I have to concede finally lol.... The iPhone's have taken the lead in my booküò≠ From customization and screen prowess to battery, speed, and camera quality. I'm officially moving over to iPhone, never would've thought lol."
The webcam one was my favourite bcuz my m1 mba webcam is trashy af‚Ä¶..
Intro was awesome!üíØ
"Question: What percentage of iphone users will use any of these IOS16 Updates? 1% is my guess, but then I'm happy with my Samsung 21."
Nokia N8 lock screen
It's almost like Apple went out and bought an Android phone for the first time and copied some old tech. I like it though.
damn what an intro
"i thought you would say the ""lockdown-mode"" is on #1 or so."
"Great job apple , the always on display it's really cool..."
"top-down view looks weird, any reason you didn't talk about it and just brushed over it ?"
"easter egg: there's a ""16"" (XVI) written on the orange-grey board on the first shelf"
Please mention the intro soundtrack
they said that you can now use pro con on ios 16?
Um‚Ä¶that was a sick intro! Keep up the stellar reviews and video production. Love your content.
This makes me want to switch to apple.
So my iPhone 6s will not have *IOS 16* version
the message function is quite useless...so far I haven't sent the message for over 5 years (with WhatsApp...Link...etc)...wondering nowadays..who will still using the message.
iOS is copying Android
Sick intro üî•
"Marques ""üçè"" Brownlee"
That intro was seriously dope.
That intro üôåüèæ
samsung did this 10 years ago
apple working hard to slowly turn me over from android after all these years
i still want apple to able switch camera from front to rear while recording üò≠
Your intros are dope üòç
"I'm curious how will be with deleted/edited SMS notifications outside of iOS. The same like on Android with that notification ""Someone likes your message""?
Android user will receive edited message or just a new message which was edited?!"
That Intro Though üî•
This has me so hype!
"love the new features, and also, you‚Äôre handsomeeeee"
The fact that the top down view also rotates what‚Äôs on the desk so both you and the person on the other end of the video see it facing the same direction is wizardry
My se3 has it
"Very informative as always man, Thanks I decided to try it myself today and I‚Äôm enjoying it so far!"
@Hyperis X I‚Äôm using the beta version directly off of apples website! üòÑ
"Is it able to download it now? If yes, from where?"
"Yeah, but can you search along route to add a stop in Maps? :/"
Can we talk about how there is going to be a car announcement in late 2023 according to the ios 16 page???
Great video. Where did you get the laptop iPhone holder?
This guy don't skimp out on the motion design.
Do those wallpapers with the top of the buildings come as a default with IOS 16?
What happened to live wallpapers? For some reason I enjoy them lol üòÇ
i need that lockscreen
0:11 Awesome!
BANGER of an intro. Watched it back a couple times lol
"That webcam system is actually a thing of beauty. I've been critical both for Android & iOS a lot but i always say , iOS brings you up something so good & stable that you can't hate it at all. Samsung been their close competitors is doing great but system optimisations of apple are just on another level ."
"‚Äã@Droid Motorola 388 An ecosystem is just a way for one company to collect way too much of your data while providing limited benefits beyond more siloed apps developed by different groups that do the same things.

I would guess that most people like their ecosystem of choice because they have apps that do everything they want them to do, not because the interconnectedness of those apps is adding a lot of value. It's just a pain in the butt to find alternatives to things once you're already invested, especially if you have data stored in those apps. Even something as simple as switching notes apps can become a pain."
@Delayed Creator bro why are you so toxic. You just woke up and chose verbal violence
@Delayed Creator it literally does but alright i dont care
"@Fisayo Ajisafe only if they decides to build it 12 years ago, they'd be aside"
@Droid Motorola 388 They have an ecosystem but they don't have total control unlike Apple.
Continuity camera seems like a gimmick to me. Cannot imagine using this on a regular basis..
"@prod. trxphy  Just like most of us, I have been working from home for a while. And of course, this includes video calls and such. But honestly, nobody cares if my webcam records a better image when it's just a tiny portrait among multiple others. And even full screen it doesn't really matter because it is about work and not cineastic excellence. Therefore, I'd just stick to the integrated webcams instead of clipping my phone to my Mac all the time, leaving me unable to check incoming messages etc."
Well do you work or go to school online? thats who theyre targeting
Love the Lizzo reference üòÇüòÇ
Cant wait till apple charges 100$ for a phone holder premium to put on your mac book
"00:12 magic starts here. 
Your Welcome!"
"I don't usually comment, but I have watched your content for 3-4 years consistently. Every single video is A-1. Perfect. You and your team are incredibly talented and ultra-content creators."
@Vanimal Adventures or Google Wave?
@TechDove Remember Google Plus?
I've been watching since 2011 and you wouldn't believe the difference
But like why does search need a button? All you have to do is swipe down on the Home Screen
"Hey Marques, is there a Live Object or text feature like this on Android? Thanks for the videos."
Will you be able to finally get rig of that flashlight and camera shortcuts from lockscreen?
that intro was amazing!!!!!
Does continuity camera work if you mount the phone to an external monitor or does it have to be within a certain distance from your laptop itself?
"Who created Adam, the first of the offspring, and who provided you with money and health, and who created you out of nothing, and who answers the sad and distressed if he calls him.. and he is the one who knows the date of your death and who has kept your heartbeat until now so that you know and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth and enter Islam. Why is this poor and this rich? Have you ever wondered why this one died when he was young and this one when he was old, and what is found in the grave and the resurrection‚Ä¶..or do you think that you were created in vain,.. the world is a test house and work in order to be rewarded for what you did on the Day of Resurrection?"
Nobody does it better than you Marques! :)
2:16 Just one of many reasons iPhone is simply the best
this intro was üî•
"I want to buy laptop hp 850 g3 i5-6300u( 16 gb ram, 256 gb SDD).So I'm wondering if that laptop will be able to support minecraft in some 60-90 fps"
Is there still no split screen? Omg Apple!
2:09 you can now make any object in a photo a whatsapp sticker
I wanted to try this with photos and realised that the recently deleted and hidden photos albums are now secured by faceID/password
I‚Äôve been waiting so long for that and now they‚Äôve finally done it
wtf that intro was nuts
"5:00 ""brilliant idea"" is around for 5+ years."
Nr.4 blew me away a little bit‚Ä¶ ü§Ø
Where did you get this Transamerica Pyramid from? I can't find in these links
Have you noticed a significant change in battery life while keeping keyboard haptics on?  Curious if that makes a big impact for the medium-heavy keyboard users on a daily basis.
I've had it on for a while on an iPhone 12 mini. It barely does anything.
Well! You won‚Äôt see any difference. Most likely it will be 1% or less.
"Yeah, I was curious about this as well. Thank you for asking this question!"
Waiting for nothing 1 unboxing
is it me or there is an awful background noise in almost all the video? sorry your videos are great but I couldn't help noticing this. Great review btw
This all stuf android got 5 years earlier
This iOS bout to cost hella relation problems
Best intro!
#1 kinda lame
So astonishing that iPhones 8 & 8 Plus from 2017 are still gonna get this iOS 16 update.
"Damn too bad for PC gotta use Windows for dem games, but phone related everything apple"
How do you get the notification back to the normal spot. Not fond of them at the bottom of the screen
wish Apple release iMessage for android if they are serious about market outside US
Maturity is realizing that telegram has been having these features and all the other developers are just adding spice to them
Damm!! that intro!!
Finally! I‚Äôve been waiting for them to allow us to customize our wallpapers! üôÑ
Introduction is amazingü§©
"as an android user, I am very jealous."
About using smartphone cameras cool that they  add extra features but still is soo stupid that u bay $$$ Mac in 2022 and have 720p cam. Ehhh
"Now that we can bring spotlight from home page dots, I just hope they make swipe down gesture bring the Control Centre instead of spotlight."
Mine is taking forever I just want the update already üò≠üò≠
That intro was pure flex. Great work
#4 will be good for making youtube thumbnails too.
This intro is üî•
"Wow‚Ä¶ Just Wow‚Ä¶
Waiting for beta‚Ä¶"
They made the lock screen look like Google
This was definitely a response to when people started customizing the homescreen in iOS 13(?)/iOS 14. Which gives me hope Apple will allow SOME level of customization of the homescreen in the future. Probably iOS 18 or 19.
"That intro snapped... super crazy, you guys should start a media consulting group at this point. As always, much love for the recap, keep up the great work MKB!"
The landscape Face ID is great.
i think apple is going to focus on custobisability
Lock screen got  me wowüòÆüòØ
"I would just be spending half of my life removing background from the photos. Live object feature will be great.
Also, your videos are great keep growing."
This and the lock-screen customization feature is going to just explode on the socials. I‚Äôm so excited to start playing around with these!
I just want Gmail to stop crashing on my iphone 13 pro U_U
Nothing phone1 vs iphone 13 vs iphone se 3 gn full camper video banaoo....
Intro low key better than Apple ad
"Marques, maybe a talk show type of setup where you invite guests to demo their products and discuss about existing and future products?"
Great Video Bro
Great content as always. Even tho i can't afford an iphone your channel has made me know a lot about it and their ecosystems
Android have been doing lock screen customisation for years...go back and look at the Galaxy S3. It improved over the years.
"5:15 Apple didn't have a brilliant idea, they just took it from other apps. I've been using an IP webcam app to use my phone for my webcam for zoom etc. on my pc since the pando started. Granted that top down view thing is pretty cool."
bro how come can your videos be always this perfect. goddamn now i'm hyped over an iOS update
Thanks!
Is it still beta?
Just the slickest most professional and enjoyable tech review channel out there!
"Well done to Apple for helping it‚Äôs customers to keep being focus and less distracted üôè BUT ‚ö†Ô∏è

The lock screen might be (too much) if you choose to have a lot of information (widgets). Still, we are all humans and we need to calm down a bit with the information intake ‚ö†Ô∏è

Therefore, highly recommend not put a lot of widgets once you get IOS 16. Even though it is some what tempting ü§Ø keep it as clean as possible and enjoy that lock screen background üí°

Am i not right? üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è"
No you are wrong
Got the beta version 2 days ago and it‚Äôs been really smooth. Everything is cleaner and better rounded. I love the new Lock Screen features and the variety you have. It‚Äôs been great and smooth these past few days!
@Smartphone Fuchs yeah no shit its a beta isnt it stable yet
@sedkai me also! Especially the battery drain is incredible
"Everything has been ok, but I‚Äôm with you on the battery loss. I think it‚Äôs just because the software isn‚Äôt fully complete and this is just the beta version. I‚Äôm sure it will be fixed soon though"
"I just downloaded it but I‚Äôm concerned about reports of overheating and fast draining battery. I‚Äôve already Had the messages app crash on me twice, what‚Äôs your experience so far with this?"
"Basically they‚Äôre making Android, iOS."
"Thanks for showing us the new features, downloaded the beta and testing it now"
"1:53 has anyone else kinda come to hate live text a bit? I keep highlighting text on websites that use images for thumbnails on articles etc. when I just want to open the link in a new tab.

The feature is still handy sometimes so I wouldn't want to turn it off, but man I hate having to be careful not to long press on text on images if I don't want it to happen so I'm definitely turning off the objects one."
I‚Äôd say the thing I‚Äôm most looking forward to is ‚Äúmark as unread‚Äù for iMessage. My 2013 Focus automatically dismisses the notifications from my iMessage when I get a text while driving and I ALWAYS miss out on responding in a timely manner. Also helps when accidentally reading a message and wanting the notification to remember to respond.
Came here to say this. Can't believe this didn't make the list!
"Intro never gets old üòá

So it's iOS with a Miui lockscreen and a camera feature that you'll use only if you make conference calls on you MacBook and for some weir reason need to shoot at plain objects on your table

"Anyone else remember using the Profiles in Nokia, more than a decade ago what Apple now calls ""Focus mode""."
Is there always on display on iphones?
The top down view blew my mind‚Ä¶ I spent a minute trying to figure out what I was looking at and then realized how insane that is. Hats off to apple..
Seems like useless update for me ‚Ä¶ü´§
"@Vladimir Putin  except the Lock Screen ,really nothing new

"The lock screen changes though, my phone unlocks when I look at it, it's kind of counter-intuitive to have these functions for a lockscreen when most phones are setup to unlock on face recognition. Top down view is very cool, great idea, unless or until you need to do something with your phone screen while broadcasting in top down view, guess you could always buy a second iPhone."
the more and more I see what Apple is doing with the iphone the more i'm happy with Android :-)
"It is becoming more androidish, yuck"
Uhhhh . . .  NO!!!
"The ""virtual top-down view"" and the ""Live Image"" features are hella impressive, close to being magic. Well done, Apple."

"Who cares a big Flag ship phone brand can't even perform a volte calls without data on & video calls without data on, & no charger with an excuse for packaging pathetic"
Apple is soo genuis
Nice joke
"Yeah but can you change a video quality in a browsing player ? Don‚Äôt think so . On android general media player let you select a video quality of the source , in iOS it choses 360p and higher quality only if you apply desktop version . What a joke .."
0:13 üî•‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm sad that my trustworthy iPhone 7 I‚Äôve used for 5 years won‚Äôt get more updates
"wow, apple is actually getting serious about copying old android features now, and honestly, there's nothing bad I can see about this update - which is not something that could be said about anything from Apple for a long time.

nice. maybe someone on the dev team actually cares about useability.


does not absolve them of their environmental and anti-repair, anti-customer crimes though"
I always replay those sick intros.
super bug in ios: Not able to edit the phone number on the dialpad from anywhere in between. Hoping this will be resolved
"Finally I can sens d*ck pics with just the d*ck, and no background. I want nothing to distract."
"What if I want to ""lock"" my lockscreen? Doesn't long pressing the lockscreen cause accidental changes?"
Pov: you are watching this on your android phone lol
As a long time android user I have to say these are very nice changes and it's cool to see some of the customization that android is so loved for make it to iOS - I guess people who already use iOS don't care but for me these are super welcome changes. Maybe with iOS 17 or 18 I can consider an iPhone now!
"In sum, IOS 16 has yet to showcase something truly revolutionary and unique, other than the desktop view. Although, it can be replaced by screen sharing."
"That edit function looks like is badly thought of then. We can't expect everyone to be on the latest iOS. At worse, it should resent the edited version if the recipient is on <iOS16, at best disable the functionality to edit / unsend if the recipient is on <iOS16."
The heptic and the costumization is what android been do for more than 10 years now!
Android user here: can't wait for Google to clone the live objects before too long
This intro was f.awesome!
where did you get these nice wallpapers bro
"If they really want iMessage to be somewhat of a good messenger, they at least would need to update the apps on all currently supported devices. Also the ones which will get dropped with the new iOS."
"Apple adds a feature androids have for literally decades..
People: ""Ohh you precious dear darling...""

Androids literally be folding screens, putting fingerprint scanners & camera under display, giving the best looking screens & phones, all the customizations in the world, infinite software features, letting you keep some of your money compared to apple, etc
People: ""Ohh you fkin donkey..."""
hahaha It's true isn't it?
what about the battery heat
Let us change the Ringtones! Sick and tired of same Ringtones!!
That intro‚Äôs so dope
During lockdown I was playing magic the gathering with mates remotely. This camera trick would have been amazing back then
They still have a 100 limited call log record?
"i am not buying an iphone because of a very very important feature which isn't available yet in any iphones, Realtime caller ID or Realtime Truecaller ID, This is a very important feature which saves you from all the Spam calls."
For iphone 11 ???
Bro that intro!
"I've been using the beta as my daily driver & its been working NEAR perfect. 

Really happy with the new life its given my 13 Pro Max."
"@Aaron Gorman ok yeah, that makes more sense when you put it like that. Just using more of phone's potential"
Apart from that. It‚Äôs been really smooth / battery efficient
@Arthur Larin just main app crashes / instability for the apps that didn‚Äôt upgrade to the new backend / api changes.
"@Rand0mTV hahahahah I know, but it‚Äôs not the case! The logic behind what I said is that iOS 15 didn‚Äôt even touch the full potential, this is really taking advantage of the extra memory / processing power of the newer phones."
You are saying that like 13 Pro Max is an old dying phone üòÇ
is ios 16 available now ??
what about normal calculator
A+ on the intro
Haptic keyboard is AWESOME
level‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è
Mic sounds different..... A loud humming sound in background like a aircon... Annoying
6:00 Mind blown üò≥
I hope the always on display is a feature on iPhone 15 pros.  It‚Äôs about time they get that feature.
excellent review. thanks
Didn‚Äôt only IOS 16 beta come out?
Is it possible already to pin apps to various places in the screen? like it's possible in android to pin apps to the bottom of the screen
Video is super clean
iOS is more customisable than Android right now.
16 ios could  make  my final  switch to  iphone
I've been switching from ios to android and vice versa almost all my life but never realised there was no haptic keyboard on the iPhone

That intro was insane
Yay marqass brownlee's favourite OS and phone!
I would never use the beta update but I‚Äôm going to wait till September for the real update
"I honestly love iOS 16. I've been using it since Day 1 on the dev beta and even on the first day it was incredibly stable. The amount of bugs I've run into with this beta run has been very very nominal. The one thing that kind of kills me though, is iOS 16 STILL doesn't allow for multiple timers. The damn Apple Watch has been able to do multiple timers forever, but the iPhone still hasn't figured that out, so if I want two timers I have to do one on my watch and one on my phone, it's a bit frustrating."
The intros are SO good now that the corresponding companies ought to think about buying these short showcasing videos...
7:28 that glitch tho lol
"Congratulations you have been selected among our shortlisted winners from our previous giveaway, text the number above^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^"
"IOS is now so customizeable if not more than most android in term of UI and is a solid UI too, that's insane to think about if you look back 2 - 3 update ago."

that keyboard? with the swipe. is that new to ios16 or have i just been dealing with hasle of trying to get gboard(googlekeyboard) to work??
What do you mean its not stable enough to make it your mainüòÇ... Thats an understatement
this intro üò±
Best intro of mkbhd I found so far
I like how Huawei is cheap and the picture quality and the battery is very very good. What I don't like tho is that they nearly never make new updates! I really hate that about my Huawei smartphone. Samsung is way more expensive and the battery is way weaker but at least they updated the phone really often it felt like every week.
Great intro :)
opening was so sick
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos
wow 3 milion views in 1 day :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
THE INTRO LOOKS SICKK üëèüëèüëè
Cool That Thanks!  How Can I Use It On My Xs Max Now?

Anyone know when the public beta version will be released? I wanna wait for the Public beta cuz I want to use it on my daily
What an intro
Hey guys how do I try to make videos with cell phones like the one in the intro?
i'm excited from the lock screen alone lmfao
"One thing I wish apple had was being able to control more of your sounds. On my android I can adjust media, ringtone, alarm ect all from my home screen. My iPhone will only do ringtone except when using media then it will only do media volume."
Wow sick intro
Wow sick intro
"They are beautiful, I can‚Äôt wait to change my iPhone 6"
@Harvey Whitehouse yes I know that‚Äôs why I said I can‚Äôt wait to change it
Iphone 6 can't get IOS 16
That intro was super clean and really good
"Just wanted to note something not mentioned is ""Lock Down Mode"". It is a major step in the right direction in protecting vulnerable people from having their security breached (e.g. human rights activists, journalists etc.)"
Does the Lock Screen include Tesla battery state?
why can‚Äôt i pick up subjects from background on iphone 8 ios 16
Craig has to be mad he didn‚Äôt get to use that intro
Where can one get the cellphone mount for the webcam feature on the MacBook?
"@MKBHD I was hoping you could do unboxing of Nothing Phone 1, but i guess its not gonna happen."
Looks a little like android tbh

"How about a stupid icon that indicated your phone is in silent mode. how many times people forget that their phones are in silent mode and missed calls or notifications.
there is nothing to remind people they are in silent mode except for the physical switch on the side which nobody looks at."
Guessing all of them works on my iPhone 13 and not reserved for iPhone 13 pro or max (referring to top down view camera)
i‚Äôm sorry but the whole hang your phone on your laptop thing is so something steve jobs would‚Äôve hated to see. i think he would‚Äôve just made sure the laptops have better cameras..
And now I'm ready to move over to Apple. Android has been good to me but stagnant for years. iPhones have a vibe now that I'm all for.
It‚Äôs not supported in all regions some of these new features‚Ä¶ üòê
iOS is finally coming along. Now get rid of apps on the home screen and get a drawer already.
"It's crazy that they are adding haptics on the keyboard finally. Just for that purpose I have been using Gboard. It feels so cheap not having haptic feedback when I type. Finally they are bringing that on the board, and I can just delete Gboard app."
Intro is sick man
More than half of those features aren‚Äôt available in my country. Literally.
this is just a reiteration of you wwdc impressions video..
"Incredible intro, as usual."
Apple is Closing Gap Between Android and Ios rapidly year by year........Just ADD DUAL SIM SLOT man that's much NEEDED!!!
that's gotta be the best intro yet
"What are those colorful ring things on the desk? Please anyone tell me, it's itching my brain lol"
iPhone 7 got PLAYED. Big Time.
That intro is so good
"Not sure if it has already been mentioned, but you don‚Äôt have to drag to drop the subject form a picture. If you long press and release once the subject is highlighted, a ‚Äúcopy/share‚Äù option will pop up. It makes it so much easier!"
@John Hero i m.. but no work on iph X
@Tomislav Nikoliƒá upgrade to ios 16 and it will work
Thank you for that

This trick with subject photo not work on iphone X?
For the lock screen can you add fonts??

Yup. That intro was straight up dope.
Didn‚Äôt know a man could be so smart and handsome and buff. Thanks
I‚Äôm really curious how this works with Android users.

Very interesting thank you for saying
Surprised Apple hasn't contacted you about working on a commercial for them XD. Intro is killer man
"As someone who preferred Android more, I'm intrigued to give iPhone a chance to be my daily driver"
"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
as an iPhone fan- this is a boring upgrade."
I love the #4!
"All that customization makes it look like Android, and I hate it. We still can't move icons where we want them tho. I'm not 12, I don't care how my font looks like."
"Your iPhone videos make me so happy, even though I can't afford an iPhone yet üòÖ"
To be honest I would use none of these features! My home and Lock Screen is solid black and that‚Äôs how it will stay!
bro these text updates are made for cheaters. Im keeping my android da fuq
"Bro my hear dropped when he said Iphone 8 and later 
Cuz I still have a 7!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Great vidya MKBHD! Glad u testing betas so I don't have to!
"Thr skip video button is on the mid centre now? How i use my phone with one hand, and do other stuff with other hand"
Apple and features? ü§£ what a joke
When will we finally be able to have the ‚Äúclose all apps‚Äù button?
Fin.
i really just want the lockscreen to change with the cover of the song playing . or atleast the option to get the big media player with the bigger album art(like  the iso 7 one i think)
in 8 years never locked my phone ... one of most useless feature to me
There is no reason apple can‚Äôt put a better camera in their laptops. It‚Äôs just silly at this point.
"I lost count of the amount of times that I have  Shazamed the intro music to an MKBHD video, find it on Youtube, blast the whole song, download it THEN go back and watch the rest of the video."
And this is why we still keep buying apple products lol. i know might not be huge updates but the ease of use and simplicity is what matters to most of us.
I never seen a YouTube with 15 million subscribers. That‚Äôs crazy!!!üî•üî•üî•
this is fucking insane apple out does themselves every year like at the start of this year I thought this update would be disappointing because we didn't get any leaks at all apple seriously did a way better job this time
"Of all the new features, the haptic for the keyboard is the one I'm excited for. Just wish they could FINALLY add clipboard manager like all other Android manufacturer."
I'll finally be able to uninstall the Gboard keyboard. Only use it since it enables haptic feedback
I‚Äôm also being making complaints to add the clipboard gestures on their keyboard too. üò≠üò≠
That intro itself deserve a like üî•
#1 feature is pretty good however if they took the screenshot then it will be a mess
"No one gonna talk about how you still can‚Äôt customize the buttons at the bottom? More specifically the camera button‚Ä¶ makes no sense to have a camera button that takes longer to open the camera than a simple swipe left on the Lock Screen ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Would much rather have the option to change that button to something else"
"I really perked up when you said ""Face ID works in landscape now"", finally!"
Will they fix the Focus mode not turning off on the specified time?
Does the Icons rotate when turning the iPhone landscape like the iPad?
The easter egg this video is book(?) with XVI ü¶Ö
3:22 nah I dislike the safari video fast forward 10 sec. when I'm watching üåΩ I'd like it to stay at the edge where it always been
Anyone know a fix for my Face ID to unlock the phone after the 16 update?
I just wish i own one of those Macbooks
"Didn't know the iphone's mic was THAT good, I thought you were using a studio mic."
I am being excited to get this update! One thing‚Ä¶how many more years until they allow you to place app icons anywhere on the screen?
10 years
It's crazy how the entertainment industry works now. This dude just gives his 5cent reviews on products manufactured by actual innovaters and academics and he has made so much money haha. The world is crazy
the way they made the clock interact with the background is everything ive ever dreamed of
Now all of the iPhone users that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt care about customization‚Äù wont be able to shut up about all of the customization.
That's it. My next phone will be an iphone.
"definitely updating, that looks sick!"
2:30 Nice driver from TXG there
I want your phone‚Äôs wallpaper anyone know how to get it?
Where can we buy that iPhone MagSafe MacBook mount?
Apple need to separate media volume and ringtone volume.
who made that CLEAN intro
"I can't stand the haptic feature. Feels like an electric shock ‚ö° Pass! *This new iOS 16 is a battery killer!* No thanks. üëéüèº Apple will use the feature to push pop-up ads on your lock screen. Yayyy! Forcing you to watch ads! The notch was bad enough and still annoying but this iOS 16 will not be for the better like everyone thinks. I'm not installing until I have no choice. No one is seeing the smoke screen with the other playful enhancements but trust me, you'll going remember me. Companies will begin pushing ads on your lock screen phones‚Äîevery platform."
I‚Äôve been asking for the ability to mark messages as unread for years. So happy it‚Äôs finally here.
will the haptic feedback on keyboard affect battery life a little?
the haptic touch feels weird when you type
Apple should hire you for that intro
"The camera thing is lame.
Why should I buy a $1000+ phone to have a good Webcam, when they can just put a better camera in the laptop.

My laptop costs less than the iPhone and it has a 1440p from facing camera.

Apple can easily do this for what they charge for the Mac.

Nothing shown was all that great considering like you said, most was on Android.

I do however like you can cut a piece from a photo or video and have it mask out the background.

For me to do that, I use my pen on my Note to draw around the object to cut what I need. Close, but not quite as easy. So that was pretty cool.

Not good enough for me to buy the phone, but it is very useful."
That notch tho
Why not that freaking always on display.....WHY?
'Live Activities' is hands-down my favourite new feature. I hope developers really buy into and support this feature and it doesn't have wasted potential like the touchbar.
Do you think you can use the continuity camera with your iPad and iPhone or is it just for iPhone and apple laptops
About time üëçü§£
Lmao I had to right click and go to stats to see what frame rate you use when you showed that message
"Ok, your team killed it with this intro."
Looks more like android
I‚Äôve had the beta for a month as well and having a fully customizable Lock Screen always has people asking / talking to me about them.

"I'd be interested in more software reviews! Things like MacOS, Final Cut, Windows 11, etc. I think reviews from people who use them often (most YouTubers/tech enthusiasts)"
ATTENTION APPLE -2022 - and still No Multitasking!!!!!!!!!!
"No split screen UI like iPad? 
Apple: Even better than that. You now have lockscreen widgets like Android.
OK?"
Rip android
"Why is no one calling out the fact that you can only have 1 row of widgets, it's extremely annoying!"
I don't like the photo blocking the clock on the home screen. WTF

it's amazing how long ago you could do all this with Android
When will Continuity camera be available ???

Its cool that they didnt focus on upgrading look of the iphone and went all in on small important updates! TY Apple
A really underwhelming update tbh
The feature where you can tap a picture and bring into your message app is so coolüò≥
You forgot about the wifi password show feature‚Ä¶..i love that a lot
at first i didn‚Äôt like the notifications but i love it now it‚Äôs great customizing your wallpaper is cool too
apple adds real customization confirmed?!
"The background remover is huge, at least for me personally. Being a content creator I do this all the time and it's always a pain to do, or I have to pay a website to do it well. Let's hope that it cuts the photo out in full resolution!"
"Just quickly, I've been using my iPhone as a webcam for ages. There's a bunch of great apps that allow you to use it wirelessly. Desk view is sick though"
Jidion üíÄ
"Man, these intros are getting crazy. It's really cool to see you always getting better."
Can‚Äôt wait to use this iOS !!!
one thing i really hope apple does is make it so some of there preset backgrounds that are light mode activated can be dark mode activated too. It‚Äôs just something i‚Äôve been really wanting
Jesus Christ is the Son of God and he loves you more than anyone else in existence including yourself!!!! Jesus Christ died on a cross for your sins and he rose from his grave on the third day for your salvation and resurrection!!!!  Worship Jesus Christ and follow him and Jesus will save your soul from an eternity of torture and torment in Hell!!!! You will spend eternity with Jesus in Heaven!!! Love you!!!
I can't wait until iOS 16..unfortunately I can't run it on my daily driver because I use it for work as well. I have an unrelated question though. I have a chance to buy an Apple Watch series 5 like really cheap. I wonder if it would be worth it or just upgrade for a series 8 when it's released? Or even a series 7 now? I currently have a series 3...thoughts?
hello how are you
I feel like the market performance of this product will be pivotal to apple's success because this is the first time Apple has strayed away from it's controlling nature and limited UI customisability in the past.. if this product fails that will be a knock on apple's resume as they have always been successful till today with the first company to boldly remove the headphone jacks even getting mocked by the likes of Google and then making the same companies bend to apple's bold decision but if it succeeds then it will prove that apple is just a damn brilliant company at predicting and/or driving customer behaviour. We are at a landmark moment in this organisation or have I hoped this up too much?
realy for the better because Pac Attac is gone? NO oh PAC is hardware based so Apple cannot fix it. so in the real World Apple is worthless junk that anybody that knows how to use thor browser can hack these days. you must be mentaly disabled to spend the money for anything with an Apple logo on it.
Is it stable enough to use it as my daily ?
I'm an android user and Android on OnePlus or similar phones is so good but when it comes to flagship no one's even close to the perfection of iphones samsung after abandoning their Exynos will sure give competition to apple
Most image/pictures features only work in iPhone XS and newer devices.
Intro fire as always
As an Android user I'm jealous about that Live Object feature üòÖ

*(Look up at the sky and ask God)*"
does the sound seem bad to anyone else here?
Shit looks windows 11 on the thumbnail
Everything that android has had are coming to iOS finally üòÇüòÇ and all of you fan hoes eating it up like it is something new!! Apple always behind. Only thing somewhat impressive was the long press on the image to copy it and paste it but other than that all that customization we been having it for the longest!!.
"Not All, and do you fkn see the perfection here? Not the glitchy bad crappy animation of your phone, and those artificial intelligence work is absolute not comparable to anything else, and btw samsung copy wayyyyy more from Apple even the bad stuff like removing charger jack all of itü§£"
"My fav thing would be to have back the fingerprint sensor‚Ä¶ and I still have hopes for the new iPhones but with the notifications coming from the bottom in this new os, I find hard to believe Apple is having fingerprint sensors back. The camera thing is wow! Fantastic!"

incredible edit but i just hope you weren‚Äôt purposely making the videos more than 10 minutes for the ads :/
We 100% need these awesome wallpapers!
Nice guy at 3:01 hahaha
this intro could've easily been the official introduction of IOS16 !!!! Amazing work!
Marques in on another level! This guy is awesome!!!
somehow MKBHD has higher production value than Apple wtf...
noone cares about anything here
And Siri ?
You can also press the cover art when listening to music to transition the art from the small view in the video to the cover art covering the full lock screen
Wallpaper customisation is so good on iphone but I heard no talking about the 3d icons on ios 16
I already knew everything he was going to say but it‚Äôs an MKBHD video so I watch it anyway
Barely 30 seconds into the video and just gotta say that intro at 0:13 was so good!
pog
The delete and edit of iMessage not working on older OSs makes no sense. Just update the app for them too? Why does it need a whole OS update for such a simple feature to work?
iOS 16 is finally an update worthwhile. Downloading beta as I type :-)
"Real quick, you pronounced it IOS Ventura with a ‚Äúch‚Äù instead of the ‚Äút‚Äù which is fine but as a local, few people don‚Äôt pronounce it that way."
the only thing I can't do is edit  the lockscreen! Do I have to activate something??
"My Home Screen is me with a lightsaber overlapping the clock, and when I turn on my phone it looks like the lightsaber ignites"
I wish they would implement a landscape video toggle when watching videos on safari.. it‚Äôs so annoying to have to unlock screen orientation and then rotate and then re-lock it after
still don't have the headphone jack like my Samsung.  i can charge my phone and listen to music at the same time is all i ever need.  not everything uses bluetooth so thats a big win
Siiiick intro
Cool intro!
"this seems to be one of the better iOS updates. still waiting for iOS 17 and the iPhone 15 Pro though
- Android user"
Not enough changes to me for a version change I think Apple has gotten stagnant with both software and hardware. For years I've been Apple only now I've switched over to Android and Windows. Missing somethings but the controlling phone completely with Windows with phone link is pretty cool. Also Apple's support has gone to 90% overseas making interactions with support a living nightmare.
"K, I have an S22 ultra. But God damn this is great! Maybe we should just all flip flop between android and apple whenever we want and have that be normal ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Sick intro!! üôå
That intro üî• Amazing Team!
if you pick up your phone 100 times a day you may have a bit of an addiction
That glimpse of the foreground/background feature at the intro.. ü§©üòç
"hey man , a MKBHD tech review using the continuity camera would be dopeüòÉüòÉ.."
The new Lock Screen is insanely amazing!
Great transition at 0:20 My designer eyes approved haha!
Love the intro!!! üî•
Thank you so much
Been a Samsung user since birth but I'm switching to iPhone 14 because of the stickersü§£ü§£ yes Samsung you are loosing a customer because of stickers ü§£. And I will miss multitasking but stickers are fun
looks good
This is my favourite MKBHD video!
What about the battery doe
"great video, as always! Still got a couple of questions about continuity camera:
1. Do you need the Belkin mount? If not: how far aways can the phone be from the Mac?
2. Does the topdown mode only work with iPhones with an ultra-wide or is it just ""not that good"" on iPhone 8, X, Xs?
3. Can you manually change between the phones cameras or is it locked to the 1x camera?
4. Can you manually change (just like in the camera app on the iPhone) the exposure or even lock the AF & AE?

Thanks for any answers, looking forward to the new software updates!"
Has anyone found the belkin clip URL?
"and a couple more:

5. Does it work with the front facing camera, too?
6. What's on the phones display while using this feature? Can you still use it?
7. Can you use it in the Mac Photobooth app and if so, what's the resolution then of pictures and videos?

Ok that's it, I swear..."
iOS 16 is looking nice!
"It boggles the mind how apple can roll out a super feature which is a game changer like the continuity camera, and also lets you customize your lock screen clock font like android 1.6 in the same update."
"He said: ""All The Small Things"" 

Well, he is a blink-182 fan! Ha! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I've been using android phones for 10 years but I think iOS 17 will be the one to make me switch...
wen multitasking?
"Dude, telegram does the editing and deleting of sent messages"
"JBH
old lock screen > new lock screen
OG üëë‚ú®"
So still we cant customize our iphone ringtone even in ios16 natively ?? may be they might focus that feature for ios17 ? XD
"Apple iPhone, everything has now become a dream come true but my phone has been stolen. I like the new cool lock screen."
They ruined wallpapers.

Just watched the intro for 69th time
This with an always ON display is enough to sell me the new one coming out this September!
And yet not being able to use your phone in any way because you stuck it to your laptop is the biggest downfall. I use my phone during meetings for many reasons. To me it seems like the biggest false good idea.
Great information that introduces the most important features.thank you so much.
"After awful experiences with two previous iPhones, warming up to Apple again with a Macbook Air 2021 and it's solid.  But now adding some customization to the home screen and haptic feedback...Apple is only, what, a DECADE behind now?  The iPhone is slick, but I'd still take an Android because that horrendous notch at the top is every bit as atrocious as it was when it was first released."
Sick intro!!
Will have to test out the haptic.  Currently use Samsung and generally very happy.  But my LG V-series phones had the best haptics for typing that I've used.  We'll see how Apple stacks up..
Haptic feedback is by far my favorite iOS 16 feature.
Roman numeral 16 on the bookshelf behind you‚Ä¶ just saying
Where can I get some of those wallpapers??
What are those colorful rings on the desk?
"It looks like some great changes are coming! Thanks for another interesting vid, Marques. I'm curious: Of all the tech people I watch/talk to, you pay special attention to weather apps it seems. I'm wondering if you have a particular reason?"
You forgot about the new voice-to-text keyboard. Can you talk about that?
Who else is watching on android?
That intro/snap though!  ü§©ü§©
Bro the intro to this vid was sick man. Keep it up :)
Amazing Intro! üî•
M2 macbook air
Finally Haptics on the native keyboard!! Much needed!
"I‚Äôm on iPhone 12 Pro ,ios 16 developer beta 3 but Face ID doesn‚Äôt work in landscape for me"
Please just make a volume mixer for aps .
"Love you, love the channel. No hating. Obviously this is subjective... but 30fps takes the entire epic camera setups you have and brings them down considerably to almost consumer grade in a lot of circumstances, especially anything involving motion. It takes the immersive-ness of a 48th second shutter over 24p when dealing with motion and really makes it look like a stock camera shooting in Auto mode."
"I am watching this on my iPhone 7,
Don‚Äôt ask me why"
#4 üòÇ
That mighta been the best intro there‚Äôs been
That intro üôåüôåüôåüôåüòé
I want so bad to try this new lock screen!
"I mean... cool, that iMessage gets now the features all other messengers have for years, but who uses it anyways? I know not a single person."
Your intros are amazing!!!!
Please tell me where to find wallpaper art
Where can I get that continuity clip?
"nobody gonna believe but i still use iphone6 cuz i got no money for new one
is it embarrassing to tell?"
"iOS really looks polished in this update, but it makes you wonder if all this customization they're copying from Android will make some people mad that preferred iOS because of how simple it was."
Still wish they added a fingerprint censor!!!!!
I installed the public beta but I am not able to select text in a video and I cannot select the subject of an image and paste it in whatsapp tho
"Why do we ""still"" have the super annoying white home bar after so many years of the new swipe interface!"
my 5 year old pixel 2 does all that right now. am i missing something.
hey you the so called you tubers some of the region‚Äôs and and some of the reasnonal youtubers didn‚Äôt got the review units what‚Äôs the problem man is it india are not the tech things like views and the subscriptions
where is your review man about the so called phone called nothing ‚Ä¶.
Wait... They're having haptic keyboard feedback now ...? üò≤
"5:08 ""that's genius"" no its not that fucking common sense"
"Damn, that intro was on a whole new level!"
This intro is absolutely nuts
"Omg the intro is very very clean üßº 
Amazing ü§©
Your communication skills is always good Marques."
üé© Hats off to the graphic and motion graphic team. üî• Awesome intro as always!
it wont change for me bc i have iphone 7 baby
"That's great Marques but don't you think they missed to add vibration when the call is answered. 
Please see if you could suggest them about this."
Still no ‚Äúunread‚Äù feature for messages?! Come on Apple.
That intro was fire! üî•üî•üî•
XVI (16) in the backround. Appreciate it.
"every year they add more and more and i do not use any of these ""features"" mostly have everything default"
I've got an  iPhone X and I ain't got the option to upgrade to iOS 16 ):
"And now, let the best home screen designs game begins! Ready, set...GO!!"
"Live Objects looks miraculous.  What a gift to film historians!  
Thanks, brother!"
The best intro ever
"So keyboard haptics are off by default, but the annoying audible clicks are still on by default. That's the very first thing I turn off setting up a new phone."
I think IOS is the best OS. It can‚Äôt have it all but it‚Äôs too good.
Is it gonna be on iPhone XR?
"It is really unacceptable, that edit and unsend would be broken across iPhones. There are a great number of people that use iPhones older than iPhone 8. It really isn't that hard of a software trick to enable. If Facebook Messenger can offer that feature on every iPhone ever made. 15 minutes is far too short of a window. Try 12 hours, or 24, or 48 like Telegram does."
I think IOS is the best OS
The timer on the lock screen for me is going to be the biggest feature on iOS 16
Who else wants a studio channel video on how this intro was made
i watched the video yesterday but came back for the into üòç
iPhone 7p owner dislike this video
"Wow, one of the best intros I've seen in a while. Love the editing!"
Is it finally possible to put more than one timer in the new ios? üòÖüòÇ
that video at the beginning ü§©ü§©
frame rate slander continues :(
the continuity camera doesn't work right now for me. it just crashes and does nothing
We need sort by usage every where
99%üîã
"Everytime I think of moving to IOS from Android, android had all those features long ago."
All these features... ü§™... I'm getting old. Do people really need them?
Thank you for the easy to understand explanations!  Great video
That intro though ü§å
Love the delete messages for the iOS 16
"Saving this for when I get the iPhone 14! Love how well these videos are put together, shot and just everything!"
The feature I'm looking forward to the most is definitely the haptic keyboard as I've just recently switched over from Samsung to an iPhone 13 and the absence of the keyboard vibrations has been really tricky getting used to lol
"@ScapeDrag7 Small phones are mainly marketed to people who were teens or young adults in the early 2000‚Äôs who hated the way phones gradually got bigger and bigger. As a child of the 2010‚Äôs though, I find the iPhone 13 Pro‚Äôs size to be quite manageable and comfy. You‚Äôll always find older adults with the Pro Maxes because of eyesight problems or they like the feel of a bigger phone in their hands. Teens and young adults now are an either or. Some like the big phones others like the minis, they don‚Äôt really have a set preference."
@ScapeDrag7 there are loads of us. thats why the iphone se was one of the most requested phone before it came back in 2020.
@Luis Diaz same bro same happened with my both last two phone  got slowed after 2 years . I haven‚Äôt updated iPhone because they are known for slowing
@Apricreed wow ive never seen someone who like small phones
LIFE CHANGER. AM I RIGHT?? HAPTIC KEYBOARD CHANGED MY LIFE.
"Just finished watching this amazing video ,now time to watch the super awesome intro again and again......üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ"
"How about the duplicate photos feature? I love it! Photos can spot out duplicates so you can delete them, or you can merge them together"
Whats the gadget called kn 5:40
"IOs is way ahead of andriod in performance and now apple is trying to follow up andriod's features 
At the other end , andriod is way ahead in features , now they have to follow up with ios in peeformance 
I dont care who copy whom , because it will definitely benefit us"
is iphone 14 base gonna have ios 16 ?
Sooooooo the top feature is something Android has had for years? üíÄ
IOS 16 NOT RECOMMENDED SERIOUSLY SHITTY UPDATE EATS YOUR BATTERY SLOWED MY PHONE REALLY BADLY I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO UPDATE
did they fix all the no brainer options and features that android has and IOS doesn't?  if not this is useless
Not gonna lie I‚Äôm actually really impressed with this iOS rev
"Wow 

Thanks for the info on ios"
I am absolutely loving this software update. And thank you MKBHD for letting us know about the haptic feedback while texting. It is SO satisfying!
"fr, had ios 16 since beta 1 and didn‚Äôt know about the haptic keyboard"
"Easter egg - XVI.. white shelve in the background, 4th roll.. got you Marques üòÅ"
I think horizontal face id unlock is just available in iPhone 13
"the word he used most in this clip was ""finally""....""finally""...he might be happy now!!!! ""finally"""
While playing music you can tap the album cover an it fills youre lovkscreen. Pretty nice
Wow the new version allows you to change stuff on the lockscreen imcredible ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ what's gonna come next? Will they invent in screen fingerprint sensor coming with the iphone 14 pro max edge ultra 6g sierra crap 128gb trash?!?!?!?!
This is basically android 12
"hi marques, i love your videos !"
"Insane editing visuals as always, you continue to outdo yourself Marques."
"Great Video and awesome intro! I am really hyped for iOS 16. As a former android user i love seein that all these customizations are coming to the iPhone.
One feature that is really missing for me in focus mode is the ability to turn of specific mail or calender account with a focus mode. I dont want to get an E-Mail notifcation from a work mail in the evening."
For the first time in 5 years won‚Äôt be getting this new update on my 7 plus which I‚Äôve been using since 6 June 2017!
"Honestly with how far the iPhone has come in recent years, and now IOS 16, might have to switch to iPhone. Been an Android guy for a long time now, but with OnePlus descending into mediocrity it may be time to try what the other team has to offer."
When will this be a available?
hope apple improves its interface more
I like the live text and the web cam w/ the iPhone attachment then recording on the flat surface too! But  promised my husband I'd do android this next 2 years. Oh the things we'll do for love üôÑ
Shame they haven‚Äôt removed the camera of the Lock screen always thought it was and is completely pointless as all you need is to swipe left or been given  the option like in Android to choose the shortcut on the lock screen
One of the best intro ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
great changes
I love how at 8:20 he uses multiple top down shot sets to show off the different wallpaper. Shows how much effort is put into these videos!!!
More of nothing. 9 years of basically the same expensive garbage.
the haptic feedback is awesome!!
God damn that intro! üî•
What a introü´°
"Marques, you should have been the one to unveil NASA's James Webb Images. It would have been a whole lot more exciting if you had."
Phone clip you used were did you buy it
üëç
Inspiration from Windows live tiles...ü§îü§î
Still no T9 dialing?
Solid video as always üò§
High quality content
"Anyone else running the Public Beta have a solution for this:

You are not able to select a System image as a wallpaper (default iOS 16 wallpaper) for your Home Screen AND a photo from your Camera Roll as a wallpaper for your Lock Screen. No matter what steps you take, you can not have an image from your Photos as a Lockscreen wallpaper if you choose one of the wallpapers that come with iOS 16 as a Homescreen wallpaper. 

Am I ‚Äúholding it wrong‚Äù? Anyone?"
That intro is just SO GOODüò≠ Watched it again and again!
Picture in Picture works for YouTube app in ios16 üòè
"Still waiting
AoD from iOS . . .  

Still Waiting"
These are useless changes main changes required multi window app usage &phonebook access shortcut like android
I think it‚Äôs a missed opportunity if Apple iOS 16 doesn‚Äôt allow for swapping custom home screens/lock screens. But it‚Äôd require Apple to open up a bit. I don‚Äôt see that happening.
"Probably because thats what makes apple apple, and people seem to love it."
Intro is dope!
"Shout out to Apple for choosing ""Dowlat Abad Garden"" as one of their wallpapers, iran üáÆüá∑  packs a lot of beauty"

Is there a document you can read to remember all this?? Oh my!!!
"Very well explained, the most incredible thing is the camera trick, but I think it just works with apple ecosystem"
That intro is super dope
"What an intro Marquez, this time you guys out did yourself.

I was literally laughing at how cool üòé it was."

Ah man the intro is amazing!!!
I also want to choose a Homescreen for every focus. Like having different pictures for every focus
whoaa that introüî•
I'm glad I don't have to buy a webcam now because the built-in one on my M1 MBP is actually hot garbage. Thanks Apple!
And here I'm again with an android phone to watch iOS 16 review.....üòê
No wonder i can‚Äôt find any haptics option for the keyboard on iOS..turns out it doesn‚Äôt exist..
"MKBHD: So I have been using this womb for 9 months, here are my top 5 features. Full review coming soon."
live objects looks so sick
Only thing i want is a number row for the keyboard and splitscreen multitasking.

"iOS became better android, lol."
waiting for nothing 1 review!!!
Nothing new to android users
"To be fair, the live objects and the phone-webcam feature are new to both the apple and android ecosystems. But yea, the whole customization thing with the Lock Screen is nothing new to android users"
"Apple really lost inovation XD. Sheeps gonna love this silly update. Nothing is new, apple is just very far behind and is getting forward slowly with the rest."
"Between these amazing features and Samsung talking about turning lock screens into advertisements, I think it's time to change"
The intro!
"Why did the iOS 16 intro feel like a Apple advertisement? 
I really like the clock-in-background-feature"
"Looks like one more useless, battery drainer IOS update‚Ä¶"
Love the easter eggs in the background. The roman numerals for iOS 16 and weather book
"the animation and appearance of the 'copy|paste|cut' button has been made so much worse, it looks like a gimmicky Android phone animation trying to copy Apple'sü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Paid add.
"Security security , only thing important."
The intro looks like apple !
I‚Äôm super excited for the new Lock Screen Customization. So excited
The top desk view is insane ü§Ø
What's going on with the audio in this? Sounds very roomy.
"I switched from iOS to Android in 2018, and I've been pretty adamant that I don't want to go back.

iOS 16 (and the threat of Glance coming to my S22 lock screen) really makes me want to switch back to iPhones."
Did anyone notice the intro song? I think it's from an Indian show TVF Tripling

"I'm excited for this update, Apple was listening to the customers and what they are looking for as a user. They put alot of time in this update and I hope to have it soon I wanted to get the beta one but didn't want to mess with it just yet. I think I'll wait keep up the great work!!!"
"Marques, when is the IOS 16.00 update coming to public??"
nice intro
Live text is something Google's had for years. Live objects on the other hand.... amazing idea and feature.
#06 on trending on Pakistan
"Can Apple make an big iPhone with a built in Pen like the Note series, please i love my iPhone 13 pro but i want something like the sPen, i miss that from my note phones"
This comment has nothing to do with iOS 16.  Just adding it on here because This video is what I‚Äôm currently watching lol but looks like YouTube has FINALLY BEEN UPDATED TO SUPPORT PICTURE AND PICTURE! I‚Äôm not on any paid YouTube subscription.
"Leave everything, your intro is just awesome!!"
can we apreciate the aesthetic wallpaper Marques has
How did he make it say upcoming rain text? Mine only say degrees
"Bro,intro!!! Really?"
iphone finally being worth its value aside from the camera
That intro is on fire! ‚ù£Ô∏è from a future. ‚úåüèø‚úåüèΩ
"Could've included battery percentage :)
or that battery widget on lockscreen with percentage instead of phone icon ü•≤"
"FINALLY EDITING MY 1,000 TYPOS"
Nice intro bro
What an intro! üî•
"Best channel ever!
Love everything about this channel ü§©"
How do you copy and paste Live Photos?
"Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him!
Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!

Have a blessed day, everyone! ‚ù§"
"Your worries (yes, anxiety), depression, suicidal thoughts, EVERYTHING will melt away and be NO MORE when you lean on God and put your trust in him! When I have physical pain, I literally pray and the Lord quells it, that I am healed!

Know that there is power in the name Jesus Christ! His name casts out demons and heals! People are bothered by his name. The world hates the truth and wants to continue living sinfully! God's children are set apart (holy) and righteous."
"Imagine if the phone webcam was in quarantine, teachers would be able to see me using my phone below the computer"
Need the wallpaper shown at 9:30.
Having just switched to iPhone this makes my little android soul happy.
What about new features that will be added on Android 13? Make a video about that.
Big Thumbs up for that Intro!!
"The only thing I‚Äôm not incredibly impressed with would be the spotlight search that hangs out in the bottom of your home screen. If we could turn that feature off if we wanted, that‚Äôd be great."
@Revfarr great! I basically never use spotlight
"@Revfarr Sweet! Didn‚Äôt know that, thanks!"
"In the current iOS 16 Beta, you can remove the spotlight search. It‚Äôs in Settings > Home Screen > Search - Show on Home Screen > Toggle Off :)"
The top down feature looks pretty amazing. Imagine what AI enhanced camera could do in the future.
Everything is probably AI enhanced already
Literally drooling over the intro.
What are these Apple cards at 8:31 please?
are you jidion
"It‚Äôs kind of a bummer that my iPhone se won‚Äôt get support anymore,but it had a good run"
When do we talk about split screens on these? Can we start to make some noise.
"Lol, who else watched the intro like 10 times"
Oh man i can't wait for an ability to obstruct clock on my lockscreen
That intro...wasn't bad at all.
The fact that message editing only works for people who are on ios16‚Äîand that there's no way to tell from the sending end which ios the recipient is on‚Äîmakes me think this feature is almost completely useless. How is it acceptable to have a scenario where the same message history is different on two devices?
"ios 16 , introduce things android had for a decade, then they say green bubbles are antiquated."
Loved the intro man!
"The only time I ever see my lockscreen is when my fingerprint reader fails.
I suppose the facial recognition crowd has a different experience"

I personally never liked the haptic feedback actually disrupts me if I text fast. Even when I had android I had that disabled! Not sure why anyone would want their keyboard vibrate
All I want from apple to to make Face ID auto unlock instead of having to swipe after unlock.
I think a ton more can be added to the automations. Been using it for sending like reminders to multiple WhatsApp groups at specific timings now.
Why is the thumbnail is low quality
"With most phones locked these days, there needs to be a feature on the screen itself which shows your ‚ÄúIn case of emergency‚Äù dialling number. At the moment, its hidden inside a feature which many would not know how to reach."
When is that Belkin iPhone mount coming out?
"""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.""   
 -John 3:16
God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. 

We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him. 
We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. 

He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven

Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends
Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.


May God Bless you all"
"i was hoping for a huge theme change. i dont even use imessage on my iphone.i have it disabled. its much worse than telegram, even than whatsapp."
The intro to this vid was the best part!!
Am I the only one who NEVER uses IMessage and hopes it dies a quick fiery death?
The Lock Screen stuff is my favourite üòç
"This intro tho

Wow."
Not you can set a custom focus mode with your specific name and different font style and it will be visible at bottom of the lockscreen  like the androids have owner‚Äôs info.  üòâ
the iphone 6s is no longer supported from ios 16.. rip it served me well
You need to do some audio work on eliminating the a/c in the background from your shotgun recording
I‚Äôve been using iOS 16 for a while and I didn‚Äôt even know they added a haptic keyboard. That was the one feature that always kept me from using the apple keyboard and now they have it.
No drastic change
"For ‚Ç¨2.5 - ‚Ç¨3k that apple is asking me to pay for new macbook air, I would expect the iphone quality camera to be included in the laptop by default. Not that gimmicky holder to attach the phone to the screen‚Ä¶"
What about the possibility to lock certain apps with faceID/code. I also would love the option to lock hidden photos.
Any update to increase the call logs? Iphone gives only upto 100 calls history. This is utterly stupid thing by apple but It‚Äôs not complained much.
"I mean, but like I could watch MKBHD videos 24/7 simply for the amount of creativity and skill put into the intros and the overall video itself"
have they at least changed the ‚Äúadded to library ‚úÖ‚Äù from the massive screen intrusion to something smaller?
"One of the best intros ever !!
You‚Äôre invincible bro, you have my respect !!
Love from India‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Thx for the explanation , loved the new updates üëå"
Was hoping you‚Äôd be able to place apps wherever you want on the Home Screen instead of having them sort top to bottom still
The Hole screen setup is what I am really going to love
Totally nailed the intro bro
@Wilgax He has nearly 1.5m subs though
‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏û‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ö‡∏π‡∏°
Let's help this verified guy to have replies
More effort has been from the MKBHD team to make the slick video than from Apple implementing features Android (And even Windows Phone) had 12 years ago.
"Thats so awesome, love that I can edit my lock screen on my nexus since 2010 keep it guys!"
"‚ÄúFor God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.¬†(John 3:16) The bible says the wages of sin is death. Man has broken Gods moral law and has gotten the death penalty. However due to Gods mercy Jesus lived a perfect life and died on the cross for our sins to make us right with God. ‚ÄúGo and sin no more‚Äù-Jesus. trust in what Jesus did for you‚Ä¶because He loves you."
Great review as always mate üëçüèº
Omg‚Ä¶ number 4 is life changing
Apple needs to remove the SMS limit.
Dankpods gonna love number 2
"Holy shit that intro was <3 Shoutout to whoever makes them, they're wonderful"
So it‚Äôs getting android features now
IOS Google Pixel!
"Secondary relevant comment: I hate when I quickly hang up a iphone call and tap the ‚Äúend call‚Äù icon a couple times, and as soon as the call ends, my list of recent calls pops up and I accidentally tap a number where the ‚Äúend call‚Äù icon was and call someone. Add that to the list of updates if it wasn‚Äôt fixed here üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Nice intro
Still wish they would update the clock app with more features. I can't even set multiple timers!
apple should pay ur intro video for their adsüòÇ
Intro song: Devil's Tune (20syl Remix)
it tells you in screen time how many times you pick up and unlock your phone. turns out the answer is a lot more than you would think
That intro is insane-
Finally Apple did something what Steve was not wanting for Apple . Well that‚Äôs a congratulations for Tim Cook . But a huge cancer for Steve Jobs .
I first thought he had a picture of an android lock screen in the thumbnailüòÖ
That intro was absolutely fire
intro?! awesome
The Intro üî•üî•üî•
I hate my iPhone now and im gonna hate it after the update
I appreciates the warn.
"Almost two months with iPhone 12
Still don‚Äôt know what the file manager does"
So unique!
i really be controlling every now
Soon I'll be abandoning Android and coming to iOS
Live objects is absolutely hot fire!!üî•üî•
that intro was. wow.
Ios 16 is ugly idk why??
Oh no... Title video missed the good opportunity... :/
Do people still care?
Best intro ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Congrats iphone users 
For getting android oldest features in new upcoming iphone 14."
Still no split screen. I guess I'll keep using OnePlus phones as my work phone until Apple adds that feature. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Damn that intro üî•üî•üî•
Click batting is gonna be easier for everyone now üòÇ
That intro is super clean!
Will the lock screen work on an SE-2?
Apple will always be behind on everything ü§£ Everything they come out with has been out for years.
So any idea on when it's released
1:35 it actually shows ‚ÄòEdited to ‚Äúnew edited message‚Äù‚Äô for people on older versions
"imagine teachers telling you to use that continuity feature while writing an online exam, we're FFFD for sure"
that intro
"Do you really carry your iPhone without a case? How do you keep it from chipping around the camera apertures? I want to carry without a case sooooo bad, but I‚Äôve flung it from my hand while pulling from my pocket with a case on already."
"MKBHD: I've had the beta for iOS 16 on this iPhone Foooooooooor (Zooms In) a month, lol really tot he was gonna say 14 there. ü§£"
"MKHB: in texts if you are so disgusted on what you sent you can unsend a message completely which is pretty sweet
Me: Texting my ex when I am drunk üòÖ"
i will soon get a hand me down iphone 8 plus from my mother. i hope it works next year also
It‚Äôs the intro for me! Sheeeez
Is apple going to bring back fingerprint unlock? Hmm
"My gf had the iPhone 7. Since she wasn't getting the newest update, she decided to just get a Samsung A52 5g and she loves it. Headphone jack, sd card slot, 120 hz, it's an amazing phone."
"That continuity camera is black magic, nothing you can tell me"
03:07 Rain drops were falling on top of the weather widget. Whaat?!
"Dave from D2D had made a video about the top down feature but it got taken down, it is literal witchcraft and so close to being highly usable.
The intro was next level btw."
Need that mount asap
The awesome intro tracks are always so good that I feel numb for about a second before I continue watching the video. :)
2.2 million views later yaaaayyyyy I can finally load the video!  Good job YouTube!  üôÑ
"You know what would be a great upgrade? If I could adjust my alarm volume separately from my ringtone volume‚Ä¶
This is very annoying, and even my Samsung S7 was able to do that."
iphones cant do that? lol
I can't get the clock to do the foreground thing. I have no other widgets and it's still just regular.
"Kiddy stuff for kids l, Apple yet trying to stay stable with those edits and jokes"
As always top edition. The little details like that book with XVI when we talking about IOS 16. Nice touch üòâ
So i pick IP13 or IP14 pro/pro max ver?
That damn intro
That intro was incredible!
Nice
"I personally don't interact with the lock screen at all. I go directly to the homescreen. The customization options look great, though."
Lock screen update made iPhone just like any other Android üòÇ
Hourly weather is so clutch
bla bla bla
"Alas, now that they've added all the fancy fluff to the lock screen, I'm never going to be able to just disable it."
"As a Android user, it hurts to say but this new lockscreen is dope. I'm jelous."
the new video ui work in other browser too.
I so badly want poker card style web pages view not the tile one
This is like the 10th time I watch this
ya kno i actually feel weird bout that edit feature. doesnt that technically open the door fr more intrusive editing. cuz think bout it. ur editing text on someone eles device arnt u?
what wallpaper is 9:24 I need it pleasee
"Hi, can I ask what about the battery performance? Did you notice any drastic drainage for the new features? Thanks for the video tho! So hyped for ios 16 üòç"
@Jeremy West ah thank you so much for your reply! And thank you for your contribution in beta testing ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Beta1 was a bit rough on battery, I suspect due to the first version of the lock screen improvements. Battery got much better in beta2 and beta3 is as expected but still quite a lot of weird, deep bugs. 
I‚Äôve read on the beta forums most people reporting solid battery performance with a few outliers."
Is it safe to download the latest iOS 16 in beta version?
"Holy, the copying the subject of a photo is mind blowing to me"
If they start using usb-c I might actually consider Apple now
This Intro ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I can't seem to find the wallpaper from 8:26, anyone can help me out? It looks gorgeous!"
GODDAYUMMM THAT INTRO THOOO
I‚Äôve been using the beta since release on my daily.
Absolutely amazing effects and transition in first 20 second. Great great editing.
"Yoooooooo, that into tho!!!"
As always writing a comment to support the channel
"As a hard-core Samsung user, I must say the camera continuity feature/desk view is just top-notch! I am super envious of this. Great job Apple üëè."
@Brandon S. i can absolutely agree with you. I have had ios for 6 years now and i got a Samsung for the first time last year and it is much more easier to use and more user friendly
"@MissNelly I'm telling you 

I might be used to android, but my Samsung was way more user friendly. I counted a difference under settings of 11 more things on iphone... Stuff you don't even use

I was also able to connect my Samsung to myacbook with ease!"
"I just got my first iPhone after using android since smart phones were smartin. I actually kind of love it. The first 24 hours with it was the most frustrating experience of my life, but once it was set up, it‚Äôs been fast and reliable. Camera is amazing."
"Don‚Äôt worry I was Samsung for 15 years about 5 months ago went for 13 pro max and they are rubbish.
The iPhone fanboys are simply deluded. 
So many things are just crap, most notably the gesture controls, back takes you back maybe once then it changes and will delete emails etc,
I can‚Äôt believe how bad they actually are.
Yes the integration with iPad etc is fantastic but the phone themselves are poor.
I‚Äôd go back to Samsung in a heartbeat"
@Brandon S. sadly that apps suck i miss apples appls
Still no AOD üò≠
"Damn, that intro... üôåüôå"
Damnnn im excited for this update ‚Ä¶ got some really cool stuff and that webcam from my phone is gonna make things so much easier ‚Ä¶ Thanks Apple üíØ
Awesome
wow!  the individual selection of an object blew me
"Every year I see all of those changes to iOs which look so cool, it makes me want to have an iPhone even though I can't afford it"
"Different topic, any idea if still made in china?"
Lots of Easter eggs here.
"It cool an all, but I want a battery percentageü´†"
Give me all the walls
"So Apple has just added features that many android phones have had for over a decade and apple touts them as new features. What a joke. Think of it another way if you bought something brand new today and the big selling point are features from 10 years ago you would just buy something else. But its Apple so its OK, Wake up people. And as for tech  channels hypeing Apple updates as the next best thing shame on you tell the truth have your own opinions say it like it is. Just say apple is far far behind in new features and it's being done deliberately. And the simple answer is money, people will still buy there over priced products with out of date features because they want to belong to the it crowd, even if the product is not that good it's better to be in then out. Just explain why your channel which was one of the best tech channels now seems to worry that their opinions may upset Apple. Check your own videos you don't seem to mind stepping on the toes of other companies Sony, oneplus, ect but you seem to tread very carefully around Apple. Go back to how you started give your own honest opinion."
Live Weather lockscreen is the shiz...
"An important missing feature in iOS is a proper calendar reminder. The old Blackberry had the perfect one. It was basically an alarm, impossible to miss unless you postponed it or reset it. You can easily miss an appointment with iOS."
Go away bot
"I have an iPhone 11 and i m scared apple might slow my phone down if I get iOS 16. Was already sceptical for iOS 15, but did it anyway. 

But now I just don't feel comfortable messing with the phone right now, i love it and can't see it go slow."
Will your MBA M2 review include 8 core vs 10 core ? 8 core seems like it‚Äôll have better battery life with no major performance difference but they did gimped the M2 13 inch ssd on the base model :/ great video btw.
The web cam I had that in my Motorola Edge 20 for very long time now you only need to connect it via USB C cable
The Dope intro i ever saw in my entire life period.
ü§îü§îApple turns to Android ??
"before watching the entire content, must admit that intros are getting better and better every day."
desk view is crazy lmao
"Is it wrong that I only watch his videos for the intro like the tech is interesting but like you got to appreciate the work put into making an intro that good
Ps : nice vid"
Customizing lock screens like it's 2012 and I got an Android. I can't wait till all my iPhone heavy users show me this great new feature lol
I'm sorry that Apple doesn't think about Czech customers and the iPhone doesn't support the Czech keyboard for fast typing.  üòî
"I hope apple can change the automatic dimming of the contrast in your screen when playing a game, i really hate that feature. Then you can‚Äôt adjust it again unless you close the game and lock your phone"
"Incredible transitions and visual effects, terrible audio."
they should've add Always on Display as well
Now that intro is dope
That top down camera feature is a killer!
I know it's small but man I'm ready for haptic feedback in the native iOS keyboard
"Apple cracks me up with the juxtaposition of their amazing innovations and inability to offer basic things like hourly weather for so long. Seemingly every time I hear news about iOS, I smile and shake my head simultaneously."
"To me, the worst part is that apple has more money than most countries it still has trouble doing simple stuff right."
"You've expressed my feelings for it perfectly. My wife recently got an iphone13 and we've just been flabbergasted by all the ""fancy"" stuff it tries to show us it can do, while trying in vane to set it up to do the basic functions she expects it to be able to do."
"Ahhhhhh threintro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When the video played, I thought why there isn't an intro here? Then when I saw the intro... I just loved it! It has become my dream to work with you and your team!ü§©ü§©"
Wowüò≥
I love how Apple takes what works really well on one device and adapts it to other devices. The new Lock Screen is essentially the watch face but for the iPhone. Very nice
"Again about that edit and unsend-feature for i-message. I dont see any point for us normal people and only for narcissistic, evil and manipulative people.

We had a small group at work on messenger. We had one young guy who was mentally unstable and put up shit he regretted. I mean if you say something, then just delete it, it sounds bitchy. It sounds very unhealthy morally. The only person in that group deleting messages was him, and every time we all lost a bit of respect and trust in him.

I really dont like that feature.

You can have an argument with a very manipulative person that says shit, then that person can change what he/she has said and not take responsability and lie even more.

There really isnt any worthy upsides for it."
Everything!
Cool
I see you kept a roman numeral 16 in the background. Neat
"I love the lock screen updates. Took them way, way too long."
How about always on clock?
I hate hate hate the new lock screen. Looks like a cheap android skin
One step closer to android
That intro was   ...  ...  ...   delayed.
This intro god damnitüî•üî•üî•
I have an iPhone 7 üò¢
Isn't the facetop camera thing the same thing car manufacturers use to get the 360¬∞ camera view thing
Had no idea a Lock Screen was so important to people lol but I‚Äôve also kept mine plain black for several years
Still no ability to arrange icons on the home screens
Superb Intro. Do it again.
But still no always on display
How can i get those wallpapersüòÄ
just updated my phone tio ios 16 and my touch screen went crazy. How can I downgrade?
"Apple is running out of  idea and things to do, they implement crazy things that can be useful but in very specific situations :D"
"Someone please tell me why you can personalize absolutely everything in the lock screen BUT the camera and flashlight buttons, to put anything else I want to have there........."
Watching with iOS 13.6.1 and still don't want to update. Ps : my phone is iphone 11
iMessage delete feature has been in the Meta Ecosystem of WhatsApp (text messages) and Instagram (social media) way before the Covid-19 pandemic and the new lifestyle of Work From Home!
0:11 sickest transition
No always on screen!!! Very disappointed!!
That lock screen is so copied from Android. Its bollocks Apple doesn't copy too.
gotta upgrade to the 13 next year for sure.....
Love it how the book in the background has the Roman numbers for 16 on it üòÖ
"It‚Äôs a new camera thing! Also, that iMac mouse was üî•üî•"
did you purposely release this on the day of the release of the public beta?
Yeah this is all amazing but I still have to mute my phone to avoid camera shutter sounds and more annoyingly SCREENSHOT SOUNDS...  no ringtone for me :(
Do we have a way to increase our call log limit above 100 now?
"Lock screen, apple biggest innovation"
Love the idea of the desk view camera and the possibility of playing tabletop games over FaceTime. Super cool feature.
Those KM184 in the background tho üëÄ
"Marquez can I ask you for an iPhone maybe, iPhone 10,11,12..doesn't matter. I never hold an iPhone before hand"
"loved the intro, I watched it like 5 times"
Can‚Äôt wait üòù
iOS finally married android and wechat
I just want T9 dialing ü§£ the thing I miss the most about my android!
"Idk how I feel about notifications coming in from the bottom, but everything else seems really cool"
"Apple ia turning into android with all that cuatomizarions, I love it. Android is regressing right now in that front. Atleast we still have launchers."
How is android regressing if anything theyre doing even better especially samsung
Did we not have haptic keyboard already??? What is this mandela effect???  I swore I thought we had it already. üòÇ
Damn that intro üî•üî•üî•
This video is one of the best MKBHDs video ever!! Top stuff!
As much I am an android guy. I hope to own an iPhone at some point. They are just extremely well optimized.
that intro!
"I just ditched iPhone last week and switched to Pixel 6 pro.

IMO Pixel Pro is like a PC on your hands. While iPhone is limited and is still a ""phone"". That's the biggest difference I noticed.

I still love iPhone but I don't feel like switching anymore until apple opens up a bit more (YOU CAN F SIDELOAD APPS ON PIXEL LOL)"
Me to i switched to the fold 3.. apple needs to step their game up
My favorite feature is the ability to drag and drop photos from your gallery to your iMessage
"I just installed iOS 16 public beta on my main iPhone 12 Pro Max, thinking it could pretty much support all my apps, but it couldn't. When I went to import big files into my phone, it glitches and bugs out. Moreover, when I open huge games such as Call of Duty: Mobile, the game is very laggy. So, now I have to delete iOS 16 and reset my iPhone to restore iOS 15 again. Personally, I'm just going to wait for the official commercial version to come out in 2 months' time."
Great Intro...We Want More Of Those
"Thanks for the update on the update, marquees üòä"
"What about using the iPhone's keyboard to type on a Mac? To me, it's so much faster. (Correct me if that already exists, thanks)"
Awesome intro!
honestly the thing I'm most excited for is haptic feedback lol ive always missed that from my android days
intro was sick btw
The lockscreen update is really nice and all but that theres still no always on Display is killing me
I'm not sure Steve Jobs would be happy with the idea of having users change the fonts and colors of the fonts on the home screen... I've seen some horrendous setups on Android devices where ppl change the system font üòµ‚Äçüí´
And when comes the option to customize your homescreen like in Android? üòÖüôè
it kinda feels like android 12.
Will we EVER get new system sounds?  Haven‚Äôt they been the same since iOS 7?
"I'm thinking on changing to iPhone and these are great features... But damn, still no icon customization or personal icon placement? :/"
"i didnt know the iphone didnt have the haptik keyboard i always thought it did since my samsung had it, my last phone had it and the phone before that had it"
Does the iPhone camera feature work on iPads? Becuz i hate the poisition of the camera on the iPad when your doing video calls
Very cool into!
"Personally, i'd rather have the following: 

1. Android's navigation gesture specifically the ability to swipe left or right as back gesture. In ios, only the swipe on the left side works. Too cumbersome on us 13pro max users. 

2. Always on display

3. Battery percentage on the battery icon"
The intro was legit so good
Any plans for you to review the Oura health ring. Would love to hear your opinions about it and its functionsü§îüòç
"In our country, about 10-12 years ago people used to take a course to remove the background from photos. Those courses literally cost 5000-6000tk. People also earned a lot by removing bg from photos. Some of them ran their livelihood by that. In recent years AI is doing it more accurately and it is time efficient.
AI is scary and a blessing at  the same time."
hey bro.. please share those wallpapers that you are playing with in this video... üí´
Can I install it on my iPhone 7
Nope
"I absolutely fancy the transitional effects on the first 20 seconds of this video. It just keeps getting better and better, splendid editing work right there."
bot
Wtf
please tell me i‚Äôm not the only one who don‚Äôt like the notifications at the bottom
Amazing
"Can we please have an option to hide that fucking homebar? It‚Äôs been years and everybody on earth already know how to gesture without that ugly ui. 

I can easily get accustomed to the notch but I at least want my screen clean."
this is the first time where i genuinely wish to get an iphone D: these features are so dope
so v16 its just app updates. :/
"I hate to say it but the screen on first showing the object thingy, it‚Äôs already here in iOS 15. either apple is secretly giving me features or you didn‚Äôt notice it before."
"The Lock Screen is almost worthless real estate. If you set up face unlock you won‚Äôt even see the Lock Screen when opening the phone. If you‚Äôre opening your phone, it is so you can go into an app properly and not just catch a glance at a few tiny items."
Honestly the whole video was just to flex with that intro üî•
It's been there in android since 2014.....lol
Who uses it tho? Most android phones have bad haptic motors and it makes the phone feel even cheaper
That Lock Screen change is fantastic. I‚Äôve wanted that for so many years. I hate not being able to see the clock well.
"Dayum, that's one sick intro!"
Can i use ipad for camera webcam feature?
"Blooper: This video was made @ 5 o clock ; 2:15. Just wondering if that‚Äôs a 24 hr. Take a bow, then."
"The intro man... ‚ù§Ô∏è
Cool stuff going on there from Apple. Not to forget a lot of the tweaking is already on Android. Apple just polished it a bit launching for now. It's like Apple is launching these old android features as new for itself"
Unsend = delete!!! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"This version of iOS will be my next favorite.
I already loved the Darkmode iOS Update, but iOS 16 comes close."
Does it have a app drawer
"Hey Marques, related to the lockscreen that changes with the focus mode you are on, dont you think it would be nice to do the same with the apple watch faces? It would be nice, i have different watch faces when going to the gym, work or the rest of the day, iphone change focus mode automatically for me but the watch face dont :("
Anyone know what that laptop mount is?
lol heptic just an additional pay load to your battery. As an extensive user I¬¥d rather turb≈Ñ it off.
I love how Apple takes what works really well on one device and adapts it to other devices. The new Lock Screen is essentially the watch face but for the iPhone. Very nice
REVOLUTIONARY!!!
"What do you mean, there no weather or calculator app on the iPad :("
@Vanimal Adventures That and a specific app lock feature to be safe from prying eyes. These features are on android for years
@Slipp yeah I have the 13 pro max and I use my iPad more for certain things for that reason. Wish they‚Äôd bring it over to us especially since we have a large enough screen size :/
@Vanimal Adventures and bring back landscape home screen on iphone for crying out loud
That intro was absolutely awesome
I like the keyboard‚Äôs haptic feedback a lot after updating
üòÆ top down view of iphone camera is black magic indeed üòÅ
Dope introsüî•
Intro üëåüèº
thumbs up before the 25th second. Awesome work
That intro!!! The best one I have seen so far! Great job guys!! ü§òü§òü§òü§ò
"And here I am, waiting for them to bring back the fingerprint unlock. To this day, face id has proven to be infinitely worse in every scenario."
"Apple have made all these features many years ago.
And every year they just add one feature to the new iOS ‚Ä¶ 
They do so because they are not able to make something new every year‚Ä¶ 

Like come on these things(widgets, wallpaper, fonts,‚Ä¶)are already exist on android and a long time ago"
I think Apple should hire MKBHD's team to make their promotional videos. That intro was siiiiick! üî•
Intro was better than apple does for real
Intro was better than apple does for real üî•
Wish it had a volume mixer and split screen.
That introoooooooo!
Ok
"Seems iOs have stopped innovating, but just copying android features from many many years ago. Lol at customized lockscreens."
Customization is an android feature? And my pixel has less than half of the lock screen options ios 16 has lol
Best Intro üî• üëå
Only I love stevejobs I love apple üçé but u really good awesome men I like it üëçüî•üçé
best intro ever üëçüëçüëç
"Although I am only 14 years old, I like testing new software, programming different stuff like websites and apps (I am not very good at it yet though but I can do some stuff). So because of all that, I bought the apple developer membership, downloaded the iOS 16 beta and started learning how to make iOS apps using xcode. So I would just ask you Marques Brownlee, can I review it with you? If not, please at least just reply on this comment."
"Omg finally, for a haptic keyboard. I was bumped that iPhone did not have one. I switched from the note 20 ultra. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I missed it until i lose it."
The live text feature doesn't work in some parts of europe. (for example Hungary)
That intro was fire thoüî•
Fire intro üî•üî•
Why doesnt Apple just upgrade the laptop cams. 1 Question: what are the useful purposes of the top down cam?
This lock screen customization thing reminds me of when people started customizing their lock screens on Android. Feels very cheap and I don't get the hype around it.. It still needs to me polished imo.
Sooooo I can make a focus for each of my girlfriends üò≥üò≥üò≥ Apple you‚Äôve done it again üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ
These intros are getting out of hand. IT'S TOO MUCH EFFORT FOR A REVIEW! ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Still watching this kind of content even though i don't own an iPhone. My last iphone was iphone 4s.
"Asus came up with nr 2 for a long time, its not an Apple Original idea"
The next update should include live wallpapers
The 16 at 00:30 (written in Roman number) on the book is class
Damn. That intro on another level.. Great work guys
üî•üî•üî•
"""TOP 5 NEW FEATURES""
*ANDROID* : Hold my beer"
"@Hinata good reply, unfortunately that doesn't answer my question"
@NotLxrd duhhhh cry cry üòÇ
Who cares about android and why do y'all keep mentioning it under ios videos?
Just got the public beta ios 16. So far loving it. ‚úåüèª
"Apple: ""It's been 16 years. You're old enough to take the wheel. We give you... widgets and clock faces. Oh and Google Wave's edit/unsend msg.""
~The crowd goes Beatlemanic~"
IOS is really catching up with Android in customisation
"That auto crop image feature and camera add on feature is like extreme end of software engineering , Kudos to Apple Engineering team for putting this together Wow Simply Wow <3 I am just waiting for the notch to be gone and faceid inside the screen"
tesla phone???
The ability to press and hold object is next level iOS 4life ‚ù§Ô∏è like it basically takes cut and past to a whole new level
best ever intro so far this year
"Samsung galaxy a53 5g video please 
üëç vs  üëé"
"Curious to see how all the new photo wizardry behaves with 2D images.
My lockscreen is almost always an illustration or something, and it'd be really cool if I could still take advantage of the cool foreground effect. But I'm curious if iOS 16 can even distinguish between foreground and background elements on non-real world images."
"i have ios 16 beta 3 and tried it. just to let you know, it works!"
That is a good point. I'll be curious to see when iOS 16 drops.
Sicküî•
I‚Äôm still using Iphone 7 :(
We Android users have been using phone cameras as our webcam since ancient Times üòÖ.
The intro of the wallpapers are much better than the original launch video from apple. well done team
Intro is dope
3:49 My math might be wrong but did you load $20 000 to charge your electric cars or is that also for keeping the light on in the studio ?
Making a sticker from a photo with a tap? ü§Ø
Great Intro !!!
Best Intro yet üî•üî•üî•
"Live object looks so awesome, but then you realised most video chat apps do that now if they know to blur a background"
Finessed intro
The live objects thing is crazy!
"An important missing feature in iOS is a proper calendar reminder. The old Blackberry had the perfect one. It was basically an alarm, impossible to miss unless you postponed it or reset it. You can easily miss an appointment with iOS."
@Fex King You can always install Google calendar.
At least I‚Äôm not alone in this. I keep missing important reminders/ calendar appointments.
And an app drawer
Bro what‚Äôs the wallpaper at 8:27. It‚Äôs not in the links
"Actually i see the edited message on the older version of the iOS, it shows as ---- Edited ""this message"""
"Pause the video for a second, that intro was siiiick"
Introüî•üî•üî•üî•
respect to Apple for their open mindness. I'm an Android user.
Thank you for not to ask (subscribe)
when will we get 'T9 dictionary' to dial a call.?
Awesome video! But how did you get that belkin phone mount and Dave2D had to duct tape his phone to his lap top üòÜ
You are my favorite example of competitive differentiation. The production quality your team brings to this space is always awesome.
Would you say he is the iPhone of tech reviewers?
seriously! that intro got me instantly hooked.
@Zest Script I think that kind of discredits his efforts regardless of being in a fresh space. He has always paid attention to the detail of his videos wether it be motion graphics or effective gear choices even his scripting as mentioned above.
"Yeah and areas that Marques focuses on in his speech are so well chosen. Like in phone reviews, a lot of smaller youtubers fall into trap of reading the specs for first 5 minutes, which is completly useless as I can read specification myself and also it makes video boring. Marques will talk about what was his experience like with that product and give some clever bigger picture insight which is great"
"I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, thought it was straight from apple"
Will the webcam mode work for any laptop? Like for one that normally doesn‚Äôt have one?
did IOS 16 fix the problem of draining battery overnight on ios 15?
Ahhhhhhh! the intro üëå
The intro is so amazing just like the rest off the video
The intro was lit AF üî•
So more or less nothing that exciting or whatever boring update & instead of having to use the iPhones camera as the webcam common sense would be to just put better cameras in them
"Apple: Here‚Äôs the new ios 16.
Me: Did u guys increase the call history memory?
Apple: You can use ur phone as a web cam now.
Me: ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî"
What an intro!! Amazing
The best intros I've ever seen are from this channel...holy God they're sooo good
"As a lifelong android user it is pretty cool to see how innovative apple is being with IOS, some of these features are cool as fuck"
It shouldn't tell them you deleted the message because you deleted it for a reason and don't want an investigation XD
Atleast now people won't mistakenly take peoples phones ü§£ü§£
"Can confirm - Landscape FaceID does NOT work with an iPhone 12 Pro, only the 13."
"Hopefully the iPhone 14 is released with USB-C, then I may switch back over from Android."
Finally! Is bold text on lock screen going to be the default now? because I‚Äôm already quite fond of it
iOS 16 is so cool it reminds me Android Kitkat. ü•∞
@Marques Brownlee new Iphone as a gift please‚ô•
That was like a genuine Apple intro!
Man.... I wish i had an IPhone to see these new featuresüòø
So what did they take away?
"Hi Marques, nice video 

Are they including Apple Music continuity between devices? Thanks"
Its so cute that iphone users gets excited for the features which Android users have for years now on their phone.
"@Ankit Kamble why would i? I already have a chinese phone and it's shit, cannot wait to change it for a proper phone that doesn't have glitches"
@NotLxrd come to Asian market someday mate. Get out of your pond.
"@Ankit Kamble tf u talking about, with the 13 pro max, while being cheaper than the s22u you get the best performance, best battery by far, best video camera, arguably top 3 best photo camera, best os etc"
"@NotLxrd well you get what you pay for, in Android unlike ios devices."
"It's cute that android users think ios users care about what android users had/have, which usually is way worse than what Apple releases, and this comes from an android user."
when will the Android 13 features video come out?
Wtf the intro ‚ò†Ô∏è
"Imagine showing this vid to someone in 2014.....

Sad it took this long to get some decent features but dope nonetheless."
Why i need haptic keyboard?
Thats why apple will be apple
IOS got to the point where if iPhone will have USB-C and they rework the notifications I will probably switch to an iPhone
AOD still missing
"I'm sorry, the intro- WAS A MASTER PIECE"
What    An     Intro
"What was that home screen image on the far left? Oh, that was Nothing..."
2 minutes content streched to 10 minutes. You don't need to sound wise all the time some things are better if said in less words.
That intro kicks ass üî•
"I like every time people talk about massage edit and delete as novelties. Can do that on telegram since the get go, and on other gamish communication apps as well since forever"
Great video I can't say no more as usual PERFECT
They put another gimmick to satisfy all iphone sympathizers with outdated software updated to cover up their real intention to slow down older iphones. LOL
"I really hope they put in a option to set a different code for apple pay. Now it is your unlock code, not so save."
is the new beta worth having on my main iphone xs max?
It‚Äôll show up as a edited but with the original message still present for any not on iOS 16
Lost count watching the introüòç
This introooo yoo
can listen to music offline like Android......
where can I buy that phone holder for the laptop?
Always on display ?
Nope
Nice Video but could you make the intros longer like the your pixel 3 review from a while ago
watching this from my 2019 phone android phone
What is so special about continuity camera? I have used this feature in my Nokia 6600 (Symbian OS) in ~2010 with Windows Seven. Apple is wasting your time and my time by creating few twick in the OS which were already out there decades ago.
Landscape face unlock best feature hands down
Imagine lock screen with a moving live photo and the object stands out from the background
yeah i can agree dont put it on your main üò´
Man the intro ü§§
intros are getting better video by video
still shocked my iPhone 7 Plus doesn't get iOS 16
"So‚Ä¶.
 I have 
Have a‚Ä¶.
Iphone 6s
I‚Äôm broke‚ú® haha"
Where is his T-shirt from?
The top down view is really good for online teaching
"The easiest and such a helpful feature would be to rotate multiple photos in your Photo app. Or do a twist gesture to rotate a photo instead of tapping on the photo, clicking edit > rotate > and done.. it's plain stupid."
The intro is just straight fire
I just want the camera roll section back in photos üòÇüòÇüòÇ
There is a notebook with a printed XVI... the easter egg of this vid. :-)
I love the introüòçüî•
What about always on display? Is that available atleast for widgets?
Shout out to intro‚Ä¶No kidding.. watched it on loop.. Just amazing üôåüèª
"So iMessage is trying to catch up to Telegram and WhatsApp that‚Äôve had these features for a long time now, but iMessage is still behind, coz those other apps have much more to offer."
Hahaha
RIP my 6süòÇüòÇüòÇ
"For all your golfers out there. Finally, you can see wind forcasts and directions in the 10 day view."
"*I prayed a special prayer for someone passing through hard times, a hard time which seem to be mental, financially and emotionally damaging. I pray for this person reading this, that God will come to your rescue, wipe your tears and restore you whole in Jesus name. Amen*"
the intro blows my mind ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
What about the copy and paste option for your edited photos? That was dope for me
That snap of finger animation was outstanding
I can't believe you cannot see the charging percentage on the lock screen anymore when you tap to wake the phone. I wish for an option to return to the old one
Interesting how you incorporated the foreground overlay feature of lock screen into your intro. Superb editing
Love your videos. And this one is exceptionally awesome!
do the unsend/edit will work on the older iPhone 7 and below after its wide rollout?
"0:53 yo those coloured rings are from Rode""s latest headphones! review of the NTH 100 coming up??"
ü§£or if you are absolutely disgusted by what you said.
Intro was at par with Apple.
"‚ÄúOr if your so disgusted with what you originally sent you can actually delete it, which is pretty sweet‚Äù okay Marcus üòÇ"
"as an avid android user and iPhone condemner, I'm starting like the direction iPhone is headed. we can no longer use the ""personalisation"" argument anymore, I'm finding less and less points as to why I dislike iPhone other than the stupid prices"
Let me know if it‚Äôs safe need to update
Apple guy mkbhdüê∏
Useless...
The intro really amazed me
Wonder why PCs & Macbooks can't just get GOOD cameras if they for Prosü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"4:19 ""soft Muschi haptics"" ? :D"
"No Pip & split screen

What if the message is already read by the recipient anyway???ü§£ Ctrl Z and Del won't matter anymore right
These intros are always next level
Always on display?
"This is a major bash in the face for us who edit pictures, do clipping path, masking.  It's just one tap on phone now. 

Crazy how technology grows so fast."
"Wow the background ambient noise in this video is just way too much
The older studio just had way better acoustics"
Sounds like Marques is in a plane here
"Lol #5 is crazy. I don't use Messages, but it's crazy that it would make it in the top 5 of a new operating system."
Another important missing feature: transcribing audio recordings
Yeah
desperately in need of that transamerica pyramid wallpaper
Discription
Are you able to remove the clock ?
No
Intros sick AF
"No one:
Marques: so I just got married about a month ago.."
So I've been testing my wife for about 2 weeks now
"My favorite game pubg but i can't play pubg for a good phone brother please give me iphone 13 pro max my family can't afford to buy me iphone but i wish iphone....

That outro. Lit.
Na man it's shit
What an intro !
The sound is not as good as it used to be. Seems like the AC is too loud in the background
@RANDOM STUFF oh yes he does care
Jesus doesn't care about sound
"One detail so many misunderstand: It's a typeface, not a font. You choose between different typefaces for the lock screen clock. (A font is a collection of typefaces sharing the same design. E.g. Helvetica Regular + Italic + Bold + Bold Italic = a font. Whilst Helvetica Regular = a typeface.)"
"Wow, The intro!"
That intro was just outrageousüò≥
Best intro ever
Thumbnail Wallpaper?
Discription
I mean it's great that he puts the link to wallpapers in the description
Yeah
"Ur rich to have phone , can i please get 12 mini ?............ Please bro"

You forgoted the photos option like hidden photos now need to open with face lock üîí best feature and also deleted photos
This might be it. I might change over to iPhone....
Mad mad intro!üò§
thank you
I just got done paying off my iPhone 11‚Ä¶ here we are at 16 ü•≤
"Iphone 11 is smartphone
iOS 16 is new version of iOS
So don't be sad"
That intro is dopeüì±
Apple XVI ‚ú®
"That introo, damnn"
Bruh i still have the beta
"my favourite feature would be having multiple timers. why just the one, apple?"
"Omg, the number 1 üòç I was waiting for sooo long for something like this"
DAMN THE INTROO!
Then hows the battery after those widgets ?
Those 20 sec holds me for 10 min video.
this guy gives much information then my news channel
"iOS is becoming Android, and thats not bad at all"
please  try to use Telegram)) iMessage is so embarrassing
"Iphone as webcam = genius?
Android has software enabling this option for years.
oh man seriously."
The intro ü§Ø
The intro looked like it was made by Apple HOLYYYY
"However, is there any direct way to add  a ringtone of our liking in ios 16??"
"At this point, I can't even express my amazement when I saw those first 20 seconds.
Sick transitions man !!"
Damn that intro üî•üî•
Has anyone tested a live wallpaper on the Lock Screen now that a long press brings up the Lock screws editor
Can you finally long press/3D touch on apps in the App Library in iOS16?
That introü§©
"MIUI IS WAY BETTER !
XIAOMI IS BOSS"
üòÇüòÇüòÇmiui
"""unsend"" ist just a marketing word for ""delete"" and every social media and chat app can do that. Sometimes with a notification in chat, sometimes without.

Only conversation way without deleting option (I know of) is sms. But let's be honest. Even though they try to look like a chat app now and messages even get sorted by chat and not by ""send"" and ""received"" anymore, one does still have the mindset that a send sm is a short message that completely left your device forever."
"*Investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list, in some months time you'll be ecstatic with the decision you made today*"
I immediately liked the video as soon as i saw the intro üî•!!!!!!
Being an android user the 3rd feature to paste images is the best according to me and haptic keyboard finally üôå
Features
I'll miss it in my iphone7 :'(
This intro can cure coronavirus.
Still waiting for keyboard swipe in Danish.
That intro was so freakin sick üî•
I'm finally considering switching to iphone after many years on android. Finally apple is catching up with features i would miss in the past.
Am pm? A few times I‚Äôve had trouble üòî
@Guh holly molly that's he'll of a routine üòÆ
@RANDOM STUFF for example I have an afternoon nap at 4pm wake up at 6. How do I know if it‚Äôs a.m. or p.m. have I just slept for 14 hours or 2. It‚Äôs dark at 6pm and 6am here so I have to do a google search maybe? It doesn‚Äôt say on the phone.
Am pm?
6:00 to much black magic for me to handle
That Intro. Hard.üî•
Can you change the stock app shortcuts from the Lock Screen?
"@Marques Brownlee, does IOS 16 come to Iphone SE gen 3?"
@RANDOM STUFF thanks man
Yes
"As usual excellent intro, just keeps getting better and better!! üëåüèºüëåüèºAlso loved the XVI Easter egg in the background for 16. Love the impeccable attention to detail in your videos MKBHD!!"
"This video is also a big deal, great job!"
"When LEGEND TALKS,Everything gets so EASY to UNDERSTAND!"
"Ok Brandon, we get it you went to Harvard üòÇ"
laughs in google pixel
"I think they should add the ability to save Home Screen layout since so many people (including me) have been customizing them with certain themes, then you could have a home and Lock Screen for winter or summer and change then both so seamlessly but unfortunately you still have to mess around with adding shortcuts for an hour to get what you want."
‚ÄúLive objects‚Äù thing actually blew my mind wow
5:52 this is CRAZY üíÄüíÄüíÄ
"Living things look unbelievable. That type of image cropping can be done quite quickly, yet 95% of individuals are unable to accomplish it on their own. The result of the processing is really tidy. Their design and development teams deserve praise for incorporating a very sophisticated procedure in such an easy way."
seperti biasa keren sekali marques!
I heard #1 it will work only with iPhone 14
Disliked video just because of the sheer amount of stupid ads
Use vanced
I can't stop watching the intro. How do you guys manage to impress us all the time?? Hats off to the team.
How can I afford an iPhone
Except the webcam feature all the other seems useless
Lock screen looks cool tho
Why we don‚Äôt see those robot camera shots now a days?
I so wish that I could put my iPhone on my gaming monitor but we all know how well Apple and Android work together
mine is lock screen
ahhh your intros like every time are just blowing my mind i love the creativity <3
That search feature is another thing that Android has had for some time.
You know how insignificant an update is when the best feature is a new lock screenü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
Me as an Indian who have Android and watching the iOS video and thinking whether is useful for me or not
Haha same
"Please BTS video for any of the review , like how you do it exactly"
what an intro
So basically just a Galaxy S with an apple logo.
Did anyone notice there is XVI on the left of the books which may refer to iOS 16? He used to add such a small detail on his video and it is great.
it works omg i have ios 16 and i‚Äôm using the haptic feedback feature on the keyboard it feels so nice
"Great vid as usual but software updates don‚Äôt do it for me. Clearly if the Lock Screen is the number one feature then maybe I mightn‚Äôt be missing the point. 

Maybe Lockdown Mode is the number one feature of IOS for those in the world that depend on their phone for doing good and not being hacked. It‚Äôs a sad world that we need this feature but probably better than your number one feature."
I wish they would let us set snooze times though. I mean come on.
Who even still uses iPhone 6 yet? I remember people really liking that phone.
The intro in this video is just mesmerising editing! Great work by the team!
One of my favorite features is also using Face ID to unlock hidden photos
I wish Apple will allow to rearrange Home Screen icons and place them anywhere without using the blank space app.
"0:12
omg that was the best intro i've ever seen. that what makes mkbhd so special  great job!!"
That‚Äôs a lot of change this year!
the lock screen feature alone is making me want to buy an iphone
"I love num2,thank u for sharing üçª"
Love the iphone and all but letting laptops company to get away with the web cam and makes us have to utilize other device after paying thousands of dollar just to have good web cam is so crazy to me
ayeee we both listen to Joyner Lucas !!
That into thoughüî•
i just updated to public beta my instagram not working
if #1 change is the lock screen customization then Apple really seems to be running out of ideas. If they don't introduce some radically new hardware to toy around with iPhone will be hardly distinguishable from iPhone 13 (which was barely different from iPhone 12).
"Wow, iOS 16 is so greatüòç"
Please increase bitrate in your videos btw love your videos
"@RANDOM STUFF i didn't knew , thank you for the info"
"Max Bitrate for yt is 5mb he can't do anything
Rather then replacing his back ground"
Live objects is cool.
my fav one was landscape face id. had always been a nuisance while watching movies or lectures. can't wait to test it out.
Only on iPhone 13
That introooo. Damnnn so good ‚ù§‚Äçüî•
that intro is sick and smooth af nice one!
What a nice intro!
That intro is crazzyyyyyyy!
I downloaded the public beta today and it‚Äôs been great so far ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"If anything iOS 16 brings most of the stuff I care about AND am able to use, so happy on that regard.

The problem is with Apple that unless you live in the US or some other ""chosen"" countries, most of the stuff doesn't even work, every time I watch information about a new major iOS release it is ""50% comes to my country, 50% can be ignored"" at best.

Still the case with 16, but luckily everything I care about comes out this time.

If they only fixed Apple Maps for my country... I mean in my country street names and lay outs of street in neighbourhoods tend to change, I am actually still forced to use Google Maps purely because Apple Maps shows heavily outdated info.

Heavily = there is plenty of street names, lay out and so on in my country that are changed since 2014 and Apple Maps still shows the 2014 variant and before, while Google Maps does change it in a matter of weeks or months.

The street I live in doesn't even exist name and lay-out wise in Apple Maps, Google Maps changed it after 3 months, yet Apple Maps still shows the old layout from 2016.

I know few people from the US and Apple Maps works great there according to them, but Apple is a big company with a ton of money and resources, yet stuff like this feels like they only care about the US.

And that is sad.

Sorry for my rant, but iOS16 kinda reminded me of it."
Easter egg - 16 is written in Roman letters on 1 of the book in the shelf.
"my favorite feature is Always On Display. When that happens, I'll move back to iPhone. ;)"
Jailbreak
"Video: Top 5 new features of iOS 16
Also Marques at spot 3: Basically every single feature and iOS 16 in general lol"
that intro was dope
Since when Marques Brownlee become advocate of lobbyists?
"Ngl seeing Google's UI for Android 12 and Google's lock screen logic and layout UI, Apple got thrown back atleast 1-2 years. Trust me, that iOS lockscreen is ugly."
"I'm sorry but the phone holder is super sketchy
I personally won't risk a multiple hundred dollar screen or back replacement for  better webcam quality üòÇüòÇ"
Production on your videos is getting ridiculously good...
Make a video all about the new ipadOS 16....need it soon
"#5 every other messaging service already has those things
#4 #3 #1 honestly, android had all those things for ages, so shame on Apple for being a decade late to the party.
Gg for #2"
#5 does Whatsapp has it?
"Just ""WOW""! Adding lockscreen customization 15 years late and calling it ""next gen"" feature üòÇ Cudos to Apple"
I mean‚Ä¶ this intro is WWDC/ Apple event level alreadyüî•
Is all this gonna be available on the IPhone SE (3rd Gen) ? Great video btw very informative!
Where do you get your wallpapers from
Apple should just outsource their marketing to MKB damn. That was taieeet
My first smartphone was a moto droid turbo. I've had one of every generation of pixels except the 2. I'm currently using a P6 Pro. iOS 16 might be what makes me switch to iPhone this October.
Im literaly watching this on an iphone
Great job with the intro reel!
"I dont like that search button on home screen, will there be way to not have it there ? thx"
I just wish apple would fix the horrid notification system. This will literally drive me back to android on its own.
"Man, the intro was crazyyyy üî•"
Finally dammit. This is what iOS should have been years ago. They have the tech and expertise to do it. I cant wait for this upgrade
"Hello, Humans
Mr Potato Head was the first toy to be advertised on TV.

TERRANCE OUT"
Is the beta software safe to have like without problems or anything
"WOW one of the best intros I have seen in a minute, splendid!"
Your background is always attractive...
"really don't care about iOS but your videos (especially the intros) are just so fun to watch for the VFX, shooting angles, and stuff that I watched the whole thing üòÖ"
"Yooo maan, that intro was amazing! I believe thats a material for the studio channel. I would love to see how they did it!!"
still rocking my iPhone 11 Pro ‚ù§Ô∏è
is that a bar soap on top of a yellow towel. I love the photo lifting feature. That's a cool multi-touch feature. We don't get to see that often.
Why your videos are so clean! GOD DAMN!
Dope intro holy shit I had to replay
Haptic keyboard ... thank you APPLE !!!
Was waiting for this video üî•
We see xvi for 16üòÖ
"I am annoyed by face id that it doesn‚Äôt work in landscape mode, finally its fixed now. Yay üòÄ"
Seems like with their new lockscreen Apple has finally closed the gap from Cydia.
Best MKBHD into to date.. I cant weigh all of 'em in mind to compare but its clear that a lot of work was put into making it!
Sensational intro Marques!
Brandon is killing it with those intros. So good.
the intro üò≠üò≠üò≠
iMessages becoming like discord
so finally they have decided to discontinue iPhone 7Plus :(
‚ù§‚Äçüî•That intro was ‚ù§‚Äçüî•üí•ü§Ø
the beginning was ELITE
AMAZING VIDEO!!!!
I need Apple to do live wallpapers like real ones
Thanks for giving San Francisco and Oakland some love with your wallpaper
MKBHD is one of the most UNENTHUSIASTIC tech YouTube
XVI
Wow this is a crazy update. I was going to switch over to Samsung but if iPhone stays in this lane then I‚Äôll forsure stick with themüëçüèΩ
Any one here . haven't i phone yet‚ò∫Ô∏è
6:08 Kinda black magic but look at your pinky ‚Ä¶.apple better work on that
Live object need to come as default android features too! This thing is awesome and helpful. Google lens needs to support video as well just like in IOS16 live text. This shouldn't be too hard since google has all the power to train the AI
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos
Apple woke up and was like man let‚Äôs copy android even more in fact let‚Äôs just just make android but with iOS as the name üòÇ
@Angad Singh The Google store is plagued with 3rd party apps that do most if not all these features in some way or another and have probably been out for a long time üòÇ
How? Most of these features are not in Android
Looks like we could be in danger of the iPhone taking over more of our lives.
"Intro itself says DOPE. It's Dope!
Seems like IOS is going ahead of Android for the first time. They didn't wait for other companies to try new software tricks as they did in the old days. Now they THINK DIFFERENT. However, it's for Apple users and they don't have to use old technologies like their grandparents anymore!"
"My favorite feature is still my android phone LOL but jokes aside, the top-down cam feature is pretty neat"
Mark ass brownie
"Hey Marques, I hear the background air noise of your Air Conditioner. Please fix it!"
Can We please get the links for the Tribune tower and the mossy building?
Ahhhhh that intro is sorcery üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
How do you get the full photos from highrise? Do you have to pay for it?
"Stop this 90s marketing shit of ""5 things"" is old as fuck"
"@kyra again, I care, as a subscriber since the early days I think it's and old format and it's forcing you to show 5 bullet points for no particular reason

Let me say, as a stranger on the internet myself, I find it curious that you don't care about my opinion but expect me (or want me) to care about yours

I'm just explaining myself to you to be polite, not arguing, you can have your opinion and like the video just don't be such a fanboy/girl.. I've been watching marquees for years and I think he has the edge he needs to step up from this 5 things bullshit"
"@kyra I thought it was obvious I care üòÇ

Nice to know you don't ü§ó"
"Ok? Who cares it works and its good, useful to see"
"That intro was the most professional shit I‚Äôve ever seen, well done üëçüèº"
YouTube is getting way too comfortable with these double skippable ads
Use vanced
"I noticed 'XVI' is written on a book behind you,which denotes iOS 16."
Did he just roast apple in the end? That was smooth dude
That intro is sick. üëå
Sheesh the intro üî•üî•
Where is YouTube pic in pic..aww iphone..still behind Android
one featurs missing the whole ecosystem is behind an os!!
"bring back the ""what is up guys, mkbhd here"""
is it just me or with the iPhone 8 Plus the clock behind the object don't work. but I have an option for it but its on but it don't work even with no additional widgets
I don‚Äôt think there are many use cases for the desk view at all
Teachers in Zoom classes can now stream notes from paper notebooks to the class.
"4:29 yeah, you tell ‚Äòem Lizo"
Black Magic. hmmmm... Where do you get that?
Apple paid promotion.
Yeah everything is paid by apple if someone says good about  üçé
@kyra u from?
atleast from my view but
lol he literally roasted at the end
All that and they still haven‚Äôt figured out how to Picture in Picture YouTube so you can watch it and do other stuff?
"they have support for pip, youtube doesnt add it
every other streaming app has it lol"
best intro i have ever seen on any youtube channel ever
The intro is super cool üòé. Good job
still missing always on display
@kyra for someone who uses it it's not
i dont get the point for that on a phone more than a gimmick
So basically the iOS 16 is more Android-like than the previous iOS
yeah its customizable ish so its like android mhmm yep
Finally new features Android user can't laugh about üòÇ
Haptic feedback in the keyboard! Yes!! Finally!!!
f apple and f ios 16 for removing so many phones I hope this brings them down financially
"dude‚Ä¶ they are phones from 5+ years ago that work as a daily driver
you can do everything you want for it??
for a phone thats great
androids usually go like 2 years with continued updates"
"i love the new ios 16 public beta update, its refind"
"Can we take a moment and appreciate how good the Animation is in the beginning of the video, This is surely a kind of an Animation that Apple would've created themselves."
Thanks!
Great video and EPIC intro!
So is this live for the beta or still a closed beta?
I still have the 16GB iPhone SE. Is that supported?
iMessage is scarcely used outside üá∫üá∏ WhatsApp dominates in most other countries.
2B active users
ok
"Can we be honest, I only come here for the intros üòÖ"
"Mannnnnnn, u r just killing the intro game"
It looks like a 10 years old Android software.  Still 10 years behind Android. So sad. Oh but it's Apple. So it is magical and revolutionary. For $1000 and more better they put a top of the range camera sensor on the MacBook/pro instead of asking extra work and $ for the mounting of the iPhone on top of the camera. Just insane.
looks like 10 years old android software‚Ä¶ hmmmm well its way less buggy and actually usable lol
I can‚Äôt wait for IOS 16! I‚Äôm so excited for all of them you mentioned. I don‚Äôt have a MacBook ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs freaking genius & I want a MacBook now lol I recently got the IPad Pro 12.9 so I won‚Äôt be able to get for awhile. I‚Äôm just amazed that it can take videos/pictures of anything flat on your desk or surface and I think people like me who use the camera a lot are going to love these new features.
So if the recipient has already seen the message what happens if you delete it?
Still be deleted from both sides
"no lies this is the best iOS16 review yet, i've watched so many but some parts are unclear unlike this oneee, Hands down you are the lord of the tech üôåüèº"
The intro is so damn good üî•ü§©
iPhone on SOS; must be a Rogers customer üòÇ
"The ""virtual top-down view"" and the ""Live Image"" features are hella impressive, close to being magic. Well done, Apple."
in your dream üê∂
@JEDLC and yet all the features listed in his video have been on android phones for years
"@MMD They make it trend these touch and face id? No, that was discontinued then Apple release it and become a trend in tech industry. If that Aquos Crystal is a bezel less phone i'm Superman! 120HZ come first in the iPad Pro do some research. Magsafe is basically a wireless charger? You are joking for sure. AW is Apple watch. Onkyo what? Bro these android fanboys go research stupid shit ffs. You like it or not Apple make a trend and push forward tech industry every year, saying that Apple didn't come with an original idea for the last 10 years is not true at all."
"@JEDLC again, the name of Samsung‚Äôs chips is Exynos look it up. I just finished watching the ipad pro part in the 2016 apple event until they stopped talking about the display and there isn‚Äôt a single mention of 120hz you are probably confusing it with the 2017 one and still the screens are made by samsung, thats like buying a new 144hz monitor for your pc and saying you invented 144hz screens because you hooked it up to the pc"
@JEDLC you realize the only truthful thing you said in that comment is them being the first to use 64bit? You realize how much misinformation you are spreading?
Apple should of done the Lock Screen years ago it‚Äôs to late for me I am switching to the s22 ultra in burgundy I‚Äôm over apple being so simple and not changing enough over the 12 years I‚Äôve used an iPhone
@kyra that‚Äôs true I‚Äôm kinda over it but I‚Äôm trying the new update before I get a new phone
apple likes simplicity
I feel the intro should have been the official Apple intro for IOS 16 lol
I can‚Äôt be the only one that saw the intro 10 times.
IOS 44 gonna be amazing.
Finally AOD
Background noise ( boiling water noise ) is bit interrupting.
"Mr mkbhd literally showed the upcoming iphone 14 in this video guys,

Everyone just note it."
Prototype
Just give us a T9 dialler!
What an intro ‚úåüèºüòÅüòÅ
I think Tesla phone will beat Samsung and apple.
Maybe this year
When is that coming
My iphone X doesn‚Äôt support live text so i assume this new feature won‚Äôt work either
Bro as you might know live text is not working in iPhone X ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Will it return with iOS 16‚Ä¶?
that lockscreen feature ughhh so good
Apple always raises the bar man
üòÇüòÇ
Pretty sure the foreground being loaded before the background for #1 is an effect of the foreground being carved out from the background first and then the actual lockscreen itself being loaded normally. It is essentially an output lag.
The intro üî•
I'm sure the new lock screen will make all Android users switch to iOS and will sound the deathknell of Android....
Damn that intro sooo bloody good!
Does it have an nft crypto wallet built in? If not it‚Äôs old cell phone tech. A phone with no crypto integration is backwards thinking ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Telegram laughing in corner
that intro is sick
All iPhones with iOS 16 will have a neural engine now. Might explain the confident push of AI features.
Watching on iPhone 6s ):
Dope intro
"24 fps is the worst? Depends. It's the best for movies, though. ;)"
23.97üòÇ
Took many years to introduce widgets and once introduced they are running ahead of android....feels pretty apple thing
No update for Se1 T.T
The intro ü§Ø
"Your intro is impressive, good work by your teams"
"Because my finger print sensor is on the side of my Xiaomi phone...I never actually see my lock screen, moment I pick it up I am in my home screen...so these IOS features are just meh"
Damn! That intro was dope! üî•
ios is getting cluttered
I still think Siri should have been better than current stupidity
The Haptic update is the low-key best one
Where we get those wallpaper from?
Android needs this
"@Marques Browniee Please could you check 1 thing please?  In IOS 16, please check turning on Smart Invert. And then please check if youtube automatically converts to Dark mode when ios is in smart invert. I use this as default so everything is in dark mode but theh screwed integ with youtube which causes issues. Please check. If its fixed i would know i have to upgrade. Please"
"Normally, I would have to jailbreak my iphone, and customize everything that was covered in this video. Good for Apple to finally adding these features to the new IOS"
"I feel like most android phones are essentially trying to do away with lockscreens through fast fingerprint scanners and leaving most of the former lockscreen stuff to always on displays, while Apple, in the usual Apple fashion, is creating something different to make their phone instantly recognizable as iPhones."
Awesome quick detailed video thanks!
Thanks Apple for finally letting users to enjoy the useful features that Android users already used for decadesüëçüèª What an improvement!!!
Android users always so salty lmao. I guess I would be too if a not even 2 year old Android phone already started lagging like crazy
@Google was my idea next level lock screen lmao you¬¥re easily impressed
Android never had this next-level lock screen and widgets on lock screen. desk view camera on iOS will be never in Android cause nobody uses chromeos.
This is perfect for someone like me that uses a hella long alphanumeric password so I don‚Äôt have to type it in every time to check something
That intro was üî•üî•üî•üî•
The intro was fab! üòç
Top tier intro üî•üî•
Flipping amazing intro! Great job MKBHD team!
I liked the last 20sec sarcasm. I mean seriously Apple is paying its developer to customize a lock screen. Bravo. Seriously Bravo. I feel sorry for the engineers to have wasted so many hours for such a foolish code
That mf smudge on his camera lense
Best intro ever. Great job guys. Good work.
Holy Shit!!!!! That Introü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
whoever is doing the intros deserves a raise. that intro was brilliant.
That 24fps edit hurts haha
desk view will be very handy when you sketch something on the paper and show it in a meeting
boring boring apple bland and plain
Year by year apple is copying Android
This is the coolest intro omg
What is going on with the white noise in the background? Air conditioning?
It's so dumb that they don't have an always-on-display. That's the only thing that makes me want to go back to Android.
"iPhone users looking at their lockscreens 100x a day...
We android users just direct open up to the homescreen using fingerprints or evn facelocks...barely evr interacting with lockscreen lol"
"Marques, clean your camera lenses on iPhones bro! Haha @ 5:00"
that intro is awesome.. u got an amazing creative team
I get so annoyed when I come to the comments and 60% of them are about the intros. We get it guys
But it was really amazing
"Anyone installed ios 16 public beta on iphone 13 pro?
Any overheating or battery issues?"
Best intro ever!
These new features make my old iphone 11 feel brand new to me! Can‚Äôt wait for the new update
I don‚Äôt see any major bugs I use it as my daily
Still no always on display. And that is one single feature on Android that I like the most.
Bruh the intro is Fire!
Me on ios 14 cool Apple
that intro was absolutely sickkkk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"For me, its the passkeys. No hassle of remembering passwords and opening up keychain to retrieve it. Just share it and you're done. So good!"
im so excited. downloading the beta right now
really like the webcam thing
"Nice intro, sweet"
"I wish they changed spotlight to load searched apps instantly and search for everything else later. 
Like right now it does waits for all web and image text results to load together with the apps you looked up but I mostly only need the app that the phone can surely load faster"
"I can see designers/illustrators going to like the continuous camera. They can record their drawing much easier without any additional hardwares, anywhere."
Ios 16 is not out on my iphone 11
"I can,t wait until the ios 15.6 update comes out soon after the ios 16 will be out in the upcoming months"
Holy fuck that intro
"Dude, that intro was sooooo gooood."
Whether you Accept it or not but iOS is the best operating system of all time. It makes your life so much easier and better
So dumb for Apple to give up support for iPhone 7
I still wish they‚Äôd add split screen multitasking ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
"Daaaaamn apple really gotta hire Marques‚Äôs team to make ads, that intro was literally on par with any ad I‚Äôve ever seen from apple, if not even better"
I type a lot and i like the haptic feedback on the keyboard
Does anyone have a link to the wallpaper at 9:23? That is an absolutely stunning photo...
Intro is dope !! üòéüî•
This might be the coolest intro you guys ever made
where can I find those high quality wallpaper?
iOS starting to look more like Android with every new iteration.
Wow Ios new features.......oops Look like deja vu
The only thing that keeps helps me not dread the end of summer are these iOS releases
Bruh gimme a iPhone 13 pro max it's my dream mob <3
How about the dark mode of Facebook they already fix now?
"If this doesn't scream always on display...then I don't know what will, I'm honestly impressed with Ios 16."
That INTRO! üò≤
"Great overview! I‚Äôm excited to see all that iOS 16 has to offer but I‚Äôm always slow and cautious to update, to a major release. So I doubt I‚Äôll update the same week it‚Äôs released. And I definitely don‚Äôt do betas since I typically only have one iPhone at any time and can‚Äôt have it be buggy. 

It also takes me awhile to start using some of the new things depending on what it is. Like I think I didn‚Äôt finally start using widgets (introduced in iOS 14) on my Home Screen until I upgraded to iOS 15! Or maybe it was just before iOS 15 but definitely for most of the year between iOS 14 & 15 I still hadn‚Äôt setup widgets. I guess maybe cause it meant rearranging my home screens and I just couldn‚Äôt decide what to put where. lol 

Eventually I grouped a lot more stuff into folders and decided which widgets were worth using and where to place them, size, location, etc. I‚Äôm just very picky. lol üòÇ"
Live object Is gonna be so cool. Hopefully I assume we can paste it into photo editor apps like Snapseed or Adobe Lightroom as well
The best videos on youtube.. way to go.
The new lockscreen is a cheap jailbreak tweak... I hope I can stay on the old one
This makes me want an iPhone already omg.
I want to experience ios üò´
I have the Last iPhone and my next phone will be a android again dir sure
"does anyone have noticed ester egg???
XVI"
"Lockscreen update is good but I don't see anything major

Gotta wait for the public beta"
that intro is f sick.
"I mean youre not paid enough mybe to make the video, but i think its a lil too bad you did not create a crazy end of video animation, but thats all in my head lol"
do they have a native clock that has seconds yet??????
Your T shirt‚Äôs graphic looks like my country‚Äôs covid cases graph between 2020 and 2022
"WHAT A SICK INTRO, ON LORD!"
That intro was heckin‚Äô good!!
That intro was fire üî•üî•
"Nice Tshirt
Link please"
2:06 okay okay.. ive been a Apple Hater all my life.. i once BOUGHT  an Iphone and took it back the next week due to it being completely trash.....BUT i WILL SAY... that feature of removing subjects with just a long click ..... as a amatuer photographer .. that is a lovely feature.. i wanted to hate on this video due to it being about apple .....but that one feature made me think twice.... SAMSUNG (ANDROID )WILL ALWAYS REIGN SUPREME in my life. ...
The intro is üî•üî• as always.
That webcam thing has been there on android for quite a while especially on motorola phones
THAT INTRO üòçüòçüòçüòç
Where did you get the Belkin magsafe mount?  Do you know when it‚Äôll be available to the masses?
APPLE widgets vs Android launchers...Apple stop this already!
still no battery % in the status bar  ??
"Fun Fact: Most of the people watching this video don't have an iphoneüòÇüòÇ






we are just ‚ÄúTechnophile""‚ù§"
Liked the video in first 10 seconds.
"Hear me out, I become an intern for MKBHD üëÅ"
What about always on display? It's been heard that I will come with ios16
You know Andriod gonna take that camera idea and I cant wait!
Starting to feel more like Android
That was a super clean intro
"I love android, and I think it's the better software for things like notifications and home screen personalization, but man some of this is stuff is very very appealing. Hope Android adds some of it. Credit to Apple, they're really picking up in the software innovation areas"
Can you put the notifications on the top or you can‚Äôt change it from the bottom?
These Are Old Stuff For Android Lovers.
"What an intro, man!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
Hands down the best intro I‚Äôve ever seen
"How do the Undo/Edit messages work when messaging non-iOS devices? I assume they don't wait 15 minutes to actually send, lol"
Hey buddy waiting for your Apple Mac Book air M2 review.
"Top down web cam is the coolest feature , literally magic ü™Ñ"
That intro is straight fire üî•
now my iPhone 11 is gonna get downgradedüòä
Message editing appears incredible. Will reserve comments till it works the fine way you demonstratedü§†
Dang that haptics
"I still don't understand why people like IPHONE. Everything, he pointed out was useless."
Want that Uzumaki phone case. Where did you get it?
Intro üî•
Been running the beta since day 1. Didn‚Äôt know about the haptic keyboard. Actually feels pretty good. Thanks for the tip brahüòéüòò
SICK intro. Big ups to the team ü´°
The intro üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçsheer chills
Your intros ü´°ü´°ü´°
"The one thing I wish I could do with the new customizable Lock Screen is swap the digital clock for an analog clock, I love the look of analog over digital."
"Yoo I used to have that profile pic too, suda made it years ago"
Intros is always amazing in MKBHD's Team üëèüëè
looks fantastic. but what i really want to know is when is Siri going to stop being a pile of üí©?? can someone please explain why we cannot ask siri on our phone to turn on our mbp or to play music on our mbp? i thought this was supposed to be the best ecosystem around but the products cant even interact with each other. its 2022 already....come on!
The picture thing is cool but other features android already using
"My friends can see when I edit iMessages and they‚Äôre not on iOS 16. You can also get rid of that search ‚Äúwidget?‚Äù on the Home Screen, thankfully."
Cool intro ever.. üî•üíØüíØ
"bro is happy for lockscreen ü§£ü§£üòÇ..
i literally thaught Apple fix the battery life üòí but they ain't same Company anymore."
Here i am on 14.6 still‚Ä¶
They put all that effort into letting you customize your lock screen and put widgets on it but they still don‚Äôt come out with a always on display which is downright disappointing that‚Äôs the only thing I like about android is it has a always on display
IOS 16
The pillow in the back ????
That's a DOPE Intro :)
The weather app has always had that? At least I thought. I just checked mine and I can see what time it rains.
The Intro üòç
Is Apple ever going to add AOD? Samsung has had it for years with no impact at all to battery life.
"As an android user, I think the continuity camera feature is the only new thing that made me go - that's nice!"
"@Rohan Chatterjee Yeah, but I like how Apple copied the customizable lockscreen and widgets from Android and called it intuitive redesign lol."
Don‚Äôt worry android will copy it and you‚Äôll get it for cheap.
"How many times you replayed the intro ?
Me: yes"
"I've been missing the haptic when I switched from pixel 3a to Iphone 13! September is too long damn, can't wait any longer!"
Are live wallpapers now gone? I have the beta and it seems like they aren't available anymore but it could be user error.
Continuity Camera üé• ü´∂üòÉ
"Lovely video, but now my phone is so boring :("
Damn that intro
Ummmm‚Ä¶ always on display ?
Hi JiDion
Apple‚Äôs neural engine is becoming extremely good
Finally weather on my Lock Screen!!!!!!!!!!! Extremely  necessary here in Alaska. It can change in a heartbeat.
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Continuity Camera is available for mac mini?
"amazing! if Apple does it, they nail it, else they won‚Äôt do it!"
The intro is actually DOPE!!
Your introduction of the video is amazingly incredible
Dope AF intro
"What about the shuffle lock screen

I heard every time you use it, you can have random lock screens that you have previously made

Is that true?"
The intro tho ü•µüî•üî•
The lack of haptic keyboard has really been my biggest gripe with the default keyboard
That desk view means soany start up content makers will be able to get those lovely top down shots you have. It will be limited by the shape and size of the object but now we can also unbox. RIP unbox therapy (jokes).
"Apple fanboys are so cute... ü§£
They get so excited over features that are 4 years old ü§£ü§£"
"@Chidghan Hegde correct! But trust me apple will ""invent"" always on display in a couple of years üòâ"
@Greg Marchant yes and ios still don't have always on display
"@Chidghan Hegde
The fact that the IOS update has the haptic keyboard turned off by default tells me that using it will drain the battery quicker than they'd probably like"
even 10 year olds like haptic on keyboard
Very informative video
So IOS 16 is really about bringing Watch OS widgets to the IPhone ü§îüòí. What‚Äôs the point of the Apple Watch now
iOS updates are getting really good lately...
"Hmm, the Conditions text widget doesn‚Äôt give me descriptions of the weather, just the temperature. And the battery widget‚Äôs circle is off center, so totally bugged. Anyone else?"
I could watch the intro for hours
Sick intro
you've been warned loll
Any one have Wi-Fi issues every time keep disconnecting ?
That introü§©ü§©.... Man.... Keeps me interested in your new stuff...
So basically android is losing more and more of its appeal regarding customization.
Ios 50 : still no update on calcualtor
"cool, looks like apple is finally androidnizing iOS, that's great indeed =)"
The first 20 seconds transitions were really dope !! üî•
Iphones rock!..
1:30 guess women are staying on ios 15
"That intro alone deserves a shorty award, dam."
#4 - wow üî•
Lock screens you shown are awesome
Loved the video and that intro! üíØ
WHAT A BANGER INTRO
"I have an iphone 7 ... 
pray for me"
The coolest was the webcam feature ..awesome man....using tht wide angle feature‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
That intro - omg
So all of this works with iphone 8 above?
Great intro üëèüèΩ
No Fonts üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
Damn that intro is so cool
The graphics and intros are in freaking credible
"Does anyone have the Tribune Tower wallpaper at 8:40? It looks so good but I can‚Äôt find it anywhere!

Edit: If someone does please respond I would die for such a picture! Thanks!"
"well , i dont own any iOS devices but wants to get latest update always lol"
Finally Multi Million software developers did something interesting. But...üòÇ
"Can any1 please help me restore my iPhone 4s? It's not restoring from iTunes, 
It was my 1st phone purchased from 1 month sacrificing breakfast. I don't want it to die so easy."
The editing during the intro holyyyyy ü§©
Any battery heating issues and bugs?
Will we be able to remove/customize the buttons at the bottom of the Lock Screen ?
I think its time to upgrade my good ol' s9
"Hey MKB, Both apple watch and wrist band looks weird bruh..!"
"Just wondering how much battery using the phone as a webcam will take, or if the phone will get hot like how it does on FaceTime. Still excited for the update!"
How does he have the battery percentage in the top?
It's too bad you guys couldn't give us an upclose of the home screen of the lock screen.
topdown view would be great for pokemon card battles. LOL you can battle anyone at any part of the world
Not playing in Canada
"Hi, I can‚Äôt play this video in Safari Mobile browser, it shows error occurred,  why is this happening ? Does anyone else facing the same issue for this video ? Other MKBHD videos are playing  fine.."
this just made me feel sad bc I can‚Äôt get it even when it comes our because I don‚Äôt have any storage + plus I don‚Äôt have an iPhone-
This guy's video quality is completely insane
"""it's about damn time"""
"I think a pretty underrated feature is the new Medicines section in the Health app. A significant proportion of adults worldwide (myself included) take prescription medications daily, and this new section of the Health app just makes it easier to keep track of these. And with the Elsevier integration that should be coming in September when the final RC/stable release for iOS 16 drops, you‚Äôll be able to see things like drug-drug interactions, so how your prescription medication might interact with booze, caffeine, cannabis, hell, even melatonin. Continuity Camera is also a great feature to have, though I do not currently own a macOS device to test it out."
"Focus mode feels like Apple‚Äôs beta for multi-user devices. Allowing customized Home Screen, Lock Screen, and eventually accounts and user info"
Such a cool start to the vid thank you!
I can't afford a Apple smartphone still watch every Apple products video üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®
The intro. Sick. Greetings from Munich.
Nothing beats how apple adds something android been had and becomes a hype
Marques Brownlee you truly are the best at you craft thank you for all the videos and inspire me to pursue my dream in technology
Awesome videos sorry im soo late
LOVE the intro!
Just downloaded beta
Intro is better than most Aaa games and movies lol.
The effects on intros looks like apple made them
Woah cool intro
?
Wow this is honestly one of the best iOS releases in recent times. A lot to look forward to.
how do i get this new update
Its still in beta
Love the *XVI* notebook in the background! üëåüèªüëèüèº
That intro thoü§å
Didn't realize 20syl occupied this much of my subconscious
i who still uses iPhone 5s :- ü•≤ üëçüèº
"#4 y #2 me parecen incre√≠bles, el resto est√°n geniales."
The intro thoüî•ü•∂
Hey is the lock screen widget feature available in iPadOS 16??
This is the best IOS UPDATE EVER ON MY SOUL
I love these intros - really wish the music faded out a little longer!
"Stopped the video and came to say
Thats some dope intro"
Finally horizontal face recognition. That has always bugged me
I am excited about Live Objects and of course the Lock Screen customisations üòÄ
Why can you still not remove the flashlight and camera shortcuts at the bottom of the lock screen? Why must I have them there if I don't want them there?
"I someone that is about to use that edit button. ‚ÄúEnd of quote, repeat the line‚Äù"
Now this is an update!
wow..
I wish AOD in iOS 16 üôÇ
"Stopped the video at 0:27 because I have to agree with the comments below - dope intro.

More. Better.

You‚Äôre doing it."
The intro is lit af
That intro deserve a prize
"So... Apple allows you to customize your phone now and is a big deal? üòÜ  

Samsung: Really Apple...  ü§£ü§Øü§¶"
IPhone fun:
"SWEET intro, i can tell you put some time into that and it shows. looked like an ad straight from apple.. üëèüëè"
Very useful bro ‚Ä¶. Next time please skip the side window my looks always go there‚Ä¶ plain is better don‚Äôt mind üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Please give us a dark icon option. Apple and Google are you listening?
Sick Intro ü§´
"No2, i like all your video. But when i see pride flag. My respect üìâ, sorry bruhh"
"Hey Marques, love your XV collection in the left corner. Man of culture you are."
"Never liked the haptics on iphones. I own iphone 11 and 12, still I like the haptics on Oneplus 8T and Realme GT 2 which I own too"
You explain very well.
GOOGLE basically will have this feature just in a week later apple release haha
sad day for autocorrect meme
Okay where do you find these kinds of wallpapers??????
"""Hmm this lock screen shows the time and widgets too clearly for me. I wish there's a way to obscure small parts of it."""
0:13 epic intro just epik
You are really fantastic with that dripping intro üî•üî•üî•
That intro. LAWD!!!
"My favorite new feature is RoomPlan, which brings ARKit to the next level. Now instead of just roughly detecting the floor and walls, it actually figures out doors and furniture and cabinets and so on. This'll be amazing for both games and for things like home renovation software, and I can't wait to be able to use it in room-scale interactive apps."
crisp intro
"smart objects? heh heh, time to farm for some anime stickers."
that intro could be an apple commercial itself. good job mkbhd editing team!
Craig Federighi is doing an amazing job.
That transition si SICK!
Much needed iOS refresh. Can‚Äôt wait until it rolls out.
slowly copying android features...
Legibility Blur is low-key the best feature. I have wanted weather on the Lock Screen for years though.
The intros are so sick! Some daft punk influence in there?
that intros on fire!
Super cool intro. I would love to see a video how you did this and edited it.
It feels like an apple‚Äôs advertisement
"That intro was awesome, and great highlights of the new features and why they matter. Thanks MKBHD and team!"
what is something  special üòÉ love android
The intro is just speechless‚Ä¶
Hey bro can we ask apple to add vibrate on answer and smart dial on ios
"Do they have an accessibility feature that lets you move control center for left-handed users yet? 

As they move things down for reachability, I still have to contort to reach it in the furthest corner of the screen (which is why I use back tap for it)."
They need to change Lock Screen picture based on where you travel to like what the country or city known for.
copy & paste edits in Photos!
The intro fffffsssüôèüôèüôè
My jaw is still opened with that intro transition!
"The question is, can my laptop be in clamshell mode connected to my monitor and I still be able to use the continuity camera?"
"My favorite feature is that iMessage reactions now work properly in group chats that contain an Android phone. Now instead of getting that annoying ‚ÄúMatthew liked ‚Äòmessage‚Äô‚Äù SMS every time someone reacts to something, it just shows up as a reaction the way it does in iMessage conversations."
i want the camera and flashlight buttons gone from the lock screen and i hate that search button at the bottom of the home screen.
bro just made a apple type intro
"I'm an android guy currently, but iOS 16 is looking VERY appealing...."
Does it work if you have a normal ipad 5th gen?
The intro üî•
Finally there is a good reason to wait for iOS 16.  My favourite one was customising lock screen and stuff.   Thanks dude for buying this up
"As soon as he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs about damn time,‚Äù Lizzo started playing in the back of my head"
"""Apple announces continuity camera for ios 16""
Me who is already using droidcam on iPhone for years now:
*interesting*"
I just got my  iPhone13 should i update it to ios16? I care about the battery only
actually pretty excited
That intro is fire!
lol clock behind objects‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre living in the future!
I've never owned an iPhone but IOS 16 is looking tempting & has my attention... ü§î
Holy coww!! The intro is firee üî•
"I hate what they did with the lockscreen customization, i loved the iOS for its minimilism; now it's just another colorOS phone with lots of tweaks. The notification and all is cool but the customizations? why?"
"this is really cool, i do have a question though. on current versions of ios, if you have a live wallpaper, when you hold down the screen it plays. does that feature go away entirely or is it just activated differently. great vids btw keep up the great work"
They feature is gone
Gone
dope intros
Intro is godly!!‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
is there a option to share your lock screen
"Getting closer to android with the Home Screen style, widgets, haptics, browser video"
Don‚Äôt mind me. Just sobbing with my 7plus ü•π.
"I'd really like to know what some of the downsides installing the preview are.  I love to tinker, but I need my phone to work."
Still waiting for an always on Lock Screen. These enhancements are good though.
I liked the shirt tho histogram inspired.
Currently on One Ui 3.1 üòÖ
sick intro
I need that triangle building background üò´ plz link
Great view Marques thank you. Is the iPhone stand for MBs available yet?
"Apple and iOS are reaching their final form‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Actual useful intuitive features 

And dare I say CUSTOMIZATION üëÄüëÄüò©"
it starts from iPhone SE (2nd Gen) or later
"Once the iPhone gets usb-C, I'm on board. That's truly the only thing keeping me in Android land, even though I use an iPad and MacBook since forever. 

About the lock screen, that looks like serious fun and very happy Apple is doing this! I wonder though if either Apple or Android would ever allow to just not show a big fat clock at all, personally I'd like not to be forcefully reminded of the time every time (see, hard to escape this one!) I use my primary device throughout the day."
The Perfect Android
Welp...this might be what brings me back to Apple. I've been having such a hard time with my Samsung phone of late and I think I need to start anew.
"So the Top-down View does work as advertised, sick!"
The intro!!!! üòç
And the newest candidate for best MKBHD video intro is‚Ä¶!
If they'd add a number row option to the top of the keyboard then I'd be satisfied with the default now that they're finally adding haptic.
"I was sitting here for a second thinking, eh I don‚Äôt really like that font for the time and I wish we could change it. Then 5 seconds later I‚Äôm actually in shock. That is awesome."
‚ÄúRIP to some package tracking apps.‚Äù üòÇ
Killing on the intros; as expected.
"HaHa yeah. Agreed. Lockscreen features look schnappy. But I read that the Lockscreen is the next ad placement destination for iPhone (& Android) - So get ready to be bombarded with promos when you're phone is ""off"" & parked next to you on your table at Starbucks."
I was already using these features. Even it's not ios 16.
This iPhone 6 is holding me back üòîüíî
How do they still not have SCHEDULED text messages? So much useless garbage but scheduled text messages would be highly useful.
"I sold my iPhone 13 Pro after they announced this stupid update, Android is waaay much better and why they don't add a frickin finger print scanner to iPhone 14? the face unlock is trash (as biker) I don't think I will ever buy an iPhone again. the only thing I miss is the great battery life, everything else Android phones does it better."
fukin intro dude wtf?????
Don't Worry. Many People Already Changed From IOS To Android.
Can we still use Live Photos as lock screen wallpaper and hold them to see the entire Live Photo
THE INTRO ü•∂ü§Øüî•
"Damn this IOS update might be it for me. Been android user my whole life and been looking for a new phone. With Oneplus being mediocre and Pixel being buggy most of the time, I'm gravitating towards iPhone more and more. I don't even customize my phone for the past 2 years, and I really want a good camera for my phone so yea, iPhone is my best bet now, with Samsung being a close second"
man the intros are dope
Can we get some awards flowing for these intros?
These intros are absolutely amazing!
Intro be lit asf üî•
"I am an iPhone users and I believe that I will enjoy the screen customization 10 or 8 years back. 
Now, we are looking for more features that will actually will make difference in our life like the feature of making your phone as web cam.."
that intro is lit
Hey M do u think that it will have always on display like the androids have??
"I made a judgment call 9 months ago and determined that iPhone 7 is about done with its support for iOS updates sure enough one year later the generation cap pushed my old iPhone 7 out. Now that I have the 13, I‚Äôm pretty happy about this next iOS update."
WoW love TF intro üòç
Intro‚Ä¶.!!!
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos
nothing launch tonight is getting me excited!!!
Intro üòç
Love the lockscreen customizations. And the live object thing!
"THEY REMOVED THE VOLUME SLIDER. 

I repeat‚Ä¶

THEY REMOVED THE VOLUME SLIDER ü§¨"
iPhone is 1 yr back compare to Android
And finally AV1 support
where do i get those wallpapers
"The intro was sooo lit dude!!!
You just keep one upping every single time"
"Now that the spotlight got a new dedicated button on the home screen, swiping down from the home screen should not do the same thing. Swiping down from the home screen should bring the notification panel as notifications on the lock screen are scrolling up from the bottom of the screen. It is for easy reachability."
Shut up
Ios 16  is out and am still using android 11 on a a50 üëÅüëÑüëÅ
Been using it for a month too and the widgets on the lock screen are a game changer. Being able to glance exactly what‚Äôs up next on my calendar is the quality of life change I needed
These intros are straight up fire.
Dat intro tho üî•üî•üî•
This man literally makes intros even better than most of the most innovative companiesüòÇ‚ù£Ô∏è
"Native Haptic keyboard ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can ditch gboard now"
Amazing intro!
"Cries in 2016 MBP. No continuity camera, mail, or message updates. :("
"Isnt undo message this long already in whatssapp and telegram, even telegram can edit the text ü§´?"
I came here for that intro
PLOT TWIST: When MB found out he shouldn't have Thanos snapped his fingers at the start of his vid as he lost 1/2 of the views he would of if he didn't üòÇü§£üëåüëç
Amazing breakdown
Wtf with the intro ??? Who‚Äôs your editing one ?? What a crack lol üòçü•∞üòé
the most enticing intro i have ever seen
Dope Intro Marques üî•
That's pretty big update
its still so suprising that apple supports such old devices
I love the iOS 16 lockscreen customisation. But sadly I‚Äôll have to wait to install it in September on my iPhone 13 as I think the public beta is a bit risky
"All the small innovations and refreshments that have taken place in iOS16 has me really looking forward to copping an iPhone 14! After over a decade of seemingly monotonous and barely tweaked OS, I appreciate all the visual updates and the long awaited customization options. Haven‚Äôt felt this excited/eager since iPhone X or the 8 plus. Kind of a genius business model at play if you really think about it; keep slowly but surely unveiling features and settings for user personalization/customization that the public has long gotten used to in competition. So when Apple finally implements it, the market and dedicated iPhone users go wild."
@Jijoe joshi i was on android from 2009 to 2018 was a hardcore user too use to bash iOS now here I am 2022 still using iOS and Apple given me less and less reasons to switch each year. But hey if you prefer Android more power to ya.
"@J. D. That is true, 3 years happens to be the amount of time I‚Äôve been an iPhone user. Although I can appreciate the changes in iOS16 a bit more because they are more extensive visually speaking and from a customization standpoint. iOS14 & 15 were definitely the inception of uber personalization though"
Dont if u r on android now.. I literally went to iphone 13 and came back to samsung after 2 montgs
Not sure where you have been but the last 3 years of iOS updates have been actually rather substantial 16 is really just more of that.
And then their is me watching this video with my OG iPhone SE 1st genüòÇüòÇ
Man Loved it. The intro was sick
#2 was seriously black magic f
cant wait for the release
The intro is literally apple commercial üò≠
That intro üëèüèªüî•üòé
Desk view is pretty sick. It is good to show your desk and make things flat at the right angle. But it is a little wired when it shows fingers.
Crisp information üåü
"That intro was Apple level quality, and can't wait for iOS 16!"
iOS updates are better then the yearly new phone
That intro tho!
By looking at the AI with photo this year camera may be the biggest update
"Great transitional at the start of the video! Love the aesthetic, bgm, amazing work!!!"
That's what Inmobi's Glance do for Android ?
Damn that intro üòç
the unsend feature is going to start so many fights üòÇ
"Holy cow, can Snapchat implement the updating notifications so I don't have to keep seeing the stupid ""is typing"" notifications"
Love your intros! Super excited for iOS 16!!
THAT INTRO IS AMAZING
after seeing this I am pretty much happy with my android phone.
iPhone users are amazed by the new update. LMAO
if i didn‚Äôt know i would‚Äôve thought the intro was apple‚Äôs ad
Anyone have a link to the ivy covered building wallpaper showcased at 8:48
That intro was dope
best intro ever Marques!!
"Watched Intro more than 5 times , Still Can't Over it .
BTW That Wallpapers are so dope can I get it from somewhere"
The new Lock Screen (watch faces inspired) just make me feel like there‚Äôs a LTPO display coming for the Pro iPhones to activate an always on mode
4:27 forgive me if i am wrong but has marques ever cussed in any other video it is ok but weird change
Finding an Eastern egg is great in video
"those outside of Asia, we have an app called ""Line"", which is extremely popular here. ""Line"" has had the ""unsend"" option for a long time. You can even see what someone wrote before opening it by pressing down on the screen for 2 secs. without actually opening the real msg."
"been patiently waiting for the ""ive had it for a month"" shirt"
That intro was fire!
customization is everything to me i love this new update
"It 16 generations of OS to customise the Lock Screen, thank god"
Dopest doped dope into...üî•üî•üî•
I‚Äôm sorry what was that intro??? Is this an Apple ad. That was GORGEOUS
That intro tho! üî•
Finally Apple is letting us customize our Lock Screen. I wish they would bring the always on display for the clock though. Maybe one day they will.
"How you continue to improve different parts of your videos each and every time is beyond me. Exceptional, yet again."
Intro is awesome üòé
"Marques and his team are by far the best channel on YouTube. Period !

Ive never been excited for a phone update like I am for iOS 16. I‚Äôm blessed to be owing my first iPhone for a month now so I can‚Äôt wait !

Great video as always‚Ä¶. Keep it going üî•. Much love from South Africa üáøüá¶"
that intro was insane
The dope Intro‚ú®üòÇ
"Me: I can‚Äôt use iOS 16 until it comes out
~
~
Also me: *watches EVERY SINGLE VIDEO about iOS 16 bc I CANT WAIT*"
"Always, ALWAYS. The best stuff!!"
"Good for Apple but I'm sitting here with my S22 Ultra laughing that these are ""new"" features ü§£"
Is the simple pressing-and-holding the lock screen to edit widgets an issue? I can foresee everyone accidentally engaging this function.
Still not able to place app icon wherever we want on Home Screen. :(
Really excited for this update. Can‚Äôt wait to cheat on my spouse.
damn Apple making me wanna buy their products now...
I remember first time using an iPhone after years of android and haptic keyboards. Thought it was broken
Boring
Just when people thought smartphone features were at saturation point
"Really? Give me one reason it‚Äôs not stable enough to make it your main just yet.

I think developer beta 3 is very stable and I have no issue at all"
And here I am still with a iOS 6 lol
"The intro alone was so good, it felt like I had watched the whole video"
Bruh he just abducted a dog
Your intros are on par with @iPhonedo
I think it's finally my time to move to apple. Really unfortunate that they won't make an iphone 14 mini tho
Coming from android to iOS can someone push for swipe back!!! Oneui is so much easier to use one handed.
Brilliant intro Marques and team. I can't wait to try out the public beta for iOS 16 on my iphone 8 since I don't want to try it out on my daily driver my iphone 12 Pro Max.
Why you make a whole ad for them?
Apple  sent him the iOS 16 first on the 13. It‚Äôs pretty much an overview on what‚Äôs to come accept the 14 will be with a full screen.
"see I was right. You never do any videos on Android talking good about them. You always talk about Apple, Apple, Apple, why don't you do a video on Android 13? how great it is and how it's going to make the pixel way better. no, I can't do that one. I'm an Apple fanboy. go look at the tweet that I made a lot of people agree what I said about you"
toxic relationships about to be even crazier haha
"man, I'm still hoping they're gonna give us a health widget. I just like seeing my daily steps without opening the app. and maybe an option for a smaller battery widget. the lockscreen changes looks great though. the lower notifications and music player is perfect for me. And Live Object is quite amazing. I look forward to the official update."
"Dm

"Morning, guys!

Well that's neat! Good job, Apple!
Thank you for the video.




My worst feature though would be not having an iPhone ;S
Have a great day everyone!"
holy cow that intro is sick I havent even watched the video yet but I am liking because of the intro.
"Dam apple, u wanna talk about a low blow.
#1-galaxy theme park/ android
#2-another tool to squeeze more money out of u.
#3-IOS is becoming cluttered, trying to keep up with Samsung and google customization."
I feel like it's been a hell of a long time since Apple felt like it was really providing some top-tier stuff. Feels great to say I think we've reached a point where it no longer feels that way!
@Ez Pz it is lmfao
@BehelitOutlaw it¬¥s not lmao
LOL the processor in the 13 is 50% more powerfull than any other cpu
You forgot about when they released M1 products? Or the crazy good battery life of the iPhone 13 series?
"Apple as a whole or just the Iphone?

Cant say they arent providing top teir stuff when their Tablets are world class and the absolute best available"
Bruh‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt wait!
Looks good.
That intro was so incredibly cleanü§å
"alot of good stuff... BUT WHY THE HELL is apple still not making widgets interactable??? I just dont understand. Widgets are ... okay at best. However, they are only 1/3 as useful and they COULD be. I mean hell, they can't make a button widget for me to turn my vpn on from a widget? I can't check off my todo list from the widget?? Those are all I really need! If they can make interactable notification center and music players, I would think the minds at apple could come up with something?"
"It's great that apple is finally embracing customizations. 

Beating Android at their own game (atleast in lockscreen customizations is remarkable). As an Android fan, I love the direction Apple is taking.

Competition brings innovation."
"FYI there is an app called droidcam for android which does the same thing as continuity camera.

 - Oh and it's been around since 2010 ;)"
... Not the desk view bit though
"Wow, such great new features! I cannot wait."
Honestly one of my favorite intros of any video you‚Äôve uploaded. The team has done nothing but one upped itself each time and it feels like the universe is the ceiling for all of you! Amazing work as always.
"Your worries (yes, anxiety), depression, suicidal thoughts, EVERYTHING will melt away and be NO MORE when you lean on God and put your trust in him! When I have physical pain, I literally pray and the Lord quells it, that I am healed!

Know that there is power in the name Jesus Christ! His name casts out demons and heals! People are bothered by his name. The world hates the truth and wants to continue living sinfully! God's children are set apart (holy) and righteous."
"Hey! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him!
Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!

Have a blessed day, everyone! ‚ù§"
Came here to say exactly this!!!
yeah..I mean Apple could totally use it as a commercial for the iOS 16 update
The intro was so good ü§©ü§©ü§©
CarPlay?!?! We need an in-depth on ur Tesla
This youtuber lost all his credibility when he voted iOS against Android in his previous comparison video. How much apple paid for it ?
"Good video. But this ""update"" isn't that impressive looking right now. Semi customizable lock screen.  Notifications still aren't fully organized. Where's the ""convenience"" features, like some minor navigation of the phone with your voice for when hands are full/messy etc. Nothing crazy, just the ability to answer/hang up a call , set an alarm /timer , likewise turn them off or dismiss them with voice. 
Idk. Doesn't seem like much is different but I'll reserve judgment until the full release abs features have been navigated/discovered"
That intro was amazing
iOS customization at it's peak.
The customizable lock screen is great (for now) if you can see it. *Cough Always-On Display*
Clock was osum
"Now the question is... how do you use the live wallpapers on your lock screen without customizing your lock screen. I have been using iOS 16 Beta for a good while and still haven't figured it out.
Huge fan! <3"
At this point all iOS needs is sideloading and a folding phone and I'll convert from over a decade of Android phones.
Custom lockscreen is #1!
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes in these videos
"Ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôm getting this update, I would actually like to lock my phone with a password."
"HAPTIC KEYBOARD.... That it Chief, I'm ready to switch!"
does the photo‚Äôs album can be locked?
Craig Federighi would be impressed by that intro üòÖ
I like trying to find the Lil things that might be in background of videos like the 16 on that book and the colored rings on the table that might insinuate the new colours for iPhone 14
That XVI in the background is a great touch kind of like Easter egg ü•ö.
Thank you for the captions.
"I'd really like to see some improvements that can be done to Hardware through software optimization maybe. my 12 mini loses signal all the time, battery drain on a smaller battery already is a nightmare and random stutter while scrolling."
@Anthony Richard What is a reset just reset the whole phone? I wanna keep my data
"@Dumplinsover9000 yeah I guess so, I‚Äôve had no real problems with the device itself. Luckily. . I‚Äôm in love with the size and ability to handle this phone though l"
"@Arctica nah I don‚Äôt have that problem dude, like someone said try a reset . . otherwise take it to apple see what they say ."
@Dumplinsover9000 Weird wtf idk why it happens but it happened pretty early since I got it but I'll just live with it 'till I upgrade later
"@Arctica nope, just tested it"
"All nice, but why can't they make it so when I clear a notification on my iPhone, it also clears on my iPad and Mac?"
When are we finally getting volume mixers. I hate being in a voice call or FT trying to watch a video an or listen to music at the same time
Am I only the one who played intro 5 times.
"Pretty sure Apple had a haptic keyboard before and for some reason, they have removed it. Good, now it is back."
4:33 Why does your phone say SOS. Is this some silent cry for help?
When is Apple going to get over themselves and let us put icons wherever we want on the screen?!? üò°
these features are available in Android in decades ago üòÖüòÖüòÖ
Nice video as always. Can you share your wallpaper?
"But tell anything , for non iOS users it's really difficult to handle at anything."
"Re: Lock Screen - but do you see how much effort it requires from us to set it up? Had the same issue with Focus as well‚Ä¶I wish they‚Äôd give us a template, or some AI which predicts which apps would go with which focus to help us get started"
Looks like an intro made by Apple!! What a creative team!!
I want the back gsture of android   Just swipe from the side‚Ä¶..!‚òπÔ∏è
I still don't think I'll ever buy an iPhone
"Apple is sitting on trillions of dollars. They have more cash than many small countries. And what do they do with this cash? They fiddle with silly lock screen, haptic keyboard and unsend messages! 

These are hardly innovation. Basically a few lines of codes that cost them $50 in salary!

Shouldn't these companies do something about the planet, droughts, CO2, deforestation, over-fishing, disappearing of coral reefs -- things that affect entire humanity? Sure, one company can't solve all the problems, but they have enough money to solve one each. They have enough cash to come up with genuine innovations that will save this planet instead of fiddling with silly stuff which we all can survive without. 

And I am not only picking on Apple. FB, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Ebay... they are all sitting on trillions of dollars but are hyper-reluctant to spend on the survivability of humanity. :-("
"If I get the beta now, how hard is it to go back to iOS 15 if I change my mind?"
¬°Buena introducci√≥n!
Hey I would like to get a valve steam deck
"An important missing feature in iOS is a proper calendar reminder. The old Blackberry had the perfect one. It was basically an alarm, impossible to miss unless you postponed it or reset it. You can easily miss an appointment with iOS."
"ive never used apple calendar, ive always used Fantastical.
edit: i use apple calendar on every other device but the phone"
You can use the persistent banner style for the reminder
I use the built in calendar and set reminders and never miss appointments.
"Yes BB had a perfect calendar, it used to integrate even with FB and show the Bday Notifications as popups without any problems, missing it..."
"Your worries (yes, anxiety), depression, suicidal thoughts, EVERYTHING will melt away and be NO MORE when you lean on God and put your trust in him! When I have physical pain, I literally pray and the Lord quells it, that I am healed!

Know that there is power in the name Jesus Christ! His name casts out demons and heals! People are bothered by his name. The world hates the truth and wants to continue living sinfully! God's children are set apart (holy) and righteous."
What a into üëå
Looking forward to third-party widget support (WidgetKit?). All I need is FB and Messenger badges on the lock screen and I'll be a happy camper.
"The new lock screen is super cool-- but they really, REALLY missed the perfect opportunity to finally unveil an always-on display. This has been an absolutely essential Android feature for years, and it's downright unacceptable that it still isn't on iOS. The way the Google Pixel transitions from the AOD to the lock screen is beautiful... and I'm sure Apple, with their magic, could totally do it better."
That‚Äôs probably coming to the iPhone 14 lineup. Maybe just the pros. We‚Äôll see
iPhone has had haptic keypad forever. Am I crazy? I swear like my 3s had that.
Your iOS 16 intro is better that Apple‚Äôs!
Will the continuity camera work on the iPad? Would like to see what using the camera on my iPad as my webcam esp since the two sit beside each other on the desk all the time.
"Thanks, JiDion."
"If i want to buy iPhone 13 pro max in 2027 , is that a best buy then?"
"Okay when I first saw MKBHD type 24 fps is the worst, I was like... Wow this guy's a creator? And then he deleted it and peace was restored."
"No matter what Apple does, without 3rd party apps, iPhone would always be trash in my opinion."
Now apple is providing customisation and other Android brands are stopping customisation....
Nothing beats the amazing intros that the team makes
Dude that intro blew my mind woah!!
one day apple will be innovative again
The intro was sick! I thought I was seeing an actual Apple ad with it. Nice work. :)
I‚Äôve been on the iOS 15.4 beta- and very rarely I‚Äôll have my latest text message appear on the bottom of the Home Screen as if it were iOS 16!
This stuff is genuinely impressive. I hope these changes can make their way over to Android as well.
Customization has been on Android since the beginning. The Webcam use though is great!
I‚Äôve been using the Camo app that turns my iPhone 13 into a webcam. Works on Mac and windows. Wonder how it will stack up to continuity camera‚Ä¶.
"I've used android all my life and generally dislike apple. But the Loco screen part of IOS 16, is really good. Kudos apple üëè"
"Recently switched from android to iPhone and the one thing that I miss the most is android/google‚Äôs detection of spam callers and sms. I have a publically listed phone number and I get _so many_ spam calls/messages. I know I can filter all unknown numbers but still, something leagues ahead of iPhone and feels like a big step back"
"Not a fan of iOS, but ngl these new features are pretty sweet."
"So they've added a ton of cool features, but they still haven't considered making iOS easier to use like One UI? 

Phones are getting to tall and big nowadays, just start making the UI lower to make it easier to access with one hand, ffs"
I‚Äôm just curious why isn‚Äôt siri offline working in ios 16?
That intro sequence tho
I‚Äôm actually looking forward to the Lock Screen cause I love focus mode for school so to have changing lock screen with different widgets for the each mode would be baller as hell
The MKBHD intros always get meüòç
That intro ü§Ø
"iOS16 About to release ... 16M About to hit ...

nice."
Well to Android world iPhone peeps.
that intro is so dope!
The intros just get better
Good bye live pictures on Lock Screen
damn
3:35 what is the name of apps with the check mark next to Safari?
Ticktick to do list
24fps is CINEMA üò±
The fact you listen to skeme makes me so happy.
Rip iPhone 7
"As always, thanks for your in-depth reviews!"
Super cool video like itüòä
Nice
You guys basically broke your sealing with this next-level intro in this video.This is the result of a healthy work environment where dedicated people are doing actual work.
Love seeing all the new things Apple does that Android has done for years.
Hey do you have the wallpaper links for the building that go between the foreground and the background?
will they still see the notification before you edit or unsend the message?
Me Android user who watches this video without having iPhone.
"So close Apple, after the Lock Screen ‚ÄòUnlocks‚Äô - It should just open to your Home Screen. No need to ‚ÄòSwipe Up‚Äô afterwards‚Ä¶."
XM5 coming sooon‚Ä¶
So after deleting that risky text to my crush I should just pray she‚Äôs on iOS 16
The notifications and table view are the only ones that I liked rest is already here in Android
"Goddamnn the intro, blew me away üî•"
"No call recording by ios , that should be made available soon, what gen we living at."
If they would just get rid of that old outdated notch ü•±
"iphones photo app is insane. The last time i had an iphone was when ios 7 was in beta, its crazy how much better its gotten"
I have it
thank for video brotherüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è
can't wait...
Why do all the home screen customization feel like an evolution of what we saw from Cyanogen Mod? ü§£ü§£ü§£
"I'm loving all the new features from iOS 16, the lockscreen being my favourite. But i honestly do not understand the hype behind the continuity camera feature and its use case in general. You need to have an iPhone to do this first of all. Secondly, if you're using this as a webcam during video calls, there's a possibility that this quality might not even be noticeable to the other person because of the compressions applied by video calling apps. Also, slow network won't allow you to stream that video anyway.  My biggest gripe with this feature is that you literally block your phone when you're using it as a camera. You just can't use it. If you're on a call for hours, you just won't be able to take calls or check your notifications. I feel like it is a gimmick and that most of the people either won't even realise that this feature exists or they'll forget it soon."
Does continuity camera work on an IPad?
Easter Egg in the background on the book shelf. XVI on the book..
Bro. Make a  comparison iOS 16 with Samsung's One UI 5
That live objects is crazy
"I can't affordable any apple products but still watching this video for only mkbh
Love from india"
Lol finally apple can customize Lock Screen lol they are so far back.
I want clean home screen with no apps on it like Samsung pleaseeee‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no use of applying your favourite wallpaper ü•≤ü•≤
Goota appreciate the intro and kudos to the MKBHD team.
"Installed the public beta today, loving it so far. Definitely some fixing but it‚Äôs a beta so I‚Äôm not too annoyed. Love the haptic keyboard feature and the UI changes that look much more fresh and clean. Also, the elephant in the room which is the lock screen is a perfect redesign that was needed for such a long time."
Do tou have any idea when it will gonna release for gloabal or indian version ?
Shared photo libraries didn‚Äôt make the list? Dude must not have a family.
This is so advanced in terms of features that have been available on iPhone until this point its almost unreal. Had to double check to make sure its not April 1st
WAIT is it actually out right now??? üò≥
"""Not stable enough to be your main yet"" Thanks for letting us know!

*looks at my iphone 8 that's had the beta installed since the day of the keynote*"
"iOS16 has some amazing tech demo‚Äôs, but in day-to-day usage, the only real new feature is the Lockscreen. Still no true interactive widgets, no ability to place apps anywhere, etc. Think most ppl are gonna be disappointed there isn‚Äôt more to this release."
2:12 is plain awesome
"same BS for years, nothing changes"
congratulations on haptic keyboard iPhone users lol
Still dark sky app is better
Can we drag and drop objects to other social media like WhatsApp and Instagram etc ?
That intro tho
best feature lockscreen..what an innovation.. trillion dollor company ..trillion dollor innovation..joke of century
will the new update slow down my phone as usual?
I‚Äôm just waiting for him to miss lol üòÇ
Damn that introüòê
"Honestly so sick on my iPhone 13. Had a work Pixel 6 but quit that job, should have bought out the phone and took it with me. iPhone limitations are infuriating and the camera is dumpy."
Please talk about passkeys.
"Why im not excited with iPhones ""new"" feature when released. Because its on android yrs already"
Cleanest intro ü•µ
Does package tracking work with FedEx?  FedEx recently disabled pulling that data for the Deliveries App.
Ahh yes . The Apple android
woww those features are just amazing
What an awesome inro
Nice nuggets in the background
I‚Äôm still waiting for iPhone 9
"I think it's the first time in 5 years that Apple did a ""real useful"" update  ü§£ü§£ü§£"
Android os has more of features and customization for the sake of having them. iOS on the other hand will only introduce features that they can very clearly connect to what Apple perceives as a better user experience.
"Still no always on display which is quite disappointing. Android has had this feature for 5 years now, and it‚Äôs one of the features I miss the most."
WHY CANT WE MARK A TEXT AS ‚ÄúUNREAD‚Äù YET?!?!?!
Well the new update slow down my phone
pls dislike my comment
Each new feature is fully practical in daily life.
"still a little pissed that darksky is apple only, loved that on my android"
Meh
that intro was insanely good!
Rip my iphone 7
"It's nice though. I got the new pixel 6, it's amazing but i wish it'd be easier to customize without having to download apps and wallpapers."
Bro these videos just keep getting better!
Bro. These intros are goated üò≥
Me watching this on my iPhone 7 Plusü•≤
Deleting a message is new to Apple users?
So basic changes. Apple bullies customers.
"I phone is more man made 
hype than creativity"
"In the video shown above, the spotify widget is small and compact whereas ive just downloaded the public beta and it is a full size widget that takes up the whole screen, is there a way to set it to the small widget size for spotify?"
"Great job, Apple!"
I can‚Äôt find my photos and videos in iPhotos earlier they were in the iPhotos And in iCloud but now they are only in iCloud but not seen in iPhotos how can I get those photos and videos in iPhotos?
"Oh man, the search function being on the bottom of the screen all time is gonna irk me. I hope theres a way to change that."
intros are next level!
I'm about to buy a phone and I think this one's going to be my last android phone. üëèüëè Apple
Does ‚Äúcount‚Äù on notifications show the app icon + badge count? Or is it just a total tally of all notifications?
Fun Fact: *Walmart has a lower acceptance rate than Harvard*
8:46 it is a nice touch or a little delay?
There must be a time limit to which you can edit or unsend
"Iphone is a great phone, but fell like android has had all these features for years. Not sure if apple deserves to much credit for any update, upgrade they have ever done considering you could jailbreak them for years now with almost endless features to the software"
That intro ü§§
‚ÄúNot stable enough to make your main‚Äù bro I have ios 13 betas 3+2 on both my main phones and have had them literally since they went up on betaprofiles iOS updates have not been that significantly buggy in forever
that fucking intro though 20 outa 10
"So very cool that haptic feed back , well I did not know I was missing it. And now that I have it I cannot live without it !!"
"if only people knew about the notifications summary feature, this feature with the notifications not blocking your lock screen wouldn‚Äôt be that big an issue!"
This video is better than iOS 16
üî•üî•üî• intro!
The new widgets right under the time look perfectly designed for an always-on display. I doubt we're going to get it tho
What a hero. Working past 5:00 to make content.
It would be super interesting if with their gigantic user base they just somehow did a native IOS equivalent of the new app BeReal...üßê
That intro was sick
The animation for the cut photo feature is so clean. Looks futuristic
great video!
Oh God the introüî•ü§Ø
"I think Apple needs a new UI on all their apps. The Calendar app is so plain, I like the old-style Notes app with the yellow pad, Contacts needs a whole new UI because it is so plain and horrible. It's like the hype is the lock screen."
"This all looks great, but writing on the wall, I‚Äôm mad they‚Äôre only going to do AOD for the 14‚Ä¶ I can feel it in my bones."
YO THAT LOCKSCREEN EDITING IS SO DOPE :O
"Feels like the whole desktop view was an accident, like a side-effect of having the iPhone as a webcam. And the developers were like ""might as well make it a feature"". Kind of random for someone to look at this as a feature and said  ""we need this"".
On a side note lockscreen customisation is so much cleaner on iOS and a needed customisation style on iPhones. Of course Android has them for years but most of them are either manufacturer side or third party launcher, not under main OS. Still it does feel different from Android ones, but Android definitely have thrice more customisation than iOS."
Thanos snap transition too? damn
Can't wait for Google to do it better.
Small changes make a big difference üòå
"That continuity camera is like a remote camera app that you can download in Play Store, I would say that it was 4 years ago when it was invented to Android, though I think Apple did it fast to implement it straight to the system of IOS, which Android didn't do. I wish Android does that."
Best intros in the fucking game!
That snap in beginning got my like bro hatsoff‚ù§Ô∏è
"i want features i actually use, great you can crop a picture but who is doing that and why? lock screen.... literally its for the clock and that's it. running out of ideas since modern phones are pretty much peak"
That intro was nuts again wow.
Anybody else think unsend are bs? As a regular person perspective. I feel like it‚Äôs an unnecessary feature just to unsay something. Or maybe it‚Äôs just me
When is it out of beta?
"""Its not stable enough for your main"" Oh well I just updated my phone to the beta xD"
looks like my galaxy S7 lock screen back in 2016
This beta sucks
I‚Äôm excited for this update üòç
If only they made the commercials for apple.
Only the nothing phone 1 is the competitor of iPhone 14 in terms of MKBHD BEST DESIGN AWARD OF THE YEAR
Awesome video as well. Straight to the point.
THAT INTROOOOOO MAN I LOVE THIS GENERATION
"Mkbhd: It‚Äôs not stable enough to be your main.

Me: An individual who runs it on his main.

Mkbhd: ‚Ä¶.aight I warned you."
I don't even have an iPhone or interested on buying one soon (but I'm considering it) but I love the quality of this videos.
brb switching to iphone now again finally after ages shit got interesting
don't block my clock
Its an iphone with an android features
Too bad that nested lock screen effect only works for default system wallpapers on iPhone 8 Plus :(
"Samsung 10 years ago: you can customize your lock screen. 
People: Okay
Apple ten years later: you can customize your lock screen. 
People: wooooow!!!! How did you do that??? Amazing feature!!!!"
Seems like Apple is grabbing features from both Android and jailbreaking. It's like they're trying to phase out a reason to jailbreak your iPhone.
Few innovations hides things that are already implemented in android but are New Feature on iPhone.
Excited for that lockscreen lol
That hard-press that autoamatically crops the photo to  a thread is just so PERFECT that I wished Android has.
My name is jeff
If Apple keeps it up with the useful updates just might have to finally switch from Android.
Screengrabbing the photos subjects & that continuity camera might just be the selling point for me this year to switch to apple ecosystem üî•
"Continuity camera is ""genius"" for people with more than one iPhone. :)
For people with one iPhone only? Nope."
"Oh. My. God. FINALLY I get a haptic keyboard on my iPhone. I dunno why but I just can't use Gboard or Swiftkey and type accurately, so this is much appreciated üôè"
Love the intro!!
"I know this is a silly question but, is this the 13 or 14 iPhone?"
I just found out iphones doesn't have hapticfeedback until now wtf
"Damn, that intro!"
This iOS drains your battery (iPhone 13 pro max)
Can you do the finger press thing with regular pictures? like can I put a cutout into a pic in my camera roll?
"Being able to save lock screens is sweet. 

Cool to see the subject recognition works with any photo."
"brooo
pliz tell us where u got ur wallpapers from????üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è"
Get the hell out of here with that sick ass intro üëèüëè
Any updates about apple Gona add finger scanner in new phone??
"Great video, thanks!"
Android users have '*' instead of that #5 unsend and edit i message featureüòÄ
dankpods salivating
Android had these 5-6 years ago. Sad.
Damn! That intro!!!ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
The only thing useful from this update for me is edit and unsend message and live objects
"With the unsend message, the recipient doesn‚Äôt get the message for 15 minutes? What if it‚Äôs a time sensitive message?"
"damn theve been to town with this update,  the desk view is literal witchcraft fr"
Apple is slow
Still no t9 dialing. Linus is gonna be pissed
Is it coming to ipads?
ah... that explains why my delete msg didn't work with my friend today.. he's not on the new OS yet. The copy photo thing is kinda hard to use but cool.
"Did they update the native clock app and timers? 
I'm surprised Apple still haven't got multiple timers at once like Android does."
Go check the highlights from you YouTube notification. Seriously! Amazing stuff!
The intro is a thing of beauty wow
I spy new M2 Macbook Air at 5:04!
Thanks Marques
So no always on display? ü§î
Mkbhd the üêê. Best to ever do it!
Customization and haptic keyboard lol. What a joke when androids had these from the very beginning. Apple still so far behind
I think the iphone 14 might be my first iphone since 5.
What an intro..top ffff notch
SKEME FEATURED ON MKBHD WHOAAAAAA
Where can I buy that kind of phone mount for the MacBook? I‚Äôm not even sure what it is called.
Hey Brownlee I wish someday we could open 2 apps at the same time with split screen. I'm waiting for that day man. Is that too much asking?
"MKBHD: makes the best intro ever. 
also MKBHD: uses the worst mic ever..and forgets to close the windows."
XVI
It‚Äôs every single thing I ever wished my iPhone could do. Love you apple ‚ù§Ô∏è.
They need to update Apple CarPlay .
no GPS?
Are we getting an always on display on the new phone ?
"excellent editing marques! I gotta say, from a aesthetic perspective, i love that new clock design and how it blends with the background, really nice"
Most of these thing's  already on most samsung
"Love the deskview feature! I think it'll be super beneficial for teaching, being a teacher myself."
I don‚Äôt like the fact that the Home Screen is now the same of the Lock Screen. Hopefully Apple will let us have them different.
Nice
So where‚Äôs split screen(multi window)?
Thanks Joe Gomez
"Booted up my droid 1 and as of 2.3, there‚Äôs still vibrate on key press for the keyboard. 
Side note: surprised it still boots"
GHOLY SHIT THAT INTRO
Love the intro amazing to see you keep on being creative with your reviews!!
THE INTROüî•
IMessage editing and recall = relationship shredder
"Best feature, iOS 16 supported on an iPhone 8 which is turning 5 years old in September."
I thought the intro song was going to be the macarana. Same intro beat.
I‚Äôm kinda surprised IOS 16 is not going to be available for iPhone 6 and older models. Apple went beyond the 5 year update lifespan for that model.
"This like from INDIA , TAMILNADU üëç"
"As im watching this on my ipad, im downloading the beta on my iphone and im extremely excited about it."
My first comment on your channel and it's because of the amazing intro
"I really like your videos. They keep getting more polished just like iOS. Oh man, do you ever put out a good product. I really enjoy watching how you present information. You make it a really fresh experience."
Still no always on display
The intro for this video was fantastic
I have never had to actually pause rewind and watch an intro like that in a while. That was incredible.
"So instead of the ability to customize the home screen, they give user the ability to customize lockscreen? 
I can‚Äôt even select a music as my ringtone, or assign a custom notification sound to certain person, and yeeet‚Ä¶lock screen, whaaaat?!"
They'll probably bring that on ios 32 üòÇ
"My favourite feature is, that my banking apps doesnt work anymore....üëçüèº"
iOS 16 looks cool but what kind of CarPlay updates can we expect?
"The shortcuts app is not able in IOS 16 to change the photo used in lockscreen. Its very good the Lockscreen, buy its affecting to another apps that belong to apple. That is major issue."
"Android geeks be like ""we had those for YEARS"". Customisations? Yeah, the Comic Sans MS customisations. Not these AI-based stylish customisations."
After watching the Collab video with @mrwhosetheboss. I just realised how Marques is biased towards iPhone. Most if not all this features have log been on Android phones.
Are you nuts? Marques has been an android head for years...
One of the best intros I‚Äôve ever seen.
so iphone 7 is now obsolete? great
what's the holder you used for holding mobile on laptop Marques ?
Omg the video is soooooooo crispy!!!!!
iOS is finally becoming what it‚Äôs meant to be! ANDROID! lol
And still no AOD
So bunch of useless stuff but still no BACK gesture. I hate iOS because I'm constantly forced to use TWO hands to use it.
I really hope you can turn that stupid as shit search button off.
"I‚Äôm still upset that I can no longer save pic from google, keep getting that trademarked or copyright thing. Not sure who‚Äôs end its on but now I can use google to save and send my memes and gifs üò¢"
Just downloaded the iOS 16 Public Beta and i have to say that it is the best update we have had in years. Its better in person than what you see lol
"It's amazing how many android things are like ""game changing"" features on ios"
Waiting for mac book air 2 hands on videoü•π
Can you hide the spotlight search on the home screen? Curious because I want a clean homescreen.
Trash
Not that exciting update üòë
Does it not open the phone before you could stare at the lock screen?
I actually needed to rewind to look at the intro again. Jeez!
First time since I switched off the iPhone 5 I've considered moving off Android
"I don't think that I spend much time on the lock screen, becase I have an always on display then immediately unlock my phone"
Only 5 this video could have been a yt reel
Surprisingly I like the new wallpaper set up as you can have your personal made wallpaper but also edit the screen to make it look aesthetically appealing.
ü¶ïSo funny and enjoyable ü¶ñ
Hoping that the iPhone SE 2nd Gen will be okay with these updates?
It‚Äôs crazy how many features from jailbreak they‚Äôve implemented into iOS 16. From customizing the home screen with complications/widgets to minimal things like the haptic keyboard.
"Not gonna lie as an lifelong android user, most of these features are super dope and wish we had them."
Live objects is next level. Hats off to Apple for this
That intro... siiiiiiiick! üí•
"The editing when he clicked his fingers, omg that was perfect"
"Android has had a lock screen customization feature for a while now. But like widgets, Apple‚Äôs take on the feature is so good."
that intro was mind blowing
"i've got the beta too, its okay nothing wow."
number 8 on the yt trending list
hello every body
The intro is just damn üî•üî•
im wondering do u have that MacBook air m2 video in the making hmmm i am guess you do...hmmm lol
"With the live objects, when you lift an object by holding and moving the object, using the other finger to open a recent app to paste the object requires much hand gymnastics. With the lack of multi window support, I feel that at least moving an object should smartly open your recently opened apps in small cards so you can drop it in whatever app you want to. My opinion though. I feel it might be easier that way...

And for the haptics in the keyboard I remember sending them a feedback about how it would be impressive to at least give the option for those who want it to turn it on and use, considering how unmatched their haptics are...And that's exactly what they did... Impressive"
Would the Webcam feature work for old mabook pro like 2011 old??
"I absolutely fancy the transitional effects on the first 20 seconds of this video. It just keeps getting better and better, splendid editing work right there.üî•"
you should get out more
"@Stephane Nouafo it‚Äôs so annoying, ppl do this on EVERY video acting like it‚Äôs an original thought they had. Ain‚Äôt no way that many people have the same exact thing to say just off the whim. SMH ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Tryna get those clicks
stop copying comments
You just copied this comment word for word from Deon Soto...
Android has alot of making up
Love the idea of the desk view camera and the possibility of playing tabletop games over FaceTime. Super cool feature.
"@Matteo 
Maybe not you, but people who have friends will."
Yeah no one is doing that
stop stealing comments
Now all we need is usb c. Maybe the switch to ios wouldn't be so painful then
I hope we can remove the clock if we want.  I don't want to see the clock in the middle of the night.
"Apple adding features in iOS which have already been for years in android and which we didn't even know that we had.
Like literally I never notice my keyboard's haptic feedback until I type this comment"
Finally they‚Äôre improving the iPhone so much. This is exactly what we needed!
That was by far the best intro. Great work team MKBHD
Boyfriends during an argument via iMessage:let me switch to android and lets see who you really are ü§î
at this point iphones are just hard to beat. cant wait to ditch my crappy android. just gotta save up
IOS should allow users to customize app locations around screen like Android.
Using the iphone as a webcam will only work for Mac or that feature can be used for any other desk pc/notebook?
Girlfriends will be changing their messages 20 times before actually sending it during an argument ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Need always on screen clock ‚è∞Ô∏è.
I literally got the iPhone XS Max just to get the next updateü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI had the 8
Does ios16 have always on Display? The last thing I love from Android that iphone doesn't have yet
I only found you a few months ago and i cant get enough but urghh been waiting for the public beta to come out ios 16 is a make or break for me as i am soooo tempted as a female by the pretty cute samsung z flip and eagerly awaiting z flip 4 but hubby says i will hate messages as we are a iphone iMessage family but i recently saw an article that phone companies will be forced by the end of the year by the courts to have message apps that are compatible across all platforms ie iphone and android did you read that ? So if ios 16 is able to make my phone better like android as in more widgets cute screens and lockscreens all the girly stuff maybe i will stay otherwise i may switchüò¨but will keep my iphone 13 till im sure and sell whatever i do t want also read terrible reviews on z flip 3 screens getting dust or dirt in the fold gap causing cracking which isn‚Äôt under their warranty even if it happens within a week or month costing people alot money to fix and months sent away also the preinstalled screen protector either breaking or lifting from overheating and you can‚Äôt replace it yourself one free one from samsung in first year but it has to be installed by samsung so you have to send it away and samsung ran out of screen protectors but also said if you dont replace the broken or lifting protector your screen will probably crack so people waiting for samsung to get stock of screen protectors in ended up having their screen crack and then had to pay hefty amount to fix that whoch was basically samsungs fault
That INTRO!!!
What about an ‚Äúauto-lock‚Äù toggle from control center?  I like to disable but then re-enable for normal usage.
iOS 16‚Ä¶. Book on lower shelf  XVI üëÄ. LoL gotta have the Easter Eggs
"Still no always-on display in 2022. Insane. Well, they *just* got haptic keyboard presses, so they'll probably get in in another 5 years! üòÇ"
I wish ios has option like android where you hide apps or give a password or some sort of security in your apps........ people with strict parents will understand my pain.....I have a iphone 11 but I have to still use my Google pixel 3A xl for social media apps .......Hope apple will add this feature in ios 17
The intro is sooooooo clean love it!
2:11 - Copyright is finished. R.I.P.
Marques I just wanna say I like you enough to watch your post-roll ads üòÇ
This was the dopest intro
Beats
do you have to have the clock on the lock screen or can you make it blank
"Have they killed that stupid left widget screen yet that they force us into? Also, I know they want to force us to buy the watch, but AOD would be nice. Plus, their standard keyboards are way slow compared to Android."
your audio alright? mic check 1 2
The desktop view will be great for YouTubers.
"Man, I really wish Android have livetext."
"#5 - So yesterday! I can do that with Telegram ""ages"" ago!
#4 - Now that's cool! Can't wait to try it.
#3 - Seriously... Most of those are so ""last century""!
#2 - Now that's cool.
#1 - Yawn!!!!"
Something about using your iPhone as your Macs camera looks soooo bad lol
Uh oh a video about apple. Time for the trash android fanboys to flood in
for me it has to be the horizontally unlocking face id feature
Editing and deleting messages should be illegal. Period.
Cool intro!
Cool intro!
"Obviously there's nothing new about the lockscreen customization if you're an Android user, but I have to say, as limited as this is, it's still impressive. Sure on Android you could have done all this and more since version 1.0, but you basically had to be a hacker to figure it all out. Most people to this day don't really bother customizing their phones anymore. Even I don't anymore with manufacturers making it harder and harder to root. So for Apple to bring this kind of flexibility and freedom to the mainstream idiot in a completely officially supported way is definitely very cool and impressive.

I remember when we used to mock Apple for making decisions for you and never giving you options. Never thought I'd see the day when Apple would give you THREE distinct options for how your notifications roll in. Still got a long way for Apple to go as a company before I ever consider using their phones, but credit where due. Surprisingly cool."
new ad for apple  ?
Can you download or share the lock screen template to another phone?
Why would you want someone to know when you unsent something
"apple: we are making some innovative customization updates
apple users: hooray that's really innovative
android users: is that so"
"Still waiting for a multiscreen/multitask function for IOS, only reason why I'm still staying with android"
"I hate to point this out, but at 8:32 Marques says home screen instead of lock screen..."
I remember when Android used to be fun üòë
That intro‚Ä¶! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè you got to give it up
Does the iphone as a webcam work by putting the iphone anywhere to get better angles (depending on the type of video one is shooting) or does it have to be mounted on top?
"why would people get so excited about changing a font on a lock screen? honestly? how about a ""phone stay unlock at home wifi"" feature like on android. Something way more useful. IOS 16 seems like a joke."
"50+% of the features already in Android for years...
Was Marques being sarcastic or is this a paid video?????"
I like the video a lot it‚Äôs about a Damn time
"Just for that intro, deserves a Like."
that intro was amazing! so impressive
Well... This is the round of iPhones that will finally get me to make the jump from Android. Crazy times!
Very Nice Intros üëç
"almost all of these features can hardly be considered new, when android has had them for years. Background delete, locksreeen customization, haptic, etc."
The intros was super litüî•
1:21 this pretty important for u guys who missed it. Gl üòÅ
Is anyone else having difficulty watching the video
That intro... ü§Ø
Welcome to 2012 IOS users
You had me at the Thanos snap*
"Dude you‚Äôre so classy. Love your videos. 
Also. What took apple so dang long to do haptic keyboard !!!!!"
Am I the only one bothered that there‚Äôs no volume bar for the music live activity?
Think my favourite intro yet - this one was bloody good
WOOOOOOAH THE INTROOOOO
WOOOOOOAH THE INTROOOOO
Picture in Picture for YouTube?
Looks like I‚Äôve changed from android to IPhone at the right time üëåüèª
"By the way, if anyone needs some help with online tasks, data entry, social media,etc. do let me know."
Only thing iOS needs is the ability to remove vertical videos.
I wonder if it‚Äôs possible to buy the Belkin webcam mount ü§î
I‚Äôve been trying to watch this for the longest know on safari and chrome but doesn‚Äôt let me smh
Can it run windows Vista...
"Neat but still no AOD

If timer widget would fade into AOD timer at exact spot after screen goes off.. eh maybe iOS 17"
When is Apple going to release iOS 16 to the masses?
That intro is apple event worthy
Android used to be the big boys with innovation... They have slowed down so much... Apple rly stepping it up.... Google needs to get their act together to make Android great again!
You guys killed that into! Good stuff!
What about FaceTime handoff? That's my number one for sure.
"I see Desk Mode being useful for a new generation of shy, poor, not camera friendly looking, old, and young content creators.  I'm sure you know the type.  They are mostly in the tech field and only show their hands and display something while explaining it.  Simple Alpaca with his phones and handheld game consoles, and Aaron from zollotech with his tech displays and reviews.  Check them out if you haven't.  I suppose I should apologize to Mr. Brownlee for mentioning others in his comment section, but I feel I needed to explain at least two people who use or would benefit more from Desk Mode."
"What they need to fix is when you send a video to a someone or a group chat in iMessage, the quality of the video is very tiny and very pixelated on their end."
"So, lock screen is not that locked anymore."
Great intro.
They better put a warning in each chat saying this person is running an older version of Imessage üëÄ
Lol at the thievery will apple think of something on their own for once or will they keep stealing old android stuff and claim its new
Can I get the tribune wallpaper ?
"Marcus, drop where we can get those fire wallpapers"
Literally starting clapping my hands after that intro. Apple quality üëåüèΩ
"EpocCam, a 3rd party Mac and Windows app, has let you use an iPhone as a webcam for years. I imagine that's the inspiration for Apple's ""brilliant"" idea."
That introoooo dammmn
Can we keep the current clock font?? I much prefer it
I am so intrigued by this new feature. Until I read the term & condition to get the upgrade : You have to have an iPhone
"A major release with the top feature being able to customize lock screen?   That's just sad.  For the record, I have iphone 12 pro so don't peg me as an Android person.   I just take a step back and look at this.   A major release number and our number one feature is just that.  Silly really."
Am I the only one having playback issues on this specific video?
Wondering what happens when you‚Äôre using the camera on a zoom call and get a phone call
"Been running Android since iPhone 6, but if Apple keeps this up (and switch to USB C) I could see myself going back in the future."
"android users:nahhh its all gimmicky things
me with android: when will it arrive on android?"
With this your phone will also slow down a lot and you will need to purchase a new one.
"Damn, that intro though"
what legendary intro was this
That intro was god tier
1 million views in 6 hrs is crzy
I didn't realize that SwiftKey has always supported haptic feedback on iOS ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Yo, that intro was dope!"
Most things are decade old stuff for android users ü•±
"Well, I was planning to finally upgrade my iPhone 7 to a 14 this year, anyway. Guess I'm committed now."
"iOS is getting more like Android, and Android is getting more like iOS. Great news for consumers no matter which side of the camp they're in."
swipe right screen edge to back is still missing
The real question is how many of these new features will be on the older but still supported iPhones and not just iPhone 13 only?
It‚Äôs funny how MKBHD has become an iOS guy.
Will editing/un-sending a message remove the original notification preview?
Watching this as the beta downloads on my phone. So happy apple decided to let everyone try this out. Makes me feel important lol
Should I install the public beta ?
Backup your stuff first.
Where did you get the minimalist sci-fi red moon wallpaper in the intro?
A lot of easter eggs in that room hmm
Editing/Unsending actually has worked for someone running iOS 15 (I‚Äôm on iOS 16).   They sent me screenshots as evidence of it working.  All my edits were present‚Ä¶.
I believe that came with iOS 16 beta 3
"when the update is fully out, can you do a ""My phone setup"" so we can see how u customized ur phone? thx"
Intro So Clean You Can Off Of It
the top down is going to be so useful for so many things even teaching like in person or not like say practical classes showing how to do a process and everyone can stay in their seats while the top down view is presented or online lessons showing something
Realme GT NEO 3!!!!
I've been using it as a main lol
Epic video production value as always!
Where can I get that Belkin iphone mount? I want!!!
Will getting the beta iOS 16 affect your phone???
IOS was lagging behind on features for decades and within 1 update steamrolled every Android device.
WOW!! This intro was crazy!!!
Shouldn‚Äôt the camera array on the phone be centered to the laptop when you‚Äôre using your phone as your webcam?
"üòØSo why you watch mkbhd videos?
üòéthe intro"
Fantastic video thank you
THAT introü§Øüòç
"ü§£ü§£""Youve been warned."" We all know someone wasn't paying attention when he said that... bad days ahead for 'em."
seems like imessage has caught up to Whatsapp
Apple always late to the party haha
Thanks!
Omgosh is bad that I'm so hyped for the lock screen? üòÜ
"wow this is amazing...sorry I can't it's not this is so funny
Seriously speaking this is good stuff and cutout thing looks like magic but the whole thing is so funny. This drip method of adding features to ios is like comedy. LOOK GUYS NOW YOU CAN CHANGE FONT OF THE CLOCK WOOOOW"
üíôüíôüíô
Another Amazing Video by you Sir. Love Your Wizardry when it comes to Apple Gear.....üòùüëªüëΩüëΩüëΩ
Is the the Ye stem player?
So many people is gonna get in trouble with that edit and delete text feature. Glad I'm with Samsung
Okaubthay image thing is pretty impressive
Dude. Your intros and transitions are üî•
Can't wait for the iOS16 on my phone!
Cannot see the video. It shows some error since afternoon
Sooo sad that iOS 16  won't  Get to iPhone 7üòû
lockscreen folders? like ball game footage on lockscreen like laptops?
I can‚Äôt get the Live Photo to work
Why do i feel like ios update is rolling out very short periods
Anyone know where I can find that Transamerica building Wallpaper???
"Thanks for telling us what‚Äôs not stable about it.üôÑ

You know tons of people are gonna put it on their daily driver. You‚Äôre not doing a good job of stopping us by just saying, it‚Äôs not stable enough. üôÑ"
This video won‚Äôt work but other videos will
That intro is Apple ad quality.
need that mousepad immediately
"To be honest  idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è why do the people talk much about this tiny ios features , most of them  all  are exist  in android  for  so many years , not probably  A decade ago Quoted [mkbhd] ,  it means android is very underrated may be coz it can be afford by anyone, unlike a iphone."
Probably still can‚Äôt clear out the 379 million gigs of ‚ÄúOTHER‚Äù hogging up your devices making it useless‚Ä¶.Way to go tim Apple.
Today I found out that it takes you 3 days to edit videos based off Number 1. Thanks for all you do
Not quite there yet but slowly but surely switching from android to ios is no longer too jarring an experience. Android still has many more quality of life features id like on iPhones like interactive widgets and swipe down on homescreen for notification shade. But ios 16 definitely has some meaningful additions
@Joe Penders that‚Äôs a deal breaker for me.
"@Nathan's Stuff he's talking about how on Android you can swipe down practically anywhere on the homescreen to bring down the notification panel, not just the very top of the screen"
I use the double tap back feature to bring down the notification instead. I do like that swiping down from the screen brings spotlight though since I search a lot for apps and google
@Nathan's Stuff on iPhone you have to swipe down from the top. You can‚Äôt pull down notifications by swiping the lower screen.
"Yeahh, im just switching from android and i still miss how much i can customize the phone. With pros and cons that is here, im still satisfied changing to this phone since im coming from a bugy ass phone ( blackshark 2 pro ) i might switch back for my next phone or i might not anyway both are ok for the job"
"Lock screen customization feels unnecessary considering the moment you look at it, it will go away."
i am so damn glad that they are finally fucking allowing everybody to change the fonts for lock screens because this shit was long overdue
"I switched from android to iOS, I miss keyboard feedback so much. Glad it‚Äôs coming our way"
Wow look at apple becoming Android üòç
Omg the intro is amazing ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
Weather update is due to the aquistion of Weatherline
Okay
Update: none iOS 16 users will see ‚Äúedited‚Äù
how long do you think i should wait before getting 16? first update normally is full of bugs...
Does the Mail app widget allow you to select which inbox is being displayed? Can you for example choose the VIP inbox and have them displayed in the Mail widget?
i just know the WidgetSmith aesthetic kids are going to lose their MINDS over the lockscreen updates
Ok that intro is üî•
The editing in this video is so coolüòé
Shame MKBHD won‚Äôt edit this video to remove the anti-24fps slander
Is there an option to have ur favorite photos switch automatically like the watch has?
Was hoping them to introduce always on screen. It amazes me how after so many years ios has introduced useful features that android had already and it sounds like a great dealüòÑ
What I appreciate about Apple is how refined their implementation is. They cater the most casual consumers and it works w/o extra headache
I think that‚Äôs the kind of thing that would be announced with new hardware in the fall (even though it‚Äôs not hardware dependent) to push people toward newer phones. Probably along with some more battery life for good measure.
"calling it now, they are gonna remove laptop cameras in the future as a brave bold decision"
"iMessage, it‚Äôs funny but where I life (the Netherlands) almost no one uses it. I think it‚Äôs the same for the whole of Europe.
But in the US, they use it a lot. Funny how it‚Äôs so region dependent."
iphone 8 still getting software updates? crazy
Your intro should be the commercial sheesh man
Face ID not working in landscape BUGGED me so much.
That intro is on another level !!! Amazing !!!
nice intro
"Open the video, watch the intro, pause, leave a like, resume the video."
"This is the first iOS update I'm excited for after so many years! Gotta compliment the intro like everyone else, it actually looks like something Apple would make."
What about editing a phone number in the phone keypad‚Ä¶.
How buggy is it currently in beta cause I‚Äôm very tempted but if it‚Äôs too buggy I won‚Äôt it is my main device
I‚Äôm guessing this was filmed a month ago
"Hey Marques, as usual pretty neat video! Question, I‚Äôve noticed you used an iPhone 13 pro for the demo; how has battery been affected by upgrading to iOS 16?  Thanks."
Apple usually won‚Äôt let a phone update if the new software would destroy the battery. That‚Äôs usually when apple calls it quits on software support so for example IOS 16 won‚Äôt work on any phone older than the iPhone 8
I've had it on my 13 Pro Max for a few weeks now. Haven't noticed any big difference in battery life
"For the first time in my life, I am looking forward to ditching android and giving iOS a go. Let's do this."
"Watching this on my iPhone PIP, finally, and man it feels good."
For IOS 17 I really hope they make it easier to move around apps and add the ability to put apps anywhere on the screen instead of automatically putting them next to the last app. I also hope they add split screen.
"You can't get the split screen while they are supporting phones with just 2GB RAM, and at least those old phones probably can't even give you the smooth performance all the time, if both app has only access for one core, because Apple still use only 2 power cores, they are require lower memory too, and also with the longer support, the changes what is impossible for old devices will comes later, when the weakest supported phones are also enough strong to run that too. If you only gives the new features (which require the newer hardware, and what not require that too) for the new users, what you can give for the old users with the updates?"
"@Carl Gunderson yeah, ‚Äúmove apps around,‚Äù you‚Äôre right"
"@byakka I'm pretty sure, the OG is talking about being able to set up the home screen to how ever you like to not switching between apps in the app task switcher."
@Carl Gunderson Swipe right on the home indicator
‚Äã@byakka tf are you talking about?
Haptic keyboard!! Yes!!!
Love the animations in iOS 16.
Which framerate is the best then? ü§î
Any updates on car play yet?
Looking forward to this greatly! üëç
5:36 this will make making videos so much easier for small channels

That intro was amazing wtf
Poor Apple people... Getting excited with the possibility of customizing the lock screen
ios is slowly becoming the new Android
The undo send cool af. Too bad im not trying to risk it all anymore.
Boy that intro was sick...
These intros are on a whole different levels from anything else out there.
Thank God @jerryrigeverything did not patent the finger snap üòÇ
This is probably by the far the sickest intro yet! üòÇüî•
More reasons to stay with IOS
the time showed too big..looks like 90s android lockscreen
"Not an iPhone owner here but the webcam and sticker features are dope af, makes me consider ..."
"My fav:  desk view;
it could have been perfect for early online lectures or any demonstration"
so much good stuff coming.

Copy image out of a pic is so cool except to bringing it anywhere is so clumsy to do. Def some other cool touches as well not mentioned.
Thats alot of computing power !! Specially that most of it is background computing. Awesome !! Must get longer lasting batteries
I just want to tell you that your video bugged my TV by making every video I choose on YouTube a still image of you while you were saying goodbye
DAMN THAT INTROOO BUOHHHH!!! <3
This is one of my favorite intros so far!!
Oh my god the intro üò©ü´†ü§ü
Will you be able to use the continuity camera on the 2021 iPad pro?
"Watching this as a person who's fed up of buggy android phones. I've always been team android, but it seems like so many of the brands don't have their software together at all. If ever there was a time I've been tempted into Apple, it's now, especially of they have USB c in the next phone."
Can‚Äôt watch this video
I am officially tired of following every step of gadget evolution. I am going to check tech news every three years from now on. Stop wasting your time!
Looks like custom home screens are a preparation for an Always On Display iPhone.
And still no option to hide the ugly Homebar :( like really why isnt this an option by now as its no longer needed to be seen as well all know how the swipe home works we dont need a visual aid.
"Can you share the wallpapers you used in this video? Either way, love the videos. Keep it up!"
my fave feature is that i MIGHT get an iPhone. lol. I've only EVER used android. maybe i'll get an older model to get use to how to use the iOS; maybe.
We need smaller keyboard like Gboard on Apple
sick intro
Stem player in the back
Nice
Please I can‚Äôt copy objects from a photo can u show the settings
Great video! Where can I get this mount?!!
Multiple lock screens multiple girlfriends never get caught
Insanely great video. The intro is amazing and you guys hit all the points perfectly. Also the webcam showing what's flat on the desk?? What kind of wizardry
Still need split screen multitasking like on Android.
iPhone 13 with IOS 16 is top notch
6:20 what‚Äôs under his Tesla card?
The production quality on this video just keeps getting better and better! Thank you for keeping us uptodate on all the new ios16 features. I appreciate it. Keep up the good work.
no its bad this time with Background Air noise
Been an Android user since the Google G1 phone but actually considering a switch to Apple now...
Can always rely on you to deliver such a high quality video. 10 minutes perfectüòò
Nice!
"Perfect timing. I wanted a refresher of iOS 16, since beta has been released."
THAT INTRO IS NEXT LEVEL!!
that intro is Apple level
That into was SICK!
"How do you improve the visuals with every. single. VIDEO! Insane stuff, love it."
i must have missed it but how exactly do you set it so that your lock screen time is behind your wallpaper? i can‚Äôt find the option
Y'all did not have to shatter minds and leave jaws on the floor so much with that intro but PHEW are we all glad you did
i actually can't wait to start messing around with the new lock screen. Gonna be lit
haven't seen your vids in while with work and stuff but that into is soo clean
AOD anyone? No? Okay
does the espn lock screen work in the beta ?
No new icons :((
"And, still, AOD is a dream ü•≤"
coolest intro ever.
How do I turn off the huge music cover art on my Lock Screen when playing music? It‚Äôs kind of obtrusive and replaces my custom wallpaper.
Wow that intro!!
Not using Android 13 beta anywhere to give us a video for that?
The old running joke -- 'Andriod had this for years' still holds true.
"I think a pretty underrated feature is the new Medicines section in the Health app. A significant proportion of adults worldwide (myself included) take prescription medications daily, and this new section of the Health app just makes it easier to keep track of these. And with the Elsevier integration that should be coming in September when the final RC/stable release for iOS 16 drops, you‚Äôll be able to see things like drug-drug interactions, so how your prescription medication might interact with booze, caffeine, cannabis, hell, even melatonin. Continuity Camera is also a great feature to have, though I do not currently own a macOS device to test it out."
"Thank you so much for mentioning this. My boyfriend takes different medications nightly and every morning, so this is a godsend feature to know about"
"Yes, I totally agree with this!"
@Zaydan Naufal yes
"I'm glad iOS is adding this as a built-in thing, but previously there have been plenty of third-party apps like Medisafe which did this already. But iOS 15's notification changes made Medisafe kind of useless, too."
Underrated
When you going to fix that crooked pinky???
They are making it look like android. Nooooo!!!!!!
haptic keyboard!!! goodbye gboard :)
press X for respect for that sick intro
"I love how iOS is getting more customizations, like android has had forever"
"You know what‚Äôs funny? I get more info from Marques on iOS 16 than any other iOS 16 video I‚Äôve seen and there are a bunch on YouTube.  No one mentioned the timer displaying on the Lock Screen.. My favorite feature of iOS 16 is the new Lock Screen, I can‚Äôt wait. Coming from android, I miss having useful information when I need it. The pixel is very informative in this regard with at a glance."
Fire intro!!
Anyone know where to find the wallpaper at 8:47 he didn‚Äôt link it in the description. Thanks
when in the world is apple going to allow to minimize videos while still using other apps .
Shoutout whoever came up with the jailbreak tweak ‚ÄúComplications‚Äù literally 1:1 with new LS widgets
those dude's intro beat apple's transitions in their events
"i honestly don‚Äôt like the little search. i‚Äôd rather just drag down, the way spotlight already works tbh"
This intro is the best I've seen from you guys in a long time. I'd be interested to know if you guys have done any work for projects outside of MKBHD and The Studio
What an intro holyyyy
I love all android updates Marques!!!üß°
Whhhhy can‚Äôt I turn off location tracking in control center yet!?!?!?! ffs Apple!
"Great highlight, thank you! I really hope iOS 16 will return background app state save functionality! I remember it was mentioned. No more ‚Äúkilling‚Äù an article I read or a timeline I switch back to ü•∞"
"Here is a sign you should work on your finances.

They could have added a clear all for open apps hate swiping up on every single app
What I really want is a countdown timer that goes across all devices. This is useful for cooking for example.
the intro's always go up they are amazing
"Holy shoot that intro!!! Awesome editing, truly amazing!"
I don‚Äôt usually leave comments but that intro was freaking amazing!!!!! loved it
best review of iOS 16 so far.
"Is this presentation actually done directly on IPhone 14 Pro Max or smth, i mean just look to the notch size. ü§î"
You talk to much bro just get to the point
"That lockscreen feature for the clock is SICK!!!!! I thought ‚Äúmeh I want iphone because I can‚Äôt customize it like Android since im weird like that I can‚Äôt choose a final design‚Äù but yeah, just remove the widgets and boom! Can‚Äôt waitttt"
Wew.. does the desktop phone camera feature can be use to other laptop brand like acer? I wish it wouldü•≤

"A little hack that I use sometimes for WhatsApp and discord (where you can already edit/delete messages), when you want to see the original message someone sent I just go to the notification log on my phone and I can see the original message sent, because the notification dosent change. Maybe with the live notification stuff coming apple can fix that"
Sick intro.
Dope intro
Time stamps???
Nice Hapticfeedback but there are still no numbers on top like on the ipad keyboard?
This is the first time ever that I wish android had a feature iOS does. That lockscreen customization is actually incredibly amazing. Almost a big enough deal to me to get me to switch to iPhone. Almost.....
"@Mr. Everything everyone makes their choice, there isn't such a thing as basic customization, basic for who, me? you? IPhone isn't even basic to me with its customization today, my grandma might find the customization to be over the top as the wallpaper changing is all she needs. 

On Apple product basic is what Apple decides, yesterday changing your lockscreen like this wasn't considered basic, today it is.

That's the magic of the flexibility of Android, you make your choices of what you want, as far as baked in is considered, this argument doesn't even apply to android, the lockscreen isn't a inseparable entity to the OS it is an app, lockscreens are a launcher's part and launchers are all in it of themselves apps, you can even delete the baked in like you do with any other app if you so wish by rooting your phone and you dd still have a functioning android phone with a different launcher. I installed a different OS than what was pre installed and that came in with a better baked in launcher (which I still ended up changing to my preferred one), that is still an android experience, it may not be your Android experience but it is indeed an Android experience (my experience) because it is directly related to core differences of Android and IOS which doesn't support such things.

edit: and if you so get triggered by mentioning rooting, that I mention only as a means to explain to you that the launcher you use isn't part of Android, Android provides the tools for launchers to function and you choose the one you like, one comes baked in but that is not Android that is your manufacturers preferred *app.* (and by rooting you could wipe it from your phone entirely with no issue)."
"@Different again you and everyone else are completely missing my entire point this whole time. Please actually read my comments thoroughly before wasting my time in the future. My entire point was that we shouldn't have to use an app for basic customization features. Other specific use case stuff sure, there's an app for that. Like the phone as a Webcam thing. I've obviously known android could do that for forever now. Thus the reason I didn't bring that up. But basic customization of my device should be something that is just baked into the OS. Google is on the right track with the material you thing. I wouldn't be surprised if the lockscreen thing makes it to Android 13 before the full release later this year. I was purely stating the problem with how companies are treating their customers like animal's by dragging their feet on basic shit."
"switch to the ecosystem bro, trust me bro"
I'll be switching once the iPhone goes to Usb-c
this intro game went haaardd üî•üî•üî•üî•
iMessages are irrelevant outside of the US.
Amazing intro
"4:48 Continuity webcam - I used Iriun webcam that does the same thing with Android for some time now.
6:27 Lock screen customization is so 2018, now android phones practically don't have a Lockscreen biometrics are literally on the power button now (AOD for simple info, Biometric unlock for the rest).
9:45 so live activities are basically like persistent notifications of android?
Number 5 - about time, Telegram had it for ages.
Number 4 is just cool! It's like google lens but easier to use.
Number 3 - more haptics are always welcome!

All in all iOS is getting to the point where it has near feature parity with android! Just add real file management, third party apps and a working gallery app (that doesn't put EVERYTHING in recent photos) and I'll gladly jump ship to the more polished version of android."
I'm still longing for the day apple comes with an OS as awesome as iOS7 when it first came out.
üî•üî•
I love the last feature you talked about! I have been waiting for this moment to be able to see my battery percentage and my timer at the same time instead of seeing the battery percentage than having to wait a long time to see the timer. Very annoying.
That intro üòçüòçüòÅ
when is the m2 macbook air review droping??
I haven‚Äôt had any luck with the order tracking feature. The haptic keyboard feels way better than most android phones I‚Äôve had my hands on.
Can you change app icons or do you still need shortcuts for that?
Wish they would add FaceTime and the iPhone camera on Apple TV
Dang that intro tho üî•üî•üî•
These updates should be app updates not system updates
"Didn't find the leave wall wallpaper
Share please"
Wish apple had split screen
"I just think it‚Äôs funny how Apple is so unoriginal. They take everyone‚Äôs ideas, simplify them, and act like they created it from the jump. It‚Äôs really annoying. I can‚Äôt think of many things apple has done first or jumped on to when it started and not waited 2+ years after it‚Äôs popular. I hope apple finds some originality and innovation that isn‚Äôt being coat tailed off of someone other BIG companies work."
Wow... These things might finally tempt me to turn to the dark side ü¶π
That intro was sick! Absolutely love it!
"Great Intro but please be more critical of iOS, 1300 smartphone that can't multitask and multi window like 250 euro Android in 2022 is ridiculous."
This intro is straight üî•üî•üî•
That intro was absolute fireüî•
"will i finally be able to know who called me searching the recent call list, to cancel today's alarm only without cancelling the whole weekly program, and to automate a decent silence mode, or  should i get all frisky because fo the cool font of the clock?"
The desk view feature gives less incentive to someone intending to upgrade from an M1 MBA (due to the webcam) to an M2 MBA. Great addition!
"Just what I was thinking. The M1 MBA, now available with the best evah webcam."
Hands down the lock screen is my favourite
Y'all noticed the weather icon lil pillow ?
Lockdown Mode!
Still no pause in video recording? Still no always on display..?
"5. Barely anyone uses iMessage anyway outside of the states. Don‚Äôt care. 

4.  ‚ÄúLive Objects‚Äù everyday people don‚Äôt give a shxt. Very gimmicky but cool. 

3. Clearly starved. It‚Äôs nice little changes, nothing special. 

2. Very cool. How many people will actually use their phone as a webcam? 

1.  STARVED. A fricking Lock Screen being customisable. 

Underwhelming but this bubble will tell you it‚Äôs amazing. Crazy times."
Gotta love the weather Easter egg on the backüòÇ
Something they could add is an option to move the clock or widgets on the Lock Screen to fit the Lock Screen image better
"webcam feature is a game changer for content creators. buy an iphone and do everything from record, edit and upload with the tap of a button. insane."
Send me an iPhone..
What's that clip you use on back of your phone?
Now if only they would let Android to iPhone or iPhone to Android send videos to eachother without destroying the video.
That photo option thing is dope!
Live timer notification is great but I‚Äôd never know because ever since I started doing beta programs I‚Äôve never once been notified when my timer is up. And guess what? IOS 16 beta is no different
Best intro ever ‚úåÔ∏èüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
I immediately clicked like just for the intro
"love the cute display of colours in your room with random things. For example MKBHD on pillow, cute rings, tshirt, the cube. Great video as well!"
Lovely intro
"The iPhone becoming a webcam was pretty sweet but I like the top-down feature.
That was off the chain.
Thanks for sharing!"
"Cant believe im saying this but Google, keep up."
Well lets not forget that so sick intro. it is üî•üî•
Really boring update.
5:47 desk view sounds great for drawing art on camera without craning your neck
"Being able to use the iPhone as a webcam natively is more useful in clamshell mode. I see this being awesome for conference/meeting rooms that aren't equiped with web cameras. The Ultrawide angle being unlocked will be great for this, pair that with an external mic and you have a pretty great WFH or office set-up."
Intro üé• üî•
bro it's already great but you made it better idk how !
unbelievable intro!
"I‚Äôve just got the beta version , the first thing I‚Äôve noticed is how much more smooth Face ID is now"
I don't know why I'm so bothered with the health of people using Stack View for notifications. That looks really odd.
@8:41 ayyyyyy! Shout out to Oakland!! (The Oakland Tribune pic)
One word... Boring üòÇü§£
I think apple should also add a radar to their weather app. That would be nice
"This all so good, and the video is very friendly"
It took apple how long for all this? ü§£
"After Oneplus 8 pro went from meh to fkno, Iphones are looking good."
U gotta wonder how many of these will the iPhone 8 will get
Marquez is such a hottie ü•µ
When are they going to add notification channels like android.
So still no full Music wall on the Lock Screen when playing music huh? Would‚Äôve been great time for that feature on iPhones finally
24fs is the best üò≠üòÇ
Still no AOD
"With that intro, you'll have Apple inviting your team to their next event to work on b-roll shots in their presentations. 

Well done sir."
"You know what iOS needs? When you play a song on insta or YouTube what ever, Shazam can pick up and tell what song you are play from your phone, no more need to have something else play the sound for it to be recognized"
You should do a short video on how well ios 16 performs on an iphone 8. Im curious to see if the features are the same and how well it handles them
i weirdly really disliked the haptic keyboard. but probabky bc i tried it day one and it felt really laggy. maybe i should give it another try.
The webcam replacement seems gimmicky. They literally added a notch to a MacBook to improve the webcam and then they offer a way of mounting your iPhone to the screen lol.
Do you use Discord bc Slack is expensive?
Is it stable enough to be daily driven yet?
I really missed the haptic feedback while typing.
So happy Apple will finally be able to do what google has done for years. Now that‚Äôs innovation(rolls eyes)
We want always on display
"lol, your videos are only 30fps! those are rookie numbers, gotta pump those numbers up in the fps racket!"
"Wow, the fact that it was able to crop your headphones without cropping some of the white background, that's just... wow. Good job Apple on that one."
Didn't know ios 16 had keyboard haptics until today. My day has been made.
"nah the editing thing is a lot more fun. i used iOS 16 as my daily os since the beta launched so i also used imessage and ofc tried the new features. found out, not only will ios 15 users see your old message but also get a text below saying edited into: ""...[edited text]...""."
How can we subscribe to the beta?
Aren‚Äôt those widgets really just short cuts. You can‚Äôt do anything with them on the home screen all they do is open the app.
"Back at it with the intro game!
I think Apple did a very good job with the iOS 16 lock screen. I'm a customization freak and that's obviously the best change for me. Ever. I like how the new and different ideas they brought to lock screen customization like separating the background and the object, having multiple lock screens (it makes so much sense and is like smartwatches) and associating them with focus modes. So cool! Can't wait to get my hands on it."
That top down camera thingy is so cool
"For once, Android should emulate iPhone with these lock screen changes and multiple 'watchfaces'"
bro the intros on these videos are nuts
OMG JIDION??
Kinda want my iphone back...
Bruh what‚Äôs up with the room noise. Can we get a high pass filter please?!!!
Haptic feedback is just  a battery drainer don't need it never gonna use it.
"iPhone 8 or later? Lts be honest, iOS 16 starts with iPhone XS or later. The cool stuff is exclusiv to the iPhone XS and newer. The Beta also was pretty bad on 8, much worse then XS and ofc 13. At least in my experience. but im really happy with beta 3, it helped a lot fixing a lot of major bugs."
"Easter egg, book with XVI = 16, calendar and weather picture in the background. Love the thoughtfulness. You're the master! üî•"
Nice way of making money üòÇ
I actually spend much more time on home screen than on lock screen.
I don't even care about video editing but WTF was that intro üî•üíØüî•üíØüî•
"I'm surprised that the Continuity Camera didn't include all the features of Clips to turn yourself in to a Memoji in conference calls! Or any kind of settings capability... it would make so many scenarios better and not rely on Teams, Zoom, etc. to do good camera settings."
"Ahh, feels like a jailbroken iDevice from 5+ years ago! Bout time Apple!"
Apple invented Android
"Still can‚Äôt position app icons on Home Screen, or swipe back from right or left. The only thing keeping me on Android"
Anyone facing display issue on iphone 13 pro max?
Uh oh. An Apple titled video. View about to go üìà
"#1 thing, the lock screen customization..... ü§¶. Android for life!"
"Very nice features. I have an Android phone where some things are ""better"" and some are ""worse"". In either 'universe', people are way, way too involved with their phones. People need less screen time and more life time."
"My first and only iphone I bought in 2016 is the original SE. Even without the customization that I'm used to with android, I didn't really care, I actually love that I don't have the choice to do it. It saves me time doing unnecessary changes that I will be reverting anyway."
That intro was sweet
"Finally locks screen. Still iOS is trying to catch up to Android in 2022. I bought my first iPhone 2 months ago and also purchased another iPhone for my wife in the same month. So technically purchased 2 iPhones!

I moved to ios after 10 years of Android usage and wanted to give it a try. Everybody in my family & surrounding keeps on bragging about iPhone.

To  be honest I am disappointed, i mean there are some really sweet features, which I wish they were in Android! But Android treats me like an Admin and iOS treats me like a User!

Plenty of Basic features are missing in iOS! Such as I cannot permanently block SMS from unknown senders without numbers. Such sms coming from marketing poop tards, banks, etc. The filter option is  just pathetic and useless.

For some simple & automatic task like adding pictures, etc. I have to do long procedures.

Call recording feature is not at all present!"
"Hello, can anyone link the thumbnail wallpaper?"
"The biggest thing I want for the lock screen is Always On Display come on apple your OLED panels and batteries can cope with this in 2022. As someone who has always carried  a Samsung phone too over the years would love to see this, really hoped it was going to be on IOS 16"
"I've been using Gboard on my iPhone for hepatic feedback but idk if it has a Bug or whatever, but the cursor suddenly Moves to the beginning of the Text which annoys me, if you got a solution please helpüò¢"
"Apple making sure that iMessages remains the king of the hill for Messing apps. The ability to instantly crop images from photos and videos is going to be a game changer for people who message a lot.  

I recently was assisting my mom with issues with messaging on her new Samsun Galaxy S22+ and as an iPhone user it was a pain. It was so many setting and things to configure. I had to disable the default Samsung Messaging App in favor of the Android Message app as the UI was more familiar to her old phone. I turned of WiFi calling to get most of the images from her friends texts to download, and still there are still some messages she claims she is missing. I was spending hours on Google searching and getting mostly unhelpful results.  

After monkeying around Settings on that Samsung for a while, she finally just gave up on receiving those texts. So far all the newer texts and images are coming through since disabling WiFi calling.  

The monkeying around that Samsung Galaxy Settings makes me really glad I got an iPhone."
that's intro bro
i'm waiting for them to allow us to change the imessage bubble colors for whoever we're texting!
bro that into into ios 16 was sick 10/10
Intro was dope ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
There's no reason Apple cannot come out with a AOD for the iPhone 13 models. If Android can do it there's no reason Apple can come out with it for the Iphone 13 models
Swiftkeybord got haptic feedback on iphone since a while and it is great
Happy for the new changes coming in September. Just wish we had always on display üòû.
Dope intro as always!
Haptic keyboard hallelujah!
The XVI for iOS 16 in the background is no coincidence I guess
Thanks!
At this point Apple should stop making cringy ads and use these youtubers expertise instead
"Guh DAMN your intros are always the best, nice"
These intros are just amazing!
this isnt convincing me not to switch back to andriod
Wait what? Face ID works on landscape? For me that‚Äôs not the case
That intro üî•
"Looking at your phone 100 times a day, let alone unlocking it around the same number, sounds like you may have some OCD or an addition problem. The new update is good. I wish there was more you could customize on the lock screen, and then grabbing a subject from a photo works really well. I also wish you could do it from any app, looking at you GOOGLE PHOTOS."
"I actually never look at the lock screen, ever since I started using the fingerprint as the unlock method"
How difficult it is for apple to implement battery % instead of icon
"Seems iOS is becoming more android,  as Android becomes more iOS.  With Apple adding more customisation with every new iteration the difference is nowhere near as pronounced as it used to be"
THAT INTRO!!!üòÆ
Anyone else having trouble playing this video? No issues with any other video on YouTube but this one
"MKB is the man. I love that you warned the beta testers that message undo and edit is unavailable to iOS 15 users. It‚Äôs things like that which make you just the best reviewer. You connect with your techy, geeky audience (I can say that, I‚Äôm one of them). üëçüèºüí™üèº"
It's actually pretty obvious that's how it would work if you're somewhat tech savvy.
"It‚Äôs worth mentioning that, when an edit is made, the person with an iPhone running an older version will receive a new text message with the alterations."
The video editing in these videos are just eyecandy. Props to the team!
Ngl stuff like this wants me to switch.. I have a OnePlus and their updates and software is trash rn.. but I just deal with it.
Please don't judge me I watched the intro up to ten times
Until they let me install 3rd party apps im never switching from android
"On the new Lock Screen, can you customize and remove light button? ü§£ü§£ every time I put my iPhone into my pocket I accidentally turn on the light. it‚Äôs so annoying  ü§£ü§£"
How about being able to change the clock position! The amount of great wallpapers I‚Äôve ditched because they just can‚Äôt work with the clock position üòï
"Since they're pulling so much from the WatchOS UI for the new Home Screen, I'd love to see them go further and implement different layouts."
Your vids are amazing so talented
"All of these features are nice to have I guess, but it‚Äôs not a game changer for ‚Äúme‚Äù"
"Face ID landscape only works on iPhone, 13 and onwards"
Amazing intro ‚ô•Ô∏è
"How many times have you watched this intro?
Me: Yes"
them intros are something else ‚ù§‚Äçüî•
üî• changes! ‚Ä¶.finally some good day to day additions
my favorite feature is when they switch to USB C so I can ditch my oneplus 8 pro and try out an iPhone for once in my life
"My jaw literally dropped at the intro‚ù§Ô∏è
Y‚Äôall have amazing talent. I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine how that‚Äôs all edited together"
"Cool! Hey Marquez, would you get a message to Apple? It would be most graciously appreciated. I‚Äôd love to have apple add a pause button in their camera app. üôè  P.S. I love your work!"
"Excited about notification stacking üéâ Also, great intro!"
Man add time stamps
MKBHD the Apple sheep.
Peter McKinnon love 24fps! 1:09
Doesn't the lock screen disappear as soon as you look at it with face unlock?
Although I know it would never happen.  I really would like the iPhone as webcam with the top down mode to work on windows laptops.
Still cant pause video recording
This dude‚Äôs team made a better Apple ad than Apple
"4:19 Germans: Excuse me, Sir?!"
Why that?
love the stocks shirt!!
"During recent years, Apples openness towards customisation and great software development has really got me questioning why I stick with Android! I really do hope this drives up competition!"
@Elvan Gulley ios is a privacy focused software with great security but now it also has many good features that android has but android doesnt have any of big privacy features ios has like denying app tracking . Many Android apps cant run without those permissions . And the whole ifail is worse than pixel and samsung is just ur opinion i respect it but u have no facts there
@Abdul Azeez and here is the what I'm talking about you say those features aren't a big deal and only tech heads like them but 10 years from now you will be talking about how great they are when Apple steals them you people are a joke and no ifail has ever been better than s galaxy hell you can't even beat pixel
Live notifications have been in Android for a while eh? Or are these somehow different?
Ios 16 makes me want to switch to Samsung galaxy
intro.
Swiftkey on iOS has had haptic for a while now
"Your entros, and music choice is just amazing!!!"
But can I change the shortcuts on the bottom of the Lock Screen? I don‚Äôt need to ways to access the camera.
I love the iOS 16 lockscreen customisation. But sadly I‚Äôll have to wait to install it in September on my iPhone 13 as I think the public beta is a bit risky
@Car Lover Photography iPhone 12
@sasuke it was a joke.
@International trailers iOS 17 will be out by then or nearly out
@International trailers really? üòÇüòÇ that‚Äôs a bit crazy they‚Äôll at least have it stable in mid-October 2022 or even when November begins
If i were you i would wait until 2023 august where it will be quite stable.
"In other words, the cool club ""iMessage"" is becoming more like the loser club ""social media"". Maybe they never were the cool club."
That intro is sick. Great job!!!
I use an iPhone 7 so sad I‚Äôm not getting iOS 16
Dope Intro üî•
Bro the quality of these videos compared to 2 years ago is a huge upgrade
Apple might kill the Macbook cameras going forward and concretize the ecosystem by forcing consumers to buy the iPhone for continuity üò¨
That intro was sick
"Marques do you need help?
is everything ok?"
I use an S22 Ultra but there's some NICE new stuff there! üòç
"Unrelated to the video, but thank you for not uploading videos at 60fps. Seems like everyone is uploading at that frame rate and I hate it lol"
Wow that intro was amazing!
"I hate so badly the iPhone photos library. I would definitely like to see something similar to what Android OS has. For example, whenever you create an album and ‚ÄúMove selected pictures‚Äù to it, those photos will be there without duplicates being all over the place. But sadly with Apple, If I delete a picture from the library it automatically deletes all else moved photos from your created albums, that is pointless.

A cool wishful thinking‚Ä¶. It helps a lot to see when you open your contacts we see a name, but sometimes I personally don‚Äôt remember who that is, but if apple could allow to place the face or something right there on the contact‚Äôs list the face of a person next to name and number‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

It is not the same like assigning a picture to someone that appears only when you call or when you click info about that number. 

It should appear clearly when you open contact information list. Lastly I don‚Äôt know if iPhone contacts allows to create groups for contacts; like a family group, work group, social or friends groups, business groups‚Ä¶. Etc to keep everything in order and easy to find instead of scrolling and scrolling guessing where that name is cause I can remember it well. 

But back to adding a face picture next to that phone number ON THE CONTACT‚Äôs List will help a lot. Just my opinion. If the old format works for you, well good for you."
when will they finally fix the sound problem? if i am on a call with someone and looking at a youtube video why can‚Äòt i then adjust the volume of the call or the video seperately?
I can't wait to switch to iOS in September ‚ù§Ô∏è
That intro!!!
"Mine is moving the camera and flashlight buttons on the lock screen... oh, wait."
Apple contributes nothing to society which is deeply sad
That live objects for videos is going to be a real gamechanger for YouTubers! The thumbnail game is going to be great. Can't wait to try it out.
Telegram has been letting you edit your messages and delete them for everybody for years.
"i feel like by the time phones peak, IOS will be much better than android just because of software. Although that will take awhile lmfao"
thank god i upgraded to iphone 13 pro max from iphone 7 üò≠üò≠üò≠
HOLY WHAT AN INTRO. Absolutely brilliant. üî•
"This is all good stuff, but still, in 2022, you can't place icons on the home screen where you want them. Apple knows people want that flexibility, but they refuse to provide it. At this point it's sheer malice, and they quite obviously have no intention of doing it--ever."
Wait! That intro is the best thing I have ever seen!
So great features!
Waiting for your Nothing review
where can I find that green black and red wallpaper at 5:24 ü•µ
"@Simon P yeah realised its called Unity, cheers anyway"
it comes with iOS 16
Still no split screen‚Ä¶ ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòí
drop those wallpapers please üòÖ
At this point iOS is getting more accessible customization options out of the box than android.
"With this intro, we need a BTS on The Studio channel!"
I just want the phone to work.
When the hell are we finally gonna get icon changes or themes üôÑ
live objects and desk view are both nutty.
Dope intro!
Android better
So basically they stole everything that jailbreak has had for years... Finally I guess.
"Why don't you review Android 13 BETA.
I feel lost."
"Loving the backgrounds to all the top down, so detailed, especially the Lego DJI drone at 8:37"
Honestly I like the intro so much that I watched it like 5 times. üëå
That intro is top notch. ü§òü§ò
Wow I just turned on the haptic keyboard and this is kinda dope ü´° I just feel like typing now for now specific reason. Great video bakdoeoandiforksbjcifkdndj
Finally haptic keyboard!!!
been having ios 16 for weeks and i didn‚Äôt know the keyboard had haptic. life is better now.
Wow what an amazing intro to iOS16 awesome video.
Nothing great pls
i'm very impressed o;
finally people can make ugly lockscreens as they would do in android
How tf does apple develop that picture image feature while also BARELY releasing the temperature feature.
i can no more be a fan for someone who support rainbow  people sorry.
WHAT AN INTRO
24 fps is THE BEST frame rate...
that intro tho üî•
I like the Lock Screen customisation (and upcoming Always On Display) for iPhone 14 but the rest of the update was ‚Äòmeh.‚Äô
I got iOS 16 and I can‚Äôt stop typing the haptic keyboard is amazing
Oh wow! Can't believe that The MKBHD is using my wallpaper of palm tree leaves. You guys can see it at 7:53 :) can I attach my unsplash link here?
I feel like haptic keyboards are gimmicky
"That intro was so great!  Love the video, really looking forward to iOS 16."
Jesus Marques... These intros are amazing!
intro = üî•
No wow factor as always
"I'm an Android user rather than an iPhone user, and I find the updates amazing! :o üî•"
And still no split screen.......
damn that intro
Still no keyboard improvements? I truly hate the stock keyboard with a passion... Gboard FTW
The video won't play. Bummer. Love seeing new stuff from this Channel.
"This video showed up forth in ""asmr"" search results"
where can i buy the skins for the phones you displayed at 6:09?
"Every year Im getting closer and closer to buying an iphone, pretty sweet features ...but at this time IOS is still not for me."
Best Intro I really want see how you and your team came up with this
INTRO BRO INTRO ü•µ
Well its like watching 5 years old android release
"Customizing my Lock Screen
‚Ä¶ can I finally get a good damm analog clock?"
"Is this what passes as big change for apple these days? A bunch of bells and whistles, almost all of which have existed on android for years. Truly the tech has plateaued. Oh the days of windows 95 to 98 or iPhone 3 to 4"
those animation was lit...
"My #1 is #2!
Live-Streaming Game Changer. 
Serves those expensive (use your iPhone camera) app companies right! 
Greed. Your app's about to be obliterated.
And this Apple implementation just works..."
My fav intro to date.
"Should be able to use whatsapp on my home screen, can‚Äôt even use safari without having my video paused !!!"
GOD BLESS STEVE JOBS for the iPhone‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
seriously loving the beta version so far. one of my favorite ios updates yet!
8:20 best topdowns ever
"Unfortunately the newest feature, music player full screen on the lock screen, wasn‚Äôt out when this video was made"
You got a link for those wallpapers? They look dope!
iOS 16 is apple flexing for how capable its hardware is.
"Lol I have haptic keyboard (and more) on my jailbroken iphone since at least 2016. Apple just takes all its ""innovation"" straight from developers in cydia and gives them no credit or money for their idea that apple stole. This is seriously wrong, illegal and unethical"
Weather app is finally going to be the only one I‚Äôll need üëåüèª
So the iOs is mostly android ish now after being a decade late and that is what impresses MKBHD? When will this dick riding ever stop
Need that green wallpaper üò≠
That intro sha
IOS 16 public beta is finally live!!
That outro will not be appreciated in England.
Cool but I still want an iPhone 6S on iOS 12
Still waiting for MKBHD going Pro Max
When‚Äôs the mac air review? I‚Äôm passionately waiting.
totally love the intro
Very cool updates üëç
"I tested the iOS 16 Dev beta 1 on my iPhone X and the phone was a mess, who has tried the beta 2&3?"
finally
"So how much work do we put in the intro?
Yes"
The intro is amazing omg
"EpocCam, is an app that let you use your iPhone as your webcam... even in windows. I don't think apple ""had"" this fantastic idea... again."
I don't think marques know about samsung good lock? Lol
"loool at 3:33 i legit blurted out finally, then thank you in legit in sync with you, Marques ahahaha I know it sounds dumb but it just felt weird and funny loool keep up the great work as always"
my photoshop-figma flow just got ousted by iphoto lol
Leave it to apple to have you buy an attachment to use your phone as a better webcam instead of putting a better one in....
Lol..
When can we get an automatic cellular data statistics reset per billing cycle like android's been doing forever...
Dope intro
But does it remove/edit the notification that the receiver gets on their lock screen?
"So basically iOS 16 brings you a bunch of cheap gimmicky stuff. Weak tea. I'll stick with my S22 which, btw, I only switch over to from my iPhone 6S because when I went to upgrade to the 13 Pro I discovered iTunes and iCloud are designed so that they WON'T move over music that I manually added to the phone. They'll happily move over the music I purchased through iTunes but the music I manually added? Oh, I have to manually add it again OR buy an iTunes Match or Apple Music Subscription....Really, Apple? Really? You're not going to let me move my data from my old phone to the new one? That was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I was already fed up with iOS because they designed that hot garbage software iTunes to be not user friendly at all so that I literally can't interface my phone with my Windows 10 PC. Android is far superior. I can multi task like crazy, it will interface with my PC seamlessly (heck, even Windows 11 can run Android apps natively). Fuck Apple."
Great video keep it up!
Damn! Nice intro transitions üî•
mkbhd>>>apple keynotes
That was by far the coolest intro I've ever seen. Huge props to everyone who worked on that
"Man, does every intro ever stop to impress me"
Cool intro
I hate that this update is so interesting because I have an iPhone seven!
Peace
I bought my mom a iPhone 8 and she is very happy with it. I still have my Xs max 64gb and it‚Äôs been holding up great.
YouTube can‚Äôt even keep up with the 100K a minute watchers on mobile
Face ID doesn‚Äôt work for me sideways
"From what I heard and saw, one of my favorite features would be the Live captions. It helps me a lot, since I'm deaf and even though it's not 100% perfect, but it appears to have more accuracy and I'm way curious to have this feature on my hands"
"I wish I could switch over to iPhone all over again. I find that all this new stuff coming in the newer iOS builds is awesome - but I‚Äôve had my phone setup the same way since forever, and it makes it really hard to adopt new features. 

I‚Äôm still just now trying to integrate widgets into my Home Screen after over a decade without it."
How do I uninstall the beta
That Intro was üëåüèø
I also love that you can now see a wifi password
The new lockscreen is literally HTC's themes idea but applied to a lockscreen.  Once again time is proving that HTC were right all along
"Cool widget, if it can let you switch on/off wifi settings or data"
"Heads up iMessage partially works when editing it just sends the revised text to the user running iOS 15 and earlier

Example

He

Name revised text
Hey"
that lego dji phantom is cool
"The Lock Screen customization is what I'm most excited for, and I already know people are going to go crazy with it"
Why? It‚Äôs literally the thing you use least when actually *using* your phone
Face ID doesn‚Äôt work for me sideways.
Hidden folder needs a lock üîí
This video is a bit late.
"‚ÄúiOS still feels like iOS‚Äù 
Yeah bro, I still can‚Äôt delete multiple contacts at once."
Not overly excited about the object lift feature UNLESS they also use that as a way to introduce a Photoshop like option like Google has for their magic eraser thing. I could see that being something they show off for the iPhone 14. But I'm almost certainly wrong. iPhone won't have that until 2030.
"Excellent video!! Always super thorough! 

Not hating, but my Note 9 has had most if not all of these ""new"" features üò¨ 
Also, MUCH cheaper & comes with an S pen. The pen, microSD, & storage flexibility is what I need in a phone for work. It's basically like a mini laptop."
"For those in the ecosystem I'm sure this is an much needed update, but for someone like me to switch over they still have to make some pretty major additions."
The iMessage unsend thing: I‚Äôm curious to know how it‚Äôs set. Will you still be able to edit/unsend if you rewound your phone clock from the settings?
Those are some good updates I‚Äôm looking forward to installing iOS 16 soon!
The Boss Tech Marques Brownlee.
This is wild! Intel just sweating right now with these results lol
"When I finally get the Official update, I will be spending the whole day customizing my lockscreen Lmao"
Use as a webcam- Why..?!? üòÇüòÇüòÇ It makes me chuckle when everyone harps on about how great this is- I reckon 50% of people may use <5 times and 0.Something of iPhone users will actually carry on using üßêüòÇüòÇ What a lot of tosh üòÇüòÇüòÇ
How do you download the beta?
that intro was incredible
That new word dope sounds so wrong. So American. It contradicts with this guy's eloquence and a lovely manner of speaking.
That intro!!!! üî• How do you guys do that?
"Hopefully iOS 17 brings the ability to place the app icons anywhere on the homescreens. That is a must, now the lockscreen is customizable."
"Fuck that editing text bullshit. If you want, just send another text with the edits you meant to say. This is like being able to edit an email. That sounds terrible."
What's the apple weather app booklet on the lefthand side rack?
"This looks great.  I always get excited for firmware updates, but Apple seems to have really put in the work with iOS 16.  I can‚Äôt wait for its retail release."
"Dude your video so many views which was enough for you to make money 
Why still ads tho"
"As a graphic designer, my favourite feature has to be Live object. That object separation is so fast!üöÄüöÄ"
"The lock screen customisation is so cool though, best lock screen customisation I've ever seen."
Really creative intro!
So finally they added the Apple watch screen and complications to the iPhone lock screen!
Yo! That intro though üî•
Who do I need to sleep with to get the option of removing the flashlight button from the Home Screen?  I constantly activate it by accident. It doesn‚Äôt make sense without force/3D touch.
"Apple is being more aggressive with unsupporting phones than they used to because if their upcoming subscription plans for devices. When a phone stops receiving OS updates, eventually apps won't be compatible. Meaning it is a death sentence for that phone. The last update any phone should receive is to unlock the bootloader. Allowing new software to be used on unsupported phones. Whether it be IOS, android, or Linux. It's like having a car that can no longer be driven on the highway because of the software."
I LOVED THAT INTRO!! :00000
"Most of these are gimmicks more than something I'd consider genuinely useful. I'm not excited about the new stuff in any degree. That being said, I use the timer when baking bread, so I guess the increased visibility of the time left on the lock screen is something I'll at least notice. I'm still waiting for swipe typing in Polish. Come on Apple, stop treating me like a third class user and give me what Android has given me for a decade!"
"Also, setting multiple timers would be nice. Again, something that's been available in Android for ages."
Live object is awesome
"It would be really nice if we were able to lock the screen. What I mean is that when you're playing a game, the bar is there and it's easy to swipe out vertical or horizontal (I've done it many times). It would be nice to lock the screen for a game mode so when you swipe it asks you if you really want to swipe out. My Galaxy Tab S6 Lite had that feature and it was amazing and saved me from losing game progress."
This intro is just toooooo good üòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Give your team a RAISE for that intro!
is the new music live activity changeable? because i liked the bigger size very much ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I wish they would change the video player UI when playing your videos from the camera roll.  I forget when the current one was introduced (ios 13?). But Ive always hated it so so much.
The lock screen stuff are pretty cool but who ever sees them when you have a finger id under your screen? Oh wait... Oh
Bruh. That intro was the best I‚Äôve ever seen!! Keep it upüî•üíØüëè
"iPhone 8 wow

Can Android support for that long?"
Hey Marques - you've missed the biggest new feature - iOS finally supports BG (Bulgarian) system language. Took them only a decade and a half. :P
That update looks amazing! Just needs AOD
The intros are back !! Absolutely brilliant on this one !!
Insane Intro üòÆ
No one does the intros like you. Your team is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Marques, I swear your videos are up to par with high quality documentaries. Your videos are clear and straightforward, and they seriously help me figure out what to do with my iPhone!"
30 seconds in and the intro already blew my mind
I love the damn intros
So the genius of using mobile phone as webcams as so many has done for years‚Ä¶ only apple steals and gets ‚Äúcelebrated‚Äù for it.. bit seems like a good integration
16 versions of iOS and finally getting the ability to customize a Lock-screen ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Guess I‚Äôll wait it out another year. Great video.
Where can I find that lock screen wallpapers with buildings? Thx
"wow. this might keep me on ios for a bit longer, was about to switch to android"
Video doesn‚Äôt play anymore
SUPER COOL T-SHIRT ! Where can I buy one?
im just so glad that there is finally a haptic keyboard. With the haptics that I already feel from the iPhone I have no doubt that the keyboard will be amazing
"That intro, Primeüëå"
GOOD GRIEF that intro was crispy
Need those wallpapers you showed
"I have been for so many times to a non editable block screen that after all these years, I am sure I will continue using the default one, hahaha.
On the other side, the desktop camera view is a hella incredible feature. I will use it a ton for projects, sketching, teaching and more.
Finally, although I should have said it at the beginning: incredible intro. This was next level above the typical next level thing."
the quality and creativity of the intro is impressive
Will the continuity camera also work on windows pc tho? Or only in between apple devices? üßê
Sickest Intro
I don't like iphones but now they are doing a good job. Nice.
PnP for YouTube should be a thing
I don't care about the iPhone 16. But man THAT INTRO THO!! HOLY SHIT.
Guys. THE INTRO. I'm 25 seconds in this video and I'm amazed
Highest production value on YouTube.
"i have used the betas on my main phone for years without a problem, im sure im risking something but i really enjoy being able to get used to the changes sooner"
Where did you get the stand for continuity camera?
"It would be so cool if they rolled out Always On Display as a Software Update. I think it's possible that most iPhones could do it, cause there's not much new Hardware needed"
"@Nicolas Taddeo No, Apple don't have to reduce the Hz rate."
@Jose Vargas for sure! Everything in iOS 16 points in that direction! Crossing fingers! ü§ûüèªü§ûüèªü§ûüèª
"@Nicolas Taddeo I thought it was simpler, damn. Maybe we'll get it on the 14?"
"They would need new screens to bring the refresh rate down to 1hz. If I remember correctly, the current iPhone 13 Pro can only do as low as 10hz. Battery impact would be considerable if they brought always on displays to current iPhones"
5:09 is that dust on the lense????
OK now this HAS to be the COLDEST INTRO YET ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
Pls continue auto series and do aptera
Apple is stepping it up even higher
Who types in the Wi-Fi password these days ?! üòú
I‚Äôm downloading the public beta right now
I'm excited to start using this!
I wish this video used chapters so I could skip easier to the list
YOOOO that intro. The team keep raising the bar every time!!
The live objects is actually so amazing. It works so well
IOS 16 should fix the pathetic apple stock app.  Just sad.
I won't install it yet because I'll miss the old clock style üòÇ
"sigh, that calculator app yet to get an update..."
That intro alone was oscar-worthy.
WOAH. That intro was something else. Hats off to you all at the Studio üëè
Ventura native here. It's Ven-ter-uh
intresting to see apple finally turn to Androif ideas
"The Weather App individual days and, from what I saw, wind speed, I just what I was missing from Android."
"You really are the pinnacle of a good YouTuber. consistent, balanced, informative & entertaining without none of the scandal, drama or hyperbole. I don't even have an iPhone."
That intro was actually insane. I literally never comment cause I‚Äôm tryna watch the video but that was too good not to say anything
Great content!
As an android user from my 1st smart phone to today. I'm impressed. I've been considering an iphone for my next phone and this is helping the case
sick intro as usual üî• üòÅüëä
That lock screen montage at 0:11 was so tight! It screams Apple quality production.
"You are so awesome! Thank you for always giving to the point, up to date helpful information !"
No Android 13 video even though it was out before iOS 16? Okay.
These people are only getting 10 year old whatsapp features now üíÄ
"Calling lock screen customization a big deal is very laughable 
This is too much praise for a casual feature"
For some reason the video isn‚Äôt playing? Why is that?
I have been using my iPhone as my main streaming camera from the iPhone X lol üòÇ
What about 7plus???
woah where can I get that Belkin mount?? or is that a Easter egg of things that will be available soonish?
iPhone 13 Pro Max Gang!!!
"Can someone send a link to the wallpaper at 6:44 ? I would really need it, looks awesome. Thanks"
How is this a ten minute video
"Super cool d√©su√©tudes am testing the beta now 
By the way MKBHD dreads look good on you"
"Was  it necessary to put that pillow in the frame? Sorry MKBHD you're no longer my favourite YouTuber, I've always enjoyed your videos and reviews and recommend it to all of my friends, but supporting such thing which is out of your scope I dont see any good any it, and trust me you will be amazed when you see the results of your support"
The intro üî•üî•üî•
"but can u customize it the way you can customize an android?  
NOPE ü§£"
"Can i finally not light up the screen with notifications on my lockscreen without switching the phone into ""do not disturb""?"
"The book with the ""XVI"" in the back, love the little details and eastereggs that go into the making of your videos."
"We're inching closer to Apple having a better notifications system. I just need an ""inbox"" like I have on Android, so I can leave some notifications unacknowledged, but easily seen without having to swipe down to check all the time, for when I'm ready to act on them. I have to hope they're working on something like that... maybe one day."
huh do you mean the little notification icons in the top bar?
"Not an iPhone user, but that feature of not having your phone ring for every single notification is something I'd like on my android device. I get really annoyed when someone sends me 6+ messages for something that could have been a single line of text, so this would prove really useful"
iPhone iOS is so far superior it‚Äôs gets better and better
Android user here. Hope iOS pushes visual customisation even further in the future so that Android will have to innovate as well.
@Lamar Shaw like Intel& and
I like this instead of trying to prove which is better we should just push to make each software equally the best they can be
The intros just keep getting better!
Android is officially losing in my book. Making the switch to the 14 this year
@Daniel Pacheco as an Android user for  10+ years I disagree. At this point Android lets you do more for less but you do it in a shittier way so I would rather go with iOS.
"that background removal is going to be a game changer for people who do editing on their phones, ie.. thumbnails"
Am i the only one that is hyped for the haptic keyboard the most? When i switched from samsung to apple it took a long time to get used to but i still miss the haptic feedback
Jesus Christ what am intro. Usually I don‚Äôt really care about intros but damn this got my attention üî•üî•üî•üî•
But we can‚Äôt change the buttons to get to the camera and torch.
"They sayyy unhackable ü§£üòÇ 

But.... üë®üèª‚ÄçüíªüíÅ Apple try again.."
"Have the S22, gonna be getting the iPhone 13 for a better feel, can't wait for this update"
"I don‚Äôt care about the Lock Screen at all, never look at it."
The quality of these videos will never cease to amaze me. Especially the intros good lord.
Thats android hemmm
"10:02 oh man wait until he sees the new beta and what background audio/music does to your lock screen 












hint: It looks like it did back in iOS 9 where the music album takes up most of the lock screen. But in the new iOS 16 beta the album art takes up the background"
Just fix the damn calculator someone üíÄ
"Hopefully one day iOS will allow its users to customise their Home Screen, customise the grid size, number of apps on the dock and be able to have apps or folders anywhere on the grid. Interactive widgets would be nice too.
Apple is on the right track, but considering android has had these functions for such a long time, it kinda feels like a joke üò≥"
"@Patrick McDermott I really enjoy the ability to customise these things on android, yes. 
However, due to certain professional needs, being in the apple ecosystem makes it much easier for me to do my job. I've only recently come back to an iOS phone in the hopes of a jailbreak, unfortunately, its been a long wait, but hopefully not too much longer by the sound of recent news. 
There are things i miss about my android device for personal use, but when it comes to my work, it just doesn't make sense for me to go back :(

I had hoped apple at least would have made it possible to have app icons and widgets anywhere on the homescreen, i know there are apps that can add blanks, but it just seems like a lot of effort to do something that should be available. Surely it wouldn't be something that difficult to code into their base iOS."
Realistically‚Ä¶if those features is what you want you already probably have an Android. Like that‚Äôs where all the customization is.
"I instantly jailbreak my apple stuff and always had a haptic keyboard lol... I thought it was stock but I guess not, come on apple üò£

I'll go to stock if apple ever lets us hide app labels and the ugly homebar üíñ till then, I'll stick with iOS 14 on my 12 pro max lol üíÄ"
DAMNN! THAT INTROüî•üî•
nice changes finally  ofc it took so many years to bring stuff android has for years though now lets hope apple gives us more freedom like android has  still waiting for them to change the crappy music and album app but lets hope it comes soon
"Daft Punk vibe in the outro. 
Saluted."
Excellent iOS 16 is quite something to be eager for
"I wish they would visit the contacts/phone book app. It needs some changes.  Changes like: I the ability to send mass text messages through a broadcasting list, the ability to organize your contacts  by different groups (business, friends, restaurants) and many other changes that would make this app more valuable than just saving your contacts."
"let's just take a moment and appreciate the effort put into these videos, just look at the intros, DAMN."
Favourite feature is the infrared photo that it takes every 5 seconds
That amazing intro could be an official apple ad itself.
that intro üî•ü´°
Spoiler Altert: still far behind Android! Steve Jobs is really dead. RIP ü§£
2 and 4 are really good update. Our one ui 5 upgrade is trash. Nice one apple.
This guys is amazing
That intro was so cool
"Wait, what? iPhone keyboard haptic feedback has been a thing forever."
"Haptic keyboard should be off by default anyway, so they made the right decision there"
That lock screen looks gorgeous
"So excited to tie lock screens into my work focus mode. Right now I'm using an Apple Shortcut automation to search for an image by name, then apply it as the lock screen wallpaper when my focus mode switches. The only problem, is there is a 10-20 second delay for the lock screen to change. Now I can customize the widgets too and the wallpaper will change instantly."
Hjg
Why does this video have Picture in Picture on iOS but others don‚Äôt?
It's so sad seeing an iphone user get happy about features that were out years ago on android
What about passkeyes? Btw passwordless future is a good topic for future video
"Its funny, on Android I rarely...like rarely see the lockscreen on my phone in a given week. Face ID, Touch ID all go straight into the Homescreen. It wasn't always like that on Android, lockscreen customization used to be a big deal back in the day, but now no one cares about the lockscreen. So I find it funny that Apple seems to be going backwards in this, not saying its a bad thing...just strange to me."
This is the most relevant and comprehensive iOS 16 review by far. Thanks MB
Why does edit/unsend msg require an entire ios update for it? Cant they just update the app itself separately?
The intro was amazing üî•
I don‚Äôt even know why jailbreaking still exists lol
That intro made me cry. üî•
The Intro 15/10. Its amazingüòç
As a user that went from iphone to android in 2017 I can now say that the android market has been defeated by iPhone for a minute now. Apple had really stepped it up lately
Editing and deleting messages where available on Telegram from almost 3 years ago
"Bro, that intro..."
iOS devient int√©ressant et Andro√Ød ennuyant
Bro the intro is insane
Oof
The lego dji drone is sick
Notifications on android are better and also still don‚Äôt get that thing with the keyboard on iOS
Dope Intro Yo üòéüòéüòé
Can‚Äôt wait for ios16
so still no always on display? damn
Hi I always watch your videos
"5:13

Is it apple's idea and is it so genius? I've been doing this -  using my iPhone as a webcam - but on my asus laptop using asus software for literally YEARS. 

Desk view is cool, but I think it's a very niche thing that most people will almost never use"
"1/2 a million views in 3 hours.... On top of the YouTube world man, so wild to see how far uve come... üôå"
Nice update to an already quite usable OS. Though wonder why it took to long to have face-id work in landscape mode.
Best intro you‚Äôve ever done imo
The intro was worth the entire video!
I use my S21 Ultra fingerprint sensor to wake - so almost never see the lock screen 10:30
Really glad my iPhone X isn‚Äôt obsolete yet with iOS 16.
Intro ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
Intro ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
When the content creator makes as good or even better scenes of a product than the company their talking about in the first place:
"iPhone 7 not supported?
Shame"
iphone 18 will not have that notch trust me. That algorithm seems to be taken of  from photo background remover online websiteü§£. No1 feature is very similar to color palets on android. Never mind.
That notch though...
2:59 All the small things
I use spotlight so much that I have it to show up when you double tap the back of the iPhone. It‚Äôs great and simple. Triple tap is flashlight for me
I only have my double tap enabled and it is the flashlight
@Msizi vilakazi yes it does just tap a little harder
Yes it isüëç
Does it work a cover case
That intro was you‚Äôre best one by far!!!  The transitions made me smile for no reason.
Bro for that intro you need a spot at Apple!
Will we ever see a smart dailer like in android? The biggest thing i miss from migrating from Android.
What happened to the mic for this video?
Intro is slick AF!
Wanna take a moment to appreciate the intro!
Love the intro!
Still wish it had an always on display. The only feature I miss from my android phones
Air conditioning sound is back!
"Face id working in landscape??? 
SMALL THING????
Daimnnnnüò¶üî•üî•üî•"
we replaying that intro part for many times right.... RIGHT?!?!?!
the reference to JerryRigEverything intro was dope
I'm still waiting for split screen and rolling screenshots.
Intro of the year üëè
I just miss jailbreaking man
"Haptic keyboard is one I‚Äôve been waiting on forever ‚Ä¶ but please please, why can‚Äôt they let us move and place app icons wherever we want on the Home Screen without having to use some corny widget trick?? It‚Äôs such a basic customization option !!"
dat belkin doe
my only dislike is the music widget doesnt have a volume slider
I really miss putting music as ring tone üòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòûüòû
This is the prelude of Apple getting rid of the power button. Having always on display will eliminate the physical button in a couple of years.
I love the intro transitions in this video
Imo this screams always on on iPhone 14
Great intro! üî•üî•
20syl intros always slap
I run it as my main just fine? Not sure why everyone‚Äôs says don‚Äôt
This intro is INSANE
"0:51 ""wont see the edit history"" 
Cyberbullies just got a powerful new tool, i'm assuming there will be a record of it somewhere for criminal investigations?"
Sense the tone.
"This seems like the most neutral, sensible, progressive update ever."
"Apple not putting a better camera in the MacBook, and making people buy a new iPhone to have a better camera is the funniest feature"
I guess I'm weird. I really don't pay any attention to my lock screen on my iPhone. Cool features though. Live objects look awesome.
"If I could, I would give you a hundred likes for that intro!"
album art also can cover the locksceeen now when listening to a song !
The Easter eggs in the background ü§ìXVI
"I think this new notification system is the dumbest fucking shit. Its so unnatural to look at stuff that way. The most natural way to look at things and the way your eyes naturally lock on to subjects is by centering them. Everything happens like this and you probably dont even notice it ever, it's just how you instinctively process vision. Placing notifications at the bottom of the screen just makes for a stupid fucking way of viewing things. Just look at subtitles, they're placed at the bottom of the screen because the center is usually WHERE THE FUCKING FACES YOURE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT ARE. God i hope this can be disabled from within settings."
Dope intro üî•
"Please let me have battery % as a lock screen widget - iOS is terrible for quickly checking battery status. If you also give me ""next alarm time"" widget - you have dealt with 2 of the major issues I have with iOS vs Android."
I like how the gap between IOS and Android is getting thinner by the year
mmmmm nice intro
Lol he just had to edit the part about 24fps being the worst frame rate üòÇ  its personal with Marques
That Intro üî•
Wow! These intros get better every time!
Can we just appreciate the fact apple chose to use the phone as a webcam Instead of producing an insanely priced webcam that looked amazing but cost 800 dollars
30 fps > any fps...
"most of the features from ios 16 will not work on Iphone x üòî 
-Iphone x user"
Great vid as usual.  I wanted to ask if you can send me link for the holder that you used to attach phone on your laptop for the continuous camera feature please.  Thanks
Dope intro!
Hey let's just have people buy an iphone to make up for the terrible web cams we put in our $1100+ laptops
That editing was CRAZY! Android stays on top tho üòÖ
Can't wait to see the BTS for the INTRO via the STUDIO CHANNEL
The ‚Äústicker‚Äù option is probably the coolest feature
I can‚Äôt wait üòú
INTRO FIREEE WTF
Best video work on youtube
What is the Intro music name ? Anyone?
"You know the intro is clean when you go: ""wait, wtf was that, let me roll it back"""
I can‚Äôt wait for the update currently on version 15.5 on my iPhone 13 Pro üáøüá¶
Apple updated bore the sh*t out of me‚Ä¶if I didn‚Äôt like Marquess so much I‚Äôd have skipped this one lol
No change for large screen phones. Navigation sucks on 13 pro max.
lock screen is a big deal!!?? are you serious. this is innovation for you?
Damn!!!! That intro üò≥‚ù§Ô∏è
intro üò¢
"They love to take jailbreak tweaks and turn them into actual features ( no complaints) , just find that funny"
Ultimate Intro!!!
This IOS update is one of the many reasons I think I'm gonna be switching to an iPhone from my android phone within the next year or so.
And no display alaways on right?
Why would you need a lockscreen?
"These are the only tech review videos I watch in their entirety, no skipping around.  Good job Marques!"
The thing I wish I could do with iPhone/iOS is load my mp3 albums onto it easily. I have a load of music and I don‚Äôt want Spotify or any streaming service. Kind of makes me stay with android.
Haptic feedback is the bestt‚ù§Ô∏èüíØüíØ
"I gotta admit: I was waiting for the IOS 15 Jailbreak to finally drop, but your video might have just changed my view on that. The features (the AI driven ones the most) are just too good to miss out on.
As much as I love having different usefull tweaks that iOS hasn't gotten yet, these features are just right."
That iOS 16 intro though üî•ü§©
"Apple Please Listen, i swear to god this would be a banger feature add and is literally dead simple!! Instead of having new app installs default to filling in your home screen from top down - create a simple option in settings for ""Top down"" or ""bottom up"" - and allow apps to fill in from the bottom instead of from the top - that would make SO many people happy and still be a controlled stopgap to androids full customized app placement homescreens"
"I've been using iOS 16 for about a month to, and I have to say I love the new lock screen customization."
man kann w√§hrend des livestreams kommentare schreiben
"Hmm, a lot of ways to abuse that text delete option. I could see that end up being perfect for school bullying."
That intro is truly something else
Y‚Äôall could just make apples videos at this point honestly
It's about time that iOS allows you to change your home screen! Until last October..........I had Android for years so customizing a home screen was nothing new to me! Apple has to come out of its shell because being innovative is what brings people to use your products!!
te best frame rate in the history its 24.
"2:13 I was today years old when i found out you can tap and hold to drag things between apps, and use your other finger(s) to switch apps THANKS!!! wow, How long has that been a thing? I'm on iOS 15.2"
Your shipping updates will show in your wallet if you use an Apple Card or Apple Pay in general?
That opening transition was god tier. We don't deserve you Marques.
Wait where dis at
Come on introoooooooooo üî•üî•üî•
"people hate on miui for being an ios copy, but i like it cuz i know that these cool lock screen additions are surely coming to miui Sooner or later"
that intro was stellar ‚ú®
sometimes my default GOTO channel for testing displays are your videos for the amazing level of colour authenticity and editing! Top Notch stuff M
"i feel like they are trying to compete with android 12 and its lock screen/UI. The only thing is the IOS version feels more unbalanced visually, like the spacing, the location of the notifications and widgets. I like how it cuts thhe foreground out tho, but I feel like android is optically balanced and cleaner."
That intro
That intro was sick!
"in a long time that's the fist ios that is exciting, so lucky I just switched to iphone 13 pro a month.... thank god:D"
that intro is NEXT LEVEL OMG
havent watched the video cause im still replaying the intro üî•
Is anything about screen on screen?? Or split screen
That info is üî•üî•
Yeah sure but this video is one month too late.
Excuse me did he just make a better intro than apple's iso 16 introduction?
Who uses their lockscreen though? I know I don't.
"So excited for this update, man I love iPhones. I used to hate how mainstream and monotonous they‚Äôve become since the original, 3g and 4, but they‚Äôre still just the best phones out there and the software/hardware synergy they have is unbeatable. Updates like this make me realize why I‚Äôll never leave the apple ecosystem again, whether I like that or not lmao"
"Portland, JAMAICA in the Building !!!"
Intro üòçüòçüòçüî•üî•üî•
I thought we always had weather forecast for the hours of the day
"As someone who's dabbling in ML the fact that you can select any object from photo and copy paste it mind boggles me. Usually, object detection models only work on a specific number of objects, at least to my current knowledge. I have no idea how to even train a model to detect every single object from a background."
I made it my main and it‚Äôs pretty cool
I feel like apple just throw a bone every year and people go crazy.
that intro tho ! :o amazing !
What an intro! ü§Ø
Finally we can unlock the iphone with face id while on landscape
05:17 This feels like a blatant cop out- rather than innovate on a good webcam like they did with the pro monitors they just expect you to use your phone cam. Literally did this with my Windows PC on an Android because I couldn‚Äôt afford a webcam at the time during the pandemic.
These intros are getting ridiculous üòçüòçüòçüòç
I like the haptic keyboard but I can never go back to regular typing anymore since they added the swipe typing option!
Finally I‚Äôve been waiting for the clock widget apple has really step up their game
Where did you get your pictures for your Home Screen?
Damn that intro broooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
"Will the mounting camera feature work with macOS? I hate having my iPad camera on the side, as it is currently."
Its Sad when you Realize MKBHD is a Apple Fanboy! üôÅ
Can you give a link to all the wallpapers @mkbhd ?
"Lol I like your puzzles in the background, (1) the XVI Note Pad or something not sure what it is. Lol nice touch to symbolize iOS 16. (2) You have been ranting about the weather app and/or widget, Haha. you've probably had it in other videos, I am only noticing now. Shucks. I wish I could make out more. Anyways, I think I am ready to tap into apples ecosystem because of desk view. If there is any tech also offering desk view please let me link it to me so I do not have to change all the way to apple. Otherwise, I think I am going to give apple a chance if not"
Intro stoll the show ....i saw just the intro one more time üòÅ
iPhones DIDN'T have haptic keyboard feedback? Wtf?
Hepatics in keyboard
"That Live Objects is SERIOUSLY impressive. I did not expect it to work that well, hats off to the devs."
Nerd alert
Ok so hear me out.  Men who use iPhones have vaginas.  That is all.
It just feels so weird to me as an android user how ancient these features are :D but I have to admit apple does a good job refining those in their software
Nice!
"As an Android user I used to customize my lockscreen back in the days. But now I hardly ever interact with it more than checking if there are any interesting notifications. If there are I just hit it and go to the app. My screen is still the same stock background I set when I first got the phone 4 years ago. I just don't look at it for any amount of time that makes a difference. To me it just feels like lockscreens doesn't serve as much of a use-case anymore except for keeping time and showing notifications. But that's just me.
Could also be that I have all notifications off except for calls and my primary IM client, which are on vibrate only. I just don't want to get interrupted by unimportant stuff. I check my phone often enough as it is, but on my schedule, not others."
Dude we need a video wallpaper
I could NOT have picked a way better time to switch to iPhone 13 pro max last year from my Galaxy S10. Apple all of a sudden have began to start hitting to hard now with cool features we‚Äôve been wanting and new ones that are useful
superb intro
"Thanks to Google and its software improvements,you can brag about how the iPhone is catching up.
You are welcome"
"New stuff on ios16 are nowhere compared to what they did on ios15. It‚Äôs mostly polish, much needed but underwhelming."
Holy mother of god that intro was next level
"IOS users: WOW, new features! APPLE always the first!
Android user that have these features for over 5 years: rly?
Will never buy this piss of sh***t."
Face I.d works in land scape wow that made me scream
"Been running the beta since it released, didn‚Äôt know they added haptics to the keyboard. That has been something I‚Äôve wanted for a long time coming from android years ago. Also nice that ‚Äúrecently deleted‚Äù album is now locked as well. Pretty cool all around update, kinda wish they would something innovative/new tho; been awhile.

A ‚ÄúPro iOS‚Äù would also be kinda cool, add all the cool features and customizability to that, then keep normal iOS more simple for the people that enjoy that. maybe one day"
Sweet updates
THAT INTRO IS üî•üî•üî•üî•
"So, what about the ‚ÄúAlways on Display‚Äù? Apple has amoled displays in their phones yet this feature ain‚Äôt available till now!!"
Intro Apple level .. Content Gods level.üî•üî•
Intro was god-tier
"Man, that intro is just amazing"
I need new ringtones and alert tones
FaceiD in landscape mode is huge imo. üëçüèº
Marques get the f out with that intro. Soooo cleaaaan!
where does an XR fall in this conversation? Related to the 8.
This is officially my favorite MKBHD intro
I agree with everyone this intro was amazing
Love the idea of the desk view camera and the possibility of playing tabletop games over FaceTime. Super cool feature.
Android will copy it in a few years and call it innovation
Never thought of that idea! That‚Äôs a great idea.
@Taha Chaudhary it's been a great 6 years
This will be great in the classroom as a document camera
@Heri same man üò¢ I thought they are only gonna kill 6S but y 7
the 24 fps banter is the best ü§£
24fps is the best ever
"Another great vid. You‚Äôre going to have to show us how to sync work and home focus modes + lock screen combinations so they do it automatically, like you mentioned."
Apple didn't have a haptic keyboard??? Whaaaw
like üëçüèΩ the video keep it coming
Jeez that intro was so freaking amazing üòª
So great to know that you don't need these scam sticker apps (some want to charge you 20‚Ç¨ per week) anymore to cut out stickers from photos.
That intro! Best on the web. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Where is the mossy building wallpaper from? I don't see it in the description.
If they now add a nice punch hole front camera and a telephoto that's actually got capable zoom I might actually consider an iPhone for my next phone. Customisation is a HUGE thing for me and they're getting there... Finally.
I was expecting full screen music player on the lock screen. May be it will come out in iOS 17
Brilliant!
Anyone notice the pixel weather icon  like Easter egg
Finally a haptic keyboard üò≠üò≠üôèüèæ
Your team is killing it
So it's more like Android. Again. Got it.
"I learned the hard way not to put betas on my only phone,"
how do you save your lock screens?
How do Live Photos work with the new lock screen?
That cool intro though... Loved it...awesome work MKBHD teamüòçüòç
It's crazy how some new features in some apps makes a new OS version
That intro. chefs kiss üë®‚Äçüç≥
I might be too excited for the font/color changes to the lock screen clock :D
Can I still keep the normal background set up?
Wow
For continuity camera.. why didn‚Äôt they add a magsafe at the back of the macbooks so you can use the phone as a webcame AND charge your phone.. ? üßê
I wish I could afford even one apple product üò´
How bout adjustable front cam flash. The cam is terrible in dark and with flash your eyes will melt.
It would have been really cool if we could get an always-on feature
That intro is ‚Äûbam‚Äú
"2:07 essentially built in photoshop, sort of."
"Im running the iOS Dev Beta on my Main Device since iOS 11 Dev Beta 1 and never had Problems withit. Sometimes little Bugs with the new Features, but I as a technical enthusiest like that pretty much"
Only thing Is missing Is that Little lock on top of the screen that tells you if your phone Is unlocked or locked
iPhone fans were really suffering for customisation huh
maybe it‚Äôs time to change my iPhone 7
Brother please give me one. I need one for my Vlogs and I don't have money to buy one.
never thought apple would add costumization to the lock screen
"wow, these are actually pretty sick features. As a 10 year android user im almost starting to consider switching to iphone at some point"
"You're demo-ing the ""desk view"" functionality on an iPhone 13 Pro, but will it be available on the regular 13 or the 13 mini?"
Excellent Lock Screen
Good üëÄin booking üòá
do they finally add clipboards on the keyboard?üò©
"Looks clean, really want to get into these changes"
"Feels like Apple never really inovates anything, these things have been on the market for years, if you wouldn't be such a fanboy you would probably check some other tech out."
"""It's about damn time"""
I believe haptic feedback is EVERYTHING!
"So, you made me to want an iPhone now. Really cool stuf are coming on new iOS. Price on the other hand..."
"Im using galaxy s22 but battery life is horrible 4-5 hours SoT, I might consider iPhone 14pro ü§î"
RIP to that intro!!!!  SHEESH‚Ä¶
these intros are insane
By far the greatest tech intro
literally nothing to see here. Android still lightyears ahead of apple
DAMN That INTRO üòç
It only took apple decades to finally get things we‚Äôve been asking for YEARSSSS apple disappoints me now
Soo... Samsung
"My dbag of a friend gave me the idea that you can now link the lockscreen to a focus mode, so you can have entirely different phone profiles for all your girlfriends!"
Mann this intro is DOAP
Battery percentage in the massive corner?
"02:06 - wtf this is some next level shit
Maybe already done in Android but first time I'm seeing this"
"iphone haptic feedback keyboard ist a new feature?? in 2022??
WTF am I seeing here???"
That Intro was dope! ü§Ø
"So still no update with Siri voice commands  huh ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•∫
1. dictation improvements
2. Siri stop sending me to websites for me to look up simple questions (& other things) instead Siri do your job and look it up and tell me what it means or s‚ÄºÔ∏è
3. Make more Siri voices 
MAKE SIRI SMARTER"
MAN the intro animations are fantastic. Makes me wanna drop a like every time üëÄüëÄ
Impressive IOS 16 Intro Splendid
That introü§©üëçüèæ!!
Why can they not get rid of the fucking flashlight on the bottom
"I‚Äôve been running it on my main device (iPhone 8 plus) since it was out, in my opinion‚Ä¶ very stable. Also iPadOS 16."
"That‚Äôs one of the few things I miss about android, I remember getting my galaxy s7 and spending hours customizing to my liking. Glad to see apple following in the footsteps of android but in their own way."
"@Mariachee Bandidos That's cuz you're acting like it's new, innovative phone feature. also, there's no universal system my back swipe feature. 

do you think any of these features really change anything? If you're going to put features that people are going to actually use, just put that."
"@makasete30 You're not an iPhone user, you're just a person who's phone is an apple Phone"
"@Excess I like both Android and iOS but still kinda like Android more. I know Android has pretty much limitless customization but to be honest this is a big step for Apple and iOS and they did a great job. Currently using the iOS 16 beta and the automatic background separation, having multiple setups, attaching a focus mode while not needing a separate app is pretty neat."
@Esat'ƒ±n Maceralarƒ± yep. That depth effect for example. Or different focus modes for each setup. They also made it really easy to do. Good job Apple.
"whenever apple refines and implements a standard feature, android people always feel the need to say apple is copying, following, ...¬†
cut and paste, video recording, customization, ... even widget (originally from macOS) these are all standard things done with computers. unless the implementation was exactly the same, then it is just apple waiting until they think they a satisfactory way to implement these features.¬†
android users seem to have a terrible case of inferiority complex.




android was, is and will always be a cheap knock-off of iPhone OS (iOS)"
Dope intro
The intro! Damn!
Holy shit that intro üî•
Still no Call recording üò≠
the little widgets on the screen is already a jailbreak tweak and I use it on 14.4.2 but now that they‚Äôre adding I‚Äôm finding it more and more pointless to be in a jailbroken state
"Tbh I've always been a fan of Apple's R&D because now I feel that Apple has been listening to our concerns like customisation, widgets etc. I'm really amazed by how much competitive smartphone brands have become and how Apple has been a complete standout for every other device. Apart from everything else IOS 16 made me wanting to try their ecosystem."
"@codars All you have to do to get me to shut up and admit that you're right is link a video to something similar to zedge, like an app or at least an easy option for any sound I want just like android. But you can't and you refuse, and that's cool. I won the argument."
"@Alex S As far as you can tell, you don‚Äôt know anything."
"@codars As far as I can tell that's a lie, or you bought it off the limited iTunes store, or a rip off a mp3 file. Regardless all are janky and you just won't admit to being wrong. Stay mad I guess."
@Alex S It can easily be done but I‚Äôm not here to hold your hand. People have been doing this for years. You have the entire internet at your fingertips. Use it.
That live object thing is üî•
"i like that feature you can erase the background since i don‚Äôt have to spend an hour trying to do cutouts, but i am not really digging the new lockscreen layout so hope they also have the option to keep the original layout T^T"
"What if im using my iPhone as a webcam, and then got a call? üòÇ"
Public beer release date ?
Amazing
Hoping and waiting for the ability to resize the keyboard without changing the display zoom
Really interested how the haptic keyboard effects battery life....
How‚Äôs Live Photos as the Lock Screen going to work if now when you hold It down it it goes to personalize it.
"If you're just using your phone as a webcam without desktop view, is it using the normal or ultrawide camera?"
I love the intro‚Äôsüí°üïä
"Where did you got the continuity camera holder, what's the brand, its available now ?
Its sweet"
"Omg that's so good
Finally a landscape face I'd unlock I need these for too long.:)"
I like how Apple made the whole world talk about lockscreen when they are the ones that intentionally delayed putting the featureüòÇ next level influence
"Tldr: 
1. New lockscreen
2. Continuity camera (MacBook turns your iPhone into a webcam)
3. Small changes: weather app, video watching UI, search UI from bottom, haptic keyboard
4. Live objects (long press to copy and paste any photo)
5. Ability to edit and unsend messages up to 
fifteen minutes"
"@Motta so someone can harass someone and abuse the 15 minutes to do so. The end user would be forced to take screenshots to maintain a record instead of just having it on their phone. Sounds like a terrible idea. If I receive an email, no one can retroactively change it's contents on my end. They'd be forced to send another email with edits. But I still have a paper trail on my end of everything that came through."
"‚Äã@Oakmen There's a 15minute time limite. Nobody is going to be deleting old messages from your phone. In case you regret sending something, or you just sent wrong information, what's the big deal? Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger have had that feature for ages."
Really hate the idea that someone can send me a bad text and delete it off my phone. I hope that is a setting and not the default.
I spent the 1st 4mins just looping the intro üòÇ...Sheesh üî•üî•üî•
Does it have search option in recent calls‚Ä¶lol easy one to spot.
The lock screen customization options & widgets looks dope
This made me get the iPhone.
"So, a whole new sofware update and the best thing is the lock screen? For real?
Like seriously, lock screen
Once you unlock your phone its done, no more hype..."
"Firstly that intro was Hella clean. Secondly, I use the fingerprint reader on the s10e so I honestly almost never see my lock screen. Those new lock screen stuff still nice tho"
intro itself already made me click the like button
For me the weather app is the least interesting thing. It's  one of those stock apps where there are plenty of alternatives.
I‚Äôm just happy to be able to use Nintendo Switch controllers with iOS16
I have replaying this video just to rewatch the intro
Cropping parts of an image is my favorite part.
"2 things want to know from IOS 16 users, Does the Phone app still shows all the messenger, whatsapp and text messages in there? Can I send a schedule message via the messaging app?"
Ok
Love your way of explanation üëçüëç
We are still missing Always-on display!!
THESE DAMN INTROS ü´°üî•
why they gotta do my iphone 7 like that
I wish the phone being a web cam would work on computers that aren‚Äôt macs. It would definitely be better than my current web cam I use
"Horizontal unlock doesn‚Äôt work on xs‚Ä¶beta 3, could be mine is glitched or not supported"
"Omg I've been waiting for Face ID to support being useable in landscape since 2018 with my XS Max! I currently have a 13 Pro Max. And I've also been waiting for the native Apple keyboard to have haptic feedback like Gboard & other third party keyboard apps. I've been using Gboard with haptic feedback since 2018 with my X S Max. Now that the native iOS keyboard will have haptic feedback & trace typing just like Gboard since 2018, I might go back to using the default keyboard more often. I'm really looking forward to trying that out with iOS 16"
The intro tho ü´°
Sangar
"How many times you unlock your lockscreen to look at your wallpaper? Literally never, not even to look at the time because of the always on display. I guess this is just an iPhone thing xD"
iOS 16 is dope!
I really like the lock screen changes. More customizability is always good. Can devs also make their own home screen widgets and styles or is that something only apple can do for now?
"3rd party developers will be able to have lock screen widgets, yes. Only apple‚Äôs are showing currently as it‚Äôs the Beta and 3rd party apps aren‚Äôt updated until ios16 launches"
Mark ass brownie
Wow that copy and paste thing is amazing :O
It's always interesting to see what Android features Apple has finally decided to add to iPhones
IOS is getting near to where I feel like I could leave android for.
"i wonder how many actual features are coming to the lowest denominator phones, e.g the 8s and X?"
I don't know if anybody noticed... But I think you're holding a brand NEW iPhone!!!!
That intro‚Ä¶ Apple‚Äôs marketing department should be taking notes
If this content creator continues to make videos with high production value he is just going to continue to be even more successful.  üëè
The keyboard haptics it the best feature
Mad intro.. I just feel like tipping whoever did that
Yeah you mean ads
MKBHD intros are getting better than the actual iOS intros by Apple
"i was an android user for the longest time then i got an iphone
i used gboard for a while for the haptics since i couldnt live without them
but sometimes it would just go back to apples keyboard by default so i gave up using it 
i missed haptics so much and its by far my favorite feature tbh
but the clownfish wallpaper in beta 3 is a close runner up lol"
Ah I was wondering why my phone doesn't unlock sideway. Now it can.
Damn iphone betteaa
"On my iPad mini, I‚Äôm most excited for‚Ä¶. The new weather app. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre getting anything else :D"
Probably the best intro so far!
"This is exactly why I still use an old iPhone. Nothing new or interesting in any smart phone for at least 10 years. I can‚Äôt believe some folks even care about a smart phone, though some people even care about the shoes they wear, or whatever happen in social media world. I suppose we are just a bunch of dumb primates totally unaware of the real world."
Question when coming iPhone 14?
Watching the intro for the 3rd time.. will still watch it again
"WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT SKEME ""I REMEMBER"""
"one thing that stops me using spotlight is that whenever u open an app from it, you are stuck with that stupid back text to take u back to spotlight in the top left until you go back  to your home screen.... i wish they would remove that dam thing"
Introüî•üî•
"Fact:

""ALL those features/etc.. is with NOTE 20 ULTRA & S22 ULTRA already, with their own customizable UI & Android 12.""

Apple iPhone is always catching up, and lying to their minions that they invented this or that, even they never do, period.

Have a great day to y'all!"
The video I‚Äôve been waiting for
"Marques - So many comments I can't imagine you being able to read them all.  I enjoy all that you produce, except the intro to this video was too long."
Hidden photos folder finally requires biometrics to get in to. Could have been useful when I had a gf...
Love how the stuff around the phone changes w each new Lock Screen photo at 8:21. Trying to figure out what it all means? Marques does EVERYTHING w a purpose.
how tf did this guy get the aesthetics of his videos down to such a science?
Who created that intro? Who on earth did that intro? Dude you deserve a raise. I‚Äôve never see something amazing as that before
Sneaking in Naruto merch I see!
"Camo Studio is on my pc and iPhone. It‚Äôs let me use my iPhone as a webcam for months now. It‚Äôs another feature that‚Äôs not exactly new, but I‚Äôm glad it will have some native support. Even if it‚Äôs only iPhone with Mac. I‚Äôm just hoping this doesn‚Äôt mess up my windows support. Super exited for 16 tho. My 11 is my first iPhone and I actually miss the haptic keyboard."
bootleg android 12...... But almost better
What's most impressive about iOS 16 is how fast Apple jumped on the whole customization *cough* Material You *cough* schtick. Usually it takes them upwards of 10 years ü§°
I use the timer more than I should. It annoys me that you can't have multiple timers running simultaneously.
I can‚Äôt wait to be passive aggressive in the chat. Best feature.
Mannnnnn I can‚Äôt wait üòÖ
That live objects thing makes me jealous as an Android user lol. It's impressive that iOS can automatically rotoscope something that you'd normally have to go into After Effects or a photo editing program for.
Wow üëå
"Congrats Marques, once again a very nice video, cheers !"
Easter egg : the book cover behind marques says XVI which is of course 16 üòé
"I sense that my current lock screen picture, which is a typewriter sitting at the bottom of the screen, is not going to work well with some of these new features."
Intro ü§Ø
Apple did it again üëèüèº
"Camo camera has been doing continuity camera for a while now, not apples idea."
Nice intro. Good work guys
"IOS 16: lock screen customisation
NOKIA 3310: hold my beer"
Sweet intro
Still no live wallpapers tho
My favourite feature would be upgrade to USB-C port
"FYI, I'm using an Android."
"I‚Äôd prefer they did sth about the awful photo quality in iphone13 that‚Äôs caused by not being able to turn off the HRD option. Lots of photos look like watercolor paintings, they‚Äôre just embarrassing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è And it makes people look older than they are, acentuating every single pore and line in their face, making them look grey and tired"
"Lock screen is a big deal...
I'll never understand 1st world priorities"
You Marques and Ijustine are my favorite YouTubers when it comes to tech news üòä‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è great job keep it up! üòäüëçüôè
liked right after that intro
Jealous. I want Brandon‚Äôs number üòçüòÇ
The Lock Screen for me is a life saver. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else has done this but I‚Äôve turned on Dnd multiple time just so I can get peace and be able to look at the wallpaper without a million notifications blocking. And the way the music pops up at the bottom and try‚Äôs to give you as much rooms as posa to view your wallpaper as well is pretty good. iOS 16 is looking pretty good. Oh and I don‚Äôt have to keep on asking Siri for the weather forecast anymore ü§©ü§©üò±üò±
Great summary kid! See you at practice
Will you be able to see the stopwatch from the lockscreen too?
Damn that intro!
Bro half the budget probably went into that intro alone
Cool!‚úåÔ∏è
What about battery last life
OKAY my fav intro
"When will Apple introduce the following important features which will make our lives with our smartphones much more easier?-
1. Pause button while taking videos
2. Able to search for contacts from our recent call list 
3. Search for apps from whichever icons page we want rather than sliding till the App Library to search for an app
4. Close all the apps in a single touch that are opened in background rather than closing it one by one
5. Always on display 
6. Split screen multitasking???
I know the above mentioned features might sound like a joke for android users but these missing features are truly annoying and incomprehensible as to why Apple can‚Äôt release it? Being an Apple user is a fake privilege that is depended on what the makers hand down  to us as some sort of alms.."
What an absolute masterpiece of an intro. Well done team!
Hey MKBHD! Your channel's gotten almost par with Apple.
"lol, I recall reading somewhere that they'd only drop up to the iPhone 6 Plus or something, that's disappointing with my 7 Plus :("
The edit of the intro is just wow.
The book says 16. (I am not constantly hunting Easter Eggs in these videos now )
Nice features Android already had.
That was a beautiful intro.
Video is worth it just for that intro.
I wish they would add the feature to vibrate when someone picks your call. Android has had this feature for years ü•∫
My favorite feature is..... Android!!
These intros are proof why this guy and his team stay #1. Great stuff!! üòÑ
Imagine unsending message but your friend has ios 15 and sees the message
If you ever wanted to argue that software is as imp as hardware. Show them this video. Some amazing useful UI improvements that allow me to use my phone from one hand. Been using Samsung OneUI 4 lately and disappointed that it‚Äôs impossible to use in one hand. Kudos to Apple keeping experience first!!
"Also, all the stock wallpapers are deleted from your device. You have to download each stock paper, even the preloaded ones again."
Can I search my contacts from dialing pad. ?  No..? Okay.
Great Marques like every time !
Hey you should give the link for the thing to go on the MacBook to get desk view I need one of those
Using the iPhone as a webcam is a very nice feature but what was that mounting you had on the back of your phone allowing you to hang it off you Mac - that looked dope
That intro animations cool
Can android do that?
Love the videos jidion!!!
Been on Android the last decade or so.  haha
"Mark, you're more than next level, you're iOS 16 pro max level"
Dope video as always Marques
Back on IOS and I don‚Äôt think I am moving away for a while
"Customizable lock screen? Looking forward to finally seeing which of my fellow iOS users actually have really shitty taste/are colorblind

Edit: the notification updates are a way bigger deal for iOS than anything else."
Haptic is so annoying. I would turn it off immediatly
Is it just me or like wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if apple we‚Äôre to do something like Samsung dex
I want there to be this massive change like IOS 6-7. Something that is completely different
Apple is becoming VivoüòÇ
"If you want to try haptic keyboard on iOS 15, without switching to the iOS 16 beta: SwiftKey Keyboard supports it."
mkbhd must pay his cgi team well
"I've recently switched to iOS and I'm so glad they're adding haptic keyboard. I still miss the various volume controls on Android, tho"
Dragging and dropping subject from picture is dope. The  lockscreen where the clock slides between the background and foreground it was a feature of windows phone.
Where is that leaf wallpaper!!
them cat fishing bots gon hate this lol
I still can‚Äôt convince myself to purchase my first iPhone
"Nooo, did they get rid of the rewind and forward 15 seconds by pressing the circle at the bottom of the safari video player?"
Still waiting for Apple to allow us to convert voice messages into text! And also allow us to select where we want to start the voice message from instead of having to listen to the entire message from the beginning
That intro tho
"My question is, what does the new base car play UI look like? Or has it changed yet? I haven't been able to find any info on it yet."
And yet I still can't put an icon where I want on the home screen üòî
I would like to see them add a feature to allow my calculator to not time out with my lock screen. It's annoying to be doing calculations in the calculator app and then have it darken then shut off.
Yoo where did you get those kickass building wallpapers tho?
Does the beat of the intro background music say ‚Äûdope‚Äú? üò¨
I rewinded for this intro. I never rewind for intros.
that was probably your best intro yet
"I‚Äôm running the iPadOS 16 beta‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a tad underwhelming. I mean, I have an older iPad Pro, but the Lock Screen magic doesn‚Äôt exist, there‚Äôs lag sorta everywhere, there is a new version info menu in Settings > General > About, and also a bug with audio if you adjust the volume while something is playing."
"Will there be any way to keep the lockscreen design as it is now or will you have to adapt to iOS 16? I'm not a HUGE fan of the bold fonts on the clock or the texts, i like it how it is rn"
Android users be like: What's new??? ü§î
Finally ios is not boring!!!! Or less boring!!
What pixel is doing with android is far nicer.
Desk view is lit üî•üî•üî•
Does the second update work on other laptops
Didn‚Äôt know about haptic kb. FINALLY
BRUH! That intro
No RCS support üëéüëéüëéüëé
Something I always wanted is the ability to change the chat bubble colors on iMessage :/
Dope Introü•∂
So iOS is becoming more Android like than ever? Cool.
The intro music is Devil 20syl Remix...for those who care.
"Is that pillow your logo with the LGBTQ+ flag inthe background? 
I sincerely hope it is not..."
"1. if so who cares...
If you‚Äôre that offended by a pillow, you're a weirdo. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre the type who likes to call people snowflakes too.
2. you know rainbows existed before the lgbtq up movement right? Have you not seen the old apple logo?"
"iOS is becoming android, its good."
"Quite shocked at how few widgets you can add to the lock screen. 3 of them being tiny ones that you can't interact with. I don't know, I was expecting them to go a bit deeper with it."
The haptic feedback is probably the best addition for me üòÖ
Some good stuff there!
Say what you want about apples faults ‚Ä¶ and we all do but you got to give them credit when it‚Äôs due especially software wise.
Had to watch that intro thrice üôåüôå bful
Congrats on that Introüî• and video
Intro game crazy üî•üî•üî•
The intro looks like it was made by the Apple team except that it was made by a team that‚Äôs better than Apple.
"Very interested in how using your iPhone as a webcam will impact the lifespan of the phone. I know there have been apps that let you do this, but using your daily driver as a webcam would be hindrance to the device's lifespan"
The intro gave me chills‚Ä¶
your editor could probably run an de-reverb filter on the dialogue tracks here. we can totally hear the room you're recording in.
Always on display????
What about Indian bank apps are they working?
Damn! That intro ü•π
Edit and delete messages are for the manipulative crowd and I see more and more people want to manipulative others for personal gains as social fibers break down more and more in the US
This iphone mount camera shit really is just the most laughable thing.
Damnnnn! Props to the Mograph and editors on this one. Such high quality graphics and editing
"Marques, please give my thanks to the team for that intro. Literally looked like something straight out of Apple's own HQ. I just keep playing 0:13 on loop."
"What exactly happens, when you edit in iMessage, but you chat with a Android buddy?"
the first video from MKBHD¬†with Room Ecco! long life Over Priced Studios üòÇ
too much useless stuff. Make iOS easy again!
"In the first 20 seconds, I liked this video! amazing"
"Wow, that image copy / paste is cool."
*me owning a 6S* guess I‚Äôm gonna just enjoy what I can have
Still waiting on Cross Fade...  Still using my iPod Nano 5th Gen just for the Cross Fade...  any chance of it coming to an iPhone or Mac?
Do many people use iMessage? I would have thought WhatsApp was used by most people?
Maybe Lockdown Mode???
That Intro was incredible
Great video. Apple must have the patience of Job to deal with the fickleness of their customers. Lock screens came about when users complained too much info was available with their phones lying about and asked for a wall between the Home Screen and waking from sleep mode.
How can some of that be disabled?
the feature which I am waiting to arrive on iPhone is always on display. Don't know in which decade they will add that feature
The intros are too good
Is ticktick more accessible?
Released together with the Public Beta amazing timing
My favourite feature of iPhone is price. It motivates me everyday to use my existing phone ü§£
"I have a iPhone 7, is iOS 15.5 the final version or will I get iOS 15.6"
Man Is it me or is apple updating faster?
Pretty boring stuff tbh
Sick intro üëè
Exciting stuff. When can we expect the new update?
People can subscribe just after watching the intro!! Quality manüîùüîù
I got a Samsung ad on this video
Kudos to your editing team. I love the intro! ü´∞üèª
"Dam, it's too much this time! I can't even catch up anymore, it's too much info, too much stupid settings... Bad Apple, Bad."
Dont mind me on my iphone 6 with ioS12
That message edit feature is best one so far
"Ok, now I just can‚Äôt wait for the release, srsly."
"Am I the only on who's rewinding the intro again and again? 

Hats off for the editing"
"MKBHD's intro should have their own channel by now, just stuff of legends"
Idk if you have the answer to this since it‚Äôs still in beta. But can you still edit/unsend message if you are texting someone on Android?
Those intros though üôåüèø
The day they make it USB Type C  port on their phones is the day they have my money.
On the last one it‚Äôs iOS saying hello 2012
Fresh‚ù§
That intro was so darn cool man damn
"Intros are always unique and very well edited. 
Keep up the content!"
But still no seconds timer for the clock I see üôÉ
The intro alone is so satisfying I don‚Äôt even feel like watching the rest of the video ‚ù§Ô∏è
INTROü§©ü§©ü§©
So excited for iOS 16üéâ
"My favorite feature is: when Apple has plateaued their useful features, they start to implement cosmetic ones, that were available in Android since cavemen."
Can you really do object highlighting since cavemen in android? or the desktop view?
Can you make a iPadOS 16 video please
My favorite feature of the iOS 16 is the intro  ;)
"""its not stable enough to make your main""... watch me"
"It's not MKBHD anymore...
It's MKBappleHD now.."
"whaaaaaat, im in 0:26, dude that intro was amazing"
Anyone else having a hard time watching this video?
Still no pause button on vido .No time and date on photos.
Sick Intro!!
Hands Down An Amazing Intro!
Live text is annoying when I'm trying to double tap zoom
Would love to see the option to share lock screens like you can on Apple Watch Faces. What do you think?
That intro was fucking LIT üî•
It‚Äôs 2022 and keyboard haptic is a top 3 update üëèüëè
"Don‚Äôt think the sideways Face ID thing works on my phone, it‚Äôs an iPhone 11 on iOS 16 beta 3"
"When I watch your intros, they are this well done, that I don't know if it's an Apple's work or yours"
"Jesus loves you he died for you,  we‚Äôve broke Gods commandments and the Bible says we deserve hell for that! Jesus came and lived a perfect life   no sin and then took in ours so that we‚Äôre judged on his life when we die not our own 2 Cor 5:21   God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."
What an intro wow
That intro... ü§§
That intro is so good damn.
That might be the coolest intro I‚Äôve ever seen y‚Äôall pull off.
apple take notes
Great video! I was an android user since it‚Äôs inception. Had a iPhone 5 back in the day but the OS just never had all the features I loved with android. This past March I finally jumped back into the Apple ecosystem mainly because of the Apple Watch and the iPhone 13 reminded me so much of the iPhone 5. I‚Äôm so happy with the upcoming release of IOS 16 because it‚Äôs bringing more things I have grown accustomed to over the years. Now if they only bring scheduled texts with out the need to run automations I‚Äôd be a very happy man!
"Not hating, but my Note 9 has had most of not all of these ""new"" features üò¨ Also, MUCH cheaper & comes with an S pen. The pen & microSD is what I need in a phone for work."
L
Nice üòä but iphones are unaffordable if i look into my wallet
"If customization is suddenly that much important for iOS users that the home screen customization is the most important feature of iOS 16, well, maybe you go all in customization and switch to Android üòÑ."
Another great vid. Iphone domination ‚ù§Ô∏è
#4 is actually insane
Your fan from Pakistan üáµüá∞
"you forgot to mention that the photos lock face isn't the only Lock Screen you have. try the other stuff like astronomy, or emoji, or my personal favorite, pride and collections. they all have something special to them, something to customise."
I can finally start a YouTube channel with the sick webcam & birds eye view features
‚ö†Ô∏èJESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON. BELIEVE IN HIM. JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN‚ö†Ô∏è
"That intro is dope, nice work"
Beautiful intro transitions üî•üî•üî•
"ive noticed that almost everything to do with the new lock screen has clearly been influenced by past jailbreaks, am i right or?"
Watching this video on my 100$ chinese android phoneüòë
"*Looks at my 6s plus* Sigh, I got to make some money."
"As a Android user I'll admit the photo cutting feature is impressive.. lock screen made me laugh a little,,that shouldn't impress you"
Ok‚Ä¶.intros are *chefs kiss*
Is that a stem player in the background?
I wish we could delete people from the pictures like in pixel phones.
"It really took Apple tooooo long to add these customization options. But better late than never. I remember getting an iPhone 4 back in the day (it was already not a flagship, it was in like 2012 or 13) and one thing I absolutely hated after jumping from android was the lack of any customization. I'm not an Apple user anymore (might change in the future, who knows), but I'm glad iOS is a lot more customizable these days."
"This channel always has the coolest intros, Love it"
"Wait, he typed in deskview to do desk view? Why am I only finding out about this now?"
android  has most of this for a long time already
"You know, I could watch that intro on a loop."
Attention to details : in background xvi
What an intro
Broke the internet
‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve had ios 16 for about a month now‚Äù bro WHAT üíÄ
"As an Android user, I guess one of the things I used to look down on iOS for (its lack of customization) are really not an issue anymore"
god dammit I hate my Pixel 3a more and more every day
Bug public beta ?
Haptic is off for me since my first iPhone. And it will definitely stay unchanged.
"as soon as iphone 14 hits, all prior iphone will start lagging. You should do a test on this! Ty"
"Skeme?! Wow, I‚Äôm impressed üôåüèæ"
wow! that intro was dope af!
Dick pics game has officially levelled up
"subtleties like fading in the foreground and then the background make it look amazing, kind of want to switch from samsung even though i enjoy customizing colors"
That introüòÆ‚Äçüí®üôåüèΩ
"MKBHD always best in editing
No compromise"
one of the best intros!!
All the new features on IOS 16 is next level of what a phone can do!
Perfecting an already impressive software experience
There‚Äôs more echo in this video than I‚Äôve seen in a MKBHD video.
"That intro animations is sick, Tim must've spent countless hours perfecting it and it turned out amazing"
I used to spend hours customizing my launcher back when android was ice creme sandwich. iOS 16 reminds me of those XDA scouring days!
my favourite feature is they make you make a new video about it!
NO BIGGIES
thumbs up for the intro
Anyone else noticed it says 16 on the book behind him on the shelf?
The editing on that intro is what I needed to see today üòç
"I hate live text. I wish I can turn it off. I also wish you can control how full you want to recharge your battery. It's possible, but wonder why it's not on iPhones."
Do you ever just watch an MKBHD video for the intro and end up sitting through the whole thing thinking about the intro?
Feeling personally attacked on the 24f
"#5: fun fact, in Signal you can already delete a message since ages
#4: iOS allows Apple to scan all your photos to look for any text and now whatever they want... Privacy first...
#3: weather app? Is this the communist party of OSs? I thought that one was able to download weather apps from the app store. And vibrating while texting? 
#2: an excuse to lock you down even more into the golden walled garden... And that you can achieve since many years with Android phones with a simple cable (you know, the thing that Apple doesn't put anymore in the box)
#1: customizable lock screen...... No comment"
Fire intro
"I can tell iOS 16 will be exiting, but for now the Android 13 Beta is much smoother than iOS 16 Beta."
Great video.
Apparently new beta has a full on music player on your Lock Screen
Always epic
Great intros as always!
"The intro to this video was literally the best ever, period."
"I never look at the lock screen, because my finger activates the fingerprint scanner before i can even get a chance to see the lockscreen..."
So what I am seeing is iOS16 is basically what Material You and Android 12 completely failed at.
Great intro! Looking forward to the new changes.
"When I tried to change from Android back to iPhone last year the lack of a haptic keyboard was one of the main things that put me off. So that's a damn good addition, finally. Still no always on display though. That's a bummer."
Wow it‚Äôs getting these features androids have had just now üòÇ
I‚Äôm really glad they added this feature now when I make content I can easily crop out photos and send them to myself
"I wasn‚Äôt aware that Stage Manager for iPadOS was for M1 only. In other words I‚Äôm stuck with my A12X iPad Pro in an unstable OS that‚Äôs nearly identical to the last, with the truly breathtaking exception of the brand-new Weather app."
"@giko! too bad. I already had issues with iPadOS not being nearly robust enough to utilize even my 2020 iPad Pro, let alone M1, then they come out with a few decent features and restrict them to newer models..."
"@Ana Marko Yeah I think they could‚Äôve put this into at least all the Pro models. My phone benchmarks lower than my iPad by a decent amount (thanks to Samsung Exynos), yet is capable of using DeX, which is essentially a desktop interface for when you connect an external monitor, where you can run Android apps. Sure, it has more RAM (8gb more), but my iPad already happens to chug along with the current multitasking options (2 apps in Split Screen, 1 in Slide-over). I see no reason to restrict it all to full-screen apps, though I‚Äôd imagine Apple has their reasons‚Ä¶ namely to incentivize people to upgrade their older iPads."
"Oh is that feature M1 exclusive? Missed that info somehow. Also proper external monitor support seems to be M1 exclusive as well‚Ä¶ As much as I enjoy Apple‚Äôs hardware, their decisions really sour me to the brand sometimes"
My favourite features is the ability to sort icons alphabetically......oh wait.
"I'm a bit confused. My keyboard already does haptic response when I type. What exactly is new? I do use Gboard as my default and I'm on a 13 pro max. Maybe I'm mistaken but I'm not sure it's new with ios 16, since I'm on 15.5"
I hope one day they will give me decent reason to switch to Iphone beside old tech adaptaion
"Haptic Feedback when typing???  On an iPhone???  It's about effing time!!  I can't tell you how many iPhone users comment when I hand them my Android to enter their contact info.  All of them ... OOOOH, I like the clicky keyboard.  Bravo Apple."
How many of these features will only work on the latest iPhones?
I hate keyboard sounds but I can't type without the vibration so that's a good change
I still find it so disappointing that Focus mode forces you to choose the apps you want to use rather than apps you want to filter out! I just want to have a Personal mode that filters out MS Teams!!
Saving lock screens is pretty cool but not really necessary
The intros are sick...keep up the good work
Here I am watching the whole video without skipping on my S22 Ultra. Why you ask? Well MKBHD BI@%&!!!! üòéüëâ
Haptics for keyboard are sooo much anticipated. Now I won't need to install GBoard just to have haptics while typing - loving it!
"If you look on the bottom shelf of Marques' shelf, the photobook has XVI on it, which is Roman numerals for 16!"
I haven‚Äôt been this excited for an update since IOS 7
So what about pre iPhone 8 as you alluded to at the start - I'm on iPhone 7 - any further details? thanks
Ios turning into better version of android ü§îü§≠
I watched the intro for like 10 times before watching the whole video.  Nailed it
It‚Äôs definitely stable enough for me to use on my daily driver. It‚Äôs been stable enough since dev beta 1. Not a single issue. Battery is fine and performance is optimal.
Same. I've gone though all 3 betas so far and its been rock solid.
"That XVI in the background....
Mark and team always leave easter eggs for us to findüòÉ"
"we should call the new lock screens ""lock faces"" because of the similarity to watch faces on Apple Watch!"
"What does he mean? Keyboard haptics has always been there, at least since the first haptic engine. I am on iOS 15, and keyboard haptics is literally in the sound and haptics setting. It was on iOS 14 and even way before that."
100% wallpaper
üî•Mad Intro....üëå
I wish they would make an option to go back to iOS14 Notifications‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like the huge icons
I wish apple would add the top down feature to iPads
live objects is a game changer for graphic designers wtf
Have they mentioned anything about an always-on lock screen? And I know this might be a little nitpicky but I just came from android and find it weird that you can not place an app icon anywhere on the screen. It just snaps to the top. Wonder if they would ever change that.
"Super informative, thanks MKBHD!"
Now that's crazy cool playing something on the table and it shows up on the screen upright üòÇüòÇ
"IOS 16 have many problems, i have iPhone 13 pro max and i notice these some issues 
1. Browser are not downloading in background any Browser
2. I faced many times this message - your system experienced a crash
3. Siri isn‚Äôt working properly
4. When i change wallpaper it‚Äôs go black wallpaper for few minutes
5. Before in IOS 15.5 my network is working great but after update IOS 16 beta my network is also not stabilize
6. Battery is also drain faster and my battery health is now 98% in just 6 months"
GL
"These are all valid points. For me, I‚Äôm still waiting on the ‚Äòlittle things‚Äô like crossfading in Apple Music and perhaps separate volume levels for calls/texts and music."
@H You are correct. I should have been more specific. What I had in mind is a graphical pop up to adjust via sliders when I tap the volume up or down button similar to AirPlay volume levels for speakers in different rooms in my home. I had something similar to this back in JB days and it was ideal for my needs. Sometimes my hands are full in the kitchen while listening to an AM playlist and having to navigate through Settings isn‚Äôt always convenient. Cheers.
Uhhh there already is seperate volume levels for calls/texts and music. That's been a thing for like at least a decade on ios
@Abul Fazal yes we will :/
We'll keep on waiting...
Probably the best and innovative iOS update after many years. Making me reconsider getting an iPhone again üòú
@Nick Dean i had stroke reading this
Innovation you say apple do not do they polish old tech and software sir
It's old android shit you have this for years
Don't do it. You'll lose USB type C
"I love the iPhone, but even I would say, that‚Äôs not a true statement you‚Äôre making"
IPhone is just so boring........zzzzzzz
I didn't know that iPhone was that far behind Samsung
"All i really need is to switch off the bluetooth from the control pannel, and not do it from settings"
Now say thank you to Android. Go on.
bro the video is crisp...damn sweet!
"the production value on these videos just keep getting better and better!! amazing job team with these new intros and a great video, looking forward to ios 16!"
Nice video. IPADos16?
"Maan the intro is absolutely fantastic loved it.
Great work by Marques and team much love ‚ù§Ô∏èüôÇ"
Dat intro üî•
That intro was kickass
"""its not stable enough to make your main just yet"" uhhhhhhh oops"
Like the Naruto n DBZ skins on those Android phones
How cool would it be if the back of the MacBook had a Magsafe to hold the iPhone?
"This is now my favourite MKBHD intro, a lot of elements come together perfectly."
The whole Unsend and edit feature will leave people ( rightfully so ) to snapshot a text message that a person sent that was rude/inappropriate/etc. Because no a person calling you a C*nt can now just edit it and make it look like he/she never said that.
Back in the day (2000) people would make very good money being a master at masks in Photoshop.
Crazy Intro bro üî•üî•üî•üî•
Desk view was pretty wild
This video is dope üòÅ
Im still waiting for the password lock for each apps
Just a comment: people with iOS 15 will see the edit/deletion as a message now. And btw where can I get these Apple product‚Äôs cards??? üòç
If iMessage gets stories‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm leaving WhatsAppü§ûüèΩüïØ
Can‚Äôt wait!
iOS 16: almost as good as Android.
"The intro felt so good, I showed it to my sister who doesn't even care much about tech!"
"Enough details about the visual overhaul of the lockscreen

Now I just want to know if we can keep the actual original lockscreen, the one available in iOS 15 without the font changes to the time and other things.

Can this be done in iOS 16?"
That's called pages on my Samsung where it shows up history and searches
Have they given us the ability to remove the flashlight from the Lock Screen?
Congrats Apple .. this patch makes ios look like Android üëè
BEST. INTRO. EVER.
We need that lock screen on Pixel instead of adding everything to 'At a glance widget'.
"I want to create a clock that comes out of my mouth.


:O <--- 08.55"
"My Samsung already does all that with the weather too, old Samsung"
My favourite by far is the new photo sharing features with your family. I hope it works as I think it does
When will they launch calculator app for iPad
Jolie Intro
Sooooo we're getting a Hermes iPhone?
This is why Apple is just so ahead of time
Bought the Samsung S22 last month kind of regret it now.
ok... that has to be the sickest intro to date! Also can't wait for the update!
"THAT INTRO, OMG"
I can already do that too lifting pictures and text on my Samsung
"Apple should use this intro for their ads, damn!"
Great features. The iPhone as webcam feature is currently available in Camo Studio for both Mac and PC and works great.
"@Tariq Mulla I see some hypocracy here. You tried to insult me and call me an iSheep yet when I told you about a feature iPhone has over the Android you told me to go check some reviews or whatever but when I mentioned that most of the features that the Android phone have over the iPhone like the 8k video gimmick you said that if the feature is there there are people who are going to use it. Yeah dude I'm the sheep ü§£ü§£...

I mentioned the MacBook and the iPad nkt because I can't give you any features but because I wanted to give an example for the seamless integration of iOS with other Mac products. That's something no other ecosystem can match and it is one of the greatest feature on iPhone and other Apple products.

Idk how you decided that icloud is less optimized. There is no evidence about that but sure. I'm not talking about transition from iPhone to android I think that is very far from the point. If I say that the iPhone in better I'm most likely not gonna switch. Yet the transfer from iPhone to iPhone is absolutely unmatched in the Android world. It is a simple fact and I don't know why you can't accept it.

So you attacked me for mentioning other Apple products but then again you mentioned DSLR cameras that are supposedly better for photos on Instagram than the iPhone. Are you sure I'm the sheep here. There are literally 2 parts of your comment where you are nothing more than a hypocrite. But OK yes DSLR camera with editing will take a lot better picture no doubt but you still have to upload that picture and for better result you have to have an iPhone. And it is not just Instagram it is basically every single platform for photo and video sharing. That's goes with the point that apps are just better optimized for iOS devices than Android device. It could be because it is easier to do that on iPhone compared to the billion Android devices around. Also it is part of the iPhone simply having better apps for pro use. Ofc you have to pay for those"
"@Davout No AirDrop? It requires additional hardwares and $$$!


No iMessage - check out reviews of imessage app in the app store (may be different as per your location). In fact sucking part is no support for 3rd party texting software in iphone. The Imessage is anyways hopeless and unless. Like I said it doesn't even has basic features.

Apple's ecosystem that works flawlessly, now thats a blunt lie again.  see how many people keep on troubleshooting online. Infact the moment I had purchased an iphone and when I had moved out of my area, the iphone was not working in my office and yeah it was in the same city but on the other side. So had to troubleshoot on my flawless iphone. lol

No easy way to change android phones. Who said? In fact 1 can transfer from ios to android, but not from an anroid to ios. Hvae you ever done switching on android to android? The data gets transferred and if 1 has google cloud which is better optimised than icloud.

Its funny to see that you couldn't speak rather than speaking about iphone vs android you started to include macbook, ipad etc. Can't believe you ran out of features so early. lol

Also what has social media got to do? I mean dslr camera takes the best photo's so that some people who really want those pics really go for a dedicated cam not a iphone. Also you are saying as if pic taken on instagram makes people look like tom cruise and the one taken on android makes people look like chuck norris. 

Got it you are an isheep. üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"@Tariq Mulla 
No AirDrop
No iMessage
No drag and drop 
The Android world to this day do not have anything even remotely comparable to the Apple's ecosystem that works flawlessly
No easy way to change android phones. With iPhone the transition is seamless. Even the wallpaper is the same. Everything is just as if you never change you phone. 

There are so many features that the Apple ecosystem provide that the android world simply cannot give. The inner integration is on the next level you can literally work on a project and then send it on your iPad and then to your Macbook instantly. You start using the MacBook and you put your iPad as a second monitor with all the power you need. Then you decide that you have to put more complicated details you go to the iPad again and use the Apple pencil for the job. Then move back to the MacBook for final export or rendering or whatever. Just a random example. Also pro apps on the iPhone. One that are simply not available on Android not to mention apps on the iPhones are better in general. Some people will buy an iPhone for the simple reason that it takes much higher quality pictures for Instagram. Better optimized apps is a feature of itself"
@Davout List them!
@Tariq Mulla And there are things that the iPhone can do while Android cannot
"what a sick intro. You guys are getting way too good, it's scary."
Bro that intro TRANSITION!!!!! Phenomenal!! üî• üî•
Perfectly executed!!üòÅüî•üî•üî•
OCR features coming to Samsung UI 5.0 also! glad to see these features being adopted in phone tech
That intro is just ... ü§å
WOW! The intro got me. Really really nice work by the team. Sensational intro! Props
"you, you're my favorite feature."
What kind of iphone webcam mount are you using in this vid?
Did you put that dragonball phone in your video the realme gt neo 2 cause i mentioned it in your last video haha mine should be here tomorrow plus the xiaomi 12 ultra
Where can we get that Belkin Mount from?
Something a weirdo like myself really appreciates is them adding the OG lockscreen time font when it wasn't there in the first beta
Not enough people talking about how awesome that intro was üôå
My Samsung already does that
I hope they fix the double tap live text where it automatically picks the text out instead of zooming in.. very minor but it has been frustrating.
10:01 did you really just fawn over the music widget becoming TINY? No question now - you‚Äôre paid off by big tech.
Memo to Jeffery Toobin: Deskview is not recommended for your Zoom meetings.
Black makes beautiful vedios
still the old boring stuff
watching this video but not having an iphone
What an intro üî•üî•üî•
I don‚Äôt believe they still didn‚Äôt add simple ‚Äúschedule a text‚Äù feature (((
"The *entire* reason I stuck with Android for so long was its options for customization that iOS just didn't offer.  I switched to iPhone about 2yrs ago, and the more customization Apple adds to iOS, the less I miss my old Android phones."
Now I‚Äôm very excited for ios 16 ‚ù§
MKBHD is the TECH man lol
Hm
"Very smooth video, Marques! Good job, i want to test new iOS, because of your video!"
That intro is sick!!!
But does it save your text messages as drafts???
8:45 that fade-in is awesome üò≥
4:25
"Nothing special, same hero new boots."
"‚Äã@THE SPEAKERS REVIEW ah yes, the Apple sheep"
Ratio android suck
In app features and changes shouldn‚Äôt even be consider a new feature of iOS
"I have a question here. Are Everyone‚Äôs lives that boring that we‚Äôre thrilled to have Lock Screen Centering, along different layouts. The Copy and Paste objects in pictures is dope but seriously Human Beings spend more time playing with their phones then they know about their own bodies and how to take care of it. Think about it."
"Kids you have iphone?? , that's the poin"
I don't remember this room from the studio tour. Where are we right now?!
"Does iOS 16 let you customize the dock in different focus modes? It's annoying that you can customize everything else, but not those apps."
Cool new features. Live objects looks dope. However they still have a lot of work to do in customization before I switch to iOS. Wallpaper engine on Android is amazing if you want a real live wallpaper. An actual app drawer as well to reduce clutter on the homescreen. Real multitasking. The list goes on
"@MikeF App draw on android is hidden behind a button (old style) or upswipe on new style. No difference between swipe left, button press to swipe up IMO. I do wish I could put apps where I want though, although I use pretty much all the space for app folders to keep all my commonly-used apps in."
@Mark app library yes but it isn't like the one on Android. Hidden and you swipe up to access it.  I also like to place icons wherever I want. Just makes everything cleaner.
There is an app draw and has been for a while. You just swipe left. I only have one home screen with widgets and a few apps. I go to the draw for everything else or I swipe down to open spotlight and search.
That intro is a 10/10
The notifications at the bottom are nice  and make sense BUT since they roll in from the bottom sometimes I don‚Äôt see a notification because it all the way at the bottom and I didn‚Äôt know I had it. I think they should do something like android has were when your scrolling through your notifications it turns into a icon so it can fit the other notifications on the screen. Now im not saying to make it exactly like that but just for them to add something to let you know you have a notification at the very bottom
That notifications scroll in the lockscreen brings me TSF and SPB shell vibes.
Is the favorites widget back?
Mine‚Ä¶. boi this is a iPhone 6s I am on lol
"Appreciation post:

Honestly your intros are unbeatable. I have all the latest tech that I can want and I‚Äôm not looking to buy anything in the near future, still I watch your videos because of the amazing content that you and your team put out so kudos to you guys. Been watching you guys for a very very long time and it was fun to watch you guys grow as I grew up. Thanks for everything."
"Yep, same. Been here since 2012 when I was in the market for some new headphones and hardly ever miss a video... Don't buy much tech at all, but Marques is always on point with his thoughts, and it's just been a joy to see him develop into the top dog he is today"
Many ppl are in the same boat. Most videos cross 1M+ mark within first day. I'm sure apple doesn't sell ‚Öì that amount of iPhones. You should watch his interview podcast on some channel where he says this is to differentiate and basically increase/maintain his relevance in the world of tech
You deserve much more likes!!
Literally same. I'm not even in the market for the tech in most these videos... yet I find myself enjoying each video all the same lol
Today‚Äôs beta changes the lock screen music player to full screen.
BRO THAT INTRO!!
Welp. Made me get the beta
Can I turn off the ‚Äúfeature‚Äù that makes the clock unreadable by covering it with part of an image?
Great introüî•üî•üî•
iOS keeps copying jailbreak lmao
Nice man I will make iOS 16.0 for iPhone 5s to iPhone 7 :)
Bro iam your big fan i need google pixle 4a but idont have much money so can u give me my dream phone becoz u have lot of mobile.
Apple should hire you guys for Intro. This is legit better than Apple‚Äôs intro for IOS 16.
Am I the only one who thinks the whole lock screen theming aspect should have been continued with the home screen? It would have made iOS 16 feel whole.
"They will slow down iphone 8 to 13, as always"
"Mk calling desk view dope, I mean why even you need that? When will you use that? Whatever the phone is showing you in your laptop or monitor is actually Infront of you and takes less time to even pick that item rather than opening desk view in you laptop
I found is shamefully useless"
"What a beautiful intro sequence, props to the team"
What a dope intro
Ahh time to get back to IOS in a few months!
When will the public beta come out
4:00 yea i have been using google keyboard on ios (which is a lot worse than android google keyboard) jusg for the haptic feedback
Still trying to figure out how the lock screen thing got one over the continuity camera! ü§®
Dose it supports AOD ?
Brasil üáßüá∑
Sick that you added the XVI booklet cover in the background as an easter egg!
That dust spec
Whoa the intro was supercool !!
"Can you disable the ever annoying camera shortcut on the lockscreen? So often I accidentally swipe when putting the phone in my pocket, and camera turns on to hog battery. Same for music controls that can't currently be locked or disabled on the lockscreen."
That intro should be  illegal. üî•üî•
That intro though üî•
Can't believe I'm going through the downfall of this channel. RIP
"As a android user don't to want to say , most of the things are just a noob"
"I recently switched to an iphone with iOS 15, comming off from android with android 12. And the one thing that irritates me is when i get a message from any of my messaging apps, the screen would turn on. Is there a way to have lockscreen notifications without turning on the screen?"
"I clearly don‚Äôt see all of this working on all devices compatible with iOS 16 even, 
My little iPhone SE 2020 won‚Äôt take all I guess (I do understand, it surly takes a lot to pull all through)"
"The video does not play on this iPhone are you aware of others with the same problem?

Cheers"
MKButbutbutHbutNoD
I love how iphone fans go fanboy apeshit bezerk crazy for the most basic ass features that Android has had for years .
"apple brought android's third party ""phone's camera as a camera for your compputer"" inbuilt. Thats pretty nice touch."
"The intro! Wow! 

Better than what Apple was able to make to showcase that feature üòÖ"
That desk view thing is genius‚Ä¶takes online teaching to a whole new level‚Ä¶.the best tools to explain are pen and paper..anyday‚Ä¶voila you can use them online now
Hopefully you can remove the annoying flashlight shortcut on the homescreen that everyone including me accidentally enables constantly.
I saw a GAY pillow behind Marques
if only u would hype up one ui features like this
INTROüåüüåüüåü
that intro was sick
Amazing intro
Haptic feedback thank GOD!
"no one:
MKBHD: I buy android phones because they have haptic keyboards. furpaderp...."
"Another year, another meh. No update for widgets, no customizable desktops. Boring."
Did the iOS 16 fix the battery issue?
Lovely video
"Whatever android companies does , it never never ever matches the quality and the finshing of the ios , androids feel low quality now at all aspects , videos , speakers, haptics, system ui , lockscreen opnening smoothness and speed , keyboard response , touch response , app support and smoothness for at least 4-5 years,  heck even the screen which is taken from samsung has better refreshrate support AND even sharper with text and icons due to the amazing optimization and support across all iphones ( all have the same ppi) ."
"Still not having solutions like android for direct switching off Wifi, Bluetooth and location services from slide menu ‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs frustrating to go to settings and switch off these services‚Ä¶"
"Now I need an Android ""oh, yeah?"" Update"
If I may add‚Ä¶ FINALLY it has Bulgarian Language (I know it is just me but it was time).
I used to jailbreak my phone's because of how the lock screen looked. Glad to see apple letting you customize that now.
how many android users are watchingüòÇ
2:44 Acura NSX Type S !! My dream car..
I can‚Äôt wait til Apple implements an always on display.
The only thing I needed what the keyboard haptics and they delivered
Sick intro!
Your intro is state of the art. You have a great team. Keep it up
The one best thing about apple is it may be late when it comes to new features if compared to android but apple does things the best
Cool OS update. Just wish I had an iPhone tho ü§£
"Dont you think the customization of the lockscreen is still limited for Iphones?
I dont understand why it is being showcased as some mindblowing feature. You still have to go about what they offer rather than what the user wants.
I'd personally like my clock to be analog rather than digital. Do I have an option to customize that?"
"The other features are like not usable. Better to have
 -always on display 
-split screen 
-floating video calls, at the sametime can open other apps
-and many more needs to improve"
"Not sure why you throw shade at the weather app. I‚Äôll take slow, steady updates with a pretty UI over android‚Äôs literal ADS over everything. Also most weather apps at this level requires payment. This is an amazing free app."
"i'm using an android - oneplus 7pro ... so no sir, my iphone will not change. :D"
Man that intro tho
Never owned an iPhone and yet watched the video till the end!
"That‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôve missed since switching from the pixel to iPhone, customizations! Can‚Äôt wait for this."
Holy cow that intro
"I've been a lifelong Android user but I gotta say, IOS is looking more and more enticing each year. If the iPhone switches to USB Type C I might have to take the plunge and switch."
10:10 can you have multiple timers on like the Apple Watch?
battery warning üò™
Apple paid for that intro lol
Love all of the videos and make it a point to watch the newest ones! Keep up the good work!
"iOS turning to 2016 android , nice"
Marques would the edit and undo a text message work with someone who as an andriod phone
apple should have paid yall for commercials
It's funny how the lock screen is #1 and me using an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor I don't even see my lock screen but iOS is coming out with some cool stuff
i like the feature that allows us to copy an object from photos
The intro was the best I have seen in any of your videos‚Ä¶ Also where did you get the phone mount??? That feature is so cool but the way you portrayed it was even cooler.
Love that intro. With all the customizing iOS is getting its too bad you can‚Äôt separate the icons a more on the Home Screen.
@Samuel Leet  yes i do that every Wednesday
@Agent K You sound like the type of person to scream out that someone is poor if you spot them with anyone that doesn't have the apple logo on it
"@Agent K ? It‚Äôs a cool feature either way, apple should add it"
Android fanboy spotted
"a godamn men, wtf apple . this is iphone 1 tech"
"imagine having these features for years already and apple calling them ""new"""
that intro made me say wow out loud
How is battery performance in 16.0?
2:43 that little lighting effect when the ai selects the object in the picture is just the absolute cherry on top.
"With the new Lock Screen, I've a funny feeling an always on display may be close on the horizon (iPhone 14/15)?"
God this intro.. you're the goat
"I like the using your iphone as your laptop camera.  That's cool and seemingly overdue.  The lock screen stuff?  Ehh, not important to me.  The live objects in photos is super cool too."
shit. Great I downloaded it before I watched this due to a friend saying it was superstable.
How do you control the different camera modes on the iPhone once you are using it as a webcam? Do you have to unmount it? Or can you use the Mac to change to different settings?
Apple is finally getting up to par with androidü§ôüèΩ
Can you set two timers simultaneously on iOS 16?
yeah yeah....where's the damn AOD?
"The iphone is just a pretty phone, its operating system is just üëå. Love the video btw, so clean. Best tech channel on YT no cap"
"I've always had Samsung devices or just android in general due to how much I can customize my phone, but now iPhone is getting more and more customizable every year and is looking appealing to me now. Just got a S22 Ultra and wanna use this for a few years, but Ill probably look into an iPhone when I'm ready to upgrade ü§î"
Marques should design iOS 17
what about battery? it really drains that much or this will be optimized?
As soon as this update happens your old IPhone will start having shorter battery life üòè. This is Apple‚Äôs way of making people upgrade their phones.
More unimpressed than ever. Time to look for another phone‚Ä¶
I feel like apple work on that intro
No update for iphone 7 ?
New features stunning
Quick Question Chief: Does the saved Lockscreen sync across devices?
"Ok, that intro was sick"
XVI on the book üòå easter eggs (16)
Googlish
"Apple: you can now customize your lock screen

android fans: hahahaha we've been doing that for so many years!"
But when???????
Unsending messages are gonna cause a lot of relationship problems lol
"Ok. So Easter eggs on the background, calender, weather and on the bottom 16 in roman numbers. I can't figure out what's in between that"
that intro was dope! greetings from Mexico
Today's video setup is Top Tier.
Can you send a link on where to buy the holder to turn iPhone into webcam?
I might just go dev beta 3 instead of waiting for the public beta
Ability to maintain that lightning charging port is the best.  üôÑ
These Intros are best in industry.
Is there a way to make the time not go behind the wallpaper?
You deserve the like and this comment even just for the first 30seconds of this video. üòÑüòÑ
These intros are getting better and better and we love it üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
IOS 16 public beta on main device. Yay or Nay?
"Yo, the opening is bomb!!! This is what I come for! (Ever since the MacBook 16 inch intro)"
The editing on this video is TOP NOTCH!
"love the into, so nice!"
Me as an Android user need to say that Apple really impress... They actually add stuff that are actually making a difference of user experience.
So the question I have every year (and one I'll probably get a roll of the eyes for): Are homescreen app icons locked yet? It's so annoying when  all my icons reorder themselves when an app is removed. I appreciate I am in the minority of 1 to complain about this all the time but well this is my comment and I'll Karen my way through it if I want to!
"@Doug Nulton i mostly do the same but spotlight is very often trash when running beta so I‚Äôve gotten used to using the App Library in periods, and simply scrolling up is a lot easier than tapping the top of the screen with these bigger devices"
I really don‚Äôt like the app library.. like i have tried to hide some of my apps by just not checking those apps to be hidden but it still show on app library like wtf.. whats the point in hiding it
@Doug Nulton I didn't know that üòÇ why is it not like that by default
"@Conrad Rosgaard today I learned, thanks. Honestly, I never use the App Library to begin with - I usually just swipe down from the Home screen, type in 3 characters into search, and the app shows up instantly. I guess I don‚Äôt find myself forgetting the name of an app very often - the search is good enough that you don‚Äôt need to be exact at all."
@Jami Hamilton Just swipe down on the app screen.  It'll take you to the alphabetical list. I do wish we could group them how we want though
What an intro
"The intro is really dope
üëç"
"I think they shouldn't bring more Android features to the iPhone, their users won't be able to handle it, they will get crazy ü§£. I mean they should wait 3 years to bring something new, it's kind overwhelming now ü§£. Good video as always Marques üëçüèª"
Where is a volume slider on player widget???
Am so excited for iOS 16 looks amazing ü§©ü§©ü§©
"Not going to lie, I thought you took the intro music away and this was the new way of your videos. But boy or boy I was pleasantly surprised! Awesome! üëèüëèüëè"
The intro is sickkkkkkkk üî•
I am waiting for Android response üòÖ
"Okay, before starting the video. I just wanna say wtf is that intro ? It's just insanely awesome ! Loved it."
The click and copy thing is so cool.....Android/Samsung steal it now!!!
Schools be taking online exams using continuity camera
This intro ü§çüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
"Make an ipad one.
Make an ipad one."
"4:26 No it doesn't, that's just a preference. You shouldn't be stating it as a fact, either."
Andorid users : lockscreen? Haven't seen it since last  month
"I personally liked the permanence and accountability of not being able to delete messages in iMessage. It sorta felt like grown ups had iMessage, and everyone else had Snapchat and Instagram, to be able to undo their regrettable messages and whatnot"
And I just bought a S22U ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Hey Marques, can you make a video on fall of Windows phone (and possible rebirth if ever could have happened in today's era) and how good a system it was like way ahead of the competition. especially the best keyboard on any smartphone."
The live objects and desk view are actually so genius
Damn that intro went hard!
I'm not an Apple guy at all but damn that continuity camera feature is amazing! ü§Ø
outdid yourselves again with that intro!
"Your graphical quality makes it unrealistically hard for smaller YouTubers to compete. I demand that you decrease the quality of your videos dramatically! üòÇ Seriously, great development Marques, proud of you! üí™üèª"
Anyone who thinks the ability to unsend/edit messages on imessage is smoking some hard-core shit. I can only imagine how people will abuse this feature
"Never saw much use in the focus modes, but something about the lock screens being synced to each focus mode makes me want to use them all haha"
"So you still canNOT 1) Always On Display; 2) Arrange Icons the way you want it on the home screen; 3) Set Shortcuts to a doc, PDF or OneNote Site.

How the hell, can you work with a handicapped OS like that?"
Intro Wass...just..üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª
The iPhone is now going to be a lot more exciting! iOS 16 is looking amazing! And that 14 Pro Max in Gold!!!üíõüíõüíõ
Lock Screen and wallpapers looking cool üòç
It‚Äôs my main and I love it!!!!
For the first time I can see myself switching to an IPhone.
"I love how Marques manages to sell Apple's software better than Apple themselves, great video!"
THAT INTRO WHAT
That intro man!
This makes me love my android even more. Cant believe how late iOS is with these features
Best youtube intro ever made.
Android > IOS
That new lockscreen is LEGIT!!!!
iOS 16 is great and all but man that intro was on another level
"What kind of people would ever use their phones as a webcam for better quality!!!!!

what if you need to use your phone during a video conference????!!!!! (to use our laptops again...?)

Marques trying to be biased about Apple's iPhones but he doesn't know what actually to highlight!"
I love the little roman numeral 16 in the background
Intro was super crazyy
"I respect to everyone who were involved in this, Seriously the best piece that I' ve ever seen on YouTube, HATS OFF TO WELL ALL ! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!! ü•∞‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫‚ò∫Ô∏è.."
"Unsend and message edit may have legal repercussions for litigation cases. I foresee lawsuits due to this feature. Otherwise, great review and breakdown of the iOS 16 features. "
I think as long as it shows that it was edited it will be fine as well as it only works 15 minutes after
"Do you know if multiple live activities stack? Like let‚Äôs say I have a timer running, I‚Äôm checking the sports stats, and waiting on a Lyft ride at the same time‚Ä¶ @MKBHD"
Samsung better take notes from this cuz holy shit this looks amazing
"One ui has way more ""useful"" features though."
"Haptic is the best feature for me, finally."
marques' nose looks broken in this video did something happen during ultimate frisbee practice?
The Lock Screen is defiantly my favorite feature.
Gosh that intro! Such a high standard
Still no AOD?
Ugh iOS 16 is really making me look into getting an iPhone. The polish is amazing.
For the money we pay‚Ä¶ why would they not just put a high-quality camera IN the laptop rather than McGivering a solution with your phone
The is something about mkbhd that inspires me. I'd definitely be starting my channel in the future. Wish me luck‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏è
looks like an Android redefined...
That intro goes hard
I need the wallpaper at 8:27 ! The website doesn‚Äôt have it for some reason
That intro was crazy good
"I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max but no laptop. That is pretty cool that you're able to use the iPhone camera as the webcam for Apple laptops. 
I like how finally we're getting a lot of quality of life improvements natively through iOS."
Gotta love the Apple quality intros
Yet you still can't set multiple timers on IOS üò°.
"I was ballsy and made it on my main, and haven't had any real problems. Battery is maybe a bit less than it was before, but nothing crazy."
Or a delay sending messages/ double tap to send option. Apple makes ish so complicated
"Apple may take ages to implement new software features, but when they do it‚Äôs 10x better than Android"
"Intro is superb, could be a part of the WWDC presentation of iOS 16 features"
What is that SOS icon in the status bar?
Had to watch that intro twice üòç
Dreamjob sound designer for mkbhdü§Øü§Ø
Apple should hire team MKBHD for their no nonsense ads and intros
lmao im still on an iphone 8s
"That intro was better than Apple's, damn."
NOOOOO im still on the Iphone 7+
I have a question(for MKBHD). Why haven't Android devices/manufactures upgraded widgets? and all these little things? why is Apple so fixated on theses now?
Why are people so obsessed about these ios updates? It's not that much different from what's currently out. Seems mindless to me. Engaging with anything that happens to be new doesn't always equate to better.
Intro is really nice!
Can we go back to putting down the track for the intros? Really want to know their names
It‚Äôs about time that Apple would hire his team to make product videos
that cut out feature is wild
"Coolest intro by far, not even close"
"Intros, Post Production are the best"
"The intro can become a reel soo  easily 
That was soo smooth üëÄ"
Not  for 6s plus üòí
"We see a rubiks cube in a lot of shots, does anyone in the studio know how to solve them?"
The intro was VIBESSSSS üî•üî•üî•
Android will be proud üò∂
How much is the clock and Wi-Fi info customizable though? Cause I have some serious burn in where the Wi-Fi logo and time is
"APPLE: for god‚Äôs sake before the official version is out, PLEASE make low battery notification a BANNER!"
Thanks for those fire wallpapers
"The screen continuity is incredible. Simply, flipping, incredible."
That intro was one of THE best intros I have ever seen on Youtube!
holy crap the intro's these days :0
What will I do I have iPhone 6s Plus üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
the best intro i ever saw
Maybe next year we can customize our home screen like their doing now with the lock screen and be able to put apps wherever we want until then I am not switching to iPhone yet
"ive always prefered ios over android just because i liked the simplicity and cleanliness of it. but the last couple of years. the new features and connectivity made it so superior. stuff like live text, instant image cutouts and especially features like desk view is just something that is so cool and probably wont ever come to android (or at least no in close time)"
great intro
What‚Äôs up with the ugly weird battery widget
"Damn, that was one hell of an intro ü•µ"
"Lol, where can I get the weather app icon on the shelf? 5:17"
what if i tell you the whole lockscreen thing made my ip13 ugly :X !!
"Android users: Mostly don't see lockscreen at all, as it unlocks & goes to homescreen directly."
they could have easily solved that iMessage issue by just adding those features to app instead of os
The webcam will only work on macbook?
That intro was sick!!!!!
3:09 thanks alot marques now i dont have to be that awkward kid who just stares at the whether app when attending a party.
NOTHING can beat Apple products
Still waiting for day in a life video ü•π
Introüî•
I actually updated my xs to iOS 16 and I can say it‚Äôs good but could be much better
The top down view will be great for people who open card packs
8:36 - That DJI lego looks awesome in that shot!
Damn the intro!
I could edit my lock screen on my jailbroken iPod touch 5th generation and my Samsung S6.....
all they did was change the lockscreen. what about home screen icon customization
"Being a UI designer I'm usually very drawn to little cosmetic UI changes when it comes to software updates,
but am I the only one who does not, like at all, care for the clock being covered by an object?
Yes it's a cool(ish) feature, but some people act like it's REVOLUTIONARY,¬†
and I'm like: .....but it's kinda covering up the clock....
personally I'd rather be focusing on other great changes such as the widgets, new notifications etc.
but maybe it's just me I dunno."
Looking forward to iOS 16 on my pacific blue iphone 12 pro maxü•Çüòé
Leave it up to Marques to make the best video for iOS16 a month later than others. These intros are incredible. üî•
Anyone else feel like the lock screen widgets were a way for Apple to not include the battery percentage in the corner on the iPhone 14 pro ‚Ä¶
Intro wtf that's amazing
That intro was nuts
i dont like the unsend functinoality
"Don't mind me, just checking the keyboard heptic"
"reason behind worse webcams is , higher the camera higher will be battery consumption..."
Is the public beta out
ok this intro is fire!!!
so apple finally added what droidcam has been doing for years and years
These Intros are just‚Ä¶ inspiring
"Great video - you covered some great points!¬†

Personally, iOS 16 seems like one of the weakest, least exciting platform updates they've done so far. Honestly disappointed that the coolest feature seems to be that you can *finally* use your iPhone as a webcam more easily, but I don't even know why 99% of users would want that on a Mac compared to like a beginner gaming streamer's PC.

Resolution too low on Zoom? Who cares! Streamer's webcam is bad but they already have an iPhone 13 Pro? Win!

The only way these updates rate highly for me is if Apple does something drastic that makes them suddenly viable as the best ecosystem for all users - not just note-takers and professional emailers - and this comes from a heavy user of an iPhone 13 Pro Max and 14"" M1 Pro MBP. These updates change nothing for me."
"First version which i won't be allowed to use because they (apple) chose that my device (iphone se1) is no longer good enough.
Not everyone wants a phablet. It has been 6 years since they've dropped the last 4 incher - how many more years?
I'll continue using smartphones for app development, but once this phone dies, i'll be switching to a dumb phone, my 21yo nokia 3310 still works (ignoring the battery)."
todays my bday :)
The sheer number of apps that Apple kills with every iOS release‚Ä¶.slaughter
Damn this guy obsessed by the Weather apps...
Apple should implement the continuity Camera with Apple TV. Can be useful for Group FaceTime or SharePlay on TV.
Damn that into transition was so satisfying
I just love IOS‚ù§
üëç
A customised lock screen is a big thing?ü§£ü§£ seriously?
Is that a 13 pro or pro max?
Can you add the link for the Background from the TransAmerica Pyramid building?
That software optimisation to make the clock go in between the background and foreground is insane ..sheesh
Now we just need an always on display and we are in business!
√á√≠ kito
Face ID still does not work on landscape :(
MKB please send me an iPhone even an 11 bro
That intro was fantastic! Looked like something straight out of Apple‚Äôs YouTube channel
At 5:12 what are those black dots? Dirty Lens?
"Ho much hum in your videos, man"
Might be time to switch to iPhone
Ok this iOS is finally an Android in customization! Next iPhone sales will skyrocket
I have been using iPhones since iPhone 4s (by the way - still quite possibly the best looking phone ever made imho) - and every iOS iteration I am blown away by how great it is to still not be able to nest my icons the way I want to :) Peace!
Well u might  blow apart when iPhone finally give some simple basic features every phone has without making  crazy noise about nothing  burger
Is the top down feature available outside of FaceTime?
1st tricks is already available in many massager app like WhatsApp
Bro the edits are insane amazing job bro.
"I always felt negative towards apple for their robot like aesthetic and lack of new exciting things, but this has really changed my mind on it. I think I‚Äôm definitely going to stick with apple if the 14 has USB type C. (I have low expectations that they will, but.. maybe?) ü§ûüèΩü§ûüèΩ"
"Why can't apple just put a good camera in the macbook.
Even a midrange camera sensor would work well
Why do I require to attach an iphone."
What about texting with android
The intro was straight up fire
Still no landscape mode for Home Screen and apps .. specifically YouTube .. sucks we still can‚Äôt scroll videos in landscape mode
I have been watching you since the iPhone 6 was released and that was one of the top 5 coolest intros üî•üî•üî•
Intro is siiick ‚ô•Ô∏è
That intro sequence was UNREAL! üôå
I'm really confused and frustrated on why the YouTube app is still stuck in  Portrait mode on the IPhone
i don‚Äôt like how notifications are at the bottom. too used for them to be located at the top/the bottom of the time
THAT. INTRO.
Wow
"I like the one when you get to do different wallpapers, it will help me be more on top of my things."
Had to pause the video to appreciate the intro!! Sickest one I‚Äôve ever seen in a YT video!!üôåüèΩ
Meanwhile Android phones are pushing ads even on ur lock screen
this is exciting! probably one of the better ios updates recently for the fact that it doesn‚Äôt overcomplicate itself and doesn‚Äôt change too much
The background removal is the only thing that really really amazes me
‚ÄòWe‚Äôve had these features since 1952‚Äô - Android User
Never have tought to say one this: my best feature is going to be haptic keyboard. It's something i'm missing so much since 2019 I switched to iOS.
You can remove background and works for videos
"Top 5 intros, that was some heat for real."
"If you use any other keyboard on iOS you get haptic feedback, nothing new there lol"
"Haptic keyboard is the least interesting thing they could do with the kb as it objectively continues to be less useful than others that have both number rows and special characters via long press. The incoming natural language approach is great for messages, email and the like but in a situation where multi-format passwords are required widely having to transfer between kb versions is beyond stoopid."
You have the best intros of all YouTube game
"Happy with most on the changes made for IOS. But personally i think the next big thing Apple should be working on is to make the iPhones edges rounder again and the phone lighter. It is starting to be a brick. I don't use my iPhone at work because of the weight. I bought a Pixel 5 as a workphone since I don't have any use for anything else that calling, texting and music."
"As an Android user I've never been this tempted to buy an Iphone as my next phone, they really be stepping up their game with all these awesome little features. If compatibility with the rest of my devices wasn't such a pain in the ass, I for sure would try an Iphone."
This might be in the longest hold out between Android converted to an Apple feature. 11 years?
"""24fps is the best frame rate"" lmao üò≠"
The intro! ü§å
The intro was so cool
"After asus OG intro 
This is the best one"
üòû
"""You've been warned."" Felt that one."
What about adding stops to maps? That feature is epic
Intros are just getting better and better!!!! Keep up the good work MKBHD! üí™üèº
Anyone know when iOS 16 Public beta is dropping?
So that desk view is real? Holy shit
Still no multitasking ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
These intros‚Ä¶üî•
That‚Äôs reasonable the best intro ever on your channel Marques!
God what an intro üòçüòçüòç
Weather icon in the background
Just Perfect !!!
Wow! You can customize your lock screens now!!! Incredible! I didn't think Apple could pull it off!
"The amount of verified information you bring is tremendous.. <Bitcoin continues its wild swings between $19-21.5K the market dynamics of the last few days indicate that the whales are making some big transfers of bitcoin from one pocket to another. <Either this is an attitude of speculation in the range or whipping up froth to attract capital from retail investors who may feel that the low point has been passed. <Additionally, the 2022 volume profile is very thin, between $32-$37k if bulls want to send a message to the market that a new uptrend is about to begin, then they will need to push Bitcoin price to a daily close near $44k. <Macro factors are demanding further downside, as the impact of inflation and geopolitical strife is clearly felt on equities markets. Until BTC reclaims the key moving averages these are considered distribution rallies used to sell the rip or add to short positions...But whatever you lose in a macro downtrend, you'll gain multiples back in a macro uptrend. All you have to do is pay attention to the markets when they are ultra bearish. Everyone was super bullish on the markets, but now the markets start to correct, and the fear takes over, as  retail trader at these volatile times I keep profiting regardless using accurate trade signals from Lewis Bryson my portfolio have been on a rise although the rates are capricious wiping out some of my profits i still have about 9.14' btc! worth of crypto assets.<There might be so many investments out there but if profits must be considered, which is actually the sole aim of every Investment then I‚Äôll advice you to go into crypto tradiing because it has higher profit returns. You can reach out to Mr Lewis on <Õ≤eI—î…†…æŒ±m his personal handle is  @Lewisbryson"
"Thanks for sharing your knowledge and his info, I'm going to contact him right way"
"Lewis‚Äôs strategis gave me the assurance that has made me invest without the fear of losing, I got 3 of my friends into his guidance already."
My first signal subscription with him got me 5.6btc with just 0.5btc in a ranging price action which I've never traded before..
"I‚Äôm a novice that made 4.8 btc in my first attempt to trade all thanks to him, he‚Äôs everything y'all need right now"
"Bitcoin is moving crazy this few days but if you are smart then you should know the best thing to do is trade, especially with the right guidance."
"Great video. I don't have iPhone, but I don't hate. I did share so my iPhone buddies can check out the latest Apple stuff."
the intro of your video is insane. that is cool.
Anyone have a lead on an iPhone laptop mount? Can‚Äôt seem to find any like this one on Amazon and that one is in beta.
The top down camera is almost unbelievable and seems magical. Kudos for apple team for nailing this.
This was the smoothest intro I have ever seen holy shit ü•µüò≥
i can tell from my heart that iphones are great phones now
How about put a better webcam in your laptops
Damn! That was a cool intro!
That edit at the start was sick ‚ù§
1:30 I can collectively see all of our girlfriends remaining on iOS 15 until the end of time lmao
"I'm an Android user but the ""Live object"" is really cool!"
Any updates for chaning the default icons?
i‚Äôm getting the public beta so i have it before also that intro was gassss ‚õΩÔ∏è
"My right hand side screen is not working, hoping this update will fix this shit!ü§û"
Looking forward to try the new Lock Screen.
Hahhahah it‚Äôs like Apple are telling us not to unlock our phones!
Coolest intro ever üî•
Can it make a call?
When the new updates are coming?
Dat intro though
That's intro ü•∂üî•
"stop fooling people into believing that they are getting something new
what they are getting for older iphones
1.low volume in speakers 
2.reduced battery backup 
3.slow processing speed"
"LMAO once again ios users happy as hell to have something android has been doing for decades üëçüòÜ
Good for yall enjoy the customization for lock screens üëç"
"Honestly, IOS 16 is the first version of IOS that's convinced me I don't need a jailbreak anymore. I'm still running 14.3 for the jailbreak. Most of my favorite tweaks (features) from jailbreaking are things that IOS 16 is adding. Glad to see Apple adding some useful features this year to IOS."
Free apps? color tweaks? battery charge limiter?
"the desk view feature  just blew me up , I mean it's just unbelievable üòØüî•"
The iPhone lock screen is now officially more customizable than an androids.
This is awesome. Can‚Äôt wait for it. Now if they. Would allow us to put our apps anywhere on a screen instead of dress right dressing them and allow us to add a cover wallpaper to our cubes that hold multiple apps instead of the messy look we have now where you see 9 tiny apps in the cube. It looks too cluttered.
"I really like the new home screen customization, but having the notifications at the bottom will take a while to get used to. Also hope that I‚Äôll be able to see multiple notifications at once instead of just the most recent ones. I‚Äôm sure both can be customized to my liking though."
That intro was crazy. Wtf???
Amazing intro üòç
"Well here is my first haptic keyboard comment, feels really nice to me, will be start using it for sure"
When do we get it!!
Would you recommend getting iOS 16 Beta for an everyday user?
Thedelete messages part was a late like really late. There was tweet saying how many relationships couldve been saved if this feature was available earlier!!!!!
"Oh finally, the ability to edit messages! I've read ""Morbius is one of the movies ever"" so many times recently, people will finally be able to tell us what they meant!"
Bro please teach me the editing.
"Alrighty then, haptic typing. That was the deal breaker for me before, as silly as that sounds. I just think that any touch interface needs it. Sounds aren't good enough, and get annoying quick.
I wonder if the iPhone 14 will still have that hollow feeling/sounding screen?"
Holy shit that intro is insane
Am I the only one who hears that white noise?
Nice Intro
Can we change the volume of alarm finally?
"what sets this channel apart from other tech channels is really the quality of each video. 

-doesnt mean i dont like other channels, just saying this channel stands out on this aspect :)"
"Sick intro, sick video üëå"
When is this update available?
Good updates
That intro was insane
Introoooo üòç
great now my XR is gonna run even slower
I love that iOS is going full Android. üëèüëè
Hey man .. could you please do a LEGO review? Thanks
Anyone see that piece of Lint floating in from screen right into frame 4:36 ‚ÄúMarques you made me the monster that I am ‚ÄºÔ∏è
where does one find a lego DJI phantom?!? 8:37
"new ios means new android fans making screeching noice of how that feature has been on android for years, and also new feature for miui to copy from üòÇ"
"0:44 ""edit and unsend messages"" like in telegram message"
Control center for left hand would be amazing
"Ah yes, I forgot about the ""I've had it for ... months already"" memes üòÇ"
You should do more videos on Samsung One UI and   Samsungs ecosystem.. plz üôèüèø
"When they add always on display, I might actually try out an iphone. This keeps getting looking better and better :)"
I watched the intro for the entire 10 mins of this video
Im really hoping they implenent an always on display feature. Im ready to switch back to apple but no AOD is the deal breaker. ü§ûü§ûü§û
That intro was fire!!!
I installed it on my main very early. Not the first day! It was a gamble because in releases of earlier versions digital ID apps stopped working. But this time forums could verify it working. I have had no problem yet and 16 is pretty much prefered by me. I hope that the home screen comes to iPad OS as well.
"Hello!

i hear something about a new feature ...anti-spy feature called something like ""lockdown mode""

what is it if true?"
"Well, Face ID for photo app would have been nice"
What‚Äôs your wallpaper in the thumbnail? It‚Äôs really sharp!
MKBHD = Perfectionistüî•
That intro transition gah damn
intro was sick damn
"0:13 to 0:24 could be a 10 second Apple ad, greatest intro ever"
That intro was crazy. üî•
5:07 2021*
"Damn that‚Äôs depressing, I have an iPhone 7 lol"
iDroid OS you mean
I must be the only insane person to not give a damn about a stupid lockscreen
üò≠The Edit button I love it
THAT INTRO WAS FIRE
That intro was D0P3!!!
"In the end, Apple just reinvented Windows Phone's Live Tiles :)"
Can we please get a BTS video for this? What an epic intro! Would love to see the efforts gone behind it.
"Did you get early access to iOS 16? Same with Ventura, did you get early access to that?"
"Been jailbroken on ios14 for long while but now apple actually doing some stuff that I‚Äôve wanted, might be time to jump ship"
"The undo messaging and deleting isn't that new, it's good that they added it, however they should have done that a long time ago. Many other apps i.e whatsapp, instagram, etc...those types of apps, already have this feature from a long time. 

But the home screen and camera is a big boost on a personal level. Pretty cool and will make the usage of the phone even more desirable."
"Just like apple, MKBHD is just way ahead in this YouTube game..
i had to watch that sick intro over and over again.. üî• üî•"
what l ve noticed is he edits well apple products than any other productsüòÖüòÖüòÖ
It's the weather app icon on the shelf for me
"The way he drag and drop a crop image into a message almost seemlessly is INSANE, I'm an Android user and this iOS 16 update is the most impressive thing I've seen."
@IAmZeus samsungs do not separate subjects from the background of photos...
@Alex Klein what? lol... no you can't unless it's a 3rd party app I haven't heard of.
"@Rohan Chatterjee if it's an app then it's not exclusive to android, nor is it built into androids system."
@Yagu Tensho you need a paid app to do it. But still possible.
Should I buy an iPhone 13 right now or wait for the new iPhone?
"I do worry about unsending/editing iMessages after a message is sent (especially with such a long window).  Having seen friends deal with abusers, these features can be used to send threatening or abusive messages and then remove said message.  Yes, you can screen cap, but those are easy to fake (and easy to accuse of being fake).  I really hope Apple provides a way for people to recover threatening or abusive messages.

This is much better handled in email programs like Gmail where there is a slight delay before the message is sent, giving the person a moment to unsend if they realize they got a detail wrong, had a bad autocorrect, or regret having hit send.  Obviously, that model doesn't work well in texting, but there has to be some middle ground."
hopefully there'll be a thing that shows the history of messages
"...and banned Dark Sky for all non-Apple devices (not completely yet, but soon;  however 

...{'yawn'} I think I'll stick with Android, it is sooo many years ahead of the iPhone as far as customizability  - you should see the lock-screen on my Pocophone F1 {yes, your recommendation - back then {Aug. 2018} - brought me to this little gem-!!!) - I have a multi-face Analog clock with chic customizable year, day, date 'and' battery percentage, a a lock-screen on which I can place ready-quick apps I need without opening the phone; not to mention ""split-screen"" in portrait 'and' landscape mode [which, yes, I do use, a ""hidden app section"", all the Google Apps (esp. Google Lens - which is a complete 'œâŒørkhorsŒµ' in itself) and, ...well, you know all the goodies Android can provide. Oh, and yes, I did buy my Pocophone F1 for that mere $300, ...and had enough left over to buy my wife an HP laptop and a Samsung phone.    {;~)"
I need feature #4 in android. Google take note please ü•∫
Give me behind the scenes for the intro NOW
I like that on the new Lock Screen you can set it to photo shuffle and have a bunch of pics it can change from.
Live earth aerial view is my favü•∂‚ù§Ô∏è
Android's had these for years
Will we be getting an IPad OS videoü•πü•πü•π
That intro is like an Ad!
"Android may have the features, but Apple makes it look good lol. I'm an Android user too"
So apple anounced IOS16 last month. Marques has been trying it for the last year so
I‚Äôve had it on my main iPhone since day one!
So much talk for a lockscreen customization.. Damm these ppl lick apple ass too much
"Dude, your intros are gold!"
"My dream feature of iOS is capability to see all of your devices battery connected to iCloud. I‚Äôve got few devices and why i cannot see my iPad battery on iPhone widget? That would be awesome feature, hope to see this in next updates."
wow
Man apple needs to start hiring yall to do their ads
The visual effects and transitions are top notch‚Ä¶ but the background hum is distracting me so much :/ what's up with that?
"If only it were open source... That being said, I like the direction apple is going now. Also, nice intro"
"0:31 ""It's not stable enough to make your main just yet."" YOU'RE A FEW WEEKS TOO LATE MY GUY"
I already hear the andriod users typing under this video...
I'm obsessed with that lego dji drone!
customization wasnt an iOS design ethos in the past but its nice that is changing now
the audio was boomy on this video for some reason
"am i the only one able to hear a ""hum""?"
Lock Screen and haptic keyboard are the two things I‚Äôm most excited for. Haptic is extremely overdue! ü•∞
@Mark how does one get the beta ‚Ä¶ü§î any ideas on when release date for update is?
yeah android has always had this stuff and I‚Äôm commenting on an iphone rn lmfao
"Yeah, really enjoying it in the beta so far. I missed it so much after coming from Android. Its so much more satisfying to type now."
"The webcam feature is so cool. I can't update my work MacBook to a beta OS yet, but I'm looking forward to using it this fall. In the mean time I'll mess around with my phone lock screen lol."
The xvi at the background.... represents ios 16 doesn‚Äôt it... nice touch üôÇ
Love the content ü§óüëåüèºüëçüèº
Intro is dope!
I wish that iOS would make widgets ‚Äúsee through‚Äù similar to the ones on Android. It would look super clean
"@Uncrustable no. They‚Äôre not. There‚Äôs not a single android phone that outsells the iPhone world wide. As a whole yes. ALL android manufacturers sell more world wide because India, Africa and China have about half the worlds population and most of them are dirt poor. Look up the best selling phone by year. Samsung, OnePlus and other android manufacturers wish they could sell 100 million phones in a year with all those phones being $800 or more"
@Top Tier Tech go up in the US you mean? because everywhere else it‚Äôs beating apple
@GOTHY 332 Bruh you better work for a Ferrari or porshe/make billions. than electronics that you poop out in 2 years.
"@GOTHY 332 you know there are many android phones more expensive that any top spec iPhones, right?"
"That small little search bar just at the top of the dock on iOS 16, might well break Googles dominance in the US for search."
That Intro Dop !!! üòç‚úåÔ∏è
What. An. Intro.
What mount is that for the iPhone!?
Amazing vid as always. Nice intro to the video
Imessage needs the possibility to rewind or forward the audios.
That intro though üî•üî•üî•
awesome intro!
"what about low-battery alert, is it still as irritating as before?"
That intro üòçsheeeeeshüòç
I can‚Äôt wait for the music live activity to be able to expand and show the album art more
Wow that took a minute.
Live objects seems incredible. That kind of image cropping is really quick and is the kind of thing that 95% of people wouldn't be able to do on their own. The processing effect is really clean. Hats off to their design and development teams on baking in a pretty complex operation into such an intuitive way.
@Chaminda Khaund how would you do it with a telegram bot?
@Granade i use android but i don't give a fck who was first
"@Ofer Fuchs ahhh that‚Äôs probably why, i have an 8+ ü•¥ im too attached to the home button"
@karolina kmita which version iPhone? A lot of these new effects require the A11 Bionic processor or newer.
I like the top down view for remote Yugioh matches üëå
Windows phone did it better as far as lockscreen is concerned
The intro ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
"RIP to some tracking apps, lol."
That intro was the perfect example of why this videos are a complete experience to watch.
"For you kids watching, that XVI in the background is Roman numeral for 16. Dope."
#2 lol ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Good work Apple, only a few years behind Android at this point."
"and still cant turn up or off sound notifications for sms/apps ect , having that notification sound while on call is buzzing"
"Users will finally be able to make their iPhones look ugl... sorry, express themselves."
Just saw the weather icon in the background and had to smile because weather was added to iPad OS and macOS with the new releases.
Gimmicks
"People talks about lock screen customisation, Have you heard anything about always on display?"
Tribune Tower! shout out oakland
ios is becoming like Android day by day
"That intro was dope! When is the ios beta coming out for public? Its been a month already, generally it doesn't take this much amount of time!"
Intro was üî•üî•üî•
Me: Having a iphone 6 that cant even get ios 13
"Wow, with all these new features on the way, 
I'm kinda starting to consider purchasing an iPhone cause my gosh
they look great and I can't wait for its official release

Basically... Apple did it again"
Uhhh iOS16.....eager to see how Apple have caught up with Android this time round
Sad And Happy  I‚Äôm Using IPhone 7 Plus‚Ä¶
10:05 - I'm really not a fan of the tiny music player on lock screen. I like the bigger one.
"Nabro, Nova Launcher's customization is still much better than Apple's üò≠üò≠üò≠"
Intro ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
yeah that intro slaps
jeepers that intro
Always on point and pretty easy to understand. Respect!
Do you think the entry level iPhone price will increase?
Fantastic update
When will we finally get constantly moving backgrounds?? Basically a Live Background without having to touch the screen is all I‚Äòm asking for
#1 Welcome to android of 10 years ago but worse :P
ok but the goddamn intro is just straight FIREEE
My favourite feature is that it's coming to Iphoneüòç
"How do Live Photos interact with the new Lock Screen? I‚Äôm super curious to know, can you even set Live Photos anymore since long pressing now edits the Lock Screen instead of playing them"
"You gotta tip the hat for whoever is in charge of the background behind Marques!

1. Resemblance of widgets on (Calendar, Weather, etc.)
2. Stacked Books for stacked notifications
3. Cut out of the dog emoji for ""Live Objects""
4. This might be a stretch, but the ""Desk View"" of credit cards on the board as well.

I am sure I am missing the other stuff, but the production value of these videos are second to none!"
YOOOOO THAT INTRO THOOOOO
Now in iOS 17 they need to allow for robust Home Screen customization to match what they've done with with the lockscreen.
"@Daka you misspelled ""2007"""
"Couldn‚Äôt agree more, the lock screen looks cool and modern and the home screen is stuck in 2017 üòÇ next year they need to play catchup. Interactive widgets, a theme store where you can apply icon packs to all apps at one time instead of making shortcuts for apps one by one, LANDSCAPE MODE for larger devices on the home screen, I could keep going on ü§£"
Ist this a regular size iPhone or max model you are using in the video?
Bottom Notifications implementation is the best
Quarter mil views in 45mins !!?
"iMessage is the OP of shit town. It's like the IE of Apple. As shitty of a tech as it can ever get. Lol, you need to get a whole new OS upgrade to get that stinky app working ü§£üòÇ"
Go back and watch the intro again after watching the entire video. You will appreciate it even more.
With the pixel 6 being $500 now is $50 price difference worth sacrificing camera and screen and waiting for the 6a?
damn my iphone 6s wont have it then?
@Harvey Whitehouse that sucks but im upgrading soon so its cool
Nope
That intro was incredible! üëèüèº
DAMN BRUH THE INTROüî•üî•ü§Øü§Ø
That intro was üî•
Still no back button/gesture yet?
I wish the continuity camera worked for windows. I‚Äôm not a Mac user. I guess I could do a virtual machine but that‚Äôs an extra step
Hands down that intro is best ‚ù§Ô∏è
I've been on the Android side for awhile now currently using a Samsung Fold 3 as a daily but iOS 16 is making me jealous on the software side!
How the hell Apple still doesn't let us move icons wherever we want on the home screen is just baffling to me. It completely screws over any home screen wallpaper unless the most important parts of the photo are at the bottom of the screen. Just wild how they're okay with that.
"Sorry but covering part of the clock with your photo, even though it might be cool on paper, is a really annoying thing...it's the thing you look at the most on the lock screen, I don't want to have to guess what number it is, I want to see the time fast"
Another great intro
You have some amazing edit skills üòç
#2 is so insane and can be so useful I've no idea how they implemented it. It truly does look like Black magic with the whole capturing a flat surface with a phone mounted on a macbook.
"@Jf42 AR objects are computer generated, and then placed onto surfaces by detecting the surface. 
This is capturing images at the absolute fringe of the camera and making it look great. Those are two completely different technologies wtf are you on about."
"We have AR objects placed in real time on surfaces. This is an easier version of this. Also, you see the distortions on anything not completely flat... It really isn't hard but a great idea"
"@Sudeb Sarkar It's really not that hard. The phone has Lidar so it can easily tell what angle is the surface and then transform plane. You could do that in Photoshop on a single photo. Still useful and impressive if it works well but I just wouldn't call it black magic. Without Lidar it might be harder to get the angle of the surface but I'm not entirely sure if the camera can get distance without Lidar somehow or not, maybe by comparing to the macbook in the frame."
@Jf42 Mercedes uses multiple cameras over the entire car to make that happen. With all the cameras pointing down. This is a single phone using its ultrawide lens at one angle not even pointing at the surface. What apple is doing is completely different and ridiculously impressive.
Dude it's simple maths
Your audio quality in this video is ... not as good as your other videos. I heard ambient buzz sound. Something is wrong?
wow. what an intro! Apple should learn from MKBHD team.
What happened to the large album art on the lockscreen?
THAT INTRO
Can't wait for your nothing review üò∂üôè
They took LIVE WALLPAPER away! üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
iOS 16 is motherfu*Ker OS16 who agree!?
That Desk View was Dope!
You either die a hero or live enough to see yourself become the villain.

That continuity camera showing a top down of your workspace is kind of mind boggling but cool
I wonder would you do the same for Android 13?
"One feature that I used a lot with Android that I miss after switching to iOS is the ability to cancel an alarm ahead of time. 

For example, you set an alarm to go somewhere or to pack your bags or something but you already did that before the alarm rings. On Android, the alarms show up there a few hours earlier (last time I checked) and you can cancel them so that they don't ring that one time (doesn't cancel repeat alarms). It's a silly little thing but I used to use that a lot."
@krajar13 When you set a Bedtime and set the alarm associated with that it does this. I can easily ‚Äúskip for tomorrow‚Äù or tap on the Sleep focus icon on my watch to turn off the alarm in the morning. Many times the watch notices I‚Äôm up early and asks me if I want to turn off the alarm. BTW Sleep focus is pretty awesome: it helps me stay off the phone at night and also keeps the watch dim and quiet.
That's iOS23's feature
"@Hellsing Yeah I would never use any of those things realistically, but they are cool.  Now google camera's erase feature on the Pixel I would use.  This brings me to why I've always disliked Apple since the original iphone.  Still don't like iOS UI.  Everything about Android is simpler to me. I've only used nexus, Pixel, now OnePlus."
"@Jocii That's true. I make use of that all the time as well. But imagine that you can cancel any alarm ahead of time. A notification shows up saying ""An alarm will ring soon. Cancel?"" Something like that. I guess it's more useful for repeated alarms."
So much better than Android. iPhone all the way completely demolished android.
That intro was CLEAN
Cool
One of the DOPEST intros! Kudos to the team! üôåüèº
Clicked the like button as soon as I saw that epic intro!
The amount of views this got in 43 minutes
Dat intro thoo üî•
1:03 lmaooo 30 fps gang less goooo!
Apple give you one more reason to look at your phone
The new Lock Screen tech is SO COOL.
The customization coming to iOS 16 is putting a wrench in one of the biggest arguments towards getting an android in my opinion
These features are 10 years old bro ü§£ü§£ü§£
So the first one won‚Äôt be applicable for drunken texts which need to be deleted the next morning
"Oh I get it, Marques is a time traveler"
What an intro the best till date üî•üî•
Rip to my original 2016 se
Any news about IPhone 14pro max?
"Few years from now, features in smartphone will be so much that we will need to pay for an online course to learn them"
What an intro! üí•üëåüèº
"Da introooooooo!!!!!
Sick!
Sick!!!
SIIIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!ü§©ü§©ü§©üòÜü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øüëå"
I am really interested for the keyboard haptic feature
"""Lockdown"" doesn't make the list?"
"That desktop video on webcam looks dope. 
Yea, the new lock screen too."
"Bruh, I needed that unsend feature last year üòï"
That desk view is crazy
Still needs an always on display though
Unfortunately my Lock Screen is almost always covered by a big media player like YouTube or Apple Music or something. I feel like they could totally make that into a much more compact little bubble than a giant square lol
"""How many times have you watched the intro dissecting everything frame by frame""?
Me: ""yes!"""
iOS 16 smooth like butter üßà iPhone 13P
"Is there ""always on display"" feature for IOS 16 ?"
Nope
Face ID landscape seems to be only working on iPhone 13 right now.
Intro left me speechless!
"Apple fanboys will literally go wild for the most basic shit.

So weird how he overly praises Apple."
That intro was super cool . Loved it
"looks, if im real ugly. Thats why I use samsung now"
I feel like we will get to see a lot of ugly lockscreens in the future.
All the features since iOS 12 you could have did with a jailbroken iOS 10 device... Shit company
That intro was hard!
Need that green Lock Screen üòç
That intro is sickkkk ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
They need to combine the photo cut out Lock Screen with the weather Lock Screen with the weather effects over a photo of your choice. Would be awesome. The Weather one is really cool but it feels like it wastes so much space right now
I‚Äôm looking to get a new set of over the ear headphones I previously had beats 3 does any1 have any suggestions for what I should get appreciate it
@Harvey Whitehouse  thanks
Sony wh-1000xm5
When is the Nothing Phone 1 embargo ? 14th or 12th July ?
I may go back to iOS now
Is any of the features coming to iPadOS 16 ?
"Has anyone observed the easter eggs?
Weather App in the book shelf
Desk has cut out 1 and 5 rings which lay on the desk and 2 rings which stand. Not sure if Marques wants to say that it‚Äôs iOS 15 and half? As it‚Äôs not stable yet. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
That intro was ON POINT! Damn!
These intros definitely get the appreciation they deserve and I‚Äôm here for it üôåüòÜ
I generally don't make comments on videos....but come here to say just watch the intro 3 times
"Oh man‚Ä¶. Super smooth,super quality, that intro and quality videography‚Ä¶. Everything in this video was so satisfying‚Ä¶.. ‚ù§Ô∏è Loved it buddy‚Ä¶ exceptional work"
damn that intro
"Lock Screen ‚Ä¶,"
This new lock screen customisation is going to take up so much of my time to perfect to my liking.
"""They'll still see the crazy terrible message you initially sent"" lmao"
"Damn, just make it USB-C, I'll get the Macbook, iPhone and Apple Watch. Hard to deny Apple anymore, JUST MAKE IT USBC PLZ"
I message is literally like any other chat app it's wild you all still care about it
At this point y'all are just a professional production company
still no button to delete all pages in the background at once?
God level video quality
I watch so many videos on the iPhone 14 knowing very well I won't have for many years...
Was hoping to see something about that new apple auto for cars that's coming. The only thing that's making me consider moving to iPhone
The intro üî•üî•
Best introo üòçüòç
"A huge thanks to all the Jailbreak developers who made the lock screen customisations available years ago on iOS lol. XenHTML, Complications, Weatherboard, April, Jellyfish, Kalm, just to name a few. Apple just ripped a bunch of tweaks like they do every year from the jailbreak community, so people who say jailbreaking is dead have no idea how much influence they've accomplished over the years."
"@gudetography I tried unc0ver today. Unfortunately the A9 chipset is not supported :,)"
"@Westminster Eistee Yeah no idea, Unc0ver has been the most stable of then jailbreaks for me so far. Been using it on my 12 Pro Max and older devices with no problems. Not having to sign it every 7 days would be awesome."
"@gudetography I actually never used unc0ver for jailbreaking. Maybe that's my first time then. I always used greenpois0n, sn0wbreeze, redsn0w and checkra1n for jailbreaking. Not sure tho if the new unc0ver jailbreak will support the A15 bionic chipset fom apple. Current support is A12-A13. Perhabs only the firmware support / signing-period will be changed."
"@Westminster Eistee An uncover permanently signed update is releasing soon, a beta just came out today so there won‚Äôt be a 7 day signing period anymore! But yeah I‚Äôve enjoyed having my iPhone 12 Pro Max jailbroken and having all of these customizations way before iOS 16. My 13 Pro Max is on 15.1 waiting for the next jailbreak lol"
yeah I agree. The first thing I thought of when seeing these apple watch widgets was the complications tweak. I really need to jailbreak my device (iOS 14) again. The reason I stopped jailbreaking is the poor battery life you'll get when installing 100 different tweaks :) And also tethered jailbreaks are annoying. My 3rd gen iPod Touch with greenpois0n still runs like a charm (untethered).
sick intro
I reluctantly love the new Lock Screen
üéß Gonna bring back the headphone jack? ü§îüòâüòÖ‚úåüèº

"i'm 25 seconds in and im already having to pause to come leave a comment... but that intro, was beautifully done, that was Apple keynote level work right there, simply lovely"
I really really hope they fixed the annoying process of switching from speaker to headphones during a call.
Still waiting for the day Apple improves its notifications
crazy intro
"We‚Äôve come along way from just a simple Lock Screen, Jesus"
"30 sec in, already loving it. Sick intro"
"Great intro with all the transitions , loved it üëå"
I have an iPhone X and it‚Äôs action like an iPhone 3
Been waiting for the ability to edit and unsend messages. I never thought this day would come.

That intro legit gave me goosebumps
I am able to imagine that Apple is working on something even cooler : Interacting with live analytics on the lock screen with always on display. Let's see how they surprise us.
Desk view is the sucker punch for me. It‚Äôs going to keep me in the Apple ecosystem for a long LONG time‚Ä¶‚Äù>_>
"Holy Cannoli, that intro is the littest I've seen in a minute. üí™üèΩ‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è"
OverRated Cult.
"Th√© only word I don‚Äôt like in English, Customizations (especially in my phones) üòÇ"
Thanks for the review. Waiting for the public beta.
That Notification stuff is the most relieving üòå
Continuity camera has to be the greatest thing. No longer have to take my Sony ZV-1 with me if I don't want
holy that daft punk ish intro tho ü•µ
"I heard of a new ""Lockdown mode."" It'll be nice to know more about that."
The intro is sick!!!
Ha mwonieeeee
Your Intros Are Straight Up BUSSIN....üî•
"Long time android user and gotta say the last few iOS updates (starting with widgets and coming to this) really make an iPhone increasingly attractive.

Now if the settings for app could just be inside the apps, that would be great."
@Chris Carley facts
"@Uncrustable My point is that, as Apple is adding more and more of the features that Android users care about, the reasons not to switch become more and more obscure. We've seen a huge push over the last few years to eliminate reasons not to switch."
@Chris Carley those aren‚Äôt the reasons why they won‚Äôt switch... my point was that apple and apple users think the only thing androids have is clock customization when in reality there‚Äôs much much more hardware and software freeness wise
"I understand you prefer it that way, but that's the idea and identity behind iOS. It's the software designed to work that particular way. It doesn't have to be according to you. Asking iOS to be like Android and Android to be like iOS is like taking away their individuality. Both of these OSs work differently and these differences give a real choice to the consumer. If the both the choices are very similar, market and compeition won't be fun."
@Uncrustable You laugh but people keep making up more and more silly reasons not to switch... like clock fonts or alarm options or folder designs. They fix the reason why people won't switch and those people think of a more obscure reason.
the wallpaper function will take over and destroy my tiktok for u page for weeks
Marques just made a better ad for ios16 than Apple with that intro
sick intro üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
I hope for homescreen customization in iOS 17 to complement the new lockscreen
Killer intro
2:17 doesn‚Äôt work on iPad with iOS 16?
"@dollars¬° well you really need to start updating your ipad, mine is on ios 15"
my iPad is still on iOS 12.5.5 üò≠
"The worst feature of iOS 16 is it flipping fullscreen landscape video in the opposite direction by default. It's been pissing me off on a daily basis for the whole month I've been using it. 15 years of it flipping one way, and Apple decided to change this for no reason."
That intro looks like it could go straight into an apple ad. You guys are hitting some next level work every video
... imagine  if they added an 'always on display' - they'd be soooo advanced then lol!
"When will you watch Indian movie ""RRR""."
sick intro
Is so shameless in every detail of the video how this chanel is just Apple adverstaiment.
Amazing intro transition in a long time!
Nothing about inline dictation? pretty dope IMO.
"Everyone is prob talking about the intro but for good reason, that was cleannnn"
sick intro!!!
üåé
I see the easter egg in the video XVI at the back on the shelf
MKBHD Intro üî•
It‚Äôll be the iOS 14 craze again.
Can't wait for IOS 17 for full blown home screen customization!
"That into tho, the studio does better transitions than apple."
The introooooooüí•
Can we use iPhone's camera on windows ?
It's ugly how all the western world is now interested in some weird people's sexual preferences. ü§¢
"Lock Screen, that‚Äôs it one word"
Definetly no.1 is Lock screen customisation
"I wish I had that UNSEND MESSAGE feature last week when I sent my wife a message meant for my secret girlfriend.

Too Little, Too Late! üò°"
I absolutely hate haptic typing. Getting turned off immediately
U didn‚Äôt say anything about the dictation???
were is my always on display???? please send apple a email about this...thanks.....waiting your reply.
Maybe you'll have 16 million followers when iOS 16 is released.  Good video!  I think I like the widgets on the lock screen the best.
90% of the things added should've existed years ago lol
Always so helpful Marques.
"Personally, I would LOVE new ringtones. It‚Äôs been years since we‚Äôve had any new sounds for our notifications and idk, maybe it‚Äôs just me but I‚Äôm bored with the ones we have now."
Already a thing for Samsung
Jeeeeeeeeeeeeez that intro oh my
"MKBHD: I'm a fan of the animation where it fades in the foreground before it fades in the background

The iOS developer who created the bug instead of fading them both in at the same time: üëÄ"
"Don‚Äôt update your phones 
It‚Äôll crush it I promise y‚Äôall"
Nothing can beat the company
"Seems like after this many years its finally time to upgrade from my iPhone 7. The fact that it has lasted this long is insane, the only reason I'll be getting another iPhone"
Yo that intro was S tier. Jeez
"This is just my opinion, but I really don't like the ability to unsend and edit messages. It works fine on platforms like Discord, where most of the conversations you have don't carry any weight, but iMessage is the main way most iPhone users communicate with each other. I liked having iMessage as a platform where I could have a conversation with someone and look back on the conversation for important information, but now with iOS 16 people can delete messages and make things said look out of context. I like how you can only make changes within 15 minutes, but that just means I have to wait 15 minutes to make sure what that person said is ACTUALLY what they meant."
There are some earth wallpapers also Right?
Shout out to the motion designer who did the intro! Sick üî•üíØ
Dope intro!
take love from Bangladeshüáßüá©

16 in the background
5:09 you've got dust on your sensor
Well seems like im going to change to iphone when the 14 Comes out.
Those are some shitty fonts for a lockscreen
cameras in cars can switch mode so you look like from above the car (long time ago)... shame on you apple
Touch Bar would have survived if they added haptics
"Not a single thing here (for the most part) hasn't been on an Android for 3+ years and I get so tired of the ""Apple perfected it"" argument like I'm paying $1,200 for an experimental phone lol I've enjoyed many of these customizations already on Android and I have zero complaints and also, what's shown here (for comparable features) doesn't impress me all that much better"
I want that drag and drop background remove feature on my android very badly ü•∫
"I almost never update my iphones cuz im scarred from the past(rip ipad 2 on ios9) but these featute are stuff are pretty tempting, also that intro was so clean"
Shouts to the YZY Stemplayer on the shelf!
good video
"Thank you for the video, Marques. That intro was honestly so clean. Props to you and your team for the always amazing content, inside and out."
XVI in the background üòÖ 16!
That Intro üî•üî•
"Apple is on the right track. Now I wish for customizing the home screen to be easier. For instance: allowing to put the icons anywhere we want, changing the icons and fonts without going through Shortcuts, and making the backgrounds of the widgets to be resized and/or set to semi transparent or transparent."
"Audio seems off on this video. Looking forward to iOS 16, thank you for the walkthrough!"
Apple doing black magicüò≥üò≥
listened with headphones for the first time in ages. Could be my setup but audio wasn't as clean as it normally is. anyone else?

Will Continutiy camera work with VPN turnedon on Mac device?
"Now, I'm just waiting to have the ability to place icons anywhere on the screen to only use the bottom of the screen and have the top of the screen blank. 
Maybe one day"
At this point you‚Äôre just flexing with these amazing intros.
How about worst 5 features?
"As someone who‚Äôs been maining the iOS 16 developer beta since it was announced, I can confirm that you should at least wait until the public beta rolls out (Likely in september) before updating"
Amazing introüë®‚Äçüíª
"Android fanboy here, but this new IOS 16 lock screen looks so neat and classy. I hope we get this kind of look in android sometimes in the future"
"@Mohamad true but sadly not everyone can afford iphones, so we are stuck with Android :("
"Whatever android companies does , it never never ever matches the quality and the finshing of the ios , androids feel low quality now at all aspects , videos , speakers, haptics, system ui , lockscreen opnening smoothness and speed , keyboard response , touch response , app support and smoothness for at least 4-5 years,  heck even the screen which is taken from samsung has better refreshrate support AND even sharper with text and icons due to the amazing optimization and support across all iphones ( all have the same ppi) ."
Apple = üí©
I gotta admit. The low latency is crazy to me. AND the top down. That's some amazing software engineering honestly
Omg those new lock screens üòç
Really good of Apple to be supporting the iPhone 8 still. The microphone on my 8 just stopped working so I just upgraded to a 13. Still have that basic beach live photo wallpaper I've never changed lol
Iphone
Million likes just for that intro üòç
Do you think Iphone will ever work with windows phone link ?
Thanks for reviewing and sharing the main 5 features for the iOS 16 update. I find this iOS system to be a massive improvement for Apple and generally a new way of the the iPhone and iPad software. And yes I totally agree that the introduction is beyond fantastic and awesome
The more they change iOS to be similar to Android the better
still doesn't beat my sammy with the customization or prettiness
"I wish iphone will implement on future updates the numbers on top of the keyboard, at least as an option, i am so tierd to switch from numbers to letters every time i have to tipe a password or something OMFG üò§"
"Don‚Äôt be shy, show us where you got your wallpapers ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è (specifically the thumbnail one)"

Loooove the Lock Screen refresh!
i need those wallpapers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn! Best intro ever!
That sick Intro damn
The book behind has 16 - easter egg
So basically android 10
Thank you for the info! The only thing I want is for Apple to stop nagging me to turn down my volume.  I hope they fix this with 16 because over 130 notifications in three months is too much.
Shared Library in Photos is the killer feature for me. It's so good.
Still no split screen?
That intro though üî•
"I was crossing my fingers the entire time hoping that they finally would have fixed notifications. But sadly not. 
Miss my Android phone so much regarding notifications.

And always on display. 

Also those profiles are useless as long as they are including rather than excluding."
The new lock screen is them trying to make something like Material You but worse
Introüî•üî•üî•
That intro!!!üî•üî• You guys get more creative every videoüëè
You're really like the real techie
They made the lock screen basically an Apple Watch face
Where timestamps
Another reason to have trust issues between spouses
The intro was so dope ..... crazy good
"For me the new lock screen is too much. I struggle a lot with being able to customize things, it stresses me out to no end."
I just learned something new
Man makes cooler stuff than apple
"Is App Library customizable in ios16? 
I‚Äôm badly looking for this feature because some apps are wrongly placed. Still App Library is awesome I don‚Äôt use homescreen at all."
That intro‚Ä¶ apple should use it when the non beta version releases
The only channel where I don't want to skip an intro!
MKBHD shooting straight up free commercials for companies in their intros
"so basically only the new lock screen, the object on top of the time is dope"
Wait a customizable phone‚Ä¶. Blasphemy! üçé üòÇ
The intro is so clean
Intro was dope AF!
That was a sexy intro... üòçüòç
This is cool
These intros man üî•
so no more live wallpaper
Woah that intro came out of no where... that was dope
"A couple weeks ago I was just hanging out with some friend when one of the exclaimed ""Wait Android has widgets I didn't know they copied apple!"" It's funny how things seem to not exist until apple does it. lol"
Start to finish this video was amazing. 10/10
I wish they would add a feature to switch the control center to the top right to the top left
7:28 is that a bug?üòÖ
Yes the beta is very buggy at the moment
How do you join the discord server?
Stemplayer spotted 1:43
If Apple don't use this video intro somewhere in their next WWDC presentation they some DANG FOOLS!
It is kinda insane how iPhone x will be the next iphone to lose software support.
"why iPhone keyboard don't have built-in  ""Clipboard"" yet?"
"I cannot wait for continuity, but two things worry me: how does a MacBook hinge support the heavy phone without tilting backwards, and why would I utilize it over the webcam on the M1 MacBook Pro (which is perfectly good). Now, unless continuity transmits at a bitrate that is far, far higher than the built0in camera, the feature is likely moot for me."
I do watch a lot of videos in safari..
The #2 blew me away. Awesome intros too.
iOS 16 is crazy
That intro itself was worth 1 month of waiting ‚ú®
That intro my guy gosh damn üî•
That intro
"Still don't have the choice to unlock home screen with face id without having to swipe up every fuck** time I use my phone !!

I feel Apple engineers just want to show off cool engineering achievements while forgetting the simple practical things that are still absent for users"
Pretty lame I'm staying on android. Come on apple give me a good reason to switch
that intro was total apple
your production quality NEVER disappoints
That intro was sick.
That intro is awesome

Apple should fix FaceTime calls. There is no way you can‚Äôt mute them without blocking the person especially when it‚Äôs a FaceTime group call.
Hi do the same video for ipados16 plzzz
Correction  about edit and ubsend iMessages to someone who does not use iOS 16. I am here to tell you that it does. I did it several times from my iPhone running iOS 16 beta 2 to a friend who is on iOS 15. It worked on edit and it worked on delete. Obviously only I could do these things but it would reflect the charges on my friends older iOS pihone. Not sure if that is a result of a bug or intended to be that way.
"Short, concise and smart. This was a great video."
iOS 16 copy CYDIA STORE üòÄ
That into is dope. I don‚Äôt generally comment. But that into is worth commenting.
Imagine developing lockscreen feature for a year üíÄüíÄüíÄ
"Been using it for a month as well and it‚Äôs alright. Imo as an everyday person, there wasn‚Äôt much difference from iOS 15. Only thing I really liked was the Lock Screen customization. I also can‚Äôt use the iMessages feature just yet cuz most people don‚Äôt have the beta but I think that could be cool. Other than that it‚Äôs alright nothing crazy but it is still slightly buggy although that makes sense cuz it‚Äôs still a beta."
Intro hard !!!!!!!
When Steve Jobs would be live now you can‚Äòt use the iPhone as a webcam. I mean it‚Äòs a good idea but‚Ä¶ it looks‚Ä¶ just bad
Marques for President!
IOS shit steam
"were is always on display ....still nowhere to be seen,,,,"
The intro was so good that I though it was Apple's official. Great job MKB.
The desk view camera thing is really cool. You don't have to worry about mounting an overhead camera and blocking it with your head when you're trying to film something
"@Rohan Chatterjee Wait if windows is obsolete, what's the alternative? Obviously not MacOS, that's only limited to apple hardware and is pretty restrictive. Linux isn't very widely adopted so that's not it either."
@Jr King it was not
"@Rohan Chatterjee I've got a Macbook Pro and a 'Gaming' PC (Windows) + IPhone.... 

Stop being a fanboy and realise different products have different positives/negatives. There's plenty of software not available on OS that's available on Windows and Vice versa...  Personally I prefer Windows. More often that not I have compatibility issues with OS. Forget about any gaming on OS."
@Hir0alt Oh man that would suck. My school would make us use one called proctorio which would make us show our government photo ID at the webcam first and then have us move our head around so it could set up head tracking. It was super invasive
"@JEDLC That's not how it works lmao 
Android is usually ahead"
Nice intro
Absolute god-tier introüî•üî•
Bro that intro looked like the end of an ad for it
The transition from the intro to the main part is just stunning!
"Most of these upgrades are negligible at best. First of all the texting editing feature is great! if you have an iphone and the textee has an iphone, which 71.2 percent of the world does not. The iphone widgets have been a joke since inception as they are not interactive and are just a step above having a shortcut to your app. Now, how many people are going to go through all the trouble of mounting their iphone on their laptop and yet again this only works if you have an Apple laptop, which 76.4 percent of the world does not. This is why I'm not an Apple fan. They tease you with features that are almost are nice to have but really are just gimmicks to attempt to do what androids having been doing much better for about a decade."
what about webm support
Next level intros by MKBHD
"It's really cool how Apple adds a new feature that android already has but,
whenever they add a new feature, they make sure it's all PERFECT!"
Nice intro!
At this point the only thing holding me back from getting an iPhone is the damn lightning port
i like how apple doesntt think about changing youtube in landscape mode when ur not watching a video
I am so excited for iOS 16
This studio and everything inside is perfect matching but this creepy little power outlet behind your right elbow kills me hard. Why the hell? Please make it straight. It's so crooked üò´
The fact that you cannot add live wallpapers as live wallpapers bothers me enough to uninstall beta 3
"I'm not an iPhone user but that (#4) ""live objects"" feature is damnnn impressive. Wow."
Why do MKB videos always have white noise‚Ä¶is it just me?
"Never used an iphone before, so none of this of any use to me, so why am I watching?... its MKBHD!"
"WOW WIDGETS OMG!!! IVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE IN MY LIFE!!! HOW REVOLUTIONARY!!! such an amazing job apple your so ahead of the game, oh and i did i mention haptic keyboard ü§™ its like were living in the future!!!! such a great job üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°"
Intro at the peak of Everest.
"My device only has had ""DND"" and ""Sleep"" Focus modes and I've never understood why I'd ever need any more.
Am I the only one?"
PLEASE ... I need you to explain this black magic of how you can get a top down camera view from a 90 degrees camera. Apple is catching up or even surpassing android at this stage.
"Such a shame, you of all the people still keepn quiet about that ugly notch apple is so generously giving you."
Fact :- 80% of viewers are watching this video on Android üòÅ

Yo that Goku phone tho!
"My Fav future is lockscreen wallpaper change and widget added in the lock screen.
Also I am happy to see the notifications shades from the bottom.
What about iPhone 14 Always on Display future will be available or not ü§î
Always to open the lockscreen on battery üîã consumption and i really don't how apple will be managed by the backup of battery."
"What's wrong with 24fps, Marques?"
Holy shit. That Intro was absolute fire. üî•
Hey MKBHD.! When I'm going to receive an I Phone 13 pro max from you?üòá

I had no idea they were adding haptic keyboard. that'll be fun
LOVED the intro ! <3

Anyone else noticed XVI  on the book in the shelf? Great easter egg üëç
Perfect review
Why have you removed timestamps?
MKBHD's intros are reaching another level man!!!!
The Intro Is INSANE üíØ
Seems like the MKBHD studio has kidnapped the guy at apple who does the animations for the events xD
Welcome to 2015 telegram I massage users
Imagine the most anticipated thing in a new generation of the operating system is a customizable lockscreen... I'd consider it icing on a cake but definitely not something to put on #1.
"@Filbao That's nothing they have not done before, or they act like they were the ones who came up with the idea first."
@Commodorefan64 yap andcall it innovation
@Commodorefan64 exactly
"I'm not a fanboy of Android, as I honestly could live with a KaiOS flip phone if I had too, but it seems to me that most iOS users are so starved for features that have been standards for a long time elsewhere, that they will latch on to anything they can get."
The only thing I want to do to my Lock Screen is get rid of the camera and flashlight widgets. Wish they could change that
Dope intro.....a different level it isüò±
Top 5 down to Top 2 were crazy new features and you put the god damn homescreen on first place?? *visual confusion*
"True aaaaaaaaaaaand... Yeah, that's pretty true. That's true and- yeah that's true. That's true. That's true- That's pretty true. That's pretty true, I mean-... That's true. Yeah. That's true. Uhm- That's true. That's fuckin' true. Uhm... That's how it is dude"
"What happens if a stranger picks up your phone, can they access the widgets?"
Finally new video layout
He gives so much unwanted attention to apple.not talking about this video.generally speaking..u need to be less biased.talking about the interview with mrwhoswtheboss
lol apple fanboys will still think this update is insane
No intro just like Mrwhosetheboss
"120k Views in 26mins, Nice."
I like how the book on the shelf in the background says (XVI) on it! nice attention to detail üíØ
That introoooow brooooooo
Nice intro!
Dude the introüòÆ
"Didn't mention anything about Apple CarPlay which is interesting. To me, that is my most highly anticipated feature. Guess that wasn't available for the beta testing...But it is weird that he didn't even mention it at all."
Whoa dope intro marques
"I really appreciate that they changed the lock screen, iOS was lacking in that front.
It also makes notifications a bit easier to digest.

I feel like the lock screen customization is the first customization feature that Apple introduced that isn't inspired by Android. Good for them!

What still is very much an Android feature that I feel should have been mentioned is the live activities. I've enjoyed this feature for many years on Android and just can't go without it."
@Uncrustable The lockscreen customisation isn't default in Android and I don't know if there's an app that can recreate this effect to the same degree. But I suppose you're right in the sense that you've always been able to customize the lock screen on android.
mostly everything in this video was copied from android fym?
"iOS is the only thing that makes me miss iPhone when I switch to Android. But lately,  I haven't missed it at all since I bought Fold 3. Foldables are the future."
i don't remember MKBHD doing an android features video for Android 12. wonder why.
Yessir I‚Äôm bouta send some real bolds texts
"I don't understand why apple is so slow, idk y people prefer iOS over Android ...it's a no brainer at this point"
This intooo!!! Keep up the work Marques! This next version looks like it'll be sick!
"‡¥Æ‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥æ‡¥®‡µá ‚ô•Ô∏è,"
Just gotta stand up on the proverbial soap box and declare the production level of your videos is superb. *waddles down off my soapbox and falls like grape stomping lady*
Getting error while playing
"god the studio is so cool, love the lock screen intro"
Thanks. Great video as always!
now we can edit risky textsüòÇ
The iphone screen is insane nowadaysü§Ø
That intro was so smooth and I'm looking forward to these new features especially using the iPhone as a webcam.
ios 16 is now more like miuios
Any major changes to the music app?
nothing major just small features sadly ): like you can follow your favorite artists now
Hope ur channel will grow more.u r my idol i hope mine will also grow like urs
lol my nokia 5233 back in 2010 had haptic feed back :P
"Widgets and all are cool, but iphone camera working as a webcam on your laptop?? Thats the real deal when we really think about it. Period"
That intro was fire!!!
The limited edition Realme phones tho üî•
I realized you sound like Ben Wyatt from Parks and Rec
I LOVE Apple products and IOS.
Why does he film everything in 30 fps?
Good! Now let's hope our poor man's android comes up with similar features
THAT INTRO! <3
To install or not to install‚Ä¶
"I've been a diehard Android guy since the Galaxy S1, if only side loading apps like YouTube vanced (RIP) would be easy and wouldn't require you to basically jailbreak your phone, I would switch in a heartbeat. IOS is getting better and better. 

Still: even a 400‚Ç¨ android phone with a proper G-Cam port absolutely SMOKES iPhones in the picture department, there isn't even competition."
"when iphones get type-c, its over, the software was already pretty cool and ios 16 made it better, just add type-c and a headphone jack again and it would be the ultimate phone"
Finally IOS users will enjoy what a phone should do. **Laughing in Android**
All you Apple fan boys. Enjoy
I just want Android to have a break and make things work clean first.
People acting like he doesn't big up android 12 he made a video about it he likes both software
I had to pause the video. THAT INTRO THO
"The edit and unsend messages features is immensely sketchy. Not because it's not useful, but because of the way narratives can be instantly changed. The amount of information that can be sent and words that can be typed in a 15 minute conversation is rather large. 

Someone erasing or editing all that can really become a problem later. Hopefully, it's still accessible to authorities or as a special request."
Awesome intro
"Really good review and overall video, as always. I am wondering though: as an owner of a 2nd gen iPhone SE (2020), how well will this run on older iphones? Will the new features (such as the live update notifications) drain my battery quickly?"
@the doctor same performance. All my banking apps work fine now (didn't on day 1). TikTok crashes regularly tho
"@Ahmed Hosny That makes sense, thanks!"
"@the doctor Currently slightly worse than ios 15 on your device.

But this will improve as more betas get released"
"@Jack T That's really helpful, thanks! But to clarify, when you say the beta version is running decent, is it about the same performance, or a little better/worse?"
Runs decent on the Beta (odd crashes every couple of days) so I‚Äôd imagine it might be even smoother come release
To the person reading this... I hope you get what you deserve!! We all know what you've done
"Still can‚Äôt have gif wallpapers, why is apple so slow with literally everything."
am I only one who doesn‚Äôt like that you can change the Lock Screen from the Lock Screen?ü§£
That intro was from feature tho üòçüî•
So sad watching this on a 6 year android someone help me
These starter transitions are getting unreal
What an intro! üî•
"1:00 marques my man... you have reignited a literal war by typing those two sentences






(24 fps gang)"
"congratulations on being basic, iPhone users."
That intro tho üî•
Always with cool n amazing intro
"Amazing intro. Well, this ""major"" update to me is a bit underwhelming.

5. Unsend/delete:- amazing feature. Every messaging service should have it. Still waiting for an unified messaging experience

4. Live objects:- why??? This has got to be the niche-iest feature ever on the smartphone. Might be good to quickly print out ""missing"" posters

3. Little things:- should have been there from the start. About time apple.

2. Continuity camera:- truly amazing. However, i do not like this approach as it gives the company not to strive to make great webcams anymore and just make us get an iphone, further trapping us in the ecosystem

1. Lockscreen:- simply put, still inferior to android. The one advantage is that we can make profiles to switch between them. Im not sure but i think android's nova lanuncher or something also lets you do that.

My personal favourite:- live widget for the lockscreen for apps like uber, sports etc. Its so damn useful and im excited to have it"
cries in iphone 7
That intro üî•
iOS 16 Is a lock screen and wallpaper update  trash
That intro is fire my guyüî•üî•
Just like always... CLASSY üî•üî•üî•
"Thx, no news on iPhone?"
as an android user... live things!! please come to our robot system :D
Props to the intro maker üôåüèæ
Intro was a banger üî•
Why there's no place for Lockdown feature? I think it's the most sensible change...
The Intro feels like an amazing advertisement üëè
is it me or is the audio not up to the high quality spec we are used to expect from mkbhd?
@Marques Brownlee Is it safe to download iPados beta on iPad mini five?
The transitions are so fukin smooth
The intro was super sick
3:30 only for the new iPhones like 13 or older iPhones like 11 ??
iOS 16
welcome to another year of copied shit from android
"Are the Lock Screen background pictures taken directly from the built in wallpapers in the new iOS, or is that a 3rd party app? Are we finally getting good Apple wallpapers?"
"Btw Marques, they made the iMessage delete feature work for people with iOS 15 and under.  I can‚Äôt remember entirely how it works but it does something.  I think it has a different animation."
"I don't get the new updating notifications
Wasn't that possible before? I mean when I edited a message on TG, the receiving iPhone also changed the notification, not just the Android phones, so I always thought that iOS could already do that tooü§î"
Does it have always on display ?üôÇ
"Waiting for Public Beta to come out, hope really soon... so I can test those!!!"
Not loving the echo but that intro was so good I had to leave a comment. WOW!
whew can I get all of those wallpapers?
bro the nicest intro ever
A whole new level of drunk texting *activated* üëç
Feels like iOS 16 is supposed to make the IPhone UI more similar to the Apple Watch UI. Which is really nice because the Apple Watch UI is amazing.
"Props to the editors, making original and solid intros is hard to do.
It feels to me like Apple has built a solid enough structure, good user experience (good feel) that they have a pretty solid base of loyal customers.
So now they can try out different features and adding more stuff without hurting their solidity.
They're know as THE premium brand for smartphones  (in the population) so even if they kind of kill some of their simplicity by adding more complex features, they're probably still going to win overall.
Idk if that made sense if not i'll try explaining it more."
"Mehn, the intro!!üî•"
"Haptic feedback on the keyboard is looong overdue. I have always used it in Android and after switching to the iPhone, I had to download Gboard just to get those sweet sweet vibrations. So glad it's being added natively!"
"i watched 10+ videos on iOS 16, and i still had to watch MKBHD‚Äôs version, it‚Äôs the production value in his videos that are always incredible to me*"
Great video! Excited to see your in-depth review of the new MacBook air when you get one!
Anyone know when the public beta is supposed to drop?
I can‚Äôt wait for updated .
"I know it sounds silly, but I love that the Weather app keeps getting better and better. Dark Sky was by far the best app for weather, but I really hated using third party apps that sucked, or paying yearly subscriptions for good ones such as Carrot Weather."
"@DreadPirate Flappy but does Android have a default weather app that‚Äôs doing this? Not a Samsung app, but made by Google that‚Äôs part of the default apps list?"
the fact you're excited about something that Android has had forever just makes me realise how far behind Apple really is with some things.
Imma make a good use out of weather app when i walk by a group of girls
I know. It took WAY too long for iPadOS to get a weather app.
"That intro is Dope, üí•, music also"
holy shit that introü•µü•µ
That intro is unreal!
The unsend feature I had on iOS 7 with a jailbreak tweak
That intro! That intro! I won‚Äôt say much.
I think you should open an academy just to teach how to make those kind of intros
I don‚Äôt usually comment but that into was CLEAN
0:33 too late  üò¢
Now we just have to wait for always on display :(
That intro was dope oh my days
"ios 16 is amazing and cool, the background removal is sick"
iOS is getting pretty good
Sheeeshhh that intro
We need a The Studio video about the BTS of this intro
I dont get it‚Ä¶ Apple changed so much on the homescreen BUT one of the most Needed feature would be to change the f* icons on the bottom‚Ä¶ like who needs the Camera when you can swipe right‚Ä¶ thats just stupid
I hate apple
That intro!
Your videos are like an aesthetic candy shop of amazing shots üíØ
Using an app called Iriun webcam that lets me do it for a long time now for my pc and still will cuz I got iPhone 7 and well I can‚Äôt update now can I
Best intro yet goddamn
Amazing
droidcam anyone? why do people ignore these things until apple announces them as if they were the first one to think about it
First time i see a really cool feature that isn't copied from android. Good Job apple
"As an android user, this is amazing
Almost looks like a custom rom!"
@Ved Aryan looks like a custom rom made for iOS/iPhone or something
Definitely not near as much options as a good custom rom but they have implemented every feature very nicely
But does the Lock Screen show you what time your alarm is set to???
Great Intro!
That intro was fire! üî•üî•üî•
When will they allow to change custom ringtones?
How did you manage to install this version of ios? My phone tells me that I'm updated when I'm in ios 15 üòï
At this point they‚Äôre just giving us the things we‚Äôve been asking for for years because they‚Äôve no new ideas themselves yet
Love the new iOS 16! üòä It would be really nice if you could draw boundaries within Apple Notes app for each Focus enabled as well. Thanks for the great video!
"I haven't own an Iphone since 2015 but I watch MKB videos. I'm amazed that Apple has came to the ""gimmicky"" world. Those are major improvements. It's been along time coming for the Apple folk. Welcome to Samsung world.üëç"
"@Nitesh Maharaj - I'll ck it out, maybe ur right."
"@Ï°∞ÏßÄ ÏóòÎ¶¨Ïóá Sure, all apps have a back button when you're in a navigation stack, but it's a at the top of the screen, which isn't great for reachability with one hand. However, when I one hand my phone, my thumb hovers near the center of the screen, so it's simpler to actually swipe from the left edge than it is to reach the bottom with my thumb. To each their own."
@Nitesh Maharaj - I don't like gestures. Swiping takes a lot more effort lol than a simple universal back button.
"@Ï°∞ÏßÄ ÏóòÎ¶¨Ïóá LOL why do you need a back button, when you just swipe back?"
My friend with an iPhone tells me there's no back button ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I'm keeping my Note 20.
Queue the Bts of that super fire intro on studio channel üôå
"iOS 16 vs Android 12, which one has more feature?"
Ang ganda naman
It took me entirely too long to connect that the intro was foreshadowing the #1 feature. Well done.
The intro though üî•
my mom uses the search tool all the time because her home screen is a mess. so this feature will be very helpful to her and me lol.
Apple could probably use that intro for their promos. Top notch.
That intro went CRAZY!
I have to get myself a new iPhone since mine is the iPhone 7
i know everyone's getting excited about lockscreen customization but ideally i would want 1) homescreen customisation options and 2) would have loved to have the swipe gesture from any side of the edge to go back.
Holy shite that intro!!!!!!!!!!
Am I the only one hearing the AC background noise :(?
Damn you forgot the swipe to Home Screen and the wallpaper from Lock Screen interact with each other
"""Your Precious Lock Screen"""
They will see the edit
WOW that intro!
Showing off with that intro I see ....
That. intro. wow.
Love the new Lock Screen feature I‚Äôm not sure if you will see this or not but I‚Äôm going into sophomore year and wanting to create a ultimate frisbee club/ league for my school knowing you play professionally do you have any advice or standards for creating this league love the content üôÇ
WOW the intro. I actually said wow. Someone needs to pay them more than whatever they‚Äôre already getting paid.
It's insane how iOS' lock screen is now much more customizable than almost any Android lock screen. Really flips the script eh
Brooooo that intro is litüî• üî•
damn that's really cool i hope android 3rd party make something like this
That's apple saying - it's a launcher but not a launcherü´£ü´£ü´£ü´£
I had almost everything (not desk view & its amazing ) with jailbreak years back and apple keeps getting older tweaks to their new updates ü•π good old days with jailbreaking ‚ù§Ô∏èü´∂
"""24 fps is the worst frame rate""

Marques woke up and chose violence."
still sticking on 14 w a jailbreak cause there‚Äôs still so much basic customization shit they‚Äôre still a decade behind android on
"I‚Äôm in love with the intro, wish every YouTubers are this straightforward"
Is it coming on iPad as well
The editing is 10000000% amazing
didnt iphone 7 have haptic keyboard
"Do anyone use the App Library? Never used it, same for Spotlight."
"Dang, that lock screen transition was smooth. I‚Äôm not surprised at all. Production quality is mint as always üëè"
"Lol, is that a coronavirus shirt"
How long before Twitter follows suit with the ability to edit?
Awesome to see my iPhone friends finally getting cool stuff I've had on Android for a long time.
"They have a long way to the full customisation experience 
Also a feature they will never get dowloading apps from the web"
The ability to grab a subject from a photo and remove the background almost wants me to switch to iOS. But I'm gonna wait out a little longer to see if android catches up
‚ÄúIt seems like black magic‚Äù ü§®
Haptic keyboard is my favorite feature
Just awesome üòä
Bro the intros are fire!!!!
"Still no ""Always On"" option?"
this new android version seems really good tho!
Can you link the wallpapers that had been used for the intro?
BEST. INTROS. ON. YOUTUBE!!!!
I'm oddly excited for the haptic keyboard!
that intro thoooo
That intro is legit batter than apple's keynotes.üíØ

Great work"

"Once again, despite being later than android, only Apple actually does it right."
They changed the things we didnt ask for
the intro was dope
Still using redmi note 7 pro. Can't afford may you send me one of those as a giveaway üòú

So what do I do now if I want to have iPhone's camera quality on my MacBook but also using my iPhone?
"Weather app in background!!!
Attention to detail üôåüôå"
Why did it take apple üçé sooo long to implement haptics in keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è???
"WHAT. A. INTRO.

I was missing a lot of those .."
The intro üí•üí• you have an amazing team
Thank you!
The pillow has gays on it?üòëüñï
Crazy intro
Is there switch controller support
This guys editing is better than a Netflix documentary
When is apple going to invent always on display?
"commenting right after the intro like everyone else, BY GAWD THAT WAS CLEAN"
Well it have an always on display like every other phone in the world
"Marques and his team always outdoing their past work

While hyping up the new IOS update üòç"
Can't wait for this! Amazing video man!
cheating just became more advanced
If you're on PC and wanted Continuity Camera... you can use Elgato's Epocam.  I've been using my iphone as a webcam for a year now.
brooo the intro looked so sick like better production than apple
Why did it take apple üçé sooo long to implement haptics in keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è???
RIP my Iphone 7+
00:15 üëç
We‚Äôll see ugly as lockscreens out there
"I was skeptical about the desk view feature, good to see it may actually be useful"
"I can see it being used in conjunction with a face facing camera, as they demoed at wwdc."
Yeah its going to be great for whiteboarding at work
Intro is sick!!
I wish android would get on board with quality of life features like iOS does. Android is so concerned with siphoning data they aren't even concerned with software features anymore. I'm still a huge android fan but they definitely are letting iOS running away with the race these days.
That transition is insane
One thing that I‚Äôm missing from android is the ability to change the volume separately of the alarms / ringtones / notifications. Seem something basic to implement ü§î
"You can in fact change the volume of ringtone or music, but you can‚Äôt separate alarm and ringtones, and that‚Äôs the issues for me. The sound management is far way better on android. I‚Äôm just saying that Apple can do better!"
"Yeah, that's already a thing. If you haven't figured out your Android, then you haven't been really looking into everything."
That‚Äôs already implemented and has been for some time. Just turn off the option to tie your alarms to regular volume in sound settings
"yeah, something so stupid....... but i think Apple is finally listening to users or they are running out of ideas. In any case, all the new features are welcome."
Now add all that lock screen customizable thing to the normal home screen üò°üò° no reason to take this long.
If you look at the Shelf you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúXVI‚Äù which is just 16 for iOS 16. Crazy detail
That intro transition was super cool üëå
R.i.p. live wallpapers
I'll stick with 15.4 for now. üòÖ ü§£ üëé üëä
Intro was dope!
Okay apple give me usb-c and I'll switch.
That Live notifications might actually solve my problem with my Ipad..... I hate getting notified for every single email on my Outlook app so I need to put my Ipad always on Do Not Disturb mode
Changing for the better alwaysüòÖ
that intro kudos to Brandon
Best intro on YouTube the transition and animation brilliant üëåüèæ. Ok the live object is sick the photo masking is nuts Adobe Photoshop and Affinity Designer should take notes. I hate manual masking!!
That intro go HARD!!!!
It‚Äôs great ios
that intro was cleannnnn
intro is so cool. ü§©
That‚Äôs intro was dopeeeeee
"Lol apple was like you want a good webcam spend $1,200 on a phone and put it on top of the screen"
Literally the üêê of intros üî•
I barely spend time on my Lockscreen and if I do it's to read notifications. Why tf would I want to look so much at the wallpaper? Doesn't make any sense to me.
finally iOS keeping up with Android
Now that apple allows to set a different wallpaper together with a different focus mode I will have one for each of my girlfriends combined with a focus mode that blocks all calls and messages from the others. Thanks Tim!
And then they long press on your lock screen by mistake and you‚Äôre done :)
"Great updates from Apple. I like the direction the iPhone is going and, as a current Android user, it would be my current top choice were I to get a new phone. The customization is getting better and better, the new features are (mostly) actually new, and they still seem as seamless as ever. Very intriguing."
"Yea you'd be ""imprisoned"""
"I switched to ios after using android for 9 years üòÖ using a iPhone 13 pro max since last year december, amazing 120hz so smooth especially with iOS software and hardware. I'm definitely sticking with iphone as long as they keep supporting there old phns unlike samsung."
"Meh...some great feature (late), but mostly stupid..."
is Android... dead?
It's wasn't good enough üòù
Public beta is out!
Cool
can you give me your iphone
I really don‚Äôt get why people in the US use regular messages.. the only reason I use the iMessage app is to get notifications for mail ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here we all use WhatsApp.

"I'm an android user, & such video should be non of my interest, BUT maaaan, your videos are just so freaking brilliant! They're just so addicting to watch!"
The lockscreen upgrde was sooo much needed!!!
The intro is üî•
Can‚Äôt Wait!
THAT INTRO WAS SICKKKKK!!! PROPS TO U AND THE TEAM ü§©ü•≥
"Marques we need that Macbook Air M2 review ASAP, mine is en route! Hopefully made the right decision! Looking forward to your review!"
i was waiting for carplay updates but i guess it wasn‚Äôt that interesting to talk about üòû
This is prob my faviorite IOS update till date but for some reason it is making the iphone seem less apple-ish.
Not yet good enough to use it on your main phone while using it as a main phone and Ventura on the Mac ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤
"The thing I don‚Äôt like about most of these iOS updates is that if you have an iPhone X per se, you don‚Äôt get the same SOFTWARE features as other newer iPhones with very similar hardware. It‚Äôs software, not hardware, you can support it on the old phones. I remember jailbreaking my phone gave me almost the same software features as the newest phone that was out at the time. I believe it was the 11 pro, but god was that cool. I highly doubt the iPhone X will get landscape FaceID, or photo masking (or whatever you call it). We can‚Äôt even select text in iOS 15 on the iPhone X which makes it annoying, but apple wants you to buy a new iPhone even though most of the changes are software based."
@Jonathan Hoffman it‚Äôs software. I‚Äôm using the iPhone X as an example because I own that.
"No, it‚Äôs because the iPhone X‚Äôs chip isn‚Äôt powerful enough. The XS isn‚Äôt new either and it can use pretty much all the features of iOS 16, only a few require a 12 or newer. If this was really apple‚Äôs plan they would restrict every new feature to the latest model"
iOS 16 launching with the 16th iPhone ain‚Äôt it
A1 intro!!! üî•üî•üî•
"Never thought I'd say this, but I am so jealous with this iOS update !
Google & Samsung,  the fuck you're doing up there"
They already are sooo customizable what the fuck do you want more on android
Hail intro king ü§¥!!
See the post on twitter
"Basically I was the first to watch 

But I wanted to finish the video before commenting"
The XVI on a book is referring iOS 16 isn't it
"Question: Will this update have ads, if so, I will not update my phone from here? If not , I will update it. I like the lockdown mode for privacy"
Shame on Apple still no always on display.
"Amazing intro, but the HVAC sound is a bit annoying."
"Cant wait for this update to hit, gonna make me feel like i have a new iphone"
Dude that intro!!
Apple love ‚ù§Ô∏è
cant wait for your nothing phone 1 review
Noice
I‚Äôm impatiently waiting for the iOS 16 public beta

love the fvcking intro
w update honestly
I guess my parents iphone 6 and iphone 7 finally need to be upgraded lol. Im so glad apple has been keeping their phones up to date all these years.
The into is fantastic man!
"Make more videos on iPad, iPadOS and  iPad apps"
But iPhone has Nothing to worry about ?!
Why every time you do n3 with your fingers all I think is that scene in inglorious bastards?
That intro üî•
Every day iOS becomes more and more like android
American youtubers used to call these features gimmicks .....that why a lot of  ppl don't like Americans ..
Wallpapers?
Always On Display feature please ü•∫ü•∫
Your team is on fire üî• the intro is fab
"27 secs in the video and I want to talk about that intro 
Just Dope!!"
Can someone tell me why the iPhone doesn't have a split keyboard feature? Imagine having a split keyboard in the notepad app and how much nicer it is to type when in landscape mode.
That intro made me feel things
What a frikkin Intro! Animation Guys out there üôå
I use gboard and I've enjoyed haptic keyboard for a bit :)
Marques I am subscribed please give me an iPhone
That intro was cleeaaannn!! <3
Apple need to learn from mkbhd to make intros
Sick intro üî•
Bro that intro was fire
1:00 so offensive
That intro was insaneüòç
What an intro bro! üí•
The book in background says XVI i.e 16..
"I personally hate most of the stuff they did to the Lockscreen.
- No dark and light mode anymore
- the gesture to open the menu is way to ""easy"" for accidental opening it
- notifications are way less visible 
- the music widget no longer has a volume slider to quickly see the volume
- the clock is just comically gigantic (at least the brought back a thinner font)
- they removed all device specific wallpapers

It's just like a dozen downgrades just so the wallpaper is more visible...
The focus of the Lockscreen HAS to be notifications - not the damn wallpaper. This is just so stupid. Who on earth wants to have a better view of the wallpaper you see 20.000 times a day while making notifications way less visible. It's just terrible."
"Its insane how bad the notification is handled and how little customization there is on Iphone still, after all these years, lol"
finally
"Editing without a history is a terrible idea, in general."
that intro hits
"Editing and unsending a message being a big iOS feature is insane for me honestly.

But when editing comes to WhatsApp, it'd probably just as big as unsend was 4-5 years ago"
"@Swiss Roll Cake it's not the beauty of iOS per say rather the fact that many people have the iPhone. And more importantly that they don't allow iMessage to work with Android . Any messaging app is only as good as the userbase. And most people outside of the US don't use imessage.

Because it's nothing unique or special, it's just the thing by default. Android could easily just start installing signal on their phones by default and it would be exactly like iMessage but better.

What I'm trying to say is , it's cool they're doing this but it's not a big feature, most Android users use cross platform stuff . If everyone was using the default sms app that'd have been just as good but nobody does, they'll use whatsapp or line etc. , to chat with people having iphones. There's rcs which is very nice although admittedly still early in development and apple won't implement it because ecosystem"
Yeah but the beauty of what iOS does is you don't have to use third party apps for a lot of things. I think that's where Apple is trying to get to. Having every feature in the software by default.
"Best ways to unsend embarrassing messages
1. Don't send em."
That 30 fps is becoming interesting
THAT LOCK SCREEN THEMED INTRO WAS SMOOTH
the other bits are pretty mid but copy pasting a picture with the background automatically removed is cool ngl.
"iphone 12 was my first iphone and after using it for the past 2 years I can say that I still prefer Android. iOS isn't bad or anything, there are some cool features - but there are also a couple of smaller things that really annoy me. Like how isn't there a fucking camera folder in photos?!? All the pictures I take just end up in Recents with all the other garbage. Customizability is also a big issue - I just love a clean android home screen."
"MKBHD be like: Okay so, here's the new iPhone 17 pro max. I've had it for about 7 months, just enough time to have some first impressions."
One hell of an opening man holy crap
Ay that intro was sick. You guys are going off with the vids.

"To the people with iPhone 8‚Äôs and original SEs, a good rule of thumb is to never update to the last supported OS for your iPhone. 

Sincerely, someone who updated to iOS7 on their iPhone 4"
"Never heard of this before. Will you expand on your experience? 
It bears mention - I'm an Android user but iOS 16 looks sharp and I'm looking at new (used) phones."
That‚Äôs the most insane intro you‚Äôve done. Was it David? There better be a studio video about it!!!
I'm literally in between updating to iOS 16 and this vid pops up! Great work marques
Dude's making an intro better than Apple fr. Kudos to the team!
I think the weakest feature is number 1
That intro transition was üî•
"WAIT , face id  unlock in landscape was a simple software solution ? all this time ? ü§Ø"
Yass sister
Still a big Notch ....
Best intro yet! That was amazing!

That INTRO!!!!!!!
DAMNNNNNNN THE INTROOOOO
that was a sick intro
"Nobody:

Me when he said it‚Äôs about damn time: ITS ABOUT DAMN TIME. In a minute i‚Äôm need sentimental man or woman to pump me up"
M2 MacBook Air comparisons please
"Nice transition at the beginning. Currently using an Android, was thinking of switching to iPhone. But it isn't able to download torrents which is a big issue for me, don't want to jailbreak either. Second issue is with USB 2.0, I have a Windows Laptop which supports USB 3.2 but iPhones only transfer with USB 2.0 speeds, that will be a problem when I transfer huge 4K videos from iPhone to Windows. That's why I'm still thinking whether my next phone should be a Samsung/OP or Apple."
Dope intro
I love that
Can we get that wallpaper somewhere?
Wait ‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs the M2 MacBook Pro marquess üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ

Love the idea of using the iPhone camera for webcam for the Macs and the characteristics of been able to customize the lock screen
Yeah that webcam feature is fire. Everything else was decentish

Been waiting for this! Haven't been this early. Cannot wait for the public beta. Man I absolutely adore how fresh and premium these videos are. Heavily inspiring for my channel. Much love brother. üî•
all this just from a software update? Technology is INSANEEEEEE
"Awesome, cannot wait for this ü´∂üèΩüôåüèæ"

What a dope Intro. You keep outdoing it man!
For us Indians iMessage is never been a feature. As many of us never use it in our lives.
All are useful but the new lockscreen
"iOS 16 : Where the lock screen is more customizable than the home screen...
still a good step towards making their interface more user friendly üëç"
"@keco185 The point is that the home screen should be a lot more customizable, while the lock screen is going above and beyond what's really needed on a lock screen. Relative to where they should be the Lock Screen is way more customizable than the Home Screen."
Customizability =/= being user friendly
The Home Screen is still more customizable than the Lock Screen. The only customization the Lock Screen has which the Home Screen doesn't is a font for the time
nope where lock screen is more customizable than home screen..
the intro is fire bruh
i'm thinking to buy new iPhone in exchange of my Nokia 3310

Fabulous entry

INTRO IS FIRE üî•
"Never been so early, good luck ü§û"
that intro is insane! keep the good work up
"finally, the first hands-  on review. Love this channel, keep up the good work!"
That intro ! üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
That intro is insane! Well done to the team!
I really like the new home screen but I really wish they focused more on reachability with bigger phones along with making pop ups like the low battery warning a notification and not something that blocks your entire screen.
"@Bugs 
Apple has had reachability/one-handed mode for many many years. You‚Äôre making it painfully obvious you don‚Äôt understand how to use an iPhone. The feature has been around since the iPhone 6 when they started getting larger."
"@anton You know what is also crazy? Every other company is designing their UI over the idea of having reachablity. Apple can do it too, they‚Äôre just being lazy. Stop blaming the consumer."
"@Acer It‚Äôs my opinion and that‚Äôs it, idc to discuss semantics over YouTube comments lmao"
"@DoodAMproductions if you‚Äôre looking to make it easier to use your phone, then the option should be in ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù - that‚Äôs the definition of the word. Less motion is useful for people with seizures as well as sensory sensitivities. Being able to drag icons lower to touch them easier is an accessibility feature for many disabilities but also just people with small hands. About limiting the Hz - sure, I‚Äôll agree that whatever phone (13 pro ig) can change refresh rate should have that setting in Display.

I‚Äôd like you to consider that instead of them just having no idea where to put options other than Accessibility, they just know there are many settings that by definition can make the device easier to use depending on your condition, which would fall under accessibility concerns. It‚Äôs not that Accessibility is an overbroad software category, to me - it‚Äôs that what accessibility can look like varies so broadly between the entire human population that Accessibility must be a broad topic to accomodate.

Edit: just cut down my words a bit."
"@Acer In this case it makes some sense, I would put it in display, however, since it directly affects using the display. Others like less motion, limit fps to 60, etc should be under battery as it directly affects battery. 

Accessibility just seems like where they put everything that they can't define to one category which is just unfortunate because so many people will never look in those settings to find really useful tools to use your phone easier and more to your liking."
Your intros are getting doper and doper broh üî•
"Hi Arnav here 
Do you know when is the iOS 16 public beta launch"
That intro should destroy the whole Apple's iOS 16 presentation lol
"sheeesh the lockscreen customisation is just really cool. i know android has these like way ages ago like in CMs but whenever apple that does it, it's just like some really innovative thing"
That intro tho! So smooth!
Just make siri work perfectly and we all win

Can we appreciate the unhinged level of smooth transitions from MKBHD?

"public beta literally just released, good timing"
Excited to see changes to the Lock Screen!
@Malik good that I don't like parties anyway. Just talking facts here as soon as you actually think about these changes.
"@Photonic Pizza except you can't. The clock is like 270x bigger than before you also can't completely go back to the old notification layout without swiping up every single time. Oh and light and dark mode are also just gone on the Lockscreen. 
The music widget also no longer shows you the volume and so on."
"@Tim R. Uhhh, how? If you don‚Äôt want the widgets or different fonts, just keep it the same. These changes are basically optional. And live notifs are just universally a good feature, especially with timers and the like."
@Tim R. your fun at parties
Most of them they're just a huge downgrade...
hyped for the lock screen update for sure
