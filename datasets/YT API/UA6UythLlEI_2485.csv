40 wpm?! How does one type that slow?
"I type about 160 words per minute in portuguese, and 140 in english. My record is 174 WPM in portuguese."
It's not as complex as it looks. Basically it's a typewriter that types a form a shorthand. Basically you're typing sound as opposed to letters and words.
dying job.. ai will be faster and more accurate.
"I worked as a word processor in the 1980s and,  to keep from going brain dead, invented my own short forms and a replacement macro to convert them to text.  It was a lot of fun to develop and troubleshoot."
And I thought that I could write fast at 99 wpm. I'm really amazed that writing at 300wpm is even possible.
I type at 106 words per minute.
I type an average of 80 but can max out at 120wpm
Cicero was Roman not Greek. WTF?!?
"I am a stenography student and the argument has come up about courtrooms using audio and video to record proceedings. The issue there is malfunction.  What was said cannot be repeated and therefore is lost. Aside from the judge, the court reporter is the only one who can stop proceedings to make sure they get everything, especially when there are multiple people talking Over one another. Although audio and video would make a great backup, human stenographers are still the best asset when it comes to clarity and accuracy."
AI cannot replace stenographers.. Salute to the stenographers.. :)
I‚Äôd be fired in 5 seconds.  No way I can do this job
"Cicero was a Roman, not a Greek."
wait so i could theorically use this to take notes at Uni ?
"""Dates back to Ancient Greece back to Cicero""....  I guess you cannot expect to much from a yank."
Nope. I type at 120 WPM because I have no life.
"ya im from ohio, can confirm, no internet"
Wait wasn't cicero roman?
Damm why now
"I actually type faster then I can speak, just because I'm a DM for an online DnD group"
Digital audio would be a terrible system. Rife with abuse potential and lousy with abuse vectors.
OpenSteno FTW
"We have internet in Ohio, stop it."
"C√≠cero wasn't from Ancient Greece, he was Roman, therefore the Tironian notes refer to Latin, not Greek."
"Grandmas and grandpas can write, if pushing to the limit, about 3 or 4 words per minute üòÇ"
But what about Carpal Tunnel?
Why not just use a voice recording type writer? Especially these days.
Accuracy
Cicero is decidedly not Greek. The single Roman we know the most about
"""You probably type at around 40 words per minute"" im offended but ok"
i live in ohio
Great now im more confused about this crap lol
All I wanna know is if a stenographer be able to handle the last 30 seconds of ‚ÄúGodzilla‚Äù by Eminem

"Doctor's secretary (NOT a ""medical secretary"", that's a specific job), and have been correcting and using Dragon Naturally Speaking for 14 years. Speech to text is not foolproof, by any means. How often do Siri, Alexa, Google Asst, etc. get you wrong? They are invaluable tools, but Never trust them. Always check.

I run voice recordings through Dragon regularly. When it's not my own voice running through my profile, errors skyrocket, and I can spend 5+ minutes correcting short files. When it IS my voice on my profile (which I've spent years training), there's roughly a 90%+ accuracy. But the errors will change your meaning 180¬∞ (leaving out ""not"" is always fun...)

Now add multiple voices, people speaking over each other, variations in inflection, accent, and mumbling, and the stenographer or transcriptionist isn't goimg anywhere in the next generation.

"You must be from Ohio, we still don‚Äôt have access to the internet"
"I've worked with several Stenographers, though we just call them Court Reporters. The best of which could do real-time. Many court reporters actually do what they can in court and then just record it all so they can go back and clean up their ""copy"". The software on their computers actually links the audio recording to the section it corresponds to in text record. So if they look through it at the end of the day and see some gibberish where they mistyped, they can highlight the section and hit play, and it will play back the audio allowing them to fix what they've written. Real-time certified reporters are so good that they have less than a certain percentage of errors over time, and typically will provide the ability for Attorneys (at a cost) to see the live transcribed text, and of course often provided to the court as well as part of the contract or for free if they're court employees. Also, if it's a trial or big deal hearing, they can have people ""scoping"" for them off-site. Where a copy of their transcript is synced over the cloud to someone else's computer and is cleaned up and synced back essentially. So if someone is looking at the transcript in real time in the courtroom and they scroll back up a few minutes later, what might have been gibberish before will now be properly filled in. This is both to provide a good real-time service, but also to cut down on work after hours when the parties inevitably request daily copies from the reporter. If the copy has already been scoped it's more a ""quick"" read through checking for errors, and then sending it off. Where I work most reporters are employed by the court and receive a salary, and also get paid by the parties when requesting various transcripts and services such as real-time during the event. I think one of the largest challenges for reporting to transition to AI will be the attribution to speakers, and accuracy. These will get better the longer the hearing, or if the system allowed for building voice models for various attorneys that are loaded in each time and improved over time, it could get insanely accurate. This plus hiring transcribers to clean up the transcript after the fact will one day replace court reporters, but when, I don't know."
"I'm in the Colemak discord where Sophie and Viper can do 220+ on keyboards. I can do 60 when I'm focused, but i type in 3 languages :)"
i average 165 wpm on my laptop and im perplexed
"40 wpm? I'm offended. 
86 wpm right here."
I'd probably start daydreaming and typing my own thoughts instead of listening because i'm not a good listener (bad attention span). Then someone would read it and be like what the hell is this?

Wowowow
Why are they even needed when the audio of the courtroom can just be recorded?
*** its not et like you pronounced it in the video! ET sound like the word HEY without the H so only the sound EY this is how you pronounce AND in french (the sound is not the same as in get just because its e t togheter)
How does this work for other languages??  Do you think it just can't do Chinese or would it have an extra section for tones
"you can record audio in the courtroom, but how do you scan through audio?  you can't, but you can scan through a transcript"
It sounds like 100% are women. Someone tell Jordan Peterson

"Cicero was Roman, not Greek lol (although I'm sure stenography existed in Greece before Cicero's time and Cicero himself DID spend a lot of time in Greece and knew Greek well!)"
I take offense I type at around 90-120wpm
"Back when MSN was popular as a teen, I used to type easily 120 words a min. But only on my specific keyboard, when I got a laptop, it dropped as the flat keyboard was harsh to use, and now as an adult who barely uses a actual keyboard, I'm prob not even a third as fast lol. My teachers/fellow students used to remark on how fast I typed, and I could get out a whole essay on MSN before the other person replied. It also got me a job at a telemarketing place where on my 2nd day I was the top ""performer"" who completed more questionnaires than the rest of the new hires, and the ""leaders"" were all joking how they were gonna snipe me for their team.

LMAO the cicero's wisdom part where he loves slavery
I am from Ohio and I can confirm we don't have internet. I have to cross the Michigan border to get any signal.
what.. normal people type at 40 wpm?
My seventh great grandfather invented the stenographer and I'm proud of him
"""4,000 easy to write letters.""

3,900 too many."
No i type 90 or above on keyboard.  Apparently if you ise a different tyoe keyboard dhat arange letter then can tyoe even faster because keyboard arrangements on most frequent letters use to be closer.
or you're a gamer who types 100 wpm
Stenographer vs Eminem - Who would win?
its becuase they type on two keyboards at the same time you silly little guy !
its becuase they have extra  fingers so they can type faster
Went to a court reporting school/program. Couldn't finish (family obligations). Loved it. I also know Gregg shorthand.
legend: enables voice typing and sleeps
My mom had a cool shorthand book from high school...I tried to teach myself then lost the book.... Would have saved myself carpel tunnel from taking notes in college...
"Cicero was actually an ancient roman, but he did went to greece after being excluded from politics for being an optimates so you can say he was there"
So many jokes. So much stock video
üëÄ
There's a whole subculture of people trying to build the best and most optimal keyboard when the perfect keyboard already exists.
1:02 wasn't Cicero Roman?
0:58 Tironian notes don‚Äôt originate from Ancient Greece. Cicero and Tiro were Romans and spoke Latin which you reference later in the video when you talk about the shorthand for ‚Äúet‚Äù: the Latin word for ‚Äúand‚Äù. It was developed during the first century BCE whilst classical Greece existed between the 12th and 9th centuries BCE.
"One big incentive in favor of stenographers is their ability to do real-time in the courtroom (providing screens to the attorneys and judges for them to read along in real time as each word is spoken and then outputted to the screens for them to read/refer to). 
Yes, I realize AI has the capability to do this one day, but as of right now, it‚Äôs not as accurate and not being implemented."
"Stenography ruined my teenage years.  My mom was a stenographer and had GREAT hearing, so there was no sneaking around the house."
Pls don‚Äôt say that Cicero lived in ancient Greece! Dude he was one of the most famous Romans ever!!!
Wow! This is really interesting üòÉ

Bruh i dont about that of what are you thinking or talking what but holy shit this video is weird duh she what !?? SHE IS CHEATIN  steronographer is weird duh im now thyping nonsense stuff while watching this video to testing my self doing and typing stuff. I'M unsure how is this happening right now im just typing and typing now im kinda dont have anything to type anymore but still im typing Oh and today I eat duck meat it was very delicious and the bakery that i eat today is not so great but the CROISSANT is AMaZing!
Friendly history teacher here...Cicero was Rome. Not Greece.
This shit is outdated. Absolute scam
How so? I‚Äôm learning it on my computer just to type faster. Going pretty well so far after a couple of months.
"Picture this: A lawsuit involving an auctioneer. A cross examination.. He asks extremely verbose questions at auctioneer speed. By the end of the day, the stenographer has smoke coming out of his ears."
funny how you said ‚Äúreading is good and you should do more of it instead of what youre doing now‚Äù (obv paraphrased) while im watching the video w sound off and subtitles on
My mom did this when I was a little kid. Hated the job because she found the cases depressing and many of the criminals creepy.
Too bad there probably wasn‚Äôt as much captioning work then. That seems like it has to potential to be interesting without being as depressing.

"Chording keyboards have a weird history with computers. On one hand, a well trained typist can type much more quickly with a chorded keyboard. On the other hand, it takes months of practice to get good at it. If you want to try it yourself, Plover is free software to turn an Apple keyboard into a stenography machine. If you want to buy one, I've heard good things about the Twiddler and the CharaChorder."
Not just the apple keyboard but any NKRO one. Also there‚Äôs fairly cheap dedicated machines now like the EcoSteno and the Uni.
"If you were a kid doing RP in AIM chat rooms, you're probably upwards of 120 words per minute. lol"
Dude... there are people who can type more than 216 wpm with a normal keyboard.
@Shawn Fumo oky
"True, but probably not comfortably for hours a day like pro stenographers do. There's thousands of people out there working who had to follow along to 225wpm dictation for 5 minutes with over 95% accuracy just to get certified. The dedication that it takes to go over 200wpm on qwerty is similar to someone doing over 300wpm with steno (recently someone broke their record and did 360wpm for a minute of dictation with steno)."

How come 4 vowels are enough when there are 11 vowels in English.
"Well it uses combinations of the keys to get more. The steno theories usually still fudge thing a little but in the one I use, there is short a (A), long a (AEU), ahh / short o (AU), short u/schwa (U), short e (E), long e (AOE), long u/you (AOU), short i (EU), long i (AOEU), oi (OEU). Then AO for long U with the oo spelling and O also for o homonyms."

I've read Name of the Wind so I'm basically an expert at this
"Cicero was a Roman, not Hellenistic figure."
Impossible that an average student doesnt write at around 85wpm
and if you are Barbara Blackburn you type around 212 words per minute would not forget that if i was half as interesting
It's interesting to me that over 80% of court stenographers are women.
"Man, I wasted my time"
0:58 Did you mean Ancient Rome? Cicero was a Roman politician.
"I remember hearing that braille type writers were used by blind people to record everything said in UK courts. Another thing I have heard is that a stenographer's transcript is thought more reliable in a court of law precisely because it has no audio so removes intonation, expression and reactions"
"This and Braille writers are pretty different but also have some similarities I think.

I‚Äôve heard the same thing regarding taking out the emotions from the record (among other reasons why it is good)."
Cicero was  Roman.. not from Ancient Greece!!
I want to lean stenographer so bad but I damn sure am not paying thousands of dollars to do so.
"If you want to learn it for yourself, you don‚Äôt have to spend that much. The EcoSteno and Uni are both around $100 and you combine it with free software on your computer. If you have an NKRO keyboard, you can even start of with that at first (though not ideal).

Check out the Open Steno Project for more info."
This is absolutely hilarious.

Too many stock images and videos. Too cringy

1:05 mfw when Cicero was a Roman senator and not a Greek
Cicero was a roman guy! His corpse may start to rotate in its grave when you call a roman senator a greek ü§¨ üòèHe took studies in Greece but lived in Rome throughout his professional carreer as a lawyer and senator.
"I have a friend training to be a stenographer and they've specifically said that human stenographers almost certainly won't become irrelevant with audio recording- the will probably used as WELL AS stenographers for redundancy - audio files can get corrupted or lost, etc"
"I used to be able to write shorthand and thought it was so cool, it was a dying art when I learned it, cut to  now I can only remember a few bits and pieces."
i can do about 125 if i really try :D
50 is good right?
Not to be that guy but Cicero was Roman not  Greek
"As good as digital assistants and FTR machines are getting, the most common word in recorded court testimony is ""unintelligible."" As much as the court reporter does that's very important, sometimes the most important thing they do is yell at lawyers and litigants and tell them to speak one at a time or nobody gets anything."
"And even though in theory someone could monitor the audio and intervene, that usually doesn‚Äôt happen. And especially if that person doesn‚Äôt do transcription themselves, it‚Äôll be hard to know exactly what to look for."
"Court reporters aren't going away no matter how much techbros want them to, and every time they try to argue for AI they reveal how little they understand about the process for producing and protecting a record and how courts actually function in a day to day sense. Also money seems to be no object, it would be insanely more expensive just to run even their idealized dream setup."
"90-150 depending on the type of test and how they account for errors.

I‚Äôm on my computer 4-6 hours a day, I‚Äôm surprised they can type that fast."
"Steno allows less finger movement at the same speeds as regular typing, which is what gives it the higher speed ceiling (and also do it for hours a day). Steno at 150wpm feels much slower than with QWERTY."
What's more interesting is why we still use this when we have something called audio recorders
"Don't count stenographers out of a job anytime soon... they perform a crucial role in the courtroom which simply cannot be performed by even our most advanced computers.  Having an accurate transcription of every word spoken in that courtroom (and by whom) can literally be a matter of life & death or imprisonment in cases, and recording technology is simply not as accurate, adaptable, functional or immediate as the human brain.

Anyone who's tried to pick out quiet or mumbled words on a video recording... or wanted to smash your iPhone because Siri doesn't understand your accent... or wasted hours trying to find a file on your computer... or lost hours of work to a corrupted file knows that technology still has a _long way_ to go to be able to replace a human stenographer."

4:31 is this the guy from get out?
"Cicero and Tiro were Romans, not Greeks."
Just hit the CC button at the bottom of youtube video and it will become immediately obvious why stenographers will be around for a long long time.
A thousand comments about stenographers but not one mention of this man saying Ohio doesn't have internetüòí
-1....
I am a stenographer but here I am watching this
Cicero was Roman I think if I recall correctly
"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Heb 9:27)
The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit. (Psalms 34:18)
When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. (Mark 2:17)
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13)"
"I did not waste time. Small chunk of history, new perspective on a profession that typically flies under the radar, and my life is not precious, so no waste there, either."
My WPM is 118...
I type much faster than 40 words per minute.
"Bots be like:Finally
A new Challenger!"
"I'm a programmer lol,"
Cicero was not a Greek.
Cicero... In ancient greece... It hurts my brainn....
CICERO WAS ROMAN(from the Italian countryside)
"I write about 10 words per minute, because every comment must be edited to perfection"
"It is fascinating. I used to work as an usher in an international tribunal. The work of the stenographers was impressive. Sometimes they had to ask people to slow down, specially when 5 or 6 attorneys would start speaking over each other..."
"Just fyi all Ohioans can type at least 200 words per minute, it's just no one can actually find this out until we get internet"
"Jokes on you, I have sponsorblock and only wasted 4 mins 30 sec"
imagine being in a hype group chat with stenographers when you type an average speed
"Hang on? 'Fortune cookie ramblings '? WTF? This is Cicero we're talking about here, one of, if not the most respected jurist of the Republic, a writer on politics and philosophy, the model for centuries of jurisprudence. Jesus, this video might as well have been made by school kids, but I suspect even school kids might have bothered to look up who the hell Cicero was. Just amateurish twaddle."
"I just watched the Marjorie Taylor Greene court proceedings, and I noticed that the stenographer was talking into what looked for all the world like a WWII aircraft intercom.
So, this video announced it's obsolescence within 48 hrs of becoming obsolete.  Very cool.  I wonder if it will be on the Simpsons?"
@Shawn Fumo Thank you for the information Shawn.  Very interesting :-)
"That‚Äôs called voice writing. Usually they use Dragon trained to their particular voice as well a nonsense shortcut words and ways to control punctuation. The use a ‚Äúmask‚Äù microphone that can hear their voice but blocks out other sounds.

Some people do find that easier to learn than machine stenography, but still needs a lot of special training. Also means you have to be talking constantly all day long to record the proceedings, so could be hard on your voice if you aren‚Äôt careful."
"Your information is incorrect. Cicero was Roman, not Greek."
I was not a stenographer. Typed what my boss spoke.
I used to be a secretary and had my boss speak while I typed.  Also corrected his grammar and punctuated properly.
Im student and can type 100wpm
"This is similar to sign language. There are letters, but only used to spell someone's name or some weird word. Each sign is a word or a phrase, fuck you is 7 letters but one fling of the wrist, same with no good, didn't see, wasn't having fun or I love you. Best of show goes to the translator for Eminem performing Rap God, fastest rap ever recorded."
"@Shawn Fumo You're right. A lot of articles are left out unless it is meaningful to the context. I know it's called a language but it's more of a dialect, like ebonics or pidgin, although there is a new ""word"" to learn to replace all the ones you know. But on top of that, many deaf people can read lips, usually if they could hear, then lost it. As opposed to being born deaf, they have a very hard time reading lips. So the family members of deaf people will mouth or say what they are signing for clarity. It's funny to see a deaf person watching the news with the sound and the subtitles off."
"@BariumCobaltNitrog3n I've only heard about ASL second-hand, so I may be mistaken, but my understanding is it has its own grammar vs just having each ASL motion corresponding to the same words in the same order as the English sentence.

In in ASL, if you were doing ""The shaggy dog quickly ran across the field"". Would it actually be (asl motion for ""the"", asl motion for ""shaggy"", asl motion for ""dog"", etc) in the same order as the original sentence?"
"@Shawn Fumo Ok, but the output of both is still regular English, and I'm not sure what your sources are for steno being easier to learn than ASL. Also all languages use body language and tone for meaning, context and intent. Except steno."
"But keep in mind ASL is technically another language with its own grammar, and also meaning partially determined by body language.

Steno in comparison, while it has various rules to learn, the output is always regular English. In that way, it is a lot easier to learn than a real new spoken (or sign) language."
"FINALLY, IT'S BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE MAINSTREAM! plover is gonna get allot of new downloads soon I bet"
@Shawn Fumo that is true though I feel as if mass production may allow them to be cheaper. this'll only be possible if the community grows from a niche to something worth mass producing products for
"@yesus .is.yeemo Well the EcoSteno and Uni are both being semi-mass produced and are about $100 each. It'd be nice if it was even cheaper, but I think it'll be hard to do with the current costs of mechanical keyboard switches and all that."
"@Shawn Fumo nice, hopefully some cheaper hardware gets released for the growing community"
"Yup, lots of new people stopping into discord lately!"
"cicero and tiro aren't names from ancient greece i think, that would be ancient rome"
"‚Äú40 words per minute.‚Äù

You forgot programmers:  hunt-and-peck at 400 words per minute.  (And half of those are backspaces!)
F************************** Cicero was Roman!!!
"I make good money typing on a regular keyboard (homicide interrogations) and keep up very well, especially with my long list of text expanders, but I also get to pause/rewind audio when I need to. I don't think I'd want to be a real-time stenographer. I love working from home and not having to see or be in contact with the goons I listen to ü§£ As for AI.. My last job switched to AI voice recognition (company was bought out by a bigger company that got tons of government grant money for the AI bullshit) and then wanted to pay me less to edit that MESS and do twice the work. I said hell no and quit. Worked out for the best... Found a much better paying job. Now I get to basically type crime novels and that's a hell of a lot more interesting than cancer or car insurance. People who praise AI VR haven't truly worked with it. If sucks as much today as it did when I had to use it for a job captioning phone calls back in 2009."
"I think a fair number of real-time captioners like for TV can work from home. In theory, you could still learn steno to need less rewinding in the transcription (or to put less stress on your hands), but probably less worth it if you already have a good tech expansion system going."
Cicro was roman not greek
"the next county over? There are countless reasons why especially in a courtroom, recordings won't replace stenographers anytime soon"
Stenography will always be relevant until the point that voice-to-text can accurately recognize text for captions 99.99% of the time IMO
"as a current ohio resident i can confirm we don‚Äôt have internet, i‚Äôm using my sprint flip phone to type this right now."
0:25 so THATS why i can never watch amazing hai videos
hi
"About one minute of useful info, the rest is fluff and a commercial.
 
Didn't even fully answer the question. Bah!"
Bruh i can type hecka fast
"Reporter and has just started work, 4 years of Online School and she‚Äôs finally done, I‚Äôm so proud of her."
Is this a Geico Commercial?!?
14yr old that types at 100wpm moment
thanks for NOT explaining stenography to me
jokes on you i type 140 top speed 120 on average nd im a 16 year old male yessuh
Ohio caught a crazy strayüòÇüòÇüòÇ
imagine 40 wpm where is 120 wpm gang?
im 110 wpm actually
I thought most regular internet users (I suppose nerds) type somewhere around 100+ words per minute.
"""It's kind of like a chord on a piano, if every piano composition sounded like a Legal Eagle video""
I love this line"
"im not a stenographer but I can type at 150+  wpm and im an 8th grader. my ela teacher thought I plaigarized a 1000 word story because...
1) i used termonology that -according to an online plaigarism checker- I plaigarised 30% (I think).
2) I must have copied and pasted because I took around 10 minutes to finish the story, but I had to explain it to her

She still threataned to get me suspended and give me a 0
Everyone loved my book
I got a 90 and didnt get suspended."
But what words are counted? If I type ‚ÄúI‚Äù repeatedly then my words-per-minute could be like 200
"I think the official tests also try to space things out so that there‚Äôs a similar number of total syllables every 20 words or so, to make the tests more fair compared to each other.

It‚Äôs also usually a dictation at a certain speed that you need to keep up with as best you can. Then have some time to clean up mistakes and the result of that is compared to an original master transcription to see your accuracy."
@Elizabeth Grace interesting !
"In our tests, a ‚Äúword‚Äù is actually 1.4 syllables."
This is why Stenographers don't give any emotional emphasis when they are reading back their records!  They are literally just reading back sounds that they've typed out.
"What did Cicero mean by ""Slavery is the bedfellow of tranquil pleasures?""

Thanks for this video, by the way!  It was Twice as Interesting as I expected.üòä"
"My Mom just finished Stenographer/Court Reporter school, I would ask her about this kind of stuff and I always found it interesting when she would tell me, she‚Äôs finally a Court Reporter and has just started work, 4 years of Online School and she‚Äôs finally done, I‚Äôm so proud of her."
"i would of enjoyed seeing a more detailed ""output"" of those machines, instead of you strictly explaining how they worked. i know there was a brief clip of the output at 4:04, but going over it a bit more and explaining what it said would of helped people wrap their heads around it. I had to go google it separately, which made the video even more interesting because its gibberish for those who dont get it."
40 words per minute is piss poor‚Ä¶ anyone who grew up with computer can probably type 75+ wpm
"Cicero was from Greece, hey? Lost something in translation, there?"
I took a course and I had to quit because it was too high paced and I just wasnt getting it
Cicero was Roman‚Ä¶.
"""I love slavery sooo much"" lmaooo"
Cicero was Romen...
"I agree, AI cannot replace Stenographer's but a voice recorder can üòÇ"
"Small correction; Cicero did indeed study in Greece, but he was very much a Roman. What we think of as Ancient Greece didn‚Äôt really exist in Cicero‚Äôs lifetime."
"Cicero was Roman, not Greek RRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!"
"1:12 or 1:13 Last bit of Cicero's Wisdom:
""I love Slavery Soooo much. Slavery is Cool and Good. Are You writing this down Slave? Did you get the part about how slavery is Cool and Good? No, no, You're right, that doesn't really sound like one of my quotes. How about, like, ""Slavery is the Bedfellow of Tranquil Pleasures.""  Yeah, Hell Yeah, I love that. Write that down."""
"Yo, guys, the 10 finger technique is amazing, you really need to learn it, that will make your life much easier."
"""You probably type at 40 words per minute""
Yeah... if you're recording me at half speed"
"All great, all cool.
But Cicero was Roman, not Greek."
I always wondered how this worked! I type at 120 wpm like a big nerd and it's still not even close to typing as fast as people talk so I always wondered how they did it!
"Jokes on you, my life is worthless!"
i more amaze with the one who used papers
"Cicero was roman, not greek"
"I went to school for stenography. I got up to around 240. Unfortunately the school was very poorly run and they essentially just took the majority of the students money without providing teachers that had the proper knowledge to instruct and dictate to us. Besides that, it‚Äôs been nearly 20 years since I was in school for it and I still hear the way that people speak in phonetics. I can also picture/feel out the keystrokes of conversations that I‚Äôm hearing, including the shortcuts that we used for common phrases. If you know you know - you never forget!"
"If you aren‚Äôt retired, I know there is huge demand out there right now depending on the area you live.."
I type max 85-90 at 12.
i do 80-110 depending on what it is cause of school lol
"Always wondered how it worked, interesting."
"Cicero was Roman, not Greek!!"
Ohio doesn't have internet? Bro wtf?
"I love that old TV/film footage at 4:01 ‚Äî the actress clearly has no idea how to use the keyboard properly and is just flailing around, the steno version of q;sldkfjqw;flkjqw;elkfjqw;ldkfgj."
I write 220 words per minute
no i type more than 3x the avg pls
Jokes on you i type 110 words per minute not 40
Why didn't they use video cameras or sound recording now a days
"Cicero was roman, not Greek..."
"... dates back to ancient Greece, to this guy Cicero. 
- Are you sure about that?!"
They're probably not going to replace the stenographer with a recording device because the point is to build a transcript of the case and they need the transcript rather quickly. Having someone type it up in real-time greatly speeds it up
"Ancient Rome, right?"
You mean 4 and a half minutes and an ad
How many Americans were shocked to find out Ireland and Scotland have their own languages?
Lol your use of stock footage is great.
"My mother learned Steno (""the deutsche Einheitskurzschrift"", ""german unified stenography"") in the 50's in school and worked as a secretary for a manager of a big company until her marriage.
She never lost her ability to write in DEK by hand (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Einheitskurzschrift) for typewriting until she died."
Cicero? In greece? Yeah sure...üôÑüôÑüôÑ
"On a Keyboard I write at about 80 WPM, if I want to type fast ofc. Normally I write prolly at like 60 or 50 idek how fast I am typing rn"

Awesome
Nice how this was released alongside a lot of Heard-Depp stuff
"I did a Pitman course in the 70s as a side skill.   It really paid for itself over the years, working in media and legal."
I type fast but I didn‚Äôt say that I type accurately
Cicero was from the Italian countryside and was famous for being a Roman senator. Read moar.
My mum was taught secretarial typing on a typewriter and could type 120 words per minute... üòä and then the computer keyboard came along and it took her ages to get used to not bashing the keys so had a lot of aaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnddddddddds going on ü§£ü§£ü§£
"I'm here because I am curiosu about the stenographer on Judge Judy, excuse me, Judy Justice."

bruh i type 81wpm but i have no requirement for it
I mean I type over 100 wpm lol
Cicero ancient Greece? Excuse me? He was Roman lol.
Why not just record it digitally?  Place microphones throughout the courtroom and use AI to transcribe.  So much easier.
"Not really. The AI accuracy isn‚Äôt good enough yet (especially with accents), and you need someone to make sure everything said was intelligible. Like that they didn‚Äôt totally mumble or they didn‚Äôt ruffle papers near the mic, or a mic didn‚Äôt stop working suddenly, etc. Plus people will want to say stuff to each other privately so they need to be able to turn the mic off next to them. But what if they forget to put it back on?

And so now you need someone monitoring a mix of all the audio inputs and trying to determine if it all would be intelligible when it‚Äôll be transcribed in the future. Then you need someone to actually transcribe it later or to at least clean up the AI output. But some cases are fast moving and want to read back something said earlier or get a draft transcript right at the end of the session.

So in the end why not just keep someone there who is writing it all down in real time and can interrupt for clarifications or to tell people to stop talking over each other and can produce a transcript right away that has a high enough accuracy to be useful."
understanting quantum mechanics is easier than this devil's gadged lol!
Wait until you learn about the Characorder
"It is interesting but hasn‚Äôt really proven itself yet. It‚Äôs still in early stage. It has the potential to be easier to learn at first than steno, but has to become more reliant on chording the faster you want to go. And stuff like the dictionary theory is very rudimentary still. Maybe it‚Äôll get there over time."
These non-comedy quips that you think are cute are borderline unbearable
Watching the Johnny Depp trial I was exposed to stenomask. Audio steganography with a mic in a sound proof enclosure that looks like a gas mask.
"Cicero was Roman, not Greek."
Don't be a stenographer if you are dyslexic. Lol
"@Shawn Fumo Doesn't matter if you write everyday or do stenography every day, if you are dyslexic you are probably still gonna mess up. I write every day, both on my phone and in my school notes. I have Grammarly on my phone and laptop so it catches any mistakes. But in school notes I have to constantly erase and re-write. I choose to write in pencil, not pen, because you can't erase with a pen."
"@ILove_Pitbulls245 no disagreement there! I was just thinking more in terms of day to day writing, not being a pro steno."
"@Shawn Fumo Phonetics is based on sound, yeah? Sometimes dyslexic people hear wrong (and normal people), so we might still get it wrong. All I'm saying is, if you want to be a stenographer and you are dyslexic, it's probably gonna be harder compared to a normal person."
@ILove_Pitbulls245 yeah. I‚Äôm just not sure how it manifests itself. If the phonetic aspect would help or if the difficulty would just be diff.
"@Shawn Fumo Dyslexic people learn how to read and write, but we still get it wrong."
Ok i wanna see my typing speed to me i looks fast time to see a website

"I'd like to nit-pick the specific part of your introduction that states the current typing world  record. Despite it being the top google result, the typing world record is *not* a 1946 typewriter score. That first google source (ratatype.com) is not trustworthy. Though it may not have made it into the Guiness Book of Records, the fastest score on a one-minute randomized string of common English words is currently approaching 260wpm. I recommend checking out Sean Wrona's 2021 book ""Nerds per minute"" for comprehensive up-to-date information on past and modern top typists."
"Nice, will check out that book! Steno still has a higher ceiling (Mark just got 360wpm for a 1 min dictation) but 260 is seriously impressive for regular typing."

Bruh......"
"You‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt explain how the keyboard works. You spent 20 seconds on it and prefaced it with, if this sounds boring you can tune out now. What does that say to your audience? How does ‚Äúkph+ eu+ t‚Äù translate to commit?"
"So, it basically goes a syllable at a time, in a mostly phonetic way. The left fingers for the starting consonant sound, the thumbs for the vowels, and right fingers on the ending sound. The keys/sounds are laid out in a set order and in a way due to how sounds usually work in English. Like the left letters being letters being STKPWHR, a lot of words might start like STake, SKill, STRaw, THere, etc. And sounds that are a bit less common use multiple keys pressed. PH is m, TPH is n, TK is d, etc. And some keys are duplicated on both sides. The right side is FRPBLGTSDZ. A word might end like buRP, buiLT, says (seZ). Again, multiple keys pressed at once give additional ending sounds. Since there's only four vowel keys, combos are usually needed for that as well. Short e is E but long e is AOE. Short u/schwa is U but long u is AOU. Short i is EU and long i is AOEU, etc.

So in the above example K is starting k sound. PH is starting m sound. EU is short i sound. T is ending t sound. So like ""kmit"". Generally multi-syllable words might have multiple strokes to write them out, but there's also lots of shortcuts ""briefs"" for common words like that."

Why do we need people to type fast when we can just audio record and then write afterwards?
Too smart ass of a video
I've spent so much time on message boards over the past 20 years that I consistently type over 150 wpm

In the courts that I practice we have been using recordings for years and you have to pay for someone to transcribe it for you

It's only complex because you think it is weird to process words via their phonemes and not by the letters we use to write the words in normal correspondence.

Huh I didn't realize average typing speed was 40 wpm
I cruise around 74 WPM. Just saying I do reports for work and your assumptions are correct lol.
The Gabelsberger script has a dedicated character for the word nig-

"The problem with recorded audio is that it isn't perfect. People can easily be talked over, mumble, etc. These are all things that can usually (keyword) be deciphered by a stenographer who is actually there.

"ancient Greece.......Cicero??????
Cicero was a roman!"
but Cicero was a Roman not a Greek
This would be so much more interesting without the bad jokes.
I write at 100 wpm
Cicero was Roman.
"Cicero was a roman Statesman, and while he spoke Greek and visited greece, he really can't be considered to be from ancient Greece."

"Is the cicero thing a joke? He was a famous Roman for gods' sake. He was Consul during the Cataline Conspiracy, one of the most famous late republic events. And likewise the Tiro story is Roman. Roman, not greek. At least do bare minimum research god damn. Really hope this is a joke."

That's one thing is steno is easier on your hands since it needs less finger movements at the same wpm as regular typing.
This must be one of the most outdated things still in use
"I mean, the layout is from around the same time as qwerty and almost everyone still uses qwerty keyboards.  The steno machines people use now are basically full computers, with touch screens, the levers use the magnetic hall effect to register strokes and each lever has depth and resistance controls. In some courtrooms, the stenographer runs a live feed of the record to a monitor the judge can see, etc. There's also cheaper hobbyist machines now that use mechanical keyboard tech and open source software on the computer.  And most of the hobbyist people talk on Discord. Not really all that old-fashioned in that sense."
I love audible. Do not read at all anymore‚Ä¶thanks audible?
Mate if you grew up playing RuneScape you can type at 250+ wpm
what's with the half-beard guy at 2:22
Stella is absolutely not the fastest typist in the world. in fact in the more competitive typing scene 216wpm is pretty average if not below
"Hello everyone, I hope your having a great day today! I just want to let you all know that God loves you so very much, (whether you believe that to be true or not) and to share the gospel to you all if you don‚Äôt mind. 

So the gospel is this, that God out of his great love for you sent his only Son Jesus to take the penalty and the punishment of your sins by dying for your sins on the cross. And after his death on the cross he was buried and rose from the dead 3 days later. You see, Jesus was the only one capable of living up to Gods perfect standard, which means he was sinless( which is being without sin, being perfect). But you see, we all fall short of that whether you believe it or not, which is why we need a savior, because our own goodness cannot get us to heaven. For example, like being a good person or doing good deeds. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, being a good person and doing good deeds is awesome and all but that won‚Äôt qualify or justify you at all before God. The only thing that can justify and qualify us before God is Jesus!!! Because like I said before, we couldn‚Äôt live up to his perfect standard( because all of us have sinned), which means that even our very own best efforts to be good won‚Äôt justify us before him. And the only way for one to enter into heaven without Christ is to be sinless and perfect in every way, which is impossible! So in order for one go to heaven, and to be assured that they will be in heaven, is that if they (you) simply decide to believe the gospel and trust in what Jesus has done on their(your) behalf. Which is his death for their(your) sins! One must realize that they can‚Äôt justify their own selves because of their own sinfulness, and therefore turn to God in faith by just simply believing the gospel which once again, is the death( for your sins), burial, and his resurrection. And when one does this, Christs righteousness will be imputed to them(you) which will make them righteousness before God and will receive the free gift of God that he offers to all( no matter who they are), which is eternal life( and will be able to enter into heaven )! It‚Äôs that simple everyone!!! All you need to do is to have faith and believe the gospel and trust  what he did for you!!! I can‚Äôt stress enough how simple it really is!!! I‚Äôm not here to force anyone, but to simply share the gospel to you all, which actually( the word gospel) means good news!!! It‚Äôs good news that Jesus died for your sins, it‚Äôs good news that he did what you and I couldn‚Äôt( being able to live up to Gods perfect standard- sinless- being without sin, being perfect in every way| for our behalf ), it‚Äôs good news that God is not a respecter of persons, and offers the free gift of eternal life to all who will simply believe the gospel and depend on what he did for them. Believe, trust, and relay on what Christ did for you for your justification!!! Well, that‚Äôs  all I wanted to say, have a great rest of your dayüñ§"

"What‚Äôs the point when there is cameras with video?

Idk seems kind of outdated"
Ancient Greece .Cicero. *angry Roman noises*
Why do we need this anymore? Couldn't you just record the courtroom trial? That way you get a 100% accurate recap.
"Not really. There's a lot of issues with people mumbling, or shuffling papers near the mic, or talking over each other, or a mic suddenly deciding to stop working, etc. Having someone there who can hear it live and intervene if necessary (ask someone to repeat, etc) is very useful. You also do need a transcript in the end, so people can search through it etc. In some cases they even need a draft copy right at the end of the session, which wouldn't work if someone had to transcribe it later.

When you get to the point that you need equipment, you need people to monitor the equipment, also make sure that everything was intelligible and ask for people to repeat (which almost never ends up happening when it is being recorded), having someone sit and transcribe it, etc. At some point it is just easier for someone to write it up live."
The puns and jokes got in the way of the information you were trying to convey.
"I watched the MTG hearing, and, I presumed that lady in the foreground holding what looked like a muzzle to her face was the court reporter.  Is that some new way of doing things?"
"Yeah, that is usually called voice writing. The ""mask"" is a mic that hears them and blocks out other sounds. They usually train something like Dragon specially to their voice and also add various shortcut nonsense words and ways of doing punctuation quickly. Some people find that easier than doing written steno, but it still takes a lot of training to do it right. You also have to be careful to take care of your voice since they end up talking constantly all day to take everything down."
cicero was roman not greek
"1:00 bro cicero belogns to the first century BC-AC during Roman Republic or the beggining of the Empire, Ancient Greece ends in the fourth century BC"
Ohio doesn't have access to the internet? That's an insane claim and misleading.
Cicero was Roman.

"Umm...as good as Audible is, it's not the same experience as reading the book for yourself.  There is no substitute.

As for steno, I type bloody fast.  I know people that take Gregg (not my fave) and Pitman (like this one), and I've watched court stenographers do their thing with alarming alacrity.  The tape recorder is great, but manual a/o automatic transcription doesn't always pan out; hence, there are sometimes stenographers in the courtroom even alongside the tape recorders.  Some people still give dictation, and will even have someone take shorthand in addition to using, say, a Dictaphone, or the modern equivalent thereof.

Dictate.  It's an art."
so ... Cicero is the father of speech-to-text too ? man he would be impressed.
They always ask me to speak more slowly.
Cicero isn't an ancient greek.

"Audio recordings have a main disadvantage, you can skim through the entire thing like you can with text. Our brains can scan for specific words and that's impossible to do with audio. I've always wondered how fast can a steno type and if their brains could ever switch steno mode off when they're just chilling at home having wine with friends or if their brains still kinda shows the steno transcript in real time."
@Shawn Fumo steno about to catch fire
Usually they need to be able to do 225wpm for 5 mins with over 95% accuracy to graduate. The fastest record was just broken by someone doing 360wpm for 1 min with steno.

Yes. you were correct.  This video was indeed a waste of 6 minutes of my precious life that I will never get back.  Thank you for that.
Wasn't Cicero from Rome?
"Cicero was Roman.I mean, he's pretty much exclusively known for being an enemy of Caesar, and any piece of media about Caesar will mention him. But of course it's all greek to you. Much smaller channels, some run by a single person, would have easily screened out that in the edit- even those that had nothing to do with Rome, Cicero etc. and just mentioned him in passing. you on the other hand likely have a person who's job it is just to fact check."

Thats pretty cool
"Cicerone was a roman lawier and a philospher, he was not greek, americans should really start to study something about history,  and i mean real history, not the one of your paese di merda. This whole video starts with disinformation, what a shame, stop thinking that you are the protagonists of this planet."
"My father was a court reporter, and he often told me that he wasn't allowed to transcribe ""uh-huh"" (affirmative) or ""uh-uh"" (negative); he instead had to write ""(unintelligible)"". Most of the lawyers he deals with know this and will ask a witness to explicitly say either ""yes"" or ""no""."
"I always wondered how they did this, I figured it was a modified keyboard, where they could just skip out certain words, like single or double letters. This is significantly more interesting.

I know, what I originally thought is flawed and wouldn't work for recording stuff said in a court."

lmao what is this writing
Thats pretty cool
reading sucks cause theres too much redundant information also the fact that you assumed I wasted time of my life is funny. Some people these days are so stupid.
"Why stenographers won't be out of job in a single word: electricity. You can read the report even without electricity... That's why books still exists, for example. Also, is faster to look for a word in a paper report (book, physical) rather than in a recording (song, digital)."
"I think even if you switched to audio recording, stenographers would still be needed!  The transcript eventually has to be converted into a paper document, and AI just can't do it.  So you'd need to have someone transcribe the audio recording.  And the best people to do that would be Stenographers who can write it out without needing to go back in the recording over and over.  So at that point, you might as well just pay the stenographers to be in the courtroom doing it live with all the context, facial cues, body language, and no chances of audio being corrupted or improperly recorded."
I think its so cool how they can type live but it always angers me seeing live subtitles always being behind the picture. Like why even look at the mouth moving if it doesnt match up üò≠ ima just read the subs
my average wpm is 100-130 wpm and it's just because i completely learned the keyboard and my fingers can move decently fast
Egad bro. Cicero was Roman.
idk i feel like most of my friends and i are pretty average and we all type at around 110 - 130 wpm‚Ä¶ 40 wpm seems way too slow to be average‚Ä¶
"1:01, wow, Cicero was NOT Greek. He was Roman. I don't know how seriously I should take anything I learn from this channel if you get a fact like that so wrong."
A stenograph is closer to a musical instrument than a keyboard. A unique machine to be sure.

"This video was a horrible explanation. Slow down, tone down the arrogance & attempt at humour, then perhaps try again. All over again."
Yeah the whole time I was wondering hey isn‚Äôt this completely outdated by recording audio and speech-to-text software lol
"@Shawn Fumo Everything has its pros and cons. A computer won‚Äôt lose focus, won‚Äôt have their hands cramp, won‚Äôt be too hungover from last night, etc. I‚Äôm sure any stenographer would struggle with a really thick Indian accent for example, or someone with a speech impediment, just like speech to text software might. But the main difference is that you can introduce 100s of thousands of Indian accent and people speaking with a lisp data to a computer.

Stenography is cool, though I think transcription is best approached like how the commercial flight industry is: a computer doing 99% of the work, and a person being there to make sure everything flows well"
"Speech to text is not good enough yet to do this. Have you ever tried using stuff like siri? It's even worse if someone has an accent. And if someone really mumbles, or they shuffle a paper near the mic, or the mic shuts off an no one noticed, you can't transcribe what isn't there to begin with. Stenographers can hear and identify people better by being there and can specifically interrupt and ask people to repeat what they said, etc."
My man speaks a thousand words per minute. I had to slow the video down to understand what's being said in the video.
Ok so. I just learned that super humans are among us‚Ä¶
"Hah, I saw this video at 2x speed so I only wasted two and a half minutes!"
"Great video!  I happen to be a professional stenographer, and it's really cool to see a video about what we do on such a popular channel!

I'll add that I don't think this video will be irrelevant any time soon or that anyone will have wasted their six minutes :).  While some courtrooms have adopted audio recording systems, this is most appropriate and common in venues where some kind of record must be preserved, but an extremely accurate written transcript of the proceedings is rarely needed.  Oftentimes when a written transcript is actually needed from such a venue, the recording is sent to someone like me, and I charge a significant premium to work on it.  Such work is VERY time consuming and tedious compared to if I had simply attended the proceeding, and usually includes many instances of ""(inaudible)"" where the mic just didn't pick up what was said.  In the end, this can be far more costly than having a live court reporter and also fail to preserve important comments or testimony.

Myself, I mostly work directly for attorneys in depositions before trial.  In most cases they require a written transcript with quick turnaround, and damn near 100% accuracy is essential.  This need simply cannot be met by just recording, nor by something like Alexa/Siri - if you've ever seen bad automatic captions, that's how they perform in such a setting.  It's completely useless to litigants.

Thanks again, keep up the good work!"

"""They could just replace this elaborate system with recording audio""

Could they? I feel like a text version will always be required for ease of reference. Though I suppose replacing a live stenographer with after-the-fact transcription would be a heck of a lot simpler."
"That still often doesn't work so well. With someone there, it is easier pick up on certain stuff (like who said what), and they also can interrupt and make someone repeat what they said. Sometimes even ruffling papers or other things will mess up a mic. There are courts where they record and people transcribe later, but often there's more ""(inaudible)"" in it. Plus, for certain kinds of fast moving cases, they want a draft transcript right at the end of the session."

Ohio not having internet is a joke from someone who has never been to Ohio. The kuntry boys have their Instagram handles on their back windows
"As dictation becomes better due to machine learning, this should 100% be phased out. As others have mentioned though, they've been saying it would be a dead profession for 50 years, I think that has more to do with the lack of ingenuity and implementation more than lack of technology though."
"It also has to be done in such a way that it is actually worthwhile. Having someone there has advantages like having full context and being able to interrupt and ask people to repeat what they said. A lot of people underestimate what it'd take to actually do it right. You need various microphones. You need to worry about stuff like people shuffling papers or making other noises near the mic that could drown stuff out. You need people to be able to talk privately to each other and mute themselves. But realize that they haven't unmuted. Realize if a mic stops working suddenly.

So you need technicians and you also need someone listening to some sort of live mix of all the mics and making sure that it is all coming through ok and actually interrupting if something won't be able to be transcribed (and trained specifically to know what stuff will be able to be transcribed and what won't, which is hard if you don't do transcription yourself).

Then machine learning will improve but is still going to make mistakes, especially with people with accents. And still will never have full human context (like a JS tech conference where one of the presenters is named Jason and a lot of the talk mentions JSON). So you're going to need someone to sit through all the audio and look at the auto transcription and make any corrections. And you want those people to be skilled too. I've heard of places farming out transcription to multiple people in other countries. So they lose context by just hearing a small bit of the total audio, so certain stuff won't be obviously a mistake.

You can throw tons of money at it to try to make it work (and various courthouses have, often with bad results), but you also can just have one trained stenographer there that does it all, all at once. Then even can hand in a draft transcript to people right at the end of the session (helpful for fast-moving cases), which will already be more accurate than what AI can do at the moment."

I like how you talk about wasting time right into a sponsor that can waste time.
"Effectively speaking, this is essentially learning a whole other language, then drilling it into your brain enough that you can translate on reflex into hand movements as fast as people are talking."
"Kind of, though it isn't anywhere near as involved as a full language. You need to absorb various rules and built muscle memory, but you're still producing normal English in the end. I've only been at it a couple of months and can already write most stuff. And I think most people could get to over 100wpm in a year. The really difficult thing is actually getting up to consistent 225wpm to graduate. But I'm just doing it myself on my computer with open source software and a cheap hobbyist keyboard, so I don't have to worry about that if I don't want to."

"3:40 how is ""bp"" related to the letter n?"
"Often they aren't directly related. The steno keys are interpreted in a particular order (needed since multiple keys are pressed at once) and that order is affected by the most common starting and ending sounds in English for syllables. Like the starting consonant sound keys are STKPWHR. So that lets you write STRike, THere, SWurve, etc. The most common sounds are the initial labeled keys. Then less used sounds use combinations of keys, still influenced by location. Like HR is an L sound. Which lets you write SLeep, KLoser, PLain, etc.  In comparison, starting V is SR. Since that uses the first and last key of the starting sounds, it'd be harder to combine it with other keys, but that's ok since V is usually by itself before a vowel in English. Right side PB happens to be ending N sound, since that works well with the system. Like BEPBD would be bend. Or TEPBS as tense. Having it come before S and D works for many common syllable endings, as well as having it after R so things like TURPB works as turn."

"""52 strokes vs 11"" Well yeah if you calculate it in your advantage? :D After that moment it clearly shows it needs almost as much strokes keyboard vs stenograph :D Just because you press multiple keys simultaneously doesn't mean it's lower amount of key presses. When I type ""WORD"", it doesn't matter do I press W O R D in 0,1s interval or in 1s interval, it's 4 key presses. Even if I press them all the same time RWDO without minding the order, it's still 4 key presses."
"I dunno, I feel like this is kind of pedantic. In regular typing, you move one finger and a letter pops out. In steno, you move multiple fingers but they move at same time, and a syllable (or word or phrase) pops out. There's still 52 sequential motions for the letters to come out in qwerty vs 11 sequential motions in steno. Even though you have to release the keys before doing another stroke in steno (vs touch typing being able to overlap a new key going down before the first one finishes going up), it still ends up being less sequential motions, which lets it be faster overall."
Cicero was roman
But can you type fast CONSITENTLY?
"Yeah, I think a lot of people don't get this. The default for monkeytype is 10 or 25 words, out of the top 500 words I think. That's way different than keeping up with people talking for hours a day and doing it accurately."

"If you're curious, check out the Open Steno Project. There's open source software for your computer and cheap hobbyist boards using mechanical keyboard tech (like the EcoSteno and Uni). I've been learning it just for general computer use, and it is pretty fun so far."
"I find that odd. As a normal keyboard 110wpm and with training 120wpm I felt like I was in a top 1 percent. I guess not. It still comes in handy. People are jealous or get mad because they assumed you must type like them. So thus any complete rants or intellectual logic seems like as if I am trying; nope not really. I just speak English and on a normal keyboard can casually type at basic conversation speed. One man's tryhard and practice is a <1%'s 3 minute logical retort or comment; so I guess I see why, but for me it'd just be presumptuous to claim your ""writing an essay"" is like my own ""casual speed""."

"Hey a cool nonpolitical video, nice."
"The reason why court proceedings are recorded as transcripts is that the attorneys involved in a particular case need to be able to refer to the transcript of the previous hearings that they had in that particular matter, among other reasons.  Since the transcript is going to be used as a reference, it has to be verbatim, accurate, and readable.  There's an entire industry dedicated to making this happen.

Court reporters type every word that is spoken in the courtroom as the words are being spoken.  They also identify the speakers, do stuff with exhibits, swear witnesses in, et cetera.  After typing out the transcript, the court reporter will often send it and the associated audio to a scopist.  

The scopist will then edit the transcript while listening to the audio.  By edit, I mean that the scopist makes sure that any and all raw steno is properly translated into English, makes sure that everything is punctuated properly, and types in any words/sentences that the court reporter may have missed.  After the scopist finishes scoping the transcript, they return the transcript to the court reporter.  Oftentimes, the court reporter will then proceed to send the transcript to a proofreader - without audio this time.

As you can guess, the proofreader then proofreads the entire transcript before sending it back to the court reporter.  So if the court reporter chooses to hire a scopist and a proofreader, there are three sets of eyes on the transcript, thus ensuring that it is verbatim, accurate, and readable.

The court reporter will then add the final touches to the transcript by getting the cover pages taken care of and et cetera.  (I am not and never have been a court reporter, so I don't know much about what the final touches on a transcript are.)

Aside from court reporters, scopists, and proofreaders, there are two other professions that I'm aware of.  One job is being a videographer, whose job is to capture a court proceeding on video for reference purposes.  The other job is being a transcriptionist, whose job is to listen to the audio of a court proceeding and type it into a transcript from scratch.  While it might sound like transcribing is the same as reporting, court reporters have to type out a transcript in real-time and are required to type at a certain speed in order to get licensed.  Transcribers type out the transcript from prerecorded audio rather than in real-time and thus don't have to type so fast.

Court reporters and videographers typically work for agencies, whereas scopists, proofreaders, and transcriptionists are often self-employed.

My grandmother used to be a court reporter.  My uncle is currently a court reporter.  My mother used to be a court reporter, but she eventually had to retire because she developed carpal tunnel.  My mother then became a scopist  My mom's time as a court reporter and her time as a scopist combined adds up to more than 30 years.  Eventually, my mom taught me how to scope, so now I'm a scopist and third-generation of my family to be involved in this industry."
"wow I still have my steno machine, its a really nice field, unless your a guy and the lawyers are calling you a high priced secretarial bitch, other than that it pays well, plus you really want to have some fun, whenever someones starts bitching break out your stenograph and take down everything verbatim and read it back to them word for word, drives them nuts, its really funny, some people in the heat of the moment will say, did I really say that, umm yes you did I have it right here, out of the game myself due to injury, but what a fun field to be in."

Probably the most boring job in the world
My mom has been a court reporter for the last 30 years and she‚Äôs spent the last 20 trying to teach me how to type in steno and I still have absolutely no idea how it works.
"To be clear, ya'll: when you call 911, the operators have a minimum typing score of 120 wpm. That's with zero errors, of course. My mom worked for the VAPD for 14 years and got over 150wpm. 
I'm a computer nerd who, before voice chat, communicated mid-game entirely via keyboard. At my height I probably reached roughly 100 wpm, with at least one error. 

300 wpm. That's absolutely insane."
When I worked for county 911 here in Washington the minimum typing score was 40 wpm.
120 is extremely high for a job like 911 dispatch. 80-100 would be more than sufficient.
"Friend of mine was in the same situation (no mic), averages 120 (in German) with 3 fingers using caps lock, which is quite amazing to me (10f - 60wpm)."

"Used to work with court technology and parliamentary technology. At least where I live, Steno is no longer a thing in these places. An in room record keeper notes metadata on speakers. Recordings are made of all audio (usually multichannel - ie courts will typically record prosecution, defence, witness and judiciary separately - parliament often separates out the speaker and might separate the lecterns from the general assembly). These are then typically run through something like Dragon Naturally speaking to get 70-80% speech accuracy, and then are manually corrected and meta data and attribution is added. We also toyed with AI - however never got to deploy it due to data sovereignty issues and a general distrust of transcription without human oversight and verification, despite getting a 90% accuracy including attribution within 5 minutes of end of session. 95% if we had the speakers all commence the session with a pre-scripted introduction, and also did a pre-read of any complex/non phonetic words (ie last names, weird place names etc)"
"text-to-speech systems can do a lot of this now, along with simple audio recording.    also this reminds me of Chinese pinyin, which is a phonetic system and also very fast to type"

Cicero was a Roman
Rome. Not Greece. Cicero was a Roman who wrote in Latin. Tiro may have been Greek but we don‚Äôt know. His shorthand would have been Latin shorthand.

"I never realized that stenographers typed by chording until now. I'm partially blind, so I'm also used to chording, though in a much different way than stenographers use. However, as I grew up writing in Braille, I've always felt like I'm able to type faster in Braille than I can with a standard QUERTY keyboard, though my typing speed's not bad either. It certainly helps when I need to write a lot on my phone and can just enter my iPhone's Braille Screen Input, which is WAY faster for me than the on-screen keyboard.
For those who don't know, standard Grade 2 Braille has a lot of shorthand in it, like one cord for the words and, the, as, of, the, etc, as well as a lot of contractions within words. While physical Braille takes up a lot more space than print, it's pretty interesting when I think about just how much shorthand there is. To be honest, sometimes when I'm spelling things, I kind of have to translate OUT of the Braille contraction in my head, if that makes sense. I find it amazing that stenographers can learn to type by syllables alone."
@SeaMarie Thank you for all the info :)
"@Shawn Fumo It's definitely handy! I'm a good enough typist on a physical keyboard, but the little on-screen one is a bit of a pain. Also, I can't stand dictation and its inacuracies. For me, BSI is the only way to go when on my phone, and my Braille display's not connected. I remember using it about 7 years ago on my iPad to take class notes because I didn't have a working Braille notetaker at the time, my slate and stylus skills are ok at best, and very slow. I was sure glad to get a bluetooth keyboard, though, because BSI is kind of awkward on an iPad.
Also, slate and stylus is the precursor to the modern Perkins Brailler. (think Braille typewriter). You use a metal-tipped stylus to poke holes in the paper yourself to form Braille cells, using the slate to form the cells properly. The slate itself is metal or plastic and closes over the paper, with usually about 4 rows of I want to say 40 cells each. You poke the stylus through the cells on the slate so you can poke through the paper, dot by dot. Sound confusing? Here's the kicker: you have to write backwards to get the Braille to come out right on the other side. Right to left, e for i, r for w stuff. (e is dots 1-5, and i is dots 6-2 while r is dots 1, 2, 3, and 5 with w being dots 2, 4, 5, and 6. In standard Braille, there are 6 dots to a cell, in two columns of 3 with 1 2 3 on the left, 4 5 6 on the right, hence swapping around the dots I mentioned earlier).
Sorry if that was too much at once, but it's pretty amazing how Braille has come such a long way over the years. Personal anecdotes aside, if you ever feel like it you should check out VoiceOver, in an iPhone or iPad's settings under accessibility. Android also has a screen reader, TalkBack, which I'm not as fond of."

"jokes on you for assuming, I'm at 114 wpm"
There is no way an Alexa is going to overcome a stenographer. Stenographers can pause the proceedings and also can understand when people are speaking over each other.
"You don't need to use computers with audio recordings.  Standard practice in a lot of places is to record everything, then have people transcribe the audio into text via normal typing.  They have the advantage of being able to rewind and listen again, both to figure out what an indistinct person was actually saying, and using context to pick the correct homophone.  A stenographer has to do all that on the fly, and can easily get it wrong."
Even simple stuff like someone shuffling papers near the mic that makes part of what they said inaudible can cause havoc. What they said is just lost and is too late at that point to fix it.
"Well, there's different trade offs. Having someone there means they get a lot of context and can also interrupt if needed. I've seen transcriptionists say that their work ends up being worse since there's often stuff that can't be understood that a stenographer would have caught."
"My Grandma was a Stenographer, and still is at 75. Props to her!"

"@thefonz003 yeah, it is a different keyboard layout and works very different from normal typing. When you type normally, you press a single key and a single character is output. 

In steno, it is set up so that you type syllable by syllable. Your left fingers control the starting sound, thumbs are the vowel sound, and right fingers the ending sound.

The keys are interpreted in a certain order, basically based around how they occur in English words. Like the left side ordered STKPWHR so you could type STRike or KRush, etc. And less common sounds use multiple keys. 

The big thing is it is chorded. So you press all the keys at once. If you press KAT, the word ‚Äúcat‚Äù pops out. PRAOEUD is ‚Äúpride‚Äù (since AOEU is the long I sound). So at worst, a three syllable word is three ‚Äústrokes‚Äù, and often is less than that due to shortcuts.

It used a dictionary system that you can customize yourself as well. There are various ‚Äútheories‚Äù that map chords of keys to words in slightly different ways, though are overall similar."
"@Shawn Fumo, how are there fewer movements per second? I don‚Äôt quite understand - is it a different type of typing (pun intended)? Is it a different keyboard? I‚Äôve only used computer keyboards."
"I mean for steno, 225 is the minimum to be licensed, so thousands of people can do that speed all day. There's a lot less finger movements per second, so that lets it be faster. The steno record right now is 360wpm for 1min, though that did need a lot of correcting afterward. But people use steno for real time captioning as well, and that needs to be accurate from the start."

*For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. ‚ÄúHe who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.‚Äù*

I'm a 15 year old boy with 120-140 range :)
@Holter Domino Not sure I don't go there that often
Nice what‚Äôs your typeracer account?
"I am former Court Reporter.  If you can type 85 wpm you can transcribe most people as they speak in court.  Artificial Intelligence will never ever be the same as a human transcribing.  A human who cannot determine easily what's being said can watch the speaker's mouth, which makes a huge difference.  Court reporters should be positioned in the courtroom with a view of the judge and witness box."
Nice I could type up to 120 words per minute
"""I love slavery soooo much. Slavery is cool and good. Are you writing this down, slave? Did you get the part about how slavery is cool and good? No, no, you're right, that doesn't really sound like one of my quotes. How about, like, 'Slavery is the bedfellow of tranquil pleasures.' Yeah, hell yeah, I love that. Write that down."" -Cicero's Wisdom. Apparently."
"I learned Gregg at one point in order to document my caretaking for an old man. I've been slacking on it alot lately, but I also forgot how to speedcube too, so yeah... Stenography never made much sense to me because of the rearranged syllables and the liability for typos being as high as autocorrect though..."
"Let's be honest here. 
This is a pointless job these days with technology."
Not if you want an accurate record quickly. AI just isn't there yet.
I wonder what Johnny Depp‚Äôs stenographer had to type in for ‚Äúhuman fecal matter in my bed‚Äù
objection i type 150
My mom does this and it is confusing
Does LegalEagle have a beef against YOU too?
Great video... only Cicero was Roman not greek. :D
Still don't understand .
Audio to text?
Hey it's the infographics narrator
Why is the audio weighted to the left
My fastest run was 119 wpm
I feel like learning stenographer typing as I can use that for messaging or team chat
I'm using it right now to post comments. Check out the Open Steno Project if you're interested.
"my aunt could type at 120 words per minute.

cancer is a bitch."
So fast
I type 120 lol
God your videos are too long
So much filler
The 216 record is EXTREMELY outdated. New typists can go around 250. I wish people would stop using the top google search as their source.
how? they don't have auto correct and predictive text in their typewriters
"Because it is syllable based. So a 3 syllable word would just be 3 motions instead of each letter at a time. In practice, it is usually even less due to various short-cuts. They do have built in dictionaries which translate the presses to output words. I'm doing it on a computer with open source software right now, but the pro machines are little computers on their own with touch screens and hall effect sensors, etc."
Ohio has internet!
"Has anyone ever pushed to replace regular typing with stenography? Most people misspell when they type already if they even type. Plus, imagine being able to automatically type faster than you could speak. That's the same logic in using gaming controllers for real-life equivalent tasks (which has already been done successfully). Any thoughts, stenographers?"
I do think it would be cool if more people tried it for regular writing. Even for kids it could be helpful not to worry about spelling quite so early. There's a lot of people doing it as a hobby now that there is open source software and cheap hobbyist boards out there. Check out the Open Steno Project if you're curious.
"Based on this, I would expect live closed-captions to not suck so bad."
I used to work at one of the largest providers for live-captioning in the country. They were a different department but I made friends and learned. The live captions most networks buy for cheap are done by untrained voice writers paid very little. The company reviews on Glassdoor are a sight. Sooo there‚Äôs little incentive to make the captions good.
I'm 118 a minute in 6th grade
C√≠cero was Roman....

Have you normally spoken this fast? You're speaking just a bit too quickly for some portions of your video.
No internet in Ohio? True. Drove 20 minutes over the border to PA to watch this. It also took me five minutes to type this.

Umm why do you think dispatchers type so fast? We have radios. We just like...talk to the people who need information.
Did my man's really call Cicero a Greek?
she is definitely not the fastest typist anymore‚Ä¶ 216 is actually not even that crazy compared to the 225s i see in typeracer every day
We need a video on cheese caves I beg you
"""If you are a gamer you may type at 80-100 WPM"""
How is this NOT on trending?!?! This video has 1 million views already!!!
My top speed on 10FastFingers is 32 WPM. But I may type faster than that.
Stenography was one of those things I accidentally learned about when I misspelled the word 'steganography' when researching something for school. I went down one hell of a rabbit hole and managed to learn it well enough to type about 20wpm with my normal keyboard and some special software in about a week. Can't remember any of it now though
Cicero was roman not greek
shorthand moment
Recording is not a safe method of keeping things anonymous
Can you use it on Emacs?
Also Jeffery Epstein and John McAfee didn't kill themselves
I do 120 words a minute. But these are mad!
But does it *_THOCC_*
It can if you build your own board lol. The hobbyist boards use mechanical keyboard tech like the EcoSteno and Uni.
"When I write on paper or keyboard I can write as fast as people can talk, keep in my mind that only I have to read it"

Where can I buy one of these?
"Why is the women who could type 216 words per minute still said to be the fastest typist? 
You can easily find faster ones on YouTube or popular typing website leaderboards"
But Cicero wasn't Greek
40 word per minute. I wish.

"Stenography is epic. I want to learn machine steno, but I'm currently learning Gregg Shorthand (similar to pitman, but its light line, so its not as annoying to write) for fun. I need to get a stenography machine though lol"
The world record is actually 254 words per minute
"The average is 40? Wow, that's slow. I thought maybe twice that. That's sad."
Shorthand will always be needed. Emojis and texting is close to it modernly.
Jesus loves u all so much
Man I thought me typing at 130WPM was good but this video makes me question my life choices.
"""In Ancient Greece"", proceeds to show Cicero..."
"Isn't Cicero like, Roman? He was born in Rome, spent most of his life there as a senator and writes in latin. Or it's not the same Cicero we are talking about?"
"Cicero is Roman, not Greek."
"Interesting video, but you should fact check before uploading videos. Cicero ain't greek, he was a roman politician and philosopher."
Wasn't Cicero roman? I don't think you meant ancient Greece
"Stella Pajunas is definitely not the fastest typist in history, there are a number of people who can type faster today, however I see how you made your mistake - typing these days is very under covered and the 'fastest typists' according to google is extremely outdated."
Terrible video. Took way too long to get to the actual subject. Then glossed over it while apparently trying to speak the most words in a sentence ever. Plus royalty free stock footage b roll... lame.
"Ahh yes, cicero the greek"
"first off, i type at 150wpm when im just chillin"
i actually type at 27 wpm
Cicero was from ancient Rome
If its so good why dont we all use it instead?
When will stenographers be replaced by AI and voice to text?
"@CorelessKitKat I don't think you understood, AI training has to be done at first, by a human. To write the algorithms, etc. Then you train the AI over time and situations. That's the general principle of AI... and it's only for a little while until trained.

ya can't fight progress mate! Otherwise we'd still be horse carting around"
"@RootedHat A person correcting it and watching over the AI would be very unnecessary and just gives another job offer, stenographers do their job well already and it would cost a lot just for an AI to write down the conversations and have to hire another person to correct the mistakes. Much more practical to keep stenographers."
@CorelessKitKat yes but the AI could be trained by a real person for a while and then it's done. A person would listen and see at the same time what is being transcribed and could correct it. While the AI learns on those iterations.
"Unlikely as Voice to Text can be inaccurate and not understand when a person is speaking really fast, screaming inaudibly, etc."
So... stenography kind of works like hiragana?
Over 100 at 98% accuracy gang rise up!
I honestly would love to learn this. Stenographs are kinda expensive tho and it wouldnt really be useful as i dont type long stuff anymore. Typing papers like this would've been nice. Almost 3x the speed yes please.
Nah bruh I type like 3 or 4 words per minute üò≠
Cicero was roman
Stenographers are not going anywhere until audio transcription technology gets better because TV and Courts cannot afford to have the goofy errors that computers keep making.
I'm 13 and I type 100 wpm lmao
"I've all but given up trying to geta refund from this guy for trying out Curiosity Stream. Credit card was charged, website didnt work.  Now I'm corresponding with credit card company to have the funds reversed for a fraudulent sale. Stay away from this guy's products."
How‚Äôs Cicero related to Athens?
liked and subbed m8. the transition into sponsors what on point lmao
"While this is already a way more efficient system compared to normal typing, it still has its limits. The main one is having to be tied to a physical machine to do the transcription. If the stenographer doesn't have the machine or for some reason there's no electricity to make it work (imagine a courtroom having a trial during a power outage or a hacked computer system), then they can't transcribe anything. There are other stenographic systems that don't require any machine at all and can work just as well (if not better) with just pen an paper, so that it can be used anywhere and at any time. I tried to learn once, but it was too hard for my two brain cells. Maybe I'll try again in the future, but for now it's a no go for me haha!"
"@Merione Your main point is well taken.  I agree that no machine = no transcription.  That logic extends to almost everything in our lives.  No pen = no notes. Wet paper = destroyed notes.  The steno machine can be utilized in many, many different ways including in an academic setting.  Let‚Äôs say someone is hearing impaired or deaf.  A stenographer will sit alongside the deaf person and write what the professor is saying.  The deaf student has instant access to the words spoken in that moment by reading the translation on the computer screen sitting on the desk.   I find it implausible that a student could write the whole lecture verbatim even if that person uses another type of stenography system like Pittman or Gregg shorthand. On the other hand, using a recording device and having to painfully transcribe it later is not an efficient use of one‚Äôs time.  A steno machine and a recorder cannot be compared.  They are as different as futbol and, you know, football as played in the United States."
"@iriegalca Cool, I didn't know that they work on battery! But still, my main point remains: no machine = no transcription, and to me that's a huge limitation. I'm not saying that this system is in any way ""inferior"" (it's still a HUGE improvement on trying to transcribe natural speech with common writing), but there are other stenographic systems that are meant to be used with pen and paper only, and that could be useful in contexts other than the very specific case of courtrooms, trials or Parliament sessions, where there are specific setups for this. Just to give you an example, imagine going to class at college and using stenography as a note-taking system. Just pen and paper and you can transcribe the whole lecture exactly if you want to, instead of just taking notes. In my experience as a student, I've seen many people waste so much time recording the lesson and then painfully transcribe them all back at home."
"@Merione  Actually, steno machines have a rechargeable battery and another internal battery, so losing electricity or having no electricity would not be a problem. Most steno machines have internal memory and at the same time provides duplicate notes to several USB drives. The steno machine is not connected to the internet directly, so hacking would not be a problem either.  Now, a power outage could be a problem, but not for the court reporter.  Remember, the lawyers have computers with their trial strategies and photos of evidence to be shown to the jury.  The judge takes notes on his/her computer.  The courtroom clerk uses the computer to do his/her work.  What a mess that would be!  Everyone might as well go home after that."
Cicero was a Roman
"I hear telegrams are still a thing, too!"
"I've always wanted to learn some kind of shorthand, but never had the motivation to stick through more than a few hours of research and practice. I even tried creating my own shorthand in the hopes I'd latch on to it easier... no such luck."
"Joke's on you, I type at 40 minutes per word"

This is amazing to me
my highest typing speed was 52 wpm
A bit too juvenile and immature in here
I type at 154
my WPM is 110 and i‚Äôm in middle school ü§£ü§£
With their fingersüòÉüòÑüòÜ
"No, my average is 117wpm lmao, but it‚Äôs still horrible"
"i am in ohio and i can confirm, we dont have internet."
"Typing 80wpm on a computer keyboard is easy, try doing it on a standard non-electric typewriter."
"300 WPM on that thing is not 120 WPM on a keyboard, that looks way slower for whatever reasons"
"Yeah steno has less finger movements for the same wpm, so it looks slower. That is part of how it can work since otherwise it would be hard to keep it up for hours."
Cool
"I was a trial lawyer when the only record of courtroom proceedings was made and kept by a stenographer.  Their ability to function during hour after hour of sometimes tedious testimony, argument and requests to read back statements was amazing.  To me they are the hardest working person in the courtroom.  Then, at the end of the day, they may be requested to prepare of transcript of some or all the days testimony. If that isn‚Äôt enough, they may be asked to prepare a full transcript of a trial for an appeal.  Audio recordings cannot ask someone to speak up, repeat an answer, spell out a scientific word, identify a speaker, etc, etc, etc.... .  Sometimes a human cannot be replaced by a machine."
I decided not to study court reporting because I knew I couldn't pay attention that long and that well.  I'm amazed by the people who can.
"@Sobepome Recorded audio in courtrooms isn't just a microphone in the courtroom.  I've watched it.  It's basically the stenographer speaking into a special mic, so instead of typing everything they are hearing, they are speaking it.  But the court recorder is still the one controlling what gets put into the record."
"@Sobepome this is literally not worse. It makes a recording for later reviewing, automatically. It automatically transcribes on the fly for quick immediate review. The transcriber later is either automatic, operated by a human, or a hybrid. Offers 3 different approaches each with specific benefits for individual situations. There are no special typing job requirements or mistakes that can happen caused by stenographers that go down in permanent record. There are potentially multiple reviewers with a combination of machine and human interpreters for better integrity of transcription.

It‚Äôs simpler with most of the steps automated. It‚Äôs potentially more accurate if you dedicate a human to the task along with a machine. The job requirement is less strict. There is a permanent ground truth with audio/video recordings. You can decide what‚Äôs necessary depending on the task at hand."
"@Sobepome worse? How's that any worse? Plus you can have individual mics for people, they are cheap nowadays. Automatic transcription is getting better by the day. Even automatic abstracts are a thing already. And automatic level detection that asks the speaker to speak up."
"@Fabian So what you've done is reinvent the wheel and made it worse, good job."
i do type 40 wpm but one time it said infinite because of a bug lol
UPDATE!! I am watching this in Ohio so....watch your language everyone. We are officially on the world wide webs!
1:02 Cicero was a Roman Senator. Not a Greek citizen
"Reading?

"I learned to take notes from a TERRIBLE book called ""qualitative analysis"" in the end its about anthropology and anthropologists have to record quickly and accurately while interacting with their subject.

basically write rough notes on every other line on only one side of the page and when you have more time use your rough notes and fill out details on the blank lines and maybe draw a picture on the blank side or more detailed notes"
if ohio no have internet how i type this?
"I can transcribe dictations at an average 1.25x speed using qwerty and shortcut macros (of which I've made over 60,000). For stuff like TV shows/anything with multiple speakers, it's more like 1.75x. I'm not at all surprised that live typists need an entirely different system and, yes, the fact that they make 2-3 times what I do is honestly pretty fair lol"
"I have heard of at least one person who does live transcription using text expansion, though it seems fairly rare. It would be interesting to see how far text expansion can go, since it has the advantage of easier initial learning."
They have ‚Äúdigital court reporters‚Äù now. They sit and record the audio and then send the audio to a transcriptionist to be transcribed. I worked for a court reporting agency and had to format transcripts. The ones from ‚Äúdigital court reporters‚Äù were a pain in the ass to format.
"So if we look at it that court transcripts would already, when created, be ciphered. Good system to keep out prying eyes that ensures the secrecy of non-public information."
Kinda unrealistic that audio recording will replace stenographers since lots of people have accents and its very difficult for audio software to catch it all.
"0 chance the record is 216, i've hit 210 with minimal time and effort before. People are really underestimating how fast people can type nowadays"

"Cicero was a Roman, not Greek!"
This taught very little about stenography
I went to school for stenographer it was so fun but started to get carpal tunnel and it took years to go away completely!
"poorly, with a great many and sometimes egregious errors as to what wasn't said, what might have been said, what 'should' have been said, what it sounded like was said... in California the steno union practically guarantees a defendant cannot get an accurate transcript of what was said or by whom... also, the judge can choose the steno he wants, and leverage is provided for 'little favors' in transcript changes...  if they want to work again..."
Cicero was Roman though?
Mavis beacon powered me up to like 110 wpm
Cicero was Roman
"Time and time again over decades stenographers have proven their superiority when compared to audio recording and speech to text.  There is no substitute for accuracy, speed, and cost than a human stenographer"
Cicero was Roman not Greek and his secretary was paid not a slave as slavery was only leagal in the Roman republic when it was perpetrated against non Roman citizens

As someone from Ohio I can in fact confirm that we do not yet have access to the internet
The steno will not be replaced now in my country as there is lots of government job  vaccancies for steno in court (Supreme and High court) and there is lots of steno job in government and here most of steno become typist or personal assistant of government officials.

"Yeah‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no way audio recordings are going to take over stenography anytime soon. Courts and judges hate them.

"They tried automating medical transcription where I worked, and it failed spectacularly.

I type 90 to 95 words per minute. I've never had a job where that skill was relevant.
"My sister got her degree in court reporting around 2000. The stenograph printed the output onto a receipt roll, which she would then have to transcribe into English afterwards.

Fun fact: ""FPLT"" was full-stop (ie. a period, end of the sentence). I believe there were other such abbreviations for non-sounds (eg. comma) or inflections (eg. question mark), if I recall correctly. Of course, this was well over 20 years ago, and my sister decided not to continue pursuing that career, so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details."
There are keyboard companies starting to develop stenographs so it's not completely useless.
How do they not make typos?

I first read about this idea in the Kingkiller chronicles and thought it was super cool and original. I should have known nothing is original.
haha I have 105 wpm

Not at all! He was a Roman."
"I tried to learn stenography a few months ago. I learned to type using a DVORAK keyboard layout about 15 years ago. And I'm currently learning the standard layout for a Russian Keyboard. So I figured it shouldn't be any different than learning a new keyboard layout. Oh boy was I wrong. It was absolutely nothing like it and I gave up within an hour haha. Maybe I'll try again some time later. But holy crap, learning to type with a DVORAK layout didn't even come close to being that hard. As for the DVORAK because I know people will be curious, I learned it because I had heard all of the usual things about it being faster, feeling more natural, being less stressful on the hands. Things of that nature. So about 20 years ago or so, I gave it a try and couldn't stand how slow it was. I was using a chat program to learn and I couldn't keep up at all.

So I gave up after a week or so of using it off and on. And every few months to a year I would try it again for a few more days or a week or whatever. And yeah, it was really slow going. Really frustrating. But what surprised me is that learning the actual layout was only the easy part. You would expect that once you learn the layout, it would be easy from there. But that was just the first step. Most of actually learning DVORAK was being able to ""fluently"" form the motions with your hands to type the words. The so-called muscle memory. So it was slow until I learned that for each word.

As far as DVORAK being faster or better than QWERTY in any way. Like I said, I've been using it steadily now for 15 years and I've noticed no improvement over QWERTY. It might feel a bit more natural. A bit more comfortable. But that's it. It's no faster or anything. Or if it is faster, it's not by very much."

On average you're probably pretty average
I did not understand what¬¥s going on in the head of the typer and how he knows what to press.
"I'm surprised *dvorak* wasn't mentioned :P I tried learning it... but man looks as hard as steno, hard to get your brain to rewire differently after using qwerty so long."
Don‚Äôt let me catch you nowhere that Ohio comment got you done in üó£
"Audio is currently rubbish for legal records. I‚Äôve headed numerous PACE interviews, which are digitally recorded. What an utter nightmare to try is find distinguishable distinction‚Äôs when listening back. For example, a mumbled reply, which to one person is more audible than others, translating accents, speech impediment‚Äôs into a sensitive mic, two voices that are very closely related may be difficult to distinguish. You cannot go back to that date and time and say, ‚Äúoh, repeat that sentence please‚Äù if it‚Äôs not clear. It may be a minor as a background rustle that can distort the sound, and that particular word is lost. In court, presenting the spoken word, for example in evidence, the stenographer may interrupt and ask for the word to be repeated. The digital recorder is no where near intelligent enough to send an audible signal to alert the speaker to repeat the word, not yet anyway.  Stenography is an art, not only of recording, but listening. Why change something if it ain‚Äôt broken. Changes for change sake, and typically modern, resource hungry thinking, yeah let‚Äôs use more resources to make equipment that can break down and cost a fortune, then employ some poor soul to check the recording against the audio, plus when it needs an upgrade (as its no longer supported or it‚Äôs not reliable ), let‚Äôs buy another one and keep swallowing up resources, and your left with a load of junk that‚Äôs only 65% recyclable. People are pretty cost effective, they have a place in the world, and I know the stenographer is here to stay for a long time yet, thank goodness! Your much better than some polluting, plastic box, full of resource hungry parts, travelling half way around the world on a container ship, onto a truck, into a van, all guzzling diesel and polluting the planet! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

"I wonder if you could adapt this to phone keyboards. The need to register multiple buttons at once could be prohibitive, though. Also, you'd probably need to get it down to two keys per syllable, which is a tremendous alteration. But necessary because of how people hold their phones and type with their thumbs. If you could get it so that you could hit all three keys in any word with one hand, you could probably do better, but you still need two hands - one to hold the phone and one to type. 

Maybe something with the swipe-typing that some phones allow now? Swiping over 3-7 keys for even long words would still be faster, I imagine, and would allow for the combo-letters that get pushed together. 

Combine this with the same computer interpretation that modern stenographs use, and it may greatly accelerate text-typing speed."

"I actually ran into a Stenographer last year. She said that many court rooms are recording AND trying to incorporate Human Stenographers because the human ear can detect the conversation better than when the audio cuts out or there is crosstalk and muddies the recording. Hence, she said there is a need for them now more than ever!"
"I hope that is the case. I am in medical transcription (23 years) and it is a dying breed. We are being replaced by voice recognition and outsourcing. I am interested in stenography, seems like an obvious transition, but was wondering if it was going away due to technology. I don't think our medical records should be left to a machine to decipher what the doctor's say either, but it is happening. Sad really."
"There are dummy heads that perfectly capture the audio like a human would. You can use headphone and listen to it like you were there.

The advantages humans still have is the combination of different senses together. You can turn your head towards the one speaking and you can see their lips moving so there still is some better comprehension."
@ThePussPeeper Oh I agree with you on the nuance. I'm talking human error of activating recording devices once they're off for private conferences being a negative of the digital devices.
"@Alexander Keane everyone saying ""the human error"" as if that's the end all argument of why we should have it be automated when the clear and more thought out answer is: ""typically, the computer-error element is more rampant and misses context that a skilled human in this trade would pick up, so in this scenario a skilled human works better than the computer"". Does this make sense for everybody?"
"@fx Gamer There's also the human error factor when things go off record, like the judge near me who switched off the recorder for a conversation then realized it had never been turned back on for months."

honestly if it wasnt so complicated and would require relearning what ive been doing for 15 years now id happily learn stenographyjust for the efficiency

Fact check: if you want to be the fastest typers you need to type faster than 250 wpm not 216. If you want to be the fastest female typer then 216 might be all that you need to beat since online typing accounts usually don't say what gender the user identifies as
Sorry sir but Cicero is not from greece

They won't be replaced since court records needs to be saved  and it takes way longer to hear a court case that lasts say 10-15 hours than to just read it or find what you need. You read way faster than you hear and people sometimes are hard to understand. Unless you can't read you're not going to mistaken a word for another word.

"My great grandma became a stenographer for a modeling agency after finishing school at 14. (Our family was really poor back then, so that was already a long time for her to go to school.) Her dad taught her and her sister shorthand when they were kids so that they wouldn‚Äôt have to work factory jobs. (Meanwhile, her mom went hungry to afford violin lessons for her brother, and he later became a professional violinist.) 

She and her siblings were the first people in the family to have a white-collar job, which was especially impressive because she was a teenage girl when she was employed. (She also later went on to be the first family member to attend college when she was 40, which she got into despite not having gone to high school because she knew Russian due to being a communist as part of the resistance in Nazi Germany. At one point, she was caught and was sentenced to spend 18 months in solitary confinement, but she only actually spent half of that time alone because she was accidentally given a cellmate, which saved her from committing suicide due to the months of psychological torture she endured, but that‚Äôs another story.) (Also, come to think of it, my mom has said several times that she would‚Äôve been executed if she had been arrested _during_ WWII rather than a few years before, but I wonder if they were hoping to torture her to death instead considering that she eventually became suicidal and extreme isolation is considered a form of psychological torture.)

Anyways, not only was she a teenage girl from a poor family working a white-collar job, but stenotypes weren‚Äôt widespread yet since it was 1921 and she lived in Germany, so she wrote in shorthand with a stenography pen and paper, making the feat even more impressive. (Also, writing that made me realize that she went to _school_ in WWI Germany. Holy shit. I couldn‚Äôt even finish school in an upper-middle-class American household during peacetime.)"

"In my experience, at least in depositions, stenographers will record testimony just to be sure what they've transcribed is correct.  Deposition witnesses are also provided transcripts of their testimony to review and correct.  But even with all that, many stenographers do an amazing job."
"@BrassSnacks I only practiced for a few years but I did take a bunch of depositions.  I don't recall ever sending a transcript for a witness to review. That may be because I never represented a witness in a deposition.  But I've been deposed twice.  Once as a college student I was a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit arguing having to pay a mandatory fee to NYPIRG was unconstituional.  Many years later I was a plaintiff in a personal injury suit in a NY State court.  I had been rear-ended by a garbage truck while I was stopped at red light totalling my car and messing up my back.  On both occasions, my lawyer sent me copies of my depositions to review for accuracy.  Even the best stenographer  could make a mistake.  No one is perfect.  But if a witness made an admission in a deposition, but ""corrected"" it by deleting that admission it would become a question of fact for either the judge or jury to determine what had been said in the deposition.  The stenographer could testify and any recordings could be entered as evidence."
"I have never heard of a witness being allowed to ""correct"" a transcript. They're not exactly a neutral party. The record is the record. And stenographers will records, because why wouldn't you? Low effort and when it pays off it pays off huge. People talk over each other, interrupt, spill coffee on your lap. It only makes sense. That said, the audio is never going to be as good as hearing it the first time, so when the audio isn't clear but your notes are, you trust the notes 10 times out of 10."

I am sure there will be an AI at some point that converts audio into proper captions with indication of the speaker every time. An AI just has to be trained enough to do so.
"@The Other OhlourdesPadua
Yeah there will have to be a lot of samples to feed it and correct it but after it is complete then it will have applications in literally every field and not just the court of law. Even something like YouTube subtitles will be perfect. And then we just have to develop something that can pinpoint some person's name in the recording and the AI will take you to that voice so you won't need paper anymore."
It will need a lot of time to understand words not picked up by the mic or were garbled. Or spoken by those with thick accents. Or an intoxicated one...

"TIL stenography is basically just Hangul with extra steps. Also: incremental orthography changes to make sure your orthography only lags behind sound changes in your language by a couple of decades max so that you don't end up with a system so far removed from the originally intended 1:1 sound/phoneme:letter correspondence that a) spelling bees can exist and b) any attempt at reform would be such a drastic (publicly unacceptable) change to vast numbers of speakers that it's just not realistic (see English, French, and I'm sure a few more languages both European and non-European for examples)."
@Vojtƒõch Janda Oh completely! Hangul is smart as hell and rightly well celebrated.
"@Elizabeth Grace not surprised tbh. Especially considering even Hangul still uses 1:1 phoneme:letter ratio. But it occurred to me that it's quite funny how long much longer it took European civilisations to develop something that, in a way, mimics the creation of 15th century (IIRC) scholars elsewhere in the world. Of course, different usecases and all, but... I just wanna say that Hangul is a super smart way to write, heh."

The interesting thing is people still have to transcribe the recorded audio into written transcripts, she did this as a side gig. She used a transcription machine plugged into a computer and would play the audio into headphones and use foot pedals to control the playback plus a few other software hotkeys and type on the machine while her computer brought up her output and the translation on a split screen. She was a demon, the audio was playing at close to 2x speed."

"Im a newly graduated stenographer, our profession has constantly faced the argument that AI will replace us. They‚Äôve said this for as long as computers existed and guess what, it still hasn‚Äôt replaced us. Our skill and ability will always be better than what AI can do. When you watch  the news and see ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a tomato coming‚Äù instead of ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a tornado coming,‚Äù know that if a stenographer were captioning, you would go to the basement and not the garden.
Edit: to all the people saying AI will take my profession away, it won‚Äôt. There is a system in place that advocates for humans to be in the room writing the record, writing a class for a hard of hearing individual, or captioning a broadcast. The only reason any type of digital reporting is used is due to a lack of reporters available. So I‚Äôm done trying to convince people I‚Äôll have a career for life. I know I will and everyone should be advocating for human beings having jobs and not fighting that AI will be better and take over."
Imagine reading this comment and getting offended on the behalf of all AIs üò≠
"my job involves training people virtually, and normally we just use the auto-generated captions. however, when we are training a deaf/hoh person, we actually pay for someone to do the transcriptions because we know the auto-generated ones are completely unreliable, especially when you are talking about technical topics with a lot of jargon."
Yeah right! :)
@Elizabeth predictive machine learning is progressing at a rapid pace from 2013. Guessing that the tomato should be tornado is already possible at a much more advanced level. AI can already create a 4k image from 720p through neural network. You better pray the groups you've mentioned lobbies well. Or else you might be out of work before you even get to retire

"It's a good field with plenty of demand. It takes a lot to keep a court room going, and stenographers are a crucial piece.

Not glamorous, but it pays the bills."

"Can you be honest with me ? Do you think your a good person? Yes ? How many lies have you told in your life, have you stolen something, even if it‚Äôs little ? Have you ever used Gods name in vain ? Jesus said whoever looks at a women to lust for her has committed adultery with her in his heart, have you look with lust? I‚Äôm sure we have broken these commandments. So by your own admission via your conscious you have admitted to being a lying thieving blasphemous adulterer at heart do you still think your a good person ? You have to stand before God on judgment day, now if He judges you by those Ten Commandments do you think you‚Äôll be innocent or guilty? Sin is so serious to God that He gives us capital punishment, death for our sins. The Bible says for the wages of sin is death, we earn death because we sin against God. But God provided a way out of hell. God ""Jesus"" in the flesh lived a perfect sinless life and paid our fine we owed God from our sins by suffering and dying on the
cross. And on the third day He rose from the grave and defeated death, it was impossible that death could hold Him. And if you want to be saved you must repent of all your sins ""which means turn from them""and not live a hypocritical life which means you say, I'm a Christian but still lie, steal and fornicate, and you must trust alone in Jesus not in good works or you being a good person and the Bible says God will give you everlasting life. ‚ÄúIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.‚Äù  ‚Ä≠‚Ä≠1 John‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠1:9 Please think about your eternity, you can enter it at any moment.

"This is interesting.  My mother knows Pitman shorthand and she would use it when I was a kid to help me write down the lyrics to songs I liked (before the Internet came along).  It just seemed totally incomprehensible to me.  I had no idea that's how a stenograph works.  It does beg the question: why don't all keyboard work the same way?  People can't type and rely on autocorrect and spellcheck, so why not go the whole way and teach everyone to be a stenographer in school.  Heck, my mother is in no way of above average ability, and if she can do it then why can't we all?
Also, I had Audible, but it's really very expensive, with audiobooks costing more than actual books, by quite a lot.  Plus it's harder to lend your friend the book.  I found there are plenty of other things to listen to that are just as interesting as most books, and don't cost anything.  Many classic books written by long dead famous people have no copyright, so you can find people doing a damn find job of reading them on YouTube and elsewhere."

"I've always found it spooky that stenographers stop typing the moment the person stops talking. You'd think there'd be a tiny bit of a delay.

I wish I'd learned manual shorthand in high school. I was terrible at taking notes in college because I have ADHD and a bit of OCD, so would constantly hesitate over which words to write and how to write them. By the time I wrote down one item the professor would have covered several more. Couldn't take the typing and shorthand course in high school - it was a ""girl's course."" Not closed to boys, but virtually none took it. (1970s) Plus, it didn't use the academic part of the brain so I might not get an A, which would screw up my GPA for college. I considered taking the course but couldn't afford the hit to getting into top choice colleges or to scholarships."
Shorthand should still be taught for this very reason.
@Don Jones The last section is all that mattered. Great to hear you found enjoyable profession.
"@Tappajaav  Went to the top university in my state system (NY). Applied to only a couple of private schools, was afraid of the tuition and *non-tuition costs,* and so was my family, so never really investigated scholarships. Was a disappointment to my guidance counselor, I was her only student ever who had a real shot at getting into Harvard, but I wouldn't even apply. (SAT scores were really good, aside from a great GPA).

Ultimately none of it really mattered since I had ADHD, which was unknown at the time, and didn't know how to cope with it. Plus another personal problem (no, not drugs). So I dropped out twice and never graduated.

Serendipity kicked in, though. An extracurricular activity turned into a career. There was a student run ambulance service, and a couple of years later I became a NYC paramedic. It was a rewarding career - immediately rewarding, day by day, which most careers don't provide. Never would have ended up with it if I'd gone to Harvard.  :)"
Retrospectively did the _top choice colleges or scholarships_ really matter?
Thanks bruh. Still don't know how Stenographers do their job. But thanks.

This would bring the total time wasted from this video to at least 10 minutes. Poor Sam from Half as Interesting really low balled that estimate."

"Much like the sketch artist, the stenographer is likely to not lose their job to technology because there‚Äôs likely something in the law, the procedural docs for courts, or the constitution, that either makes the tech illegal, or mandates the type of records the court is supposed to have."
"Not the case where I am. The courts can fairly easily regulate their own day-to-day proceedings. Only a few states are strict about having trained stenographers or voice writers, who use basically a verbal stenography."

Thousandth comment
"Sorry, Stella was not the fastest typist in history. Cortez Peters was. He competed in twelve international typing contests throughout the course of his life; winning all twelve times.

Cortez set a typing world record of 225 words per minute without a single mistake (an average of 18.75 keystrokes per second). His top recorded finger speed was 297 words per minute.  

I taught the Cortez Peters typing method (using his textbook) to vocational students for years."

Bro what the fuck. You're going to take one of the most well known proponents of the Republic and gonna call him GREEK? Your wikipedia article at 1:38 even says ""Latin."""
yeah i watched historia civilis
"As someone who does transcription and captioning of recorded audio and video, yeah no, stenographers are needed and hella impressive. I couldn't do it.
AI is nowhere near what you think it is, humans are always having to go in and correct it. And do you know how many recordings sound like they've been made on a potato at the bottom of a lake in the next county over? There are countless reasons why especially in a courtroom, recordings won't replace stenographers anytime soon"
I encountered some stenographers in colleges to help out students with some form of disability.

"In the USA, doctors and pharamcists tend to use American/Gregg shorthand."

40 words per minute? I don‚Äôt practice but damn I ain‚Äôt that fucking slow
Cicero was a ROMAN!!!
I worked as a registrar (clerk) in Superior Court. The real-time steno setups were impressive. The reporters (stenos) made fortunes on big trials doing real-time and daily (sometimes twice daily) transcriptions.
how dare you call cicero greek. HE WAS A CONSUL OF ROME!
"Stenographers can write faster than people speak

"Listen, I love stenography and shorthand. I love it to bits.
I wonder how long stenographers will last. Hopefully plenty of time yet."
"that last pasrt seemed like a no brainer. . .why don't they just record everything on video and audio? why do they still even ""need"" the stenographers?"
On my school chrome book I type 94WPM and I‚Äôm in 4th grade
"Honestly, I never really understood the average speed of typing. I'm not trying to boast, but I don't do any jobs or anything like that, and since age 10 I've been able to type an average of 100 WPM. Maybe it's the piano that's helping?"
I do up to 100 wpm
"Stenography probably won't ever be phased out because having manual backups and transcriptions done by a person is just simpler. You would need to mic up the whole court room to make sure no one is misheard and that the audio is perfectly clear, and you wouldn't easily be able to go back and relisten to something that was said in court (like when someone says things like ""Can the court repeat what X said 10 minutes ago regarding Y"" and the stenographer reads out what was said) a stenographer can signal the judge to ask someone to repeat something if it wasn't clear enough, a machine cant, it just dutifully records and if the playback isn't clear enough, well, that's past you's fault."
"I never knew Cicero was the guy who said ""I love slavery soooo much. Slavery is cool and good. Are you writing this down, slave?"" That quote is a top favorite of mine"
Cicero non graecus est
"I tryharded on Mavis Beacon way back when and capped out at like 132 WPM, and averaged around 110, but in actual typing Im closer to only 70 because idk what i want to type mostly."
Excellent video! But just a small note. Cicero Isa Roman not a Greek! So ancient Roman would be a more correct way to discribe him!
"The average person types 40wpm in 2022?

"And if you're a hardcore gamer, THEN you can probably type at 100WPM"
"While stenography may be waning in relevance in the court room, they're as important as ever when it comes to live broadcasting. Automatic speech recognition will simply never be as accurate as a human being typing what they're hearing. It struggles with identifying speakers and also struggles when there's a lot of back and forth between multiple people. For that reason, stenography will always have a place in the world, specifically in broadcasting."
Also writers and programmers can also learn steno to reduce RSI.
We also assume the correct word when sounds are similar by its context.
back in the early 1990's i did field service on computers used by transcribers ..that was the people that would receive the print out from stenograph machines and they would type the real words into a computer which would print out a transcript of the hearing...the transcriber could also listen to audio and create transcripts also..i watched one of my clients work and it was amazing to read a piece of paper with just random characters and read the text she was typing....
"I‚Äôm a paralegal, I‚Äôve been in courts where they will have the stenographer AND are recording to a separate computer too. I guess having a duplicate record is good for any later dispute over what happened during a trial."
Is there  a reason that courtroom still have stenographers when everything can now just be recorded or video taped?
"Answer: Aside from legal impediments (transcripts are legal documents, recordings are not), no judge or lawyer wants to spend hours forwarding, rewinding, and repeating hours-long recordings just to get a specific statement. And you're essentially screwed if the mic didn't pick up any particular word from the speakers either through technical fault or human fault (meek voices, thick accents, slurred speech, etc). It's like comparing reading a novel vs. listening to the same novel as an audiobook: despite the effort needed to print the novel, at least you can just look it up if you want a particular passage, compared to spending effort going through an hours long audio book to find that same passage..."
"Neat, but anyone who works for the cfpb can do this on a regular keyboard. I know because I used to work there."
"I feel like theres no way the average person types only 40 wpm, I can type about one hundred, and my friend has hit almost 200?"
"The issue with recorded audio is that it's prone to not picking up whispered words or blows out when people shout. So while it's a good catch all, a stenographer ensures the collection of ALL things said in the courtroom and whom said them."
"Or worse, a person with a thick accent. Or an intoxicated person..."
I just wasted 6 minutes of my life. This guy could have at least presented the audible commercial in shorthand.

4.5 Minutes!
"I did medical transcription for 25 years, and I could transcribe 90 words per minute.  I could take dictation off of a Dictaphone or a related system, and I used shortcut software, e.g. I could type ""EGD"" and the software would spell out ""esophagogastroduodenoscopy.""  I could transcribe 15 minutes of dictation per hour of typing, which meant that the doctor who handed me a tape with 50 minutes of dictation on it and told me she needed it in 10 minutes was out of luck, and I also discovered early on that most doctors couldn't spell, so it was up to me to know how to spell the medical terminology.  I enjoyed the job, but, alas, I've been replaced by voice-recognition software, which as of yet isn't sensitive enough to do a really good job transcribing speech, e.g. I have seen some things in medical records that are truly mind-boggling."

You do realize that the end of this video you did not show examples of finished typed text on this stenograph. That's basically what the whole video was leading up to and it was left out. Thanks...
"I think that this would be a good skill to learn because even though I'll probably never use it in a court room, because it's certainly faster than journaling. Typing is fast to write down my thoughts but sometimes I just think too fast or make a spelling error that I have to fix or mess up in some other way and I forget what I'm talking about entirely. Sometimes I write and then fill in words later on so I can write as fast as I think but it gets messy at times. That's why it'd be great to learn this!"
"@J. Larspers i've tried those things. Even when i tried to speak clearly and with the right mic position, it still messes up words often enough that typing on my thumb is faster. And it also only support English."
‚Äã@J. Larspers Do you talk the same way you write? Do you like talking out loud to yourself for extended periods of time? Are you even in a setting where you can talk out loud? News flash: different people... do things differently.
"are you guys serious? there are transcription functions in most text processing apps (Word for instance). Just turn it on and speak into your microphone...

only reason to use a stenographer is because a human can intelligently listen and filter out who is speaking and only write down the important things with more accuracy and accountability. You probably need a sophisticated array of microphones + artificial intelligence to fully automate & replace stenographers"
"Yeah, getting text down at speaking speed would be a fantastic skill to teach in schools I think. Would help greatly in college lectures üòÜ"
"So, where's that video where you teach how to commit arson? Asking for a friend."

"actually i'm quite sure that my average typing speed is around eighty or so, but that's on an app that adapts to how fast/accurate you type and gives you harder words and numbers and symbols and things. forty is too slow for me and i feel so frustrated when i can't type as fast as i think/speak"

It had a lot of spelling mistakes but it was very readable still which is all I cared about and I could easily clean it up later if I really wanted to, the other classmates I shared it with also enjoyed it. I guess I didn't realize this was a rare thing. I don't type normally though, I type with 2 hands that flow around my keyboard as opposed to the proper way of typing so maybe that's how I was able to do it. idk, I see all the time about how the proper way of typing is less efficient and could better so kind of glad I just learned it my own way and didn't learn it how its supposed to be taught. Also my way doesnt put any strain on my wrists or fingers and I hear about sore or tired wrist/fingers all the time in people who type properly, or maybe I'm mistaken."

"Stella Pajunas is not the fastest typist in history, very outdate information."
"Yea pretty confident that stenographers won't be replaced any time in the future I can see, because of the necessity in the legal system to keep records that cannot be easily corrupted, the need for the physical originals stored for backup and refference and because have you ever tried to find a specific point in an audio recording? It takes forever while stenographers can refer back to a specific point in HOURS of talking in a second.
A computer able to do this would be extremely complicated and insanely cost prohibitive. And since you would have to be able to move it around that would introduce the risk of physical tampering as well as electronic tampering."
Why don‚Äôt they just record the court room audio or whatever then type it later without having to be the flash + snoic

Both should be used for those who sign and those who don't.

"For those of you getting all bent out of shape, this video doesn't say that Cicero was Greek, only that it started with Cicero in Greece. That's a big difference.

For all we know it was seeded with Cicero in Greece. Not even the famous Romans lived their whole lives just in the city of Rome. Cicero lived and studied in Greece for a time starting in 79 BC where he could easily have become acquainted with the system of shorthand used there. Tiron's earliest work developing his system may have been in 75 BC, and this may have been inspired by his owner-then-boss's recent experiences in Greece.

Sure, _if_ that's true it's playing fast and loose with the meaning of who developed it and where, for instance, why no credit to the Greeks for their efforts and why no acknowledgement that Romans routinely developed their own systems within their own social spheres, but as wildly speculative and hyperbolic it is it's more accurate than saying this video said Cicero was Greek."

Genuine question: how long does it take to learn? I type a lot - mostly in an academic setting but also I sometimes find I have to transcribe. I‚Äôd love to know more about whether it would be worth it to learn stenography or just improve my qwerty typing speed
"It really depends on the individual learner. Some people gain the required speed in a short time, and some can take years to get to 300 wpm. When I went to school for it, there were students there who had been trying to get the required speed for years. It's possible to have a student enter and graduate before someone who has already been there for years before them. At least that's how it was when I graduated back in the 90s. I don't know if they still do it that way."
"It depends on what your goals are. In order to become certified to work in the profession in a court setting, for example, it often takes two to five years. 

Learning how to type on a stenography keyboard, and simply using it to replace the QWERTY keyboard, could likely be accomplished in a few months, to a year, depending on how dedicated you are. I worked as a stenographer for 5 years, and it took me 3 years to become licensed and certified. What is different about a stenography keyboard versus a qwerty keyboard, is that you learn how to type words phonetically instead of letter by letter, so it might mess with your brain when you try to type letter by letter, and spelling English words lol."
"It depends on the type of work you are doing. If you need to transcribe large volumes of text, it might be worth it even to get to a relatively slow speed such as 100 or 120 words per minute. As someone else said, it is a lot easier on your hands and wrists at lower speeds because of the ability to use fewer strokes. Also typing speeds are not directly correlated to steno speeds. I can't remember at the moment what the difference is but 100 words per minute on a typing keyboard is not the same measure as 100 words per minute on a steno keyboard."
"I think it‚Äôd be safe to say you could get to over 100wpm in a year. Also keep in mind if you type a lot that it requires less finger movement at the same wpm as typing so is easier on your hands.

Pro steno people aren‚Äôt just fast but are typing for hours every day."
It‚Äôs hard to predict when someone will graduate. It took me just under 3 years in a program with lots of other required classes.
"And for your next corrections video, it's pronounced Kick-kerr-oh."

During WW2 Winston Churchill made very high demands on personal assistants. One of the top stenographers in Whitehall would be invited to work for Winston and it was brutal. Some lasted one day. But a few with the right temperament and exceptional typing skills managed and thrived. No shorthand needed. Winston would dictate a letter and expect the PA to type it (most probably on a manual typewriter) and would hold his hand out for the complete letter when he stopped dictating. Winston asked one of the PA's to accompany him when he visited Franklin Roosevelt at the White House. She later wrote an autobiography about her experiences.
216 words per minute isn‚Äôt the fastest a person has gotten on a QWERTY keyboard‚Ä¶ some people can do easily 250 wpm‚Ä¶
40? I barely type and can average 85 WPM with a 94% accuracy.

"For anyone curious why court transcripts need to be written instead of simply audio:

I‚Äôm a law school intern at the district attorneys office and one of my duties is transcribing police interrogation videos for my supervising prosecutor. The reason being that she can quickly glance thru a word document and see what‚Äôs important and keep referencing it as she writes out her motions and stuff. On the other hand, audio files suck because you have to listen to the entire thing to know what the hell happened and u obviously can‚Äôt just skim thru it to find what u need or see what‚Äôs important as easily. Court records will always be written down as opposed to audio files. Additionally, there are microphones in court but sometimes people cough or whatever so it‚Äôs not easy to hear, while the court reporter is right there and can ask them to repeat themselves so the written record will be much more accurate."
@purplewine Court reporters can produce a realtime transcript every second and lawyers can search-find anything immediately for at least 25 years now.  My machine allows me to find any word spoken all day every day.  We read back immediately and the proceedings continue.
"@Random i presume you meant speech to text, but having the mental image of a courtroom speaking in Moonbase Alpha does crack me up.

Regardless, Speech-to-text software are not ideal. Google is a tech giant, and yet Youtube's automatic transcription are only at its best in videos where mic quality and accoustic are superb, and people are enunciating clearly and are not speaking at each other. In either """"""accentless"""""" american or london english. And as others has said, those situations all at once are incredibly rare in a courtroom."
Text to speech
"@Wayne those make sense, yet can be overcome, individual mics can still do the trick for mumbling. It's just a matter of time, eventually the typing part won't be needed and this job will be much less specialist than now. If more people will be able to do the monitoring, then it will be a cheaper hire."

"If this is based on how words sound, then would accent change what was written, for example when the first person talks about a ""Buton"" and when the second English person talks about a ""Bu-on"" would they be typed different on the machine."
"You don't know what the sylab is, and what language is? Just because some people are impaired or struggle talking words, doesn't mean the word is changing or how it's written.

i type at 110 wpm
The reason recorded audio won't be a thing is hecause the law needs a written record. Especially now so people can search for specific events or things said.
65 wpm actually here.

Honestly a topic I‚Äôve been interested and hits that itch for obscure topics spot on
I'm reading the comments. That's enough reading for me
I wasted 5 mins and 36 secs and not 6 mins. 1000000iq
I had a professor in college who was very hard of hearing and the university provided a stenographer with the equipment and a laptop to transcribe any questions that students had during the lecture.
Ohio does not have internet yet. Shots fired!
"My mother is a stenographer. Stenographers do a lot more than was discussed. Imagine not only typing everything that was said, but also discerning true words from ""uh"" and ""um"", labeling exactly who is saying what, dealing with people talking over each other, having to keep pace with a volatile conversation, having to remember any word on a dime, managing your own dictionary, etc. Furthermore, the claim that this video ""won't be relevant"" in the future is completely unsubstantiated. Not only is a recording useless without an official LEGAL record, a computer cannot make a judgement call like a human can; a computer can't judge on the spot which word was just spoken based on context, tone, subject, and other factors. This whole video sounds like a trivializing of this profession and it is shameful."

"Surely messing with us with that Cicero mistake, I hope at least."
"Great video! I'd also like to point out that voice writing, an alternative method to machine shorthand, is gaining a lot of ground in the court reporting and captioning field. It requires the reporter to repeat what they're hearing into a microphone while speech recognition software tailored to the reporter's voice converts it to legible text. The reporter or captioner also includes special punctuation and formatting commands such as speaker labels into their dictation to ensure transcript accuracy. Like machine shorthand, this comes with its own set of challenges as well, and it can take several months and even years to master.
Cheers to all the guardians of the record!"

"I heard a story about how a basketball player (I don‚Äôt know who) was talking with the stenographer during a break at a press conference and was amazed at how they could write so many words so quickly.

"Stenographer in training here. A big reason why stenographers aren‚Äôt afraid of technology is they are unable to differentiate between basic words let alone any nuance. Lets say for example somebody is trying to say three but they pronounce it as tree, a computer would still mess up where the human would be able to write it down correctly. Similarly if someone were to be asked if they killed a man and respond with ‚ÄúI did?‚Äù The computer would just pick up ‚Äúyou killed a man‚Äù ‚ÄúI did‚Äù so it‚Äôs pretty clear to see how that couldn‚Äôt work. Entire court cases have been thrown out because of this costing the courts tons of money.

Edit: let me also add that if stenographers were replaced by AI, black and other racial minorities would be greatly hurt as the AI are largely modeled off of accents found more commonly in white communities."
"@Larg04 The problem is that it takes understanding and inference to understand what a human actually is trying to convey or hide.  I absolutely believe we could create an AI to do it, but I question the ethics of it.

We want AI to do things humans can do. The problem is that we consider humans to be self determining. To create an AI advanced enough to understand why a human is doing what they are doing is to create an intellect approaching human. 

Even if it doesn't act or think anything like us, it may be capable of self determination or develop into something that can self determine. Thus should be considered sovereign and it is immoral to force it into our service by any means, to include programming it to serve us."
"@OspreyKnight We can't do it for now. We might in the future, i think it's stilly to think we won't every be able to train AI for that."
"@Larg04 The problem isn't that it can't record words. Its that it cannot understand nuance.

""He's going to kill the dog"" and ""He's going to kill the dog"" (amused inflection) is not something a machine can read accurately without damn near human level intellect. We humans struggle with it constantly. Its why we fall for lies. 

Rote recording of words is not what a stenographer does. We've been able to do that for decades. Stenographers interpret the feeling of the room into text so that someone reviewing later can understand that there is likely more to the story than ""he's going to kill the dog"". Being amused, shocked, enraged, or flat stoney all mean different things."
"Eeehh... for now. But just looking how much better automatically generated closed captions here work those few years ago when it was introduced, I think it's unreasonable to claim AI will never be trained to do this."

"My mum was a stenographer, she still has the stenograph from her time in Hansard. I tried to learn, but couldn't wrap my head around it, it's crazy impressive. She says that during conversations, her brain will translate the words into steno."
"Yes, somebody else does this!  I still mentally type conversations while I'm in them."
"‚Äã@thatlilweirdboi 
How long vowels work in steno is that you take the base letter and then add all vowels from the opposite hand to it to show that it's meant to be long, so the short A is just ""A"" but the long a is ""A EU"", long O is ""O EU"", long E is ""AO E"", long U is ""AO U"", short I is ""EU"" (due to there not being enough vowel keys) and long is ""AO EU"".
~
Exceptions to this general short-and-long-vowels rule occur when you have differently-spelled homophones that need to be distinguished, in which case one of them will emulate the spelling of the word instead of using the phonetic theory, such as ""steel""(STAOEL) vs. ""steal""(STAEL), ""sun""(SUN) vs. ""son""(SON) {in that case both are words that use short vowels, it's just that one of them uses the ""wrong"" letter in the original word}, or ""Cole""(KOEUL) vs. ""coal""(KAOL).
~~
{Side-note: (side‚Äìside-note: raw steno is in parentheses, with more-legible pseudosteno in brackets separated by a comma) as a result of this whole system, ""heit""(HE/EUT),[HE/IT]  isn't really a way you would decide to spell ""hate"" in steno, as that's moreso an International Phonetic Alphabet way of spelling since the IPA is quite literal whereas steno has its own bespoke theory which is a mix of phonetic methods that are practical to the stenotype layout with the addition of orthography-based spelling}
~~~
These exceptions also apply to sounds in the English language that are specific to certain digraphs and diphthongs, like the ""ou""/""ow"" sound in ""south""(SOU*T)[SOUTH] & ""cow""(KOU) {literally just an O and U like the English spelling}, or the ""oi""/""oy"" sound in ""coil""(KOEUL),[KOIL] & ""joy""(PBLGOEU),[JOI] {literally just an O and I}. A weird third example is that the the two different ""oo"" sounds in the words ""book"" (PWAOK),[BAOK] and ""moose""(PHAOS),[MAOS] borrow the AO spelling of the long-O sound since you can't just place the letter O twice in a row in the same stroke.
~~~~
{BTW, the left-hand B and M sounds are PW and PH because the letter P has a similar mouth shape to them {{the W and H are just because they're close and convenient to press as a combination with P}}, so there's actually a decent amount of thought put into the theory even behind seemingly-arbitrary letter combinations. The same logic also applies to TK for D {{T and D are similar}} and HR for L {{L and R are similar}}.}

The F is used as an S on the right-hand side of the keys because English uses both -st and -ts at the ends of words often, and steno's strict letter order uses TS so a different combination needed to be used in order to cover -st so that there isn't ambiguity or word conflicts. F was chosen to fill this role because it's phonetically a very similar sound to S, the only difference being where you place your teeth‚ÄîThe F is used to represent the right-hand V sound for a similar reason, only this time the difference is that the F is just air whereas the V has you vibrate your throat.


Basically: the theory is logical, albeit a bit messy due to needing to make exceptions‚Äîbecause it's trying to handle English, which is even more messy with lots more exceptions."
@Paul M That's the same way with playing piano and guitar it's a lot of repetition and muscle memory. You can play individual notes or you can play chords made up of several notes. I like the analogy.
@Jerm The majority of it comes down to Muscle Memory.
"I get the concept of typing a whole word at once like playing a chord on a piano,  instead of typing individual letters or playing individual notes. But it's probably just as hard as learning the piano and being good at it."

"I don't think Stenogrphers will ever be completely replaced as they are more than just a court recorder, they have a degree of control over how everyone speaks so there's less confusion. I think audio recording of court cases should be made standard as there's rarely such a thing as too many reliable sources. Stenographers also have the important job of transcribing all the notes and recordings into a readable transcript that is easily followed and understood so that anyone, especially lawyers and judges can study older cases for examples of case law and precedence."
I believe general audio recording is pretty standard as you say there is no such thing as to many good sources but a main point why stenographers aren't replaced is because of realibilty of course there is what you say as well but how many times haven't recording equipment failed or files getting corrupted for seeming random reasons and one might argue that its not that common and yea sure of you have some good equipment I might agree but depending on the court room it might see several hearings a day and for bigger courts the hearings might be hours on end and when they do fail no one will/can really notice it untill the hearing is over or during reses and there is no re-takes in court to patch up the missing parts like one would do for a video
"I'm not disliking because this video will be irrelevant in the future. I'm disliking because its ending is inaccurate now and in the future. Speech to text technology can not feasibly out pace human understanding of context cues, text formatting, and grammar well enough to ever render stenography obsolete. A live humans ears won't be as susceptible to interference and noise as recorded audio. 

This doesn't even get into how stenography can be used for purposes outside of speech transcription. It is in and of itself a fast form of text entry. There is no faster way to input language into a computer. Stenography can allow for faster coding and faster typing - thoughts into text. Ending this video by saying this technology will become dated is a horrible way of showcasing stenography."
"I hate typing class, so I proved my typing teacher wrong by typing 75 wpm without home row keys. It is very helpful."
"@ThatGuyWithAPC well, there are certainly _wrong_ ways to type, but you're right that the home row method they teach you in typing class isn't the _only_ correct way.

if you wanna _really_ fuck with your teacher, go into the Windows language settings and change the keyboard layout to Dvorak right before you leave class.  I use a Dvorak layout and I always get a kick out of how much it confuses people when they try to use my computer at work."
"@Guindo, The thanks, ive always hated home row since my typing teacher always said ""no your not doing it the RIGHT WAY"" and it just pissed me off since there is no right or wrong way to type imo"
"honestly home-row is just the easiest way to learn how to touch-type.  if you can touch-type without it, then you're fine, but I suspect you're still regularly glancing at the keyboard.

i suspect that because that used to be me. I used to type 70+ wpm without using home row and thought I didn't need it, but when I got older i sat down and forced myself to learn home row typing properly, and my average jumped to 90~100 wpm and I can touch-type blindfolded with very few errors per minute at those speeds. i can even feel most errors as i type them and backspace to correct without looking at the keyboard _or_ the screen.   so you might think you're doing fine without learning ""proper"" typing technique, but if you still need to look at the keyboard for normal typing (like, ever, at all), then imagine how much more powerful you _could_ be if you took the time to learn proper touch-typing technique."
My grandpa was a judge. And his stenographer taught me to type and read steno when I was little even before I learned to type on  QWERTY.  It honestly made it harder to learn when I started using the Apple II‚Äôs in third grade.

That is, if the court reporting company said they needed an original and 2 copies, we took 3 sheets of typewriter paper and layer a sheet of carbon paper between them.  Think of the set as a double-beef hamburger where the beef is the carbon and the buns are the paper.  My mom was paid per set.   When I was in college and looking for a part-time job she suggested asking at the company to see if they had any messenger jobs available.  They didn't but they pointed me to another one.  The next thing I knew I was photocopying the single pages and making the sets needed and then delivering them to the lawyers in Manhattan.  (This company had in-house typists that read the stenograph paper and typed the pages).  Got to learn the subway that way."

They do use it in the parliament.

"@Aramis Orts B√∂ttcher so, how do you write stenograms, protocols in German courts? Did you have special techniques or keyboards to this?"
"@Pola B ah, our famously long words that are combinations of other words :D"
"‚Äã@Grubby George Good question. Probably its like coding - this solution is enought for English - easy and by that popular. In the group of the most popular 6,000 words in English, the overwhelming majority are one- and two-syllables. In Polish, the words are longer and there are more sounds (and letters in the alphabet), and there are consonant clusters (like in other Slavic languages, sounds quite tough and rustles). We need less words to explain something, but that words are more complicated. Different word-endings gives them a precise meaning. There are notability in usage of each ending letters. And writing by latin letters as it sounds, plays a servant role. It may seem that in Polish we speak faster, but globally the amount of information per minute in all languages ‚Äã‚Äãis similar (limited by brain buffor or transfer). Generally this specificity (richness of sounds) makes Polish difficult to create a simplified device to write faster. Same as our speech apparatus must catch up with its faculties to produce all these sounds. Stenography keybord would require more key combinations. It turns out that no one appreciates this as worth the effort to construct, compared to adapting existing solutions. There was a manual shorthand record in Poland, but it was not mechanized and is currently not popular (it was used by doctors and journalists among others).
Probably Germans have the same issue- their words seems like clumps of words to give them specific usage/meaning."

"I can type at roughly 66 words per minute according to the test I just did with my own typing technique.
I could never get the hang of typing normally because my hands were too cramped on the keyboard"
@OverRide I don't know but my keyboard is a standard layout. Maybe it's because I grew up playing the piano and my hands just don't feel comfortable keeping my fingers so close together but while regular typing uses 8 fingers for the letter keys I use only 5 for the letters and put my pinky fingers on the left and right shift keys rather than pointer fingers on F and J to orient my hands and manage 66 words per minute.
"How hands can be too cramped on the keyboard if It was designed to accomodate for two hands and 10 finger use in the first place. Or maybe you're talking about some PET Style, ZX Spectrum or some EeeBook keyboard... I mean not using few fingers when typing is understandable, but both hands at and fingers at F and J are kinda must-have thing."
Looks like an alien language

"Recorded audio has some serious disadvantages as a primary record in many use cases, though it can be fine as a backup or supplementary record.  Those disadvantages are likely disappearing as technology advances, but given how far court budgets lag the rest of the world, it will be a long time until steno isn't a common practice."

"@–ê—å–∑–æ–Ω–æ Historically? I'm sure there's a significant amount. I think you're talking about a wire, the #1 usage of a mic in a criminal trial. It's messed up due to being worn under clothes, in a loud environment, usually at significant risk if the wire was discovered. 

Nowadays? A $25 mic on your lapel is much better technology than traditional wires, worn unobstructed from the sound, in a relatively stable environment (the courtroom). The rate of audio being messed up is nearly negligible; ""micing"" up speakers in this way is industry standard and rarely fails, let alone to such a degree to ruin a case."
@David Botos Do you know how many cases have been fucked over because of bad audio recordings being completely horrible compared to if they just had a professional to write it down?
@Allen Fortenberry Exactly! That's why stenography needs to be phased out in exchange for pure audio recordings. There's no better way to hear exactly what was said.

What i learnt from HAI is to stop the video a nanosecond after youtubers chain without warning into an obnoxious native add without transition.
1:13 really sounds like him :D
"Maybe someday AI will be as good as a stenographer, but for now AI is really bad at captioning speakers with any kind of accent or speech impediment (which is a lot of people). Even if AI were as good, it needs a high quality audio source which means you need people to install and maintain audio recording and storage technology, so how much labor are you saving anyway?"
"And the main issue here in my opinion is ""quality audio"" there is not many that knows how to properly speak in to a mic and yes there is some that is way better then others to capture any audio in the room but there is so much more to it then people believe"
"For anyone going ""Voice recognition could easily automate this job"", it can't, and here's why:
    1. Stenographers can correctly transcribe people who speak with accents that aren't American. Until Silicon Valley starts caring about diversity, I don't thing computers will be able to do that.
    2. Stenographers can distinguish individual speakers. 
    3. Stenographers can pick the right homonym. Without understanding the meaning of the words, a computer cannot distinguish homonyms. Maybe GPT-3 could do it, but it would be hard. Technical jargon and puns could make this extra difficult.
    4. Stenographers can type with 99.8% accuracy. Even when voice recognition can do the other stuff, it'll take years before it can do it with sufficient reliability that courts and TV broadcasts would be willing to switch to it.

I'm sure it'll be automated eventually, but probably not anytime too soon"
"@N Squared The biggest problem with audio recording is that you're forcing judges and lawyers to essentially spend hours forwarding, rewinding, and replaying those audio recordings (which can go on for hours) just to get to the relevant quote. Whereas printed transcriptions can be flipped easy and fast to find that particular statement.

Also having stenographer transcribe audio recording is just unnecessary. You're just making stenographers do the job you WANT gone in the first place, and force them to rely on a secondary source with no recourse for correction if it was a bad recording or the voices are garbled due to technical or speech issues like meek voices and thick accents..."
@David W. There are always backups. We're not idiots.
@N Squared Yes. At least invest in hardware just in case there needs to have Cross-referencing done. Just trusting the stenographers alone is madness.

"@Mr My keybords are always really simmilar to the schools actually. And I can adjust to a different key spacing over time when I get a new one.

My problem is I had a working muscle memory system that was different but about as fast as the other one. But the school decided to cripple my typing while seeing what it was doing for YEARS and getting me to a point where I still haven't recovered after about 8 years solely because ""I was doing it wrong"""
"@N Squared it's all muscle memory. We had those typing activities too. The problem with those is that we only were that good with the school's standard keyboard. All sorts of computers these days have different keyboard dimensions, layouts, & spacing. So the ""proper way"" only got retained by those who kept practicing it even as their equipment changed."
"In early elementary school I could do about 40. But (I don't know if the still do this) the schools spend several years teaching us to type the ""proper"" way and we had a yearly test where we could see how we improved from last year. Every year we did this (all the way through middle school) I was worse then the last year, except one year I tied. On my last test I could type at about 12.4 words per minute.

Nowadays' I have some weird mix of the ""proper"" way and what I used to do, but I have literally never recovered to what I could do in early elementary school. It feels like in the old days where they would beat kids for ""writing wrong"" for no real reason other then ""it was wrong"" except this time I could clearly prove the lessons not only weren't working but were crippling my typing speed"

"‚ÄúOhio does not yet have access to the internet‚Äù

I bet that on a computer Stella Pajunas could type even faster. On a typewriter she has to put more care into not making a mistake since she couldn't just hit backspace (well you could on some later typewriters but idk about ones from the 50's)
"The secret to getting to these kinds of speed is: you do not make mistakes.
Even on a computer, realising that you made an error, type backspace, and type the correct letter, will seriously eat into your performance. Especially the first point - your conscious mind is way slower spellchecking than your automated typing skills, so you're already several letters past the error.
If you made a mistake, you can forget these kinds of numbers."
Why would you record audio if you can have dragon running and output a searchable PDF instead?

"Do people learn to type?  I never learned, I just did it.  I'm sure stenography is way more complicated, but at the same time way more useful.  I do a lot of meetings and I wish I could take notes at the speed people talk.  We tried recording software and voice recognition software but frankly it sucked.  You have to train it individually for each person speaking because many people have different accents.  Having an unusual accent myself, I found that it garbled maybe 50% of what I said, and it was even worse with the French accents and Chinese accents."

@Mar Celo The point is probably that 40 wpm average is complete bullshit unless you are literally going to count your 90 year old grandma that types 1 email a year at 5 wpm because anyone that ever actually learned how to type goes easily 60 wpm and anyone who does less has not actually learned to type yet and is probably still staring at the keyboard to find letters

Stenography seems like a super high-pressure job that would break me.
"They tried to get rid of stenographers when Eisenhower was president! They tried it- it didn‚Äôt work out! I know- my dad was a court reporter for fifty years. Wrote Pitman, never switched to the machine. He worked in the US Southern District inFoley Square. At his best, he could keep write 350 words per minute. Sometimes it was annoying being with him as he‚Äôd always be taking shorthand on napkins, tabletops, etc, recording your every word."

"It isn't just Ireland that uses the ""et"" shorthand. That's just an ampersand (&)! You might need to squint a bit to see it in the form used by the most common fonts, but even though there are several different ways to write an ampersand, they're all derived from an E and a T smushed together.

In fact, in texts written around the 1700s (and, I'd guess, earlier as well), you'll find that a lot of people ended lists with ""&c."" This is exactly the same as ""etc."", which (for those who have only ever seen the abbreviation) stands for ""et cetera"", a Latin phrase that translates to ""and the rest"".

(Also, as others have pointed out, Cicero was Roman, not Greek. Otherwise, I guess we'd probably have some shorthand based on the Greek word ""Œ∫Œ±Œπ"" instead.)"
"Oh, wow, I must not have even been looking at the screen at that moment. I distinctly remember seeing an entirely different sign with a fancier ampersand on it, but I guess I made that up. Thanks for the correction. I guess my whole comment is now just a set of fun facts about a mostly unrelated topic. :)

I'd argue that nowadays, & works as a kind of shorthand in practice (it's faster than writing ""and,"" even in cursive), but definitely not the kind of shorthand that can make writing as fast as speech."
An ampersand is more like a ligature than it is shorthand. What was meant was the single stroke hooklike 'and' sign.
"But the sign shown in the video isn't an ampersand, it's a different form of shorthand. It was a major novelty of the Tironian notes that they were often _not_ just based on the normal letters but separate, easily writable forms for syllables and words.

Edit: He's referring to the symbol looking like a 7 in ""√çoc 7 Taispea√≠n""."

I have to agree with the conclusion at the end of the video. I guess stenography exists only so stenographers don't lose their jobs. With all due respect to stenographers, I know it's hard to learn and practice, but just like programming in Fortran by perforating cards, it is no longer a necessary skill. 

And keeping order in court so it doesn't turn into a shouting match should be the work of the  judge and bailiffs, and nothing they are unable to do."
"""if necessary""? Let me ask you a simple question: imagine I gave you the digital version of the transcript of, oh, let's say ""The Godfather Part II"", and a copy of the film. At what point does someone first say something about making someone an offer they can't refuse, who are they talking to, who are they talking about, and what was the exact quote?

It took me under 5 seconds to find it in a written transcript, and that includes the typing. How long will it take someone watching the film, even at accelerated speed?

And if you think that's a silly example, no, no it isn't. That's the type of thing that happens with hearings, trials, and other things stenographers record all the time."

That last one seems legit
Ah
Glad i read through all that
"I will state the obvious but Cicero was Roman, as in not-greek!"
Digital transcription is a good idea but no you don't want a case to only be recorded in audio. Legal researchers don't want to listen to whole cases to find the line they are looking for
I needed this video!!
I get into arguments on youtube. I type at 110wpm.
Did someone say keyboards?
Poor letter i
Jokes on Sam. The video wasn‚Äôt 6 minutes it was 4:30 before the ads we all don‚Äôt listen to started. So in actuality I only wasted 4:30 watching the video and 2:00 minutes typing this pointless comment.

"There's a growing number of hobbyist stenographers now which might change the way that most people can type since modern mechanical keyboards more than likely have the firmware capability for that. Who knows, might change the entire way you write."
I like the way you think
"i think if we start using stenography we would follow in the same way china did with the qwerty keyboard‚Äîa lot of ppl are becoming less familiar with their writing system because like steno, they type out what the words sound like rather than what it‚Äôs actually spelled like."
"@Krozar TAL I wouldn‚Äôt learn steno just for coding but if you‚Äôre already using it for other purposes, it can work for that too.

A possible nice aspect might be having easier to remember shortcuts. Like if you had an initial refactoring stroke like FACK, could do FACK PRAM to do the re-order parameters shortcut vs remembering ctrl-alt-shift-p or something."
"@ha people have set up some dictionaries to do arbitrary shortcuts, based around shapes. Ends up a little like how Miryoku works with 40% keyboards."
@ha You just define a stroke to act as CTRL + [Letter].

I will say though, it's a right headache to learn, it's pretty much like a second language since while there are some fairly reasonable rules for the majority of words, some you can really only learn the same way you learn how bough, rough, and through are pronounced... a lot of repetition and a whole bunch of SPHAEURBGS, _ahem_ I mean, mistakes ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

@Keith ok but how do I know that P+B = N?
"They're not just typing individual letters, they're chording, hitting multiple keys at once. The modern computerized machines know that if the ""p"" and ""b"" keys are hit at once, that's an ""n"", just as they know that the p+k combination is an ""x"", so there's no need for a separate ""n"" or ""x"" keys."
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS‚Äô
Was that some joke I didn't get showing Athens and then mention Cicero (who was Roman)?
A stenographer switching jobs from a courtroom to a tv news station will quickly expand their dictionary many times over.

"You know what most of Cicero's wisdom was about? Roma. You know, the city where he lived, the capital of the Roman Republic, which is in Italy. As he was Roman, not greek.
And btw Carthago delenda est"

"The courts can't go to only recording audio legally because of laws that state for them to be in proper standing for the laws they uphold, they must keep paper records of everything as well as keep paper records of their certifications from the fed to be allowed to operate as a court. Many of our courts are not in proper standing and therefore commit crimes just by completing the proceedings they do daily."
Not true. There‚Äôs a growing trend of allowing audio to count as the record. Courts‚Äô day-to-day workflows are set by admin and the highest administrative position has a lot of leeway that isn‚Äôt exactly part of law.
What about languages that already write words perfectly phonetically?

"Thanks to openstenoproject and plover, it is actually possible to use steno with an NKRO keyboard on a computer.

Also, fun fact: in Chinese, typing the way you speak in slower than typing the way you write because many characters have the same sound. That being said, Chinese stenography is still sound based because that is faster for transcribing speech."
"@Yadobler also you can often abbreviate the whole word/phrase and just type djh to get Â§ßÂÆ∂Â•Ω
or at least dajh"
Yo @max Xiong! Fellow cuber in the wild :)
"@Elliot W. Apart from a few common single syllable word (like wo=I, shi=is, gei=give, ni=you), a lot of words are a combination of 2 words, like computer is dian-nao (electricity-brain), your brain brain is tou-nao (head-brain), etc

So while there's a lot of words that sound the same, there's only a few phrases that sound like other phrases. Like da-jia (Â§ßÂÆ∂ everyone, audience-being-addressed) and da-jia (ÊâìÊû∂ fight)

But again, smarter input dictionaries can kinda tell which is which, kinda like how the new fancy predictive keyboards can learn from your typing and suggest contextually sound words

So like you'd typically say ""fight"" after a word that refers to something or someone, or after some auxiliary verb like ""wanna"", ""didn't""

While ""audience"" is usually at the start of a sentence in a speech, or after a word that expects a noun to follow, like ""with"", ""towards"", ""saw""

Or sometimes, you can continue typing, like Â§ßÂÆ∂Â•Ω (audience, [yall] good!) is a common way to start a public speech, while ÊâìÊû∂Â•Ω (fight üëç) only makes for a lame joke about why you should practise your tones, and is never used"
"@EebstertheGreat The most annoying part of the Chinese keyboard is having to scroll through the list and find the character you want.
Luckily they are placed order based on how frequently you use them. So, the more you use the keyboard, the easier it becomes as you don't have to scroll through the lists of words to find the one you want."

Fire the researcher or writer who identified Cicero as Greek
We could just use speech to text software but big stenography lobbies against it‚Ä¶
"1) What is ‚Äúbig stenography‚Äù? Who are they? Where are they? We don‚Äôt even have a national union. The NCRA‚Äôs lobbying division is quite small.
2) I used to caption. We would use state-of-the-art speech-to-text to make drafts of very simple content. Some of that content trained the AI for over 5 years. It was sold to the company as a magic solution and guess what? It couldn‚Äôt do it. It‚Äôs a mirage, my man. And it needs investors. So their demos are great unless they‚Äôre actually live and unpredictable (I‚Äôve seen those fail spectacularly) and they get your money. By the time you figure out that it either sucks or is a mechanical Turk or both, it‚Äôs too late."

Hello
"You know what they say about fast typers

"They also do closed captioning for the hearing impaired on television, college classes, doctor appointments, etc. captioning can be VERY challenging because the stenographer has no ability to ask speakers to repeat or slow down, or to control how many people speak at one time. If you know any young person who isn‚Äôt sure what they want to do in the future, and they enjoy typing/reading, this is a FANTASTIC profession and is in HUGE demand all over the US."
"@EpicVideos lol not even close. I did transcription work for a while a couple years ago that used auto caption software to produce a raw that editors had to fix up. AI is still nowhere near capable enough to do the job without human aid, and if it still requires human aid you might as well just use a stenographer because they're faster. AI still has trouble with multiple speakers, slightly obscured speech that a human ear can pick up easily, quick speech, quiet speech, slang, words that sound like other words, unusual terms, etc."

So Cicerron is Greec.    Nope he is not he is Roman if it's in greec it's because greec was the language of high profile person like for exemple public servant.

"@Electro Duck Hmm. Are you absolutely sure there's no human element? Their website says they also use human transcribers:
""AST leverages smart automation and professional transcribers and describers to power its CaptionSync video accessibility services.""

This sounds an awful lot like projects I used to work on where you're paid to fix the robot's work, basically. The raw output is much, much different than what consumers see. (However, at least they're honest about it. Not every company admits to the human element.)"
"@Reclaimer Leviathan In November of 2021, I wrapped up five years of transcribing from audio recordings at a company that heavily pushed AI solutions. We had a ton of them. But I'll just focus on audio here.

It tends to not work as well as people would think, especially in a courtroom setting. Getting a good recording on its own is quite tricky, as there are often issues with people walking away from mics or mics being too sensitive and picking up too much ambient noise (especially when speakers get loud and multiple mics pick up each speaker on the separate tracks). More sensitive mics alone don‚Äôt fix the problem. But of course, less sensitive mics lose speech as well. These issues frequently obscure speech on a recording; meanwhile, in person, a human being filters it out naturally. Why not take advantage of that ability with the human beings who write steno?

In practice there‚Äôs a lot of potential issues with relying on audio recordings alone. They‚Äôre good to have, but it‚Äôs often important to have a clean transcript of the proceedings as well. Having a court reporter present helps ensure that everything makes it into the record accurately. It saves time on transcripts, as you no longer need an extra step to transcribe an audio recording after the hearing, especially if there‚Äôs unintelligible bits of audio. 

It‚Äôs so inefficient to create a new job for high-intensity audio monitoring so that a recording can be transcribed after the fact when a stenographic court reporter can literally write it as it‚Äôs happening. And although machine steno can take a long time to learn, there are other types of stenography! They do exactly the same job that we machine stenographers do and may be more attainable."
"‚Äã@Marten K√§hr That's easily solved by having 1. an array of microphones at various levels in front of anybody that could be speaking, 2. an array of microphones throughout the room, 3. video of anybody that could be speaking, and 4. software that recognizes who is sitting where at any given time/which microphones are being spoken into.

With various recordings of every section, and sufficient video recording, it's literally impossible to not know who was speaking, and the sounds coming out of their mouths.
If someone isn't speaking loudly enough into a microphone, then they aren't speaking loudly enough for the prosecution/defense attorneys/judge to hear them - any one of them would need to say ""I couldn't hear you, please repeat that"" to proceed with the trial/hearing to begin with.

All of these things would be cheaper, more reliable, faster, and safer/more trusworthy than paying a highly specialized worker for each and every event.
It's the year 2022. We have very advanced microphones on several devices in our homes just for fun and convenience.

I'd imagine a government body could fund something slightly better for their important work."
"@Oneiroclast Who said that it needs to be perfect? Again, this is just for timestamp puposes. As long as it is good enough for you to find what you want with a few key words, it has done its job. An official transcript can be done by a human if you so desire."
"Stenographers do more than just type what people say, they also have to identify the speaker which includes asking people to speak louder, stop talking over one another, and repeat or spell words that could be misunderstood.  This is why California's push for automated/computer stenographers failed so spectacularly."
"@Isabella Rhoslyn The audio tape transcripts are atrocious.  I found a city in Florida where the audio transcriptionists were not aware of the ""ing"" suffix and used ""en"" all the time.  Try to imagine that.  I'll be talken to you later."
"Also the judge or lawyers strike things from the stenography record in real time or instruct to stop typing, harder to do that with continually recorded audio"
@Rubiconnn Seems that way?  Nothing can transcribe two at once and a third speaker objecting.  We stop it and do it again because we've experienced every possible outcome.  The last thing you need is even one error in a transcript paid for by a lawyer.  Dang.  There are mics at the tables for 30 years already.  Some courts use only audio for certain not-so-important proceedings.  Sort of like your surgeon saying I'm gonna let the nurse open this dude up.  Felony trials need accuracy and someone to look to besides a civil service employee who can't be replaced.  Civil trials are paid for by the parties and they're not interested in what might be some day.  This game takes place at five syllables per second.
I studied shorthand and it involved writing symbols over and over to an increasingly smaller time frame. It could get mind numbinly frustrating but eventually you can just write what people say in real time
"@Elizabeth Grace Interesting. Reporters in my jurisdiction constantly monitor the record, annotate, and intervene in court if there is a problem with the record.... however they are not stenographers, they simply annotate during the duration of proceedings focussing on supplementing the record with contextual information that cannot be intuitively deduced from the record (e.g. identifying speakers, correct spellings of formal names, identifying matters and restrictions as they are called, providing case citations, etc.). transcripts are not automatically produced, only an audio record. if a transcript is needed, one will then be produced at additional cost using the audio recording."

"in stenography school you learn a new language out of the ""random"" letters, essentially.  it took me 6 months to learn the language and theory for writing on my stenography machine."
"A stenography machine doesn't have keys for every letter in the alphabet, so certain standard combinations of letters that _are_ on the keyboard are used to represent letters (or syllables) that are not. PB, for instance, equals N. Certain longer words that come up often also have abbreviations (standardized into sets called ""theories""), and a stenographer can also make up their own abbreviations for words that they expect to come up often in a certain case (the defendant's name for instance, or, as in the video, the stenographer renders ""Half as Interesting"" as ""HAF AS TRG"" instead of in full as ""HAF AS EUPB TER ES TEUPBG"").

A classic typewriter-style machine puts out a long ribbon of paper covered in shorthand and then the stenographer later translates that shorthand into the final, readable transcript. A newer, paperless machine is loaded with English-to-shorthand dictionaries (that can be edited to include a stenographer's own abbreviations) and displays not only the shorthand but also translates automatically."
"If I had to guess it's just a common translation thing. Like bp=n is obvious for arsobp vs arson, and there are very few bp  words (if any)"
Man you should add the moment when you rage against your teammate during a multiplayer game it's gonna be 300> wpm.

"@Worcestershirey also: In the time when Cicero was in Greece the period of ""Ancient Greece"" was 100 years over, Greece was invaded in the 140s BCE by Rome and since then a colony. Most likely his slaves even were Greeks"
How else is Half as Interesting going to pump out unnecessary videos at speed with 30% of their durations being adverts? He doesn't have time to make them properly.
Thank you lol

i'm actually at 120 words but my accuracy is only 80% but its ok i wont hold it against you
Can't wait until YouTube starts offering refunds
Maybe this is how I should write essays now.???
"Cicero was from Ancient Rome, not Greece."
I used to type around 135 net wpm
"Ngl I kinda want to learn stenography so I can better add captions to my YouTube videos. I stopped adding captions since it took too much time traditionally typing them out, and I‚Äôm a small enough channel that most of my viewers don‚Äôt benefit from captions. But a stenography machine with a custom dictionary with the words I typically say would be incredibly beneficial if I could learn how to use it right."
Try it with Plover!
"@ODISeth If you're doing it for court reporting or captioning, it'll probably take you years to get up to speed. I believe the average is like 4 +"
"@Qolumbia possibly, though learning that skill does also open a lot of high paying job opportunities. If it takes a year to learn, those opportunities alone may be worth it"
"Do it, it's fun"
prolly take longer to learn then its worth
"‚Ä¶so how the hell do they learn how to literally rewire their brain to do this?

Is this a female only talent?"
"The profession was actually male dominated for most of history because court was not considered appropriate for women. I‚Äôve read articles from the ‚Äò80s that cite then-current statistics, and the profession was still primarily male."

Have you administrated a court system lately? No? Okay. Maybe ask questions instead of making assumptions.

Cicero was ROMAN! Boom! love your videos though. But i also love pedantry x
"> Ancient Greece
> Cicero

HAI fact checkers doing a good job i see"
Cicero from Ancient Greece. Do you mean Rome?
"Cicero was Roman, not Greek."
"@Stephen Widger Actually, it's a bit more complicated than that. Roman culture shared much with Greek culture, but there were also important differences as well."
"@Alec Xander You're right, though maybe we should go further. I think it's even stranger to say that Ancient Greeks and Romans are the same than to say North and South Koreans are the same. It's more like saying that the Japanese and Koreans are the same or the Japanese and Chinese are the same. The comparison between the two Koreas is more like a comparison between Athens and Sparta."
He did live in Greece for long periods of time
He was one of the cretins at Sparta.  I mean - Spartans at Crete.
"@Maximillian Dragan haha, same here"
Anyone else really want to see John Moschitta Jr. vs a stenographer?
"if you can find a stenographer able to do a min. of 586 wpm that might be a even race.
(and also able to understand Moschitta clearly enough)

Let them race with Steve Woodmore (637 wmp) and Sean Shannon (655 wmp in '95) afterwards."
@Jeebus Christos yes
That would be cool! Is he even still alive?
I miss my old Micro Machines. :-(

This is the third time I've been early today
That last piece of wisdom though
Hello
"Stenotypes are one of those magic things that elude me.  Like, I know how they work, but it's still black magic to me."
"its like magic in Harry Potter, how do I do this thing? well, you wave the wand and say these words. why does that work? GOOD QUESTION!"
I know how they work as much as I know how nuclear fusion works. I could never do it with my own hands.
It's quite an art

"Thank you for makin this video. I am into keyboards and needed to know how stenography works. And no I font type at 40WPM, its double that"
@Paul S Rohrbaugh no it‚Äôs you.

I used to be able to type at 120 WPM but then I gained this thing called a life
