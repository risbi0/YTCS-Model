Imagine jumping the gun on renewables and then buying gas from Russia during a war because you can't fuel your country without it.

"The end of oil is not near. This crazy ESG police the Western has adopted is gonna end causing more damage to environment down the road and is also gonna let us vulnerable and dependent on countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia and so on. Congratulations fellow westerners"
why did that guy in the intro have like 10 cups at his desk
guessing before watching....  Because currencies are tanking against all commodities needed for production...   funny how shutting down and handing out stimulus checks ruins the economy
Global oil demand is projected to rise. It‚Äôs easy to look at the energy transition from the perspective of a developed economy. Emerging economies want to take advantage of the same growth and economic benefits provided by fossil fuels. It‚Äôs also worth while to consider the population confined to developing economies. 2022 has exposed ESG greenwashing and the persistent global reliance of traditional fossil fuels.
Thank you for this‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm buy electric today
"It is the opec embargo! It's the higher consumption of fuel. The manipulation of the Stock market.  It's people on their cell phones sitting in their vehicles idling.  It is slow moving traffic.  It is laws and taxes placed on the Oil industry.  It is the oil industry's desire to control energy.   It is corruption.  In 1970 there were approximately 3,695,390,336 people on this planet.  Today there are approximately 7,963,306,371.  People want to live longer.  So, the young are eliminated through abortion and the older have their lives extended through science.  We had different types of fuel back in the late 1800's from steam cars to electric and alcohol.   1973 Opec embargo changed everything, but so did the New Deal."
ver informative video thank you
In Canada gas prices are getting lower
"An  Exxon- Mobil Exec stated that if every car was an EV by 2025 that in  2035 we would still be using oil at 2010 rates.  Oil is a part of everything.  
Do the math on a Level 3 Charger for a Tesla S  and it is literally the same price as gasoline at $4.36/gallon.   Level 3 (FastDC) charger cost     $0.43/kWh."

"So Expensive is not quite right. Pandemic, Shortages Inflation and the War not mentioned.
Converted to Price per Liter, Gas Prices were and are SO cheap compared to us over here in Europe."
Well made video but I don‚Äôt see electric cars being affordable enough for most people to actually make fossil fuel obsolete. Electric car batteries also still don‚Äôt get enough mileage.
Yeah ur stretching oil is on its deathbed. Renewables arent the future. Its nuclear. And thatll take time because ppl r dragging their feet
Renewables are not taking over.  That‚Äôs ridiculous
"I am sick of hearing people blame President Biden for these increasing gasoline prices.  It is not his fault.  Had the orange stain won the 2020 election, WHICH, HE DID NOT,  these gas prices would still be high.  Along with  the other things that have increased in price."

"This video fits very well with a report I saw regarding what oil execs were saying about their production capacity. When a bunch of execs were asked why they were restraining growth, the overwhelming majority said ""investor pressure to maintain capital discipline."" In other words, investors didn't want them to waste money on increasing production as they didn't see it as a valuable long term strategy. If you're still thinking fossil fuels are going to have some glorious ressurgence, you're delusional. Even the people who are literally the ""most invested"" into this industry don't see it surviving."
"Lots of good intel here, but you are very purposefully leaving out the political aspect and disguising it as a ""taken for granted"" global consensus that the world is ending and renewables are our only hope. So the president of the biggest economy on the planet outright going to war on the oil industry had nothing to do with this eh? And because that apparently has nothing to do with it, when the worlds biggest economy switches back to Republican leadership, that won't have any effect either? I'm skeptical."
Gas will be normal when idiot in charge is replaced. Sorry CEO and all those in gas oil have decided to give the big guy the pedo in chief( hunter name for his dad) the middle  finger via high gas prices.
You must be thinking that trump is still in office. How are you gonna watch the video and say it‚Äôs bidens fault?
"I think oil üõ¢ is going to be around longer than anyone can predict really.  It maybe replaced but it has not yet had any stable reliable replacement. Nuclear power üîã is about the only one.
Hydroelectric is depending on the üíß üö∞ water flowing. The Hoover Dam is running out of water to power the generator.
Solar is only as good as batteries being able to store and only when the sun is shining.
When is only as good as the batteries that can store it and only win the wind is blowing."
Under Biden. I would not produce more I would produce less and not invest at  all.
Humanity doesn't actually need fossil fuels... we can do just fine with something less destructive. I wonder which kinds of corporations might have the most money to invest in clean renewables? Hmm...
"This is just gouging before the elections. This happens every year and is just getting out of control. What's the gas prices gonna look like this time next year, 12.00 a gallon ?  It's time for something drastic to happen. Being sheepled by this shit government is no way to live like a slave."
When the well goes dry.
I hope renewables never take over. This argument is from a poor country which can't afford to build its own power stations. We have renewables hiking our power bills more than oil could ever do. Hydro and nuclear are over 30-50 times cheaper than solar or wind!
"Its all Biden's fault! The US was producing our own oil until Biden took office and made his executive orders and stopped US production of oil and natural gas, Not this horse hockey they are shoveling here."

I am in orla tx right now. Heart of the Permians best wells! I have been oil and gas for 10 years now. I started in Wyoming. I have been through a few busts now. I see the insane amount of money that goes into drilling. its drill at any cost. And every time there‚Äôs a bust they go bankrupt. Then everyone‚Äôs getting merged. More laid off as the merging company is spread thinner until things settle. I honestly believe when oil went negative it was a wake up call. And they looked at there books and saw all the debt and realized the trouble ahead. They got lucky though and are paying off debt. The next bust will be the safest one I have seen yet. I did want to address the royalty rights though. Land owners VERY RARELY own the minerals. Especially in a developed field. Most of the time they where sold or kept by the previous land owner. And split of hundreds of times more often than not. Let‚Äôs not forget the biggest factor that EVERYONE is missing! They have no incentives to raise production when they have such low hedges. I believe the advantage hedge is currently $62
interesting to watch
"The scam that is oil prices, oil companies use any excuse to increase prices, never decrease them and year on year the profits increase. They get away with it as they have funded politicians fact."
At 9:02 you removed the Google Earth watermark. You're taking credit for a service and not giving credit
"Good video but you missed a few key points. As you mentioned during the shale boom in the early 2010's companies were drilling for market share. The strategy was production growth. They would spend as much money as possible to acquire land leases and drill wells. The problem with that was shale wells have an extremely high decline rates. They may start off at say 1,200 bbls/day but after a few months are only producing at a couple of 100 bbls/day and after a year they produce at 50-100 bbls/day. When the price dropped due to the oversupply of the market caused by this flood of shale oil the companies could not pay back their loans. They did not simply decide to stop drilling, many went bankrupt or were purchased by larger companies. The reason the remaining companies are not picking up rigs and drilling more shale wells now when prices are high are 1) to grow production by drilling high decline rate wells you need to continuously drill more wells each year than the year before, this is a huge capital expense which will not produce an ROI, will flood the market, and cause the price to drop which will exasperate the problem. 2) Banks are not interested in lending money to producers who would do this again, as I said a lot of oil companies went bankrupt and a lot of banks lost a lot of money during the shale boom 3) Banks have a lot of social pressure to not invest in Oil companies so the money is simply not there to invest. Which leads me to the most important point which was missing from your video. You did not speak of conventional oil plays that do not have high decline rates, rather they produce tens of thousands of bbls of oil per day for 10-20 years. These are the plays that will increase supply and decrease oil/gas prices for the world. Since 2015 there has been a huge shortfall in investment in these projects which take 5-10 years to discover, develop and produce  along with billions of dollars of investment. Banks were burned in the shale boom and along with the social/political pressure to shun oil & gas money was not allocated to this type of investment. Now that prices are high maybe we will see some more investment. Though at best this would take 5 years to see results as these large conventional plays are found in deep water environments that require many years of planning and engineering work. At worst this investment will not take place due to the fact that politicians across the world are saying they want to abolish fossil fuels. And who would invest billions of dollars knowing they could have their pipelines, leases or permits pulled at any time?"
The politicians and bankers can be the first to starve.
"14:02  I think there might be other, more traditional shale deposit maps. Not sure. Kind regards."
Official government policy has been to suppress the oil industry.  That is why investment in the future has slowed.
So Biden shutting down the Keystone Pipeline had no effect on the gas prices I'm genuinely asking
"Not really, the Keystone pipeline was unfinished and only meant to supply a couple places around the country. It also was mostly supplied by Canada. While it may have brought prices down by a dime or a quarter in the few places mentioned here:
Steel city, Nebraska
Port Arthur, Texas
Houston, Texas(Likely that it would be less effective)
Wood River, Illinois
Because that‚Äôs where the pipeline was meant to supply, but most of the supply from the pipeline would go into Canadian and American crude oil reserves, and not to the consumer. It would also cost a lot of pkwy to finish and operate, which is why Biden shut it down."
"I'm sorry I wasted 20 minutes of my life watching this.  Are people stupid enough to believe this bullshit?

It is partly but it is the oil companies being greedy and not being controlled

"CLIMATE CHANGE IS A CHARADE THAT DISGUISES THE LUST OF EVIL MEN TO CONTROL THE WORLD.
Consensus is not scientific fact. Moreover, according to satellite empirical data, the earth's temperature has not gone up in the last 21 years. Who started the ""global warming"" hoax?

""The common enemy of humanity is man.

In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome.
The real enemy then, is humanity itself.""

Everything is taken as proof that it is happening, and the repeated failure of sophisticated climate models to predict the actual, observed results is hardly noticed. Even the name of the phenomenon itself has been changed from ""global warming"" to ""climate change"" to fit the contradictory outcomes ascribed to it.

Since real time data doesn't fit into their theories, climatists now claim that there is a ""Climate Pause"" that wasn't foreseen in the original global warming ""models"" conceived in the 1990's.

Philosopher Karl Popper described the essence of a scientific theory as ""falsifiability""--i.e., it must be possible to conceive of a way to disprove the theory, so that its validity can be demonstrated and defended.

Climate change, at least in popular discourse, is not falsifiable.

If Global Warming was scientific fact, then it would behave like... boiling water. We know generally (based on altitude, temperature, barometric pressure, water purity and other specifics at the location) that water boils at 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It happens on every test.

Boiling water has 100% predictability. The falsifiable proof is that if you heat water to 200 degrees Fahrenheit or 90 degrees Celsius then water will not boil.

Global Warming advocates cannot say that about their theory. Proponents have not presented a theory where it is possible to conceive of a way to disprove the theory, so that its validity can be demonstrated and defended. Lacking this characteristic, the theory remains a probability that allows for ""randomness.""

The global warming movement has a cult like character. You have to believe it to see it. Probability cannot control randomness. It cannot ""settle"" the issue.

Climate change proponents cloak themselves in a zealotry that they condemn in the religious. They berate and belittle ""climate deniers"" as if the unbeliever ignores the obvious at his own peril. That smug arrogance built on a flimsy platform of rickety computer models would be laughable if they weren't so convinced of global warming's virtue.

Carbon DIOXIDE is plant food. It is a necessary ingredient when plant life use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water and converts it into OXYGEN through a process called photosynthesis. Eliminate it and we can't breathe. Or is that the goal?

Carbon MONOXIDE is poisonous and is emitted from burning carbon-based fuels. Taken in sufficient quantity it is lethal. These are the emissions that must be reduced.

Do these people understand what they are for and against?

I don't think so.

Discredited ""Hockey Stick"" computer models are not the stuff of scientific fact.

""Computer models do a good job of helping us understand climate but they do a very poor job of predicting it.""

That is according to the late mathematical physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey who spent 37 years studying the problem.

Dyson said, ‚ÄúAs measured from space, the whole earth is growing greener as a result of carbon dioxide, so it‚Äôs increasing agricultural yields, it‚Äôs increasing the forests and it‚Äôs increasing growth in the biological world, and that‚Äôs more important and more certain than the effects on climate.‚Äù

He acknowledged that human activity has an effect on climate but claims it is much less than is claimed. He stresses the non-climate benefits of carbon are overwhelmingly favorable.

The essential truth is that climate change theory is sophistry at its base core. It is barren of physical support and relies on the adherent to ""buy in"" that man is the root of all ecological damage to the environment. If man's activity were curtailed, the effects would go away. Taken to its extreme by irrational believers and the Club of Rome, the elimination of the human species would be the best solution to climate change.

It adds up that climate change is not fact or theory. It is a cult that requires its acolytes to suspend belief and accept a narrow and illogical screed.

"Think about it...If you had a president who stated they were going to put you out of business, would you spend billions of dollars to increase your business? Or, would you just ride it out knowing your business will soon be over.

"Question related to the production versus consumption graph...Does the consumption also take into consideration that some of that oil is not actually being consumed but being stored by several countries? Unless these are separate, it would appear that the world uses everything it produces. But that is not the case. I wonder what the graph would look like if the storage amounts were separated from the actual consumption amounts."
Bro just answer the the question.
This is why I'm glad to be getting an electric car with a much cheaper cost to run and maintain. The only disadvantage is that road trips will take a little longer but that's a small price to pay for a very occasional thing since charging an electric car on a road trip is still much cheaper than gas.

They're our enemies in the Middle East where we've fought endless wars for oil.  How about 1) we stop buying Middle East oil so we can stop fighting wars their 2) we provide the world's oil since we have the best environmental laws 3) use the wealth we create to develop renewable energy at a scale to actually allow the gradual decline of fossil fuels.

There are so many incorrect things that you put into this post trump supporter. Reading your comment almost gave me a headache. Stop worrying about politics you obviously don‚Äôt get it
Did you watch the rest of the video?
"deman is stilll going up and not going anywhere untill gen 4 nuclear comes on line. oil is not going away. renewables are not happening like you think they are. if anything synthetic fuels are coming on line and are a more powerfull renewable. petroleum is also renewable, and oil prices have droped 20% in the last two days.  oil is not going away. you are becoming more and more about agenda than information."
"renewals arnt actually taking over, they are too expensive and unpopular to use.  whats more the big ones of solar and wind flat out dont provide enough power to work and once you realize that and the fact that it costs more to charge a car than it does to buy a tank of gas even at these current prices with far less of a return given you can go less miles on a battery than a tank of gas.

thats all without pointing out the biggest issue, how many places have you been that have charging stations for cars period outside of California? when theres nowhere to charge your car you cant go anywhere.

all that said your mostly spot on but i do feel like the loss of the keystone XL pipeline which was being made by the governments of two countries has had a disproportional effect on the supply of oil given the commitment of transcanada to supply 500k barrels a day for 20 years in 2018 which would have been really nice to have right now."
"America has more than enough oil under it to make domestic fuel cheap and export to Europe. It Would create uncounted American well paying jobs, raise the GDP, and remove Russian oil dependence in Europe. God forbid our leaders would invest and plan for somthing that would benefit the people of the entire western world. Its obvious to anyone who can see that the ""leaders"" of the free world would much rather squeeze the money out of the people and intentionally divide them socially so rhe people won't stand together against idiotic policies that only hurt regular working people or hold them to account for their blatant lies."
"interesting that oil companies say the only way prices is to go down is by drivers driving less...however, people were driving just as much now as we were BEFORE the pandemic...what gives? but yet the oil companies continue to reap in BILLIONS in PROFIT!!!!! oil co's still need to PAY the politicians......"
"I divide oil and gasoline prices into these categories in a timeline.

March/April 2020: Covid destroys demand, oil goes negative, gasoline under 2 dollars a gallon, in some areas under a dollar.
May 2020 to November 2020: Travel restrictions, weak demand, gasoline in the low 2s.
November 2020 to September 2021: Good news of high vaccine efficacy, economic recovery. Gas prices exceed 3 dollars.
September 2021 to November 2021: Energy crunch in Europe and Asia, gas prices increase to around 3.50.
December 2021 to February 2022: Omicron reduces demand, gas prices down to around 3.25.
February 2022 to April 2022: Russian war in Ukraine and sanctions, oil prices surge to over 4 dollars.
May/June 2022: Gasoline inventories plummet due to high demand and reduced refining capacity, gas prices exceed 5 dollars.
June 2022 to present: Improvements on supply side, recession fears, and speculative bubble bursts, gasoline prices falling.

I don't think you can leave out the war entirely. The sanctions on Russia have made what was already a supply crunch even worse. The only reason it wasn't even worse is because most of Russia's oil is finding its way to places like China and India. Those countries are buying more from Russia at a discount, but less from OPEC and other suppliers. Another major issue now is refining capacity. While US oil production is increasing, and should reach pre pandemic levels eventually, refining capacity is harder to build up. The spread between the price of oil and prices of refined products is called the crack. That number is often 10-15 dollars for gasoline but has been over 60 recently.

If the past is any reminder, nothing is forever. Eventually, either supply catches up, a recession hits and reduces demand, or there is a transition to other forms of energy. People said the same thing back in 2008, and then 2011-2014 when gas prices were high, that they'd never go back down. I don't see 2022/2023 being any different. My guess is as supply gradually improves, and the Russian War in Ukraine eventually ends that gas prices fall below 4 dollars, but stay higher than pre-pandemic unless there is a recession."
"Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't Biden cancel almost all of those unused oil permits? So even if companies wanted to drill again or increase production while prices are UP. They can't because they lost their permits."
"No, he didn't. They still have thousands of unused permits."
"Average consumer:   OPEC is the devil for collusion and keeping prices artificially high.   
Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP:   The devil is smart."
its peak oil
They're obviously doing it a a way to make more profit. They don't give a shot that we're all getting f*cked as a result
I have noticed correlation. The more oil a country has the more poor are it's citizens. Except very few very democratic countries. But still the countries which have most of worlds oil are the worst. Their citizens are more poor than in countries who dont have a drop of oil in their soil.
I keep on being told this was Bidens fault.
"@Jadam1113 
Agreed, I don't listen emotionally like low level political teams wars seem to be discussed.

The only reason people oppose green energy is because the pundits tell them too, and the only reason the pundits tell them to oppose it is because they're being paid to. Dear Republicans, ""Centrist"" Libs and many Democrats: you are being manipulated, and you are protecting your manipulators.

The US has already lost its opportunity to become the manufacturing and innovation world leader in renewable tech because of this shit.

Maybe if some people were more efficient and not so wasteful ( like the driver I mentioned ), the demand for gas decrease and that would help bring the cost of gas down somewhat."
Renewables are anything but. What provides the energy to make them all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.oil and gas. Your puff piece is a joke of misinformation. Sad to see 2 million people watched this hopefully they think for themselves.
This is almost hilariously half baked.
That 5.5 billion for the pipeline is actually pretty cheap.  The new pipeline going from Alberta to the BC coast will most likely cost double that.
"""Gas prices at an all time high"" 0:28 shows prices that Norwegians have never paid before in their lives because of how cheap that still is."
@2loaves excuse me?üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Nice lies Russian bot
That oil/gas speculation is allowed to continue is LAUGHABLE! This entire crisis has been brought about by American oil Co.s having bought cheap russian oil instead of PUMPING THEIR OWN FROM AMERICAN WELLS! The criminals  who made this crisis are friends with the criminals who ALMOST stole the election!

"YouTube has been of great help to many facing challenges of making best decisions on what to invest in, but it‚Äôs not enough cause most people don't understand what they watch. Many need professional aid that offers best plans to better create wealth."
"@C.K Great! Got it! I‚Äôm delighted to engage in this opportunity, I just found the professional‚Äôs web page, already written her."
"There‚Äôs no limitation to what we can achieve, if you put your mind to it. You can do it. My husband and I invests with Genevieve too.

Because Republicans are gauging us at the pumps
"If the expensive gas is due to the low global supply, why didn't the prices decrease after President Biden released a record amount of gas from the US reserves? Shouldn't introducing more oil into circulation counter the issue discussed in the video?"
@Locarnese The reserve being sold to other countries isn't relevant since oil is a global commodity.
"@Elli True, but not when (like the reserve that was released--part of which was sold to China and India) is almost literally a drop in the bucket."
"@Locarnese That's not really true. Oil prices change on a daily basis. If you flood the market with supply, the prices will drop. Once that dries up, the prices go back up."
"@Paul Lee Yep, sorry if I wasn't clearer. The reserve is not an increase in *production* and as such it affects the laws of supply and demand very little, if at all. My analogy with the savings account was this: if you use it up, it's not because you're suddenly richer: you're spending a finite resource that once it's gone, it's gone. Those fixing the prices of a barrel of oil rely mostly on the potential of nations and companies to extract and refine medium to long-term, not to use up in a few months what they have stored for years. Or at least so I understand it."
@Locarnese Could you please elaborate please? I'm kinda lost.
"I loved that ending 
it got me emotional for the future"
It‚Äôs all Ukraine fault.
YOU ARE WRONG ITS BIDEN
"@Napoleon Vanderbilt you‚Äôre right. It is fun seeing how much information people in YouTube comments can deflect, just to keep blaming one leader for their problems in life."
"@Jadam1113 The difference is I‚Äôm a Republican with some actual knowledge of how politics works, and i don‚Äôt blindly follow anyone. I do this on a lot of videos, it‚Äôs fun seeing how they just go to far, like everything it Biden. One guy said that his 401(k) was down 4% because of Biden, well great, the US stock market is up 3% Yesterday. Did Biden do that? Answer: No, Biden doesn‚Äôt control the stock market."
"@Napoleon Vanderbilt me and you are doing the same thingüòÇ going on trump supporters comments and calling out their ignorance/stupidity. Like how can you watch the whole video and be like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs fake news, this is a democrat channel.‚Äù"
"This guy is very clearly smarter than you, you have zero evidence to back up your claim, the video has mountains of evidence. You are who is wrong."
"Also, when oil dropped  to the -0 range, oil companies laid off tons of workers.  With a quick surge in demand and not enough employees to ramp up supply quickly, low supply is also dictating the costs at the pump.  Remember too is a fact that the U.S was a net exporter before the pandemic."
"I think we needed something like this. Oil drilling is damaging to the planet and even worse than that are the effects of gasoline burning. I hate that regular people have to struggle while oil companies are focused entirely on profits, but this will hopefully be effective in catalyzing the world‚Äôs total switch to renewable energy."
"I guess we'll be able to make plastic out of air and sunlight, right? Or go back to leather and wood--oh wait, greenies don't like that either. Stone? Ooga-booga, baby."
"Renewable energy is by and large absolutely what we should be pushing for, however, as of right now, we are just not ready for it. There are many aspects of life in which oil is needed as there are no current electric alternatives. Take farming for example, which I have first hand experience in, because the cost of fuel has gone up so much recently the price of all foods and farm produced products either is going to spike or already is in the process of doing so. There are simply no electric tractors or farm devices that work large scale on electricity.  This is going to lead to global shortages in all food products, which is easily one of the best ways to guarantee a collapse of economics and governments. If there's anything to be learned from history its that starving people is the best way to cause chaos. This isn't even including the cost of transportation of every product anyone uses on a daily basis which is also spiking due to truck and transportation costs."
"so, capitalism and markets are to blame. what a surprise."
@Jadam1113 The polisci term which most closely represents my views is 'anarcho-syndicalism'.
"@Williem Dripfoe socialism, obviously. Whatever else you believe, there is no mechanism for price gouging in a socialist system."

"I believe its a wrong assumption. Even has we transition into renewable, it is not the case for every country."
Listen Trudeau put a carbon tax of 60 percent on Canada day anther 2 percent  that's why gas is higher no other reason period
"It seems like the strategy of keeping production low and prices high will incentivize more people to switch to electric vehicles and other ways of cutting their own gas costs. I guess it makes sense if oil companies are focused on ""now"" like he said in the video."
I work in the oilfield as a floorman or roughneck it‚Äôs literally the lowest position in the oil and gas filed and I literally worked 2 weeks and make 5k after taxes it‚Äôs insane how much they paying people to work In the industry

"The end of oil is nowhere near, near‚Ä¶ take some time and look into how many different products use ‚Äúoil.‚Äù"
"The stock market has topped out.  Big money shifted to commodities and is causing oil, nickel paladium, etc to artificially cost more. Crude oil is trading at $110-$120 per barrel when it was around  $40 per barrel."
There is a lot of valuable insight within this video but the content creator has left out significant contributing factors for why prices are so high and oil companies dropped production within the US.  It is either complete ignorance or trying to drive a narrative.
It's ok mummys here
And this is why the market is ridiculous and unsustainable.
Sorry but if governments want to lower gas prices just stop taxing for a year!!! It‚Äôs not rocket science but plain economics!!!!
"What really doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to me is Oil companies are so ignorant that they are causing their own demise by these high gas prices. Let me explain in detail first off when have you ever thought of buying an electric car or a hybrid vehicle?.. answer- when gas prices are ridiculously high. Did you think about buying an electric car when gas prices were two bucks a gallon? I could bet not. So these oil companies are gouging people and literally killing their own business as fast as humanly possible because they‚Äôre making people realize that oil companies and gas sucks. I literally sold my 1972 Chevelle and bought a Prius because of how expensive gas is,  jokes on the oil companies now I‚Äôm not spending $100 a week in gas just putting around town. That is absolute greed and ignorance in the purest form. They are Setting their ship on fire."
Oh and I thought it was Joe Biden‚Äòs fault that gas prices were so high. At least that‚Äôs what they say on Fox News each and every day.  I guess there‚Äôs a bit more involved.  üòÑ
@Williem Dripfoe yes
@Veric Basilio you sure?
@Williem Dripfoe not having 50 news report of blaming the other side
What does CNN say?
Its because nothing's free pipsqueak
This was an amazingly informative video. Thank you very much.
The cost of a barrel of oil is largely controlled by the Saudis.  It costs the Saudis $6 USD to produce a barrel.  They are the world‚Äôs largest exporter and can increase/decrease their production at will.  The future of gas pricing is controlled by a dictator/nation that hates western countries.  You have 2 options.  Stop using oil or invade Saudi Arabia.
My uncle was once offered a 1/3rd ownership of a Senator.  I'll leave you to guess which political party made that offer to him.
"Why don't we create a water pipe line across America....to send surplus water from states with excess water to states low on water it helps Americans and stimulates the America economy..

"US average field crude oil production 2018: ~11 million barrels a day.  Average Gasoline Price: $2.74
US average field crude oil production March 22: ~11 million barrels a day.  Average Gasoline Price: $5.

It's raw price gouging y'all.   

It's not Biden. It's not that oil producers can't drill.  It's not that they've incurred too many additional costs to drill.  Companies like Chevron are making record profits and using it to buy their own stock back. 

Globally, oil companies voluntarily dropped production during coronavirus because fuel demands obviously fall when people stay home. They have REFUSED to re-invest in production because they simply wanted to make up for lost revenues and ride high prices for as long as possible."
One solution is to stop voting liberal/Democrat.
He never once mentions political opinions here. There is an exactly zero percent chance that your statement works.
While we see your green course has led to the fact that the world's dirtiest coal-fired power plants are reopening

"Instead of trying to outcompete OPEC by poisoning our air, land, and water, we should invest in renewables to escape our dependence."
wouldn't it be easier to blame putin instead of poor braindead biden?
@Jesse Berg thank you it‚Äôs nice to see someone in recent comments who has a brain
"Or, you could, I don't know, actually watch the video where he talks about how no politician is in a position to quickly affect long term market trends that have been going on for decades."
we dont need oil monopolies. free up the oil industry. more competition= best quality + lowest price = best market players.
Is this a propaganda piece paid for by the WH? Maybe bad policy coming from Washington is what's driving the none reinvestment?
"Like he said, no politician acting in the short term (as politicians almost always do) is able to control the market.  Trump couldn't, Biden can't, and whoever is next won't be able to either."
Well canceling keystone and vowing to stop the oil industry doesn't help much in inspiration to reinvest. If you want a green world..well here we are.
"So if this is true, why has UK government reversed they decision on new oil rigs and allowed a new major oil rig in North Sea. This won't keep the price high?"
"Your analysis is missing crucial details. 

Where is the analysis of the Obama-era environmental taxes & regulations that drove the USA to cut emissions, take standards higher, and make individuals pay more money in taxes as well as in added foreign aid? The USA is required to pay more than ANY OF THE OTHER NATIONS IN THE WORLD INCLUDING RUSSIA INDIA & CHINA. 

Week 1 of the Trump presidency, Trump rescinded the 250+ regulations that had been keeping the US from producing & refining. Remember our oil and gas prices then? Yup, much lower than with Obama, yet the economy and demand were steaming along until Covid. Trump‚Äôs final year at least was a typical supply/demand issue as covid was overblown and slammed the nation, so oil demand plummeted. 

Then week 1 of Biden‚Äôs presidency, he reset all those rules and regulations.  Biden is beholden to the alternative energy folks & the global warming hoax folks & sadly, globalists who would like to weaken America to alleviate our stubborn independent individualism that will prevent controlling most of us. The global warming hoax is a gigantic wealth transfer scheme. It‚Äôs quite clever.

So with the Biden administration resetting environmental taxes & regulations, as well as advocating for the end of fossil fuels, not considering nuclear as an option, prematurely, the oil companies are not aggressively spending R&D to 
source more future oil finds. As a result, oil prices will remain higher until we elect an administration that will signal that fossil fuels are still a critical energy source as the alternatives are studied and developed.

Biden wants to cement his legacy. He wants to be the one man to face down Big Oil
and even fossil fuels and save the world, yet his brain is a potato. 

Your analysis is missing crucial details."
"I think you missed the point of this entire video.  Gas prices are not set by the US president.  OPEC countries (owners of 80% of THE WORLD'S oil reserves) sets the world's supply of oil - - That's globally.  Private companies set the prices of gasoline based on supply & demand.  In case you missed it when they spoke in March 2022, the CEO's of the major gas-producing companies in the US have stated (on the record) that they have refused to increase production because their allegience is to their stockholders.  That is the reason for high gas prices. (Search: Oil Companies Refuse to Increase Production)"
"correct me if i'm wrong, but hasnt the shell group officially announced to switch to renewables and not expanding their oil extraction capabilities around 2017 (or 2018/19 not sure atm)"
Awesome video and very informative.  Thank u!!!
bro the gas prices just look up the executive  orders biden put into effect.
@encryptlake games you watched this whole video and you‚Äôre saying that Biden is still the reason why. You‚Äôre so obsessed with him. Sorry that there‚Äôs too much information in here to understand it.
"@Napoleon Vanderbilt well then you do if you think that executive orders structured to stop drilling on federal lands isnt helping gas prices go up, and directly causing the issues with all other products going up."
"@encryptlake games Actually, i don‚Äôt support Biden in the slightest. I‚Äôm a republican. But I don‚Äôt support misinformation and stupidity."
"Why would you invest in something everyone is trying to get away from? Day 1 Biden said he was going after oil companies and that the green new deal was a major push for his administration. Also, I've heard that out of those 9,000+ leases available over 5,000 of them are in litigation and another 3,000 are about to go into litigation. It's an attack on big oil before we even got our Chinese solar panels brought over by diesel powered ships."
You didn‚Äôt watch the video
"Oil companies in the US cannot be expected to invest more in production when the federal government has declared war on them and vowed to shut them down. It doesn't make sense for them. I think a more measured approach to lowering carbon emissions would be a better solution. Focusing on improving the emissions of the larger contributors (Industry and Power Generation) would make a whole lot bigger impact than just screwing the public and vehicle transport, which is a very small contributor to greenhouse gas emissions world wide."
"An impressive essay. What I find most people neglect to present is how many other things in our world are reliant on Oil & Gas. 
Fertilizer for the world market is produced with sulfur from the refining process. 
Tires, inks, plastics etc. all use some part of the distillate from Oil & Gas. 

It‚Äôs easy to say move away from O&G for fuel but there‚Äôs a direct market affect on every other item produced."
It‚Äôs funny how every country in the seems to want to fight over energy like little kids why cannot everyone in the world use the energy that the world has and not need to control everyone I don‚Äôt want to be know as a human being anymore be cause I am ashamed of the human race
These gas prices will lead to a recession in the end! EVERYTHING we consume is shipped by way of gasoline!! It's making prices skyrocket!
Biden
@Chris Olsen the stupidity. Any singular leader of any country can‚Äôt just make gas prices be high.
"@MD yes they do by having friendly relations with other countries.

That and you don't have an administration who wants to declare war on the oil companies."
Biden wants people to buy electric vehicles has nothing to do with the Ukraine invasion.  If America wants cheap gas oil open pipe line from Albert lots of oil sitting on the sands. Or relect Trump.
@Marv Kwia I'm not a Democrat.  This only happened last year.  I just remember statements made by the company and then people immediately distorting of what the company and news agencies said.
"@Marv Kwia Please, don't take my word for it. 

From the Austin American Statemen (Jan. 22, 2021) - a newspaper in Texas:  ""TC Energy (the owner of the Keystone Pipeline) said more than 1,000 people are out of work because of Biden‚Äôs executive order. In October, the company said it EXPECTED to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021""  ""A 2014 report found that the company would need only 50 employees to maintain the Keystone XL pipeline once it‚Äôs finished, 35 of them permanent.""

From FoxNews (Feb. 10, 2021): ""Labor groups have said Biden's day one decision to nix the Keystone pipeline quickly eliminated 1,000 union jobs and could kill 10 times more in construction jobs that were EXPECTED to be created by the project.""

All of the 11K jobs mentioned were in construction jobs and were temporary."
@MD I know a person that works for XL Syncrude in Fort McMurray he will know for sure I'm golfing with him I'll be back
Its putins fault.
Lmao why don't you blame chief in charge first?
I thought it was because we have a weak president wanting us to buy weak electric cars
Nice smoke screen
"Nothing to do with Biden killing America's oil independence in turn hurting the price of the dollar which the majority of oil is sold in, in the western world and beyond? cutting leases plus pipelines also."
"Bwahahaha - what a load of tosh. Keep it up, we need more comedy channels like this :)"
@Jadam1113 Yup :) - it would be an honour work on construction :)
22 minutes of information is obviously too much for you take in. It‚Äôs okay maybe you can use your pea sized brain for maybe construction work.
"Nonsense video. The Federal Reserve created the inflation when it conjured $7 trillion in new currency in 2020-'21 that was used to buy Treasury debt. That is what financed PPP, bailouts and stimmy checks.

The currency supply increased by 40% over an 18-month period. That is inflation!"
"Great delivery, nearsided assertion that it's not the war. Historically, oil prices go up with conflict. Also, the narrator fails to mention Russia's involvement in OPEC+ or how it is absolutely advantageous for oil companies to artificially create scarcity.
So, yeah, it IS the war, and OPEC dictating the price of crude."
It's not due to the war as far as the U.S. gas prices go. Blame Texas
"Yeah, oil is going to be around for a while. Renewables aren't without their problems: intermittent power production, massive environmental footprint (which requires clear cutting), stable source of REEs (most of which are sourced from China), location dependency. I think renewable energy will need to co-exist with other types of renewables, or non-renewables in order to work."
"putin is not responsible for the rising gas prices. He is the enemy how is he controlling our gas prices. Unless the demoncrats allowed putin to have the control. Then it's still bidens fault for giving our resources to the enemy. That's treason, correct?"

This is also before we spend 100k for a Tesla model x that can carry my wife and our 5 children. I really don't know what world you live in, but it isn't reality as we currently know it."

Joe Biden what? You obviously didn‚Äôt watch the video
"First of all, War is a bit much."
"Lower speed limits nationally to 55. Saves lots of fuel, creates lesser demand and price will come down."

Biden what? You obviously didn‚Äôt watch the video
"No, AOC did this. LGB"
He‚Äôs a leftist and of course he refuses and denies the truth. Biden has been shutting down us pipelines refusing oil leases promised to ‚Äúdestroy the oil companies‚Äù and ‚Äúput an end to fracking‚Äù you have to be living in an alternate reality to understand oil works like a stock market and think this has had no effect on oil prices.
"Oil companies: ‚ÄúWe made the front page today.‚Äù *shows newspaper saying Companies Awful Rich*

"US average fuel tax is 10%?
Guys that's a dream compared to our Italian taxes totaling 57% of fuel price."
"11% Taxes on gas are cute, in Germany its nearly half of the gas price."
"It will be years before petrol demand will decline, current estimates are about 2035. World demand now is up. As restrictions in China ease, and jet fuel continues to recover, world oil demand is set to rise. Currently, people are worried if refiners can keep pace."
Gas and oil isn‚Äôt going anywhere you need diesel fuel in hospitals to power generators you don‚Äôt want to be plugged in on solar or wind if your life depends on it the Hoover dam does not make substantial electricity in June 2022 anymore because it‚Äôs so low renewable is unreliable ü´° we use our fresh water to make corn to burn as ethanol when people are starving and thirsty
Propaganda!
incredible insight
Great video! Please do a video on the coming demand destruction of oil based fuels from Battery Electric Vehicles which use zero fuel!
"I understand you advocating for the switch to renewables so produce a video taking about the challenges we face in producing the power cells for all of these proposed electric vehicles. The challenge to the electrical grid to regularly charge up hundreds of millions of EVs and the cost of adoption, both environmentally and monetarily as you can't buy a used EV for $5000 but you can buy an modest ICE vehicle that will get you to work for years. Why does everyone sell the transition as so easy. I can't afford an EV and that was before the chip/supply shortage."
O
"So many of California's woes are self-inflicted wounds.  Just as the state has refused to build more reservoirs to cope with the water shortage, they have blocked any attempts to build new oil refineries, and indeed, have closed refineries in the state; ostensibly for environmental reasons.  (It's as if no one in Sacramento ever took Econ 101.)  But as this video points out hurtling towards environmental goals is not without risks.  If governments would allow renewables to enter the market organically (instead of subsidizing them and pushing out other energy sources), this mindset of ""going down fighting"" on the part of the energy companies would not exist.  This does not mean governments were necessarily wrong to do so; perhaps the fight against global warming is worth the cost.  But it needs to be acknowledged that there *is* a cost of transitioning quickly.  I talk to people in the comments all the time who live in a fantasyland where switching to renewables is actually going to make our energy both less polluting and *cheaper* . Well, time to wake up from that dream."
Its not. At all because Russia rather hold gold vs. Fake money üôäüëÄüñï
Green energy is becoming cheep and government seems to be throwing money at them
Simple answer GREED
Current electric vehicles is a joke.  Technology has not advanced to justify the change.  Current battery technology is dependent upon Lithium.  It's simply not good enough!!
"To bad it takes 350,000 miles of driving an EV with a battery rage of 400 miles to offset the amount of green house has energy it takes to make the overall car,  Versus a Toyota Prius"
It amuses me that people think the president is largely responsible for prices. OPEC+ (they‚Äôve called it OPEC-Plus since they started coordinating w/Russia on production levels) and domestic American oil producers don‚Äôt care about giving us good deals. They care about making money. End of story.
That pipeline would have cost $155 billion to buy in America.
"Something I'm still wondering: Why did it start at the same time as the war? Shouldn't it have been relatively (more) progressive, if the reason is lack of investment?"
it may be this reason.........................and the war
"Well in the US, I know it's because they geniuinely just want the prices high. Why else block the pipeline and get rid of our energy independence. It is a complete scam"
The sort answer: biden shut off the oil spigot on his first day.
You obviously didn‚Äôt watch the video.
"Well in 2008 oil peaked at $147 per bbl under the R flag. It isn't that high now and hasn't been. Gas refineries are setting the prices right now, not the president. In other news, global gas prices are up. I suppose you can blame that on the US president as well?"
Which is why it took‚Ä¶ over a year for prices to jump?
"This is one of the most important videos you've made I think. So much disinformation about oil prices going around, and lots of it getting picked up by mainstream media."
@A Universal Woman yah ok secret agent woman
@Gary Martinez tons of alternatives...
"No mention of how government regulation/subsidies effect price? This doesn‚Äôt explain how gas was only $2.17 in 2020 and is now $6 only 2 years later. What does explain it is our foreign dependence on fuel. Since trump worked to reduce our dependence on foreign energy, investment in energy production at home went up. Biden admin making oil a bad investment by blocking pipelines with tyrannical executive orders. Amazing how you can make a 20 minute video and track the industry back to its infancy and still give no insight into why this is actually happening."
"You imported more oil in 2019 then in 2021. oh no, Trump failed"
The majority of cities in the world don‚Äôt need gasoline or even a car but you come to the United States and I highly doubt you are going to walk in the country for where I live it‚Äôs roughly 20-30 miles between towns and we lack the public transportation like many other civilized countries have in place like bullet trains
"It‚Äôs not just one issue , and congress asking oil companies to pump more oil now while at the same time telling them and the world they are going ‚Äúphase out‚Äù the worlds or at least the USA‚Äôs need for gas‚Ä¶ yeah right , I‚Äôd be giving a big fu and higher prices too .."
Biden has publicly stated there will be no more drilling. America is allowing a mad man to bring it to it's knees. How many slaps in the face is it going to take to get your attention!
You didn‚Äôt watch the video
"Oil Companies aren't drilling due to their own choice of ""Capital Discipline"""
"Very good video. Wish more had been said about the effects of alternative fuels on oil.
Also, your drop in tone at the end of almost every sentence got rrreally annoying! No personal offense."
Oil is going nowhere. Electricity runs on coal and oil. Your future just isn‚Äôt ready yet for your dreams.
"It‚Äôs an essay. And it‚Äôs likely not really correctly reasoned. The reason for lack of investment is driven by government policy, not altruism."
Essentially Republicans need to implement socialism for oil for there to be lower prices.
It‚Äôs our President loser joe. That‚Äôs who it is and you‚Äôre not changing my mind
"@BPgaming175 You don't want to talk about my scenario because it is in the past, yet you bring up Trump who is no longer in office. 

We've literally been importing oil since forever. Even when trump was in office. 

We have plenty of oil right now. If we didn't, the oil prices would be through the roof. Yet its less now than when the economy collapsed. 

As someone with a lot of family in the industry, we are drilling here right now. 

You still didn't answer why global gas prices are up. I guess the entire world relies on US oil? 

Biden may have dementia. Yet everyone screaming that will be voting for Trump if he runs again. Who, by the way, will be the same age."
"Well in 2008 oil peaked at $147 per bbl under the R flag. It hasn't hit that high since. Gas refineries are setting the prices right now, not the president. In other news, global gas prices are up. I suppose you can blame that on the US president as well?"
Thanks for this very informative video!
"Most of these companies own the renewables market as well. They‚Äôre not going anywhere, just shifting focus."
It‚Äôs because Biden and the liberals shut down the pipelines in America! No other reason!
"Well in 2008 oil peaked at $147 per bbl under the R flag. It hasn't hit that high since. We don't have an oil shortage in the US. Gas refineries are setting the prices right now, not the president. In other news, global gas prices are up. I suppose you can blame that on the US president as well?"
Hahaha. No.
"All the facts presented were good, but the facts remain that the US was a net energy producer on 6 November 2020 and gasoline in MD was 1.83 at the BJ gas station in Columbia MD.  After the Biden win, gas prices started going up, and during COVID and 1 year after the election, gas prices had risen more than $1.00 per gallon, at least 3 months before the Feb 24 invasion of Ukraine by Putin.  It was the actions of Biden on his inauguration day and the days following.  The problem is that Biden WILL NOT back off on his actions because of the Green new deal people in the far-left part of his party."
1) Biden is basically a republican president with his ideals so no ‚Äúfar-left.‚Äù 2) Don‚Äôt blame stuff on Biden because you don‚Äôt understand how world economy works.
Thank you for this. I‚Äôve been trying to explain this to people for months. This is oil‚Äôs terminal diagnosis party. They‚Äôve accepted their fate. This is how they‚Äôve chosen to go out.
"Here in North Dakota the news has been full of stories of how the drillers are ready to go, drill more wells and increase production, but they can't get the employees. When the boom crashed, the workers moved on and aren't willing to come back without significant incentives, mainly involving job security which the drilling companies are unwilling to offer given the boom and bust nature of the industry."
"We are all about to see some scary changes over this decade. No matter what happens, a large proportion of humans are going to die, starving on the streets."
"There is no such thing as """"Renewable Energy"". So called renewable cannot and will not replace oil & gas. Also CO2 IS NOT a greenhouse gas and has no effect on climate."
"When Oil companies limit production they're actually causing the change for consumers to go electric. I never intended to go electric, but the cost of my car at $336 a month is 100% offset by the cost I used to pay in fuel, approximately $400 a month."
That's an excellent way to look at it.
Shoutout from the Permian Basin‚úå
Tax programs to encourage investment is the answer
The answer is just for the Fed to seel the mortgage backed securities and just buy chevron and exxon.
how nice of these oil execs to limit production to help reduce CO2 pollution.
"Yes, profits drive everything and you glossed over a key point.  A key point was the breaking of OPEC due to independent shale oil producers.  At about 17:45  noteworthy comment was that they ""lost appetite"" to make investments.  Even though they could produce oil on current leases, they aren't.  Why?

Consider a hypothetical ""hot dog stand""  Assume for a moment, you have an operation where you can sell hot dogs and make a profit.  Others notice and jump in the same kind of venture.  This is exactly what happened do drive prices way down.  The SOMETHING HAPPENED!

Someone with an agenda decided hot dogs were bad. Together with a lot of ill informed young people, the elected a leader who vowed to kill the hot dog industry. Suggesting people should not eat hot dogs, but eat kale instead.  In this new political climate, investing in hot dogs was not a good idea, especially when storm troopers could shut down your hot dog stand at any moment.

Of course, the new, elites had their own profit motif which is to switch over consumers to kale instead of hot dogs. Together with major government investment, the elites touted kale as the wave of the future using the media propaganda and drove up the cost of hot dogs.  The Marie Antionette types changed, ""let them eat cake"" to  ""Cant afford a hot dog at $5.49?  Buy Kale at $10.00. 

For the peons who aren't happy about this ""transition"", ""too bad"". You must sacrifice for the greater good where someone else decides what ""good"" means."
Could it be that the billionaires needed a lot more money ?
Why doesnt the US nationalize some of its Oil deposits and Flood the market with cheaper oil? just enough to lower costs.
@Dologong Polopono Bonotong Polopono The world isn't anytime soon. Ships don't have an electric alternative. The OPEC is taking advantage of the world so why doesn't the US help out the world by crashing fuel prices.
because the us wants to move on from fossil fuels
"Wendover usually gets it right.   However, Oil prices are complicated and it is never 'just one thing'"
"Biden: ‚ÄúI Guarantee You We‚Äôre Going To End Fossil Fuel‚Äù
All according to plan i guess"
@Jadam1113 least biased from your perspective not mine. thats just how it is
"@Dologong Polopono Bonotong Polopono I never said being unbiased is possible. I explained to you why this is the least biased a video can be. The only reason you think that this is biased is, like I said, because it doesn‚Äôt really include Biden."
@Jadam1113 my reply was short and you still did not get it. You're living in fantasy land if you think being unbiased is possible LMAO
@Jadam1113 oh you mean the biased video? its fine though we all have our biases

What the heck is a barrel of oil defined as anyway?
"did yall know that 54% of oil doesnt go towards gas? that 54% goes towards things like medicines, plastics, Cosmetics, cleaning products, asphalt for roads, synthetic rubber, and cleaning products. the majority of our oil wont go away just because we use cars with alternative fuels. the real answers to becoming les depndent on fossil fuels for electricity is to start utilizing nuclear more. nuclear energy has the greatest ROI for electricity production."
Donald Trump is the answer.
Where I live when Trump was president...Gas almost never reached $3.50 and a couple of times was $1.99. It almost always hovered around $2.00-$2.50. Biden is blaming Trump and his admin. Unfortunately I don't buy it. I think Biden has no control over anything and is looking like a blundering idiot just as much as Trumps mouth made him look like a blundering idiot. America traded one loud mouth that other leaders were actually scared of or respected for a leader who has 0 control and nobody respects.
"I hope Biden doesn't watch this, if he does, he will find tons of new excuses."
"@Jadam1113 also, ""its complicated"" is essentially what this video says. Funny, a successful Capitalist didn't seem to have too much trouble with global complications...."
I hope you would take 22 minutes out of your pathetic life to watch the video and stop blaming gas prices on biden
"when biden leaves and prices comeback down again, lets see what wendovers excuse will be."
"So, why is the Biden administration lying to us about it all?"
"So, why can‚Äôt you just watch the video?"
You want the rest of the story check into what is happening with the major banks and their esg regulations.  Banks have decided that their environmental and social goals are more important than providing bank loans.  Specifically they will not provide investment loans to oil companies anymore.  That compared to a completely unstable economic market and a government that is hostile to them is creating an environment of uncertainty that is predictably forcing them to keep more capital on hand for their own survival then spending it on exploration and production.  With major billion dollar decades long projects like keystone being shut down on them by political whim they are currently in a fight for survival and having to be more protectionist as a result.  You want to lower the cost of gas?  Stop the hostile workplace routine and that will help out a bunch.
ESG is marketing. I guess you think McDonalds actually cares about the children.
"I'd Say screw gas prices today as Tennessee which isn't a flaming liberal state It's almost as high. Maybe States should pay people less there & stop using barrowing money from other states wealth. As Even Tho it's part of the Union California is a massive Union State As it Affects & promotes at the same time to rely on professionals who control the markets. 
I don't see much in relying on others even with mutual funds offered it's all minimum earnings. If your a professional & say you can't find the time to figure it out or even invest in stocks yourself i'd Recall your degree. As I'm sure you can obtain a Blo* J*B or find a way to sneak around each other or even watch a film. you can invest on your own. If not your supporting the system & inflation will always continue. 

EVERYTHING IS A JOKE> Fundamentals don't mean much when Governments & collective groups & firms constantly back & barrow off Iffy Not factual Fact's. As the US Dollar is. It was Backed by gold & now what? Petro dollar? or gold ??? what is it? Or is it Military Controls It All?

Just think Saudi Is paying it's Citizens How much in USD for free? Which is biased off USD Dollars? & what does the US Military Set backs come from that? In the Hundreds of billions."
"I wonder due to Military conflicts with Azerbaijan & Northern Russian Naval sector, I wonder if Russia will reclaim Azerbaijan Either by force or whatever works for me idc really as I don't really care about that area. I would more if they didn't screw over Russia aka Ussr as a whole. Look At Saudi! all their or majority of the Population is wealthy. I wonder why. OPEC did way to much to support it So did massive Us companies & so did the Military on all levels their guilty of it. That's a Factual Fact. & including the Support of the CIA & it's sub companies that congress uses from time to time. As only a few Agencies of the US doesn't have to or are even required to file any expenses of tax payers $ including Higher education & intuitional especially when it comes down to  MONEY! 

MONEY MEANS NOTHING IS WIPE YOUR *** WITH. 

In Theory it does mean something as means of bartering. If the US government can over the past so many years allow to fund businesses & put in a system to where certain companies will succeed over others & not be liable for any debt as due to business debt laws. Which has been taken advantage of for too long.

"So Joe Biden (or any other US president) didn't do that? Are you telling me that political parties want people to think that things would be different if you voted for them, when in reality it is largely global market forces that set the price?"
Thanks Brandon
Still have to admit that it‚Äôs kind of strange that fuel prices jump at about the times obama and biden were put in office ü§î
If you consider that oil receives over 50% of its revenue from transportation industry then even a small percentage shift in ICE car demand to EV can hurt the earnings numbers. Tesla is proving people want EVs and are tired of being slaves to oil cartels. Oil will be around but its necessity in transportation will be reduced. Ive had solar on my house I put there myself since 2014. I have battery backup power that would be more than adequate to charge a Tesla and meet my needs. I fix all my own cars but ill gladly take a Tesls and not have to get robbed by the oil cartels driving my F150 to a construction job.
This doesnt make any sense. The youtube short today told me the democrats did it.
"The US by the end of Trumps term, was exporting oil and gas. Biden shutdown a ton of shit, which killed our newly acquired oil dependency.

Biden let it spill recently his plan, or better said, the people who control Biden Plan. Biden want everyone to buy electric vehicles. Problem is, neither battery tech, nor solar tech are even close enough to what we need to make it possible. Retards jumped the gun, and sure enough, a lot of the people behind it also have stock in companies that produce electric cars.

Elon Musk himself though recently tweeted about NEEDING to restart our pipelines. He knows we are not ready to go full electric. He knows the tech isn't there yet. He tweeted this, and even stating to the detriment of owning Tesla, that OIL PIPELINES NEEDED TO BE REOPENED."
"Pipelines are open, ever the keystone is open and running for years. 
The US is exporting LNG and Oil now as well.  Biden didn't shut that down."
What in the world are you talking about? Opening WHAT pipelines??
Who cares? Go buy a hybrid and stop bitching. People understanding that our economy is screwed up by a cluster fuck happening in our supply chain doesn't help resolve anything. Make whatever money you can to pay for inflation. It's a hard knock life.
"@JesseT951 not my problem. I can't even use the internet to start a business. I don't get any empathy, so why would I have empathy for other poor people?"
If people having hard time affording gas how in the hell they're gonna be able to afford hybrid?
hail shale
Truth is it‚Äôs Biden this video just doesn‚Äôt want to say it lol
When will pedestrian toll booths also be introduced so people can't save money by not driving?
"You analysis fails to account for the current admin not being fossil fuel friendly. canceling leases/ pulling permits etc. This causes those that might have wanted to invest in increasing the supply to stop in their tracks.

My prediction; Gas prices are going to wildy swing in prices over the next few decades as we change from 1 admin to another."

*OPEC Owns and Controls the oil in the world*
Well done piece and just provides support for my contention that the stock market and investor class are one of the biggest problems faced by the world today. Their greed works to destroy the lives of millions each and every day.
The Democrats should receive some credit for brilliantly outsmarting the Republicans at every level. It is so funny that the Republicans still cant figure out the high gas prices while our president wins environmental and social change objectives. There may have to be a class of people in the USA who are sacrificed in order to build back better. We have compassion for the people who cant afford changes like electric cars but their suffering will be worth it. We are going to completely rebuild this country they way it should be. It is ironic that while Biden keeps making trips to the bank on policy the elephants keep claiming that he is ignorant. It really burns me up that we are called names instead of being idolized for how brilliant we are. The Democratic party should not be staying silent when we are called names on social media. We deserve admiration for what we have pulled off.
I agree.
"""I like money."" --Frito Pendejo (and gas companies)"
I feel like you could of proved the point in under 5 minutes.
Renewables are much farther off than this video seems to think
I am a computer science student and it‚Äôs getting to the point where quitting my part time job will make me more money then going bc of gas prices. I hope it gets better soon
"Umm, ON DAY ONE, Biden HALTED oil drilling on Federal land, making America DEPENDENT on foreign oil again. Biden also HALTED the pipeline and put 10,000 people out of work."
Good. Oil needs to be phased out.
"Because the one percent have invested in one another and now Control the monetary narrative don't believe the scarcity and supply chain issues, they have created this narrative"
"Democrats: Produce more oil! We promise not to tax you, regulate you penalize you, ban you, etc."
"Republicans: keep blaming the democrats on everything wrong in my life because I have nothing better to do even though I have this 20 minute video of information that I could just watch, but instead I‚Äôm going to blame Biden!"
Sad that you do not cover the total picture and problem in California we could produce as much as Texas for crude oil production on the coast with offshore drilling but it was illegal because of the bp oil spill and lying media
This video is bullshit. Reason why gas is high is because US embraced stupid left policies of war on fossil fuels. Prices were great under Trump.
"@Jadam1113 It is because the US is forecasted to produce less, which affects GLOBAL supply, as the US is one of the largest producers."
"@MichBaba Ok, whatever. I had a typo on the word recession. Your comment still doesn‚Äôt explain why GLOBAL gas prices are so high. If the left policies increase US gas prices, then why are other countries also with the largest economies gas prices higher than the US? The video explains why but you just blame it on the left."
"@Jadam1113 Left policies do lead to higher gas prices. That is why we went from low prices under Trump to high prices under Biden. Price of gas depends on futures. So when Biden comes out and says he will destroy the oil industry it makes investors believe that the US will not be a welcoming place to do business, this leads to less output/supply, and that in turn makes the price increase."
"@Jadam1113 You spelled ""recession"" wrong."
"This video basically totally ignoring the role SPECULATORS play in the price of oil, is borderline negligent."
Greedy oil companies Shell made 9 billion in  the last quarter
$3.5 a gallon! It‚Äôs around ¬£2 a litre in UK
Because someone in Washington has their pockets deep in oil companies just like her daddy
It because of pipeline shut down we all see it
Bullshit
Bullcrap.
"If everybody doesn't drive for two weeks, we can flatten the curve."
Good documentary . Already knew lot of it but this didn't answer the point why gas price went up right after Russian war. We export crude oil and our next door neighbor Canada has a big oil reserve.  We are not  any other countries that we have to stay alive on the blessings of ZAR oil  or Middle Eastern oil.
Oil is sold at a world price. Alberta oil is sold to whomever pays the most.
I told my mom about this. She's still blaming Biden for the high gas prices. =_=
Well the prices whent up with Obama.  Down with former president Trump and back up with former vice president Joe. So left in power equals higher gas prices.
I THUMB DOWN all videos where I cannot see the upload date !!!
Renewables are NOT taking over. There‚Äôs more energy in oil than any of the renewable alternatives. The last president wouldn‚Äôt have let this happen on his watch.
"Exactly. ITS NOT THE WAR PEOPLE.

BEING DONE *ON PURPOSE*"
Sure glad I bought a Plug In Hybrid.  50 miles of EV range using no gasoline fits in perfectly with my daily commuting.  Haven't had to buy gasoline in months.
"With the world looking towards green alternatives and politicians being able to completely destroy an industry with the wave of a pen, I can see why people arent investing in oil."
Gas prices are high because Biden shut down the pipe line! He‚Äôs too stupid to open it back up!
"@Robert M  and, of course, dead silence from Carl.  :-)"
Which pipeline was shut down?
"No its not the war, its Demonrat policies."
Why it got so expensive? Because China Joe came on board and fucked our entire country up
"I have to beg to differ that renewables are taking over.  Without nat gas, there is no ammonia fertilizer.  Without fertilizer, rural India and Sub-Saharan Africa starve.  My belief is that the kids of India want to eat.  Also, nuclear is much more robust than renewables like wind and solar, but nuclear gets no love.  I have a feeling that we‚Äôll still be using fossil fuels for longer than people think.  Solar and wind will get expensive if silver and copper get expensive."
@Robert M It doesn't have to be twice as expensive if governments made it easier to build out nuclear.  Solar and wind are only affordable because of subsidies from governments.  Nuclear is also much more robust.
Nuclear is twice as expensive as nat gas. people are very price sensitive (usually)
"Short version: Supply and demand set prices. Supply got reduced after the 2021 price crash (caused by reduced demand), and now the oil companies and OPEC are keeping supply below demand. Even shorter version: It's just supply and demand! Not Joe Biden, not the Deep State, just good old supply and demand."
It's Joe's fault
"Would have liked that you went over the arduous process of drilling in a place where you have a lease. Having a lease does not mean you are good to go to drill, you still have to get all the permits to build the infrastructure required to drill. Also wouldn't the cancellation of the pipeline from US to Canada also be a mayor factor?"
"@Robert M well that is a lot of investment money gone to waste, oil being a market with a good amount of speculation, it would be reasonable to assume that a cancellation like that would lower confidence in investing more money into those projects when they can be shut down on a whim."
The KXL pipeline didn't exist in 2018 so why would that it's cancellation cause increased price of oil?
Thank you Dear Leader.
Sounds like bullshit
"Funny how at the end you admit this is a propaganda piece. Your closing argument is not true.  It's still a capitalist sector where companies will invest if they think they can make money. The problem is, we have a guy in the government who says ""I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuels"".  This same idiot is dragging the US back into getting our oil from places in the world that are not friendly.  Less than two years and already two failed military excursions and more to come. A smart person would come up with the substitute before removing what is being substituted.  No one has ever accused Benito Biden of being smart."
People will stop going to work
Oil is GOD'S anointing on Earth . Shows yah how corrupt government's are.
Easy answer. Old Joe
Well the war is some of it but a lot of it is supply and mainly opec . We also are at production capacity in the us . We need to transition off oil but this is not the way to do it . By 2022 people are gonna be enraged . Getting to revolution territory
"The end of oil is not near........the end of oil used for Petrol, might be, but oil is used in pretty much everything, so it's not going anywhere anytime soon."
Peak consumption or peak investment? Good insight. It‚Äôs natural to cut back investment for future when you see no future and you can capitalize current market. It‚Äôs similar to continue to drive the 7 year old car before switching to an EV in another 7 years.
I just hope somehow high gas prices will equal a major crash in real estate values.
">$5.5 billion (adjusted for inflation)
The richest person on the planet right now has over $200 billion. The richest 400 people in the US alone have more than $3.2 trillion combined, which is more than the combined wealth of the poorest 40% of the country.
$5.5 billion is nothing.
They could've saved the world with that money, and they chose to contribute directly to its death instead.
And throughout all of it, they prioritized artificial scarcity for increased profits over availability of a basic commodity.
The way that capitalism rewards scarcity and punishes abundance should be seen as a flaw, not a feature."
THE ONLY DIFFERENTS BETWEEN COMMUNIST & SOCIALISM IS YOU VOTE IN SOCIALISM & IN COMMUNISM THEY PLACE A GUN TO YOUR HEAD AND YOU AGREE!!!!!! AND BOUGHT WERE WRITTEN BY KARL MARX. YET OVER THE YEARS SLOWLY THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER OUR SCHOOLS AT ALL LEVELS AND WITH YOUR HELP OUR USED TO BE GOVERNMENT.
"THERE IS NO SHORTED OF OUR OIL, THEIR IS THE COMMUNIST PARTY  THAT IS AND THE NO LONGER A DEMOCRAT PARTY ONLY THE NEW NAZI HITLER STYLE SOCIALIST FRAUD PARTY AND AMERICA YOU HAVE THE WELFARE-SLAVERY SYSTEM THEY USED TO CONTROL VOTES &  THE ORIGINAL RACIST ONLY SLAVE OWNERS THE DEMOCRAT PARTY THAT STARTED THE CIVIL WAR & IF THEY HAD WON WE WOULD NOT BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"
"Interesting information. However, the thesis (that Exxon/Chevron just want excess profits) is completely misleading and without context. Ultimately, Exxon and Chevron aren‚Äôt confident in the regulatory, political, and cultural environment to add more investment. Recall that foreign states & companies and domestic agencies & parties have tried to kill American oil in the last 5-10 years with the fallacy of renewables being a viable option. Never forget the ESG nonsense. Exxon and Chevron nearly went bankrupt adding so much debt during an unprofitable era. Now is not the time to shame and hate our American oil Producers. Instead, we should surround with support. Until that changes, Exxon and Chevron will only be recovering and paying off debt incurred. Bidens shaming and attempted bully pulpit of Exxon has no impact."
Wow I had no idea on this perspective.
"Honestly, I'm tired of being influenced. I just want the facts. Unsubscribing now."
"Meanwhile, India and China don't seem to be both affected or concerned about climate change.  Let's hand over the keys to China now.  What are we waiting for?"
"Glad to hear that you declared the era of oil dead.  Apple is investing in a phone made out of mud, with a beautiful stone holder.  All of Google buildings will be powered by immigrants rubbing flint on stones.  But they will make at least today's wages.  $30 hr. Oh, and plastic, that will be made out of wood and lawn clippings, and old potato peelings"
"But if oil prices are sky high and shale rigs are cheap to start, then you would think some of them would be incentivized to start up again."
"Joe Biden want you all to buy electric cars, more than 90% taxes from gasoline"
"Of course it's not because of the war, but old man Biden will never miss a chance to blame Putin for it anyway."
Biden huh
"Cheap oil is how the third world pulls itself out of poverty. If you want to see this industry destroyed because you believe it's an existential threat, you're adovating for the suffering of the poorest people on Earth. All I can say is you better be really really sure it's actually an existential crisis..."
But... Putin price hike. üòî
This is a twenty minute video explaining why I don't have job security.
So the ev1's and ev2's were outlawed and crushed and shredded to make sure this happened? Of course even thou these cars were outlawed the new electric cars are for the privileged.
"I absolutely see this outcome! Everyone driving electric cars for say five years is that many years of no oil use by this person .... say times fifty  thousand rigs on the road that opec is no longer bleeding. Should those numbers  rise even more, Opec is going broke as in no more cartel. Just like starting up a oil  refinery, its costs are crazy high to start another mafia and a lot will not join a loser deal making it hard to take it away again. We will see the last of those refineries burning the remaining products as they can't sell Cyanide gas which is deadly to all living animals, we are too animals on this chart. Everything gone but the cockroaches as their going to be the  last survivor"
"So if I understand this right, due to the political push to go electric, the industry doesn't want to put any investment into more oil refineries or logistics to get oil the refineries that do exist.  So still politics driving oil prices, just indirectly."
I think the high oil prices just add stress to the economy and I think something is bound to break. Recession could well fix this oil prices hike.
Let‚Äôs discuss Biden banning drilling on federal land or his ability to release the reserves in the Permian Basin.
"Greed.  You raise the price until people change their behavior.  When they stop paying for it, you can‚Äôt raise the price anymore."
"If you dig ditches and you're in HIGH demand, you slow down, dig less and charge more. Why not ?"
"I just wanna enjoy my Miata, damnit"
Record profits. I wonder why the price is high. LMFAO
Too bad this is wrong...
@Eric Jones likewise. I don't owe you an explanation no matter how much mommy and daddy make you feel special.
Such an insightful and well reasoned argument. You've really brought me around and changed my mind with the plethora of evidence you showed in support of your claim.
"Tldr: it is actually the war, supply shock, anti-fossil fuel rhetoric from countries worldwide, and the poor choice to keep everyone locked down which forced a cutoff of new production and suspension of current production. 

     The war alone caused prices to increase, but being anti-oil is another thing (Biden and EU)"
You are a very gifted storyteller
Dude. Slow down !!!
"B-b-b-b-ut Biden! Yeah he ain't great, but the entire world is dealing with the same shit. Screech harder. The problem is above any politician."
Giving 40 billion to a foreign country right after passing a multi trillion dollar bill doesn‚Äôt bring up inflation
Can i just say that a gallon of 95 feul in kuwait is around a dollar? Hf guys im staying in kuwait
If you voted Democrat shut up
No
This video should be required watching for the clueless crowd that thinks ANY president as ANY serious degree of control over gas prices.
"While i loked most of this essay (except the last 1 minute conclusions, which I think are questionable).  It didn't really answer why Gasoline prices are so high compared to Oil prices.  Even at $110 a barrel that doesn't explain why Gas is $6-7 a gallon (we've had oil prices this high before).  If oil supplies are being kept lower, then the price per barrel should be higher to explain the higher gas price,  unless we are seeing a lack of refinement of the Oil in the US"
"Very well presented! Not being an economist, it seems to make sense however it all comes down to greed and market manipulation. As the rich get richer, the rest of us get the shaft."
"It‚Äôs funny the amount of people who actually believe that human beings can change the climate of earth, climate change is a normal process for this planet, hot to cold, cold to hot, this planet has gone from covered in volcanoes and lava, to completely frozen, we‚Äôre just living  in the small part of earth‚Äôs existence where it is habitable. You want green energy, get rid of your vehicles all together, ride a bike or walk, electric vehicles are not ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, have you ever looked at lithium mine? Seeing as how most electric vehicles hold six lithium batteries, which last only about 5 years, and cost around 1,000 dollars a piece, I see landfills with mountains of used lithium batteries in the future lmao"
"Yeah, funny how no one brings up the 'dirty' side of electric vehicles.  Call your utility ahead of time to find out when the next blackout is, and charge accordingly"
Atty Gen just announced charges against 1 large industry for price gouging (profits now + via tax breaks if Biden looses due to economic impact!). Multifactorial inflation.
Look whos in the white house
"This is one big giant bull $h1t.   why didn't the oil prices go up during kuwait war?  or Iraq?  Some gas stations even gave out free gas during that time.  this whole thing was planned by the US, (yes they spread the virus in China) to protect its economy at the threat of China's economic boom."
Bidung stopped the pipeline january21 2021 and Russia invaded much later than that so Joe and his Marxist puppets have outright lied. Prove me wrong. Chronology proves me right.
Bidung through hate shut down the pipeline because Trump OK'd it
"Petrol, it's petrol ffs. Its not a gas and never will be so stop calling it that"
Wow if only Biden didn‚Äôt stop that pipeline
Greed.

"The guys that complain the loudest drive giant 4x4 trucks to work from their government subsidized xerb alpaca ""farm"" to their city jobs on their daily 85 Mike commute.. 

The only thing they ever haul is a bedliner."
"19:22 ""The end of oil is near"". So true. And let's hope world leaders take urgent action. We need it. For those concerned about economy, you cancheck many studies that price that not talking action will be much more negative."
"The last time oil passed $100 per barrel, gas at the pump was much cheaper. Who is keeping the difference?"
Executives... This is a great time to reap the benefits of Crude haha
Nice try! Blame it on Russiaü§£. Has nothing to do with canceling American oil drilling leases Pinocchio
"gotta love it when people complain about fuel prices while showing USD prices, i suggest taking alook at EU prices (esp places like the NL) where it always about 3 times as high as the US....."
But that makes sense nearly all your oil is imported meanwhile 92% of the USA oil is drilled & refined here meaning global supply should have very little to do with prices.
Greed and overpopulation.
One can only wonder how a powerful country such as the us just let itself bullied by small Venezuela...
"sitting here workin for an oil company watching this video wondering why they said a 4% raise since 2020 was ""in line with inflation."""
If we're creating enough oil in our own country for all our needs why the hell would we care about a pipeline over in russia. It sounds like prices are being raised here just to make profits take a look at what the profits end up like at the end of the year I bet they'll be record profits just like in the early 70s oil crisis which was fake. They tell us we're creating all our own oil with this new process of pumping water into the shell. Something doesn't make sense here for us oil prices.
"$60k for a base model tesla would also buy me 20,000L of gasoline for my pos if it even goes to $3/L. Add $6500 interest there's another 2100L.  At the end im left with a $30,000 (or less) tesla with no warranty and batteries that are not worth replacing if they go bad. Don't laugh, it's paid for"
"Hungary uses Russian oil and we pay 1,2 euro/litre for petrol while in Germany it is 2 euro. yes it is because of the sanctions, not because of the war. The west decided to pay the 'cost of freedom'. Hungary decided not to pay the cost of the war between US and Russia happening in Ukraine."
"Infuriating and persuasive. I was thinking I'd eventually get an EV, but that ""eventually"" just got seriously truncated. Great vid!"
"You should get an EV soon regardless. They are FAR cheaper to maintain than gas cars, even considering battery replacement costs."
We need an end to fossil fuel use immediately!
"Sure, but how are people going to throw all those plastic water bottles away without plastic?"
"Ah Yes , Struggle breeds Innovation . Don‚Äôt be suprised if you see more people claiming to have made cars that run on Hydrogen or engines that operate by other means."
Pipelines are no longer the future. THORIUM small modular reactors are.
Gas prices were at a all time low in 2020 because of the global lockdown from covid and now that we have people going back and the world is opening up again of course the demand will increase.  The war in Russia is also a factor and most of all the big oil countries and companies are not stepping up production cause they are making more money than ever hiking up prices cause they can and making up for loss profits or simply greed.
Oil traders are the culprits thanks to the futures and securities modernization act.
this is Brandons mess !! period!!
The problem for gas prices is called JOE BIDEN!!!! Stop deflecting.
"""renewables""...what a loaded term."
Oil sucks
USA prices went up because he stopped them from drilling for oil. Later Biden started purchasing oil from Russia. One can never stop a resource unless you can completely replace it. Trump fill reserves full and lowered prices by drilling. Biden cheaply gave away these reserves to China and India. Only peace that lasted between Ukrainian and Russia was balanced on the need to get oil safely through Ukrainian. Signing contract for pipeline north without securing Ukrainian guaranteed safety was negligent on Biden‚Äôs part again.
"Love your videos, but attributing the massive jump in prices to OPEC and not once mentioning the current administration's anti-oil agenda through over-regulation (wanna mention WHY those 9k LEASES are sitting dormant???) inaction is just wrong."
It sure is not slowing people down at the pump! People are flying into the gas stations by the droves! So why would they lower it!
Whole lot of hand waving to not blame the ü•î's administration.
Thanks OIL COMPANY YOU RUSSIA COLLABORATORS.   üá∫üá≤‚ô•Ô∏èNOTHING TO DO WITH BIDEN! .. please people he's released more reserves than any president n history!  AGAINST an oil tycoon that supports Russia more than USA & you guys don't understand that it's a BUSINESS in America that brings gas in from overseas & sells it to us! It's just a damn business people! Can the president make me charge more or less for my products??  seriously wake up people!üá∫üá≤
"ALL rigged, AND they are scared to death of that alternative energy hidden at Area 51, Wright Patterson, and Los Alamos.  Other sites too!! The men in black keep that all buttoned up."
when gas was negative 37.00
"it's the commodities  broker's that have a hand in driving the prices up. When gas fell to MINUS 37 dollars  a barrel briefly because  there was no place to store it, prices at the pump didn't  reflect the negative gas surplus. for every 20 cents the price of gas drops you can expect at least a increase of 1.20 to 1.60 within the next few months that follow. I remember a time when gas was only .65 cents a gallon rarely if ever has the price gone down in the last 70 years it's all ways gone up & it shall continue  rise as long as gasoline continues to exist"
Really sad time to be a car guy now. Soon we'll be overclocking our cars to get more performance üòÇ.
Putin needs to invade and collect back all of Soviet republics!!
"never under estimate the amount Joe Biden can fck something up. You were trying to keep politics out of it, and that's a good thing. but there was an immediate increase in gas prices as soon as Biden took office and started making changes, and that is undeniable. especially with his deliberate refusal to work with russia anymore for oil, driving gas prices up even father. but gas prices were already starting to go on the rise as soon as Biden started messing with sht, and if you look at a graph, you can see the corollation clearly. 

corollation and causation do not always go together, but its pretty obvious that the oil prices were not on the way up to that extent before he took office."
Coorelation. is. not. causation.
What if u work 45 minutes away from home and only make 15 dollars per hour?
"I dream of a world where gasoline costs 26 dollars a gallon but we've perfected alternative energy infrastructures to a point that allows our society to continue functioning as normal.  Even people who don't directly stand to profit from oil would be right to worry about such a transition if they know how reliant we are on it as a species.  I'm not an idealist.
But I spent most of my childhood in a hospital bed barely able to breath due to smog exposure.  At the age of 9, despite being otherwise healthy, I couldn't walk the length of a soccer field without collapsing and struggling to breath.  I grew up near the San Bernardino Valley, you could physically see the smog if you were on a mountainside looking down into it in the 90's.  The harmful byproducts of oil consumption, for me, was never some abstract concept that may or may not affect the climate in the distant future.  It has caused obvious and immediate harm in my life."
"Thoughts when i saw the title: ya no shit, we knew this forever, who doesn't?"
"this is not TRUTH while President TRUMP was in office we were completely independent of in need of oil - energy from other country's 
Lets go back to President TRUMP'S POLICIES !"
"This is not a persuasive argument.  Renewables aren‚Äôt a practical alternative to fossil fuels, nor will they be for decades, no matter the doom sayers or the cheerleaders.  The reason oil companies aren‚Äôt reinvesting like the used to is political risk. With the democrats in charge who would be fool enough to make the investments needed?"
So basically we have to get fucked so hard by gas & oil prices that we will be forced to switch to renewable resources to stop being fucked
"This is all US policy, when you can short change oil supply, demand goes up and people are greedy.  Look who owns the railway in US, the same people that own the production of EV.  Weird? Retailers cannot get railway to deliver‚Ä¶. US can be independent to overseas oil."
"And this is why China is encroaching in the West Philippine Sea, to survey for oil/natural gas"
"It's not the war, the cartel, Biden, Putin, or peak oil that is at fault; it's just the reality of the globalized energy market during the 2020s (& maybe beyond). Climate change, the power of scarcity, the ruin of abundance, the surreal obliteration & resurrection of the price of oil, and the true power of supply & demand were all factors that built up this sum."
Ok I'm going to invest in oil so I can get some of the short term profits. What the hell can happen gas prices go down ha ha not under this president
"Sure wouldn't have anything to do with the DemonRats and the green freaks declaring war on fossil fuels with the ""Green New Deal""... And this video says nothing about it.. Its total Bullshit!"
When did the Green New Deal get passed by both houses of Congress and get signed into law? Did you watch the video and properly understand it?
I was there working in these fracking but I never lived there. So you're half right. The only person that is causing these high gas prices is simple JOE BIDEN not my president  puppet .
No it's this President in the white house
My Climate-Change-anxiety-induced depression is back and this time it's burning my wallet.
Fun fact: EVs are powered by oil and coal. They are less efficient than gas engines because of the number of energy storage transitions involved in getting the power from a fossil fuel-powered power generator to the wheels.
"@chris rawr Meanwhile in my Mitsubishi Mirage...50 MPG, not hybrid or electric."
Correct depending on where you are a Tesla can burn upto one pound of coal per mile driven each pound of coal burned releases 2 pounds of co2 compare this to gas which is 20 pounds of co2 per gallon and that means a Tesla can be equivalent to a gas powered car getting 10 mpg.
"Can't make an unbiased expensive oil video like this without mentioning Joe Biden's energy killing policies.  He approved Russia's pipeline while stopping our own.  Harsh regulations and bearish policies/mentality made us go from net exporter of energy to RECORD HIGH GAS PRICES. Wendover, you need to correct your video to reflect this ""fact"", doubt you'll do it but I hope you do, to remain journalistically honest."
"Gas has got expensive because the oil/gas compsnies are going for profit
 now and we are getting screwed . .I've been scared into getting solar in .I didn't want too . But if it's going higher n higher I need to protect myself . But at my age I thing someone else is gonna benefit and not me  ."
Because Big Oil wants to sodomize us?
So basically gas prices are high because of manufactured scarcity? But all the conservatives keep telling me it's because of Biden.
"@Will Smith 
Except no. Gas prices kept going up even after that pipeline, gas prices were low relative to income before they even started working on that pipeline and there isn't a real scarcity because there is a plethora of oil wells still pumping around the world and mountains of stockpiles and many thousands of drill sites that they haven't even tapped yet."
"If America still had all the food we've wasted over the last two decades, we'd have enough food to feed the world for 2 decades.  Godliness with contentment is great gain.
Having food and clothes, be therewith content."
So what's new here? It's always been profits over people plain and simple fact.
"Great video, the one problem is you didn‚Äôt mention the cancellation of the key stone pipeline, pause on all new fracking projects on public land, and the 2 or 3 other things the new administration did. Each resulted in immediate massive effects on the futures markets. The very existence of the current administration probably chills oil companies to their core. Not saying it‚Äôs good or bad. Just saying it happened, and is more likely the origin of our insane prices, especially considering how a release of 30% of our strategic oil reserves had such a big effect on the market short term. Peak oil doesn‚Äôt matter as much in the United States, where domestic growth isn‚Äôt based on overall growth of the oil market, it‚Äôs just based on replacing other sources of oil, and there is plenty of room to grow on that front. Bring Canada into the mix, the continued rapid development of combustion engines, new uses for oil opening up, for American oil companies, the best is yet to come, if left up to the market at least. The United States is a huge part of the global market, but our domestic market is pretty insulated because of that, ironically."
The pipeline wasn't even 8% done so it uses was almost non existent it could've transported like what 3-7% of the national crude oil
"@Sesju perhaps you would be well served getting multiple news sources and then mixing a little common sense in. Pipelines are the most efficient form of transport, and are used worldwide."
"I thought the keystone pipeline was just waste oil, as it will have more negative effects than good ones? It will have to be cleaned and processed multiple times which will increase price? I thought that‚Äôs why it was canceled because it was not cost effective and the amount produced was minimal? Literal worthless cash grab for companies"
The reason fuel prices whent up it's called corporate greed just like everything else that has gone up its greedy they found a way to fuck the American people so there doing it
They gotta be nationalized
"I watched this video and now I'm gay. Checkmate, liberals!"
"You mean gay people don't use energy!   Wow, must be a conscientious group."
"Hmmm.....No mention at all about the Keystone pipeline; and, no mention at all about the United States becoming energy independent and becoming a major exporter of oil under the leadership of former President Trump.  We are now at the mercy of other major oil exporting countries some of whom hate the United States and some of whom have very shaky and dubious governmental leadership.  Venezuela, Iran, and Iraq are prime examples."
The only reason CA gas has gone from $2.50 to $6.00+/gal is  to make money. There is all the gas you can afford to buy and plenty left over. The double tankers show up at Costco 6x a day hell or high-water under the same production process as years ago. It goes up every summer with the 'summer blend and demand' manure dispensed as if it's a surprise.
"Traits of theives,  see it, like it, take it"
We know why.......Eye sockets and Open pockets
"THISIS all Putins fault.  He FOR ED Biden to do everything possible to shutter the American fossil industry on the day he (Biden) took office.  By doing this he made sure his Russian Oil would be worth more and thus he could fund his war against Ukraine and Biden was more than willing to help his.

No seriously this isBIDENS fault for his Administrations PATHOLOGICAL HATRED of fossil fuels.  Check the data prices started going up THE DAY HE WAS SWORN I TO OFFICE.

We were better off withTrump."
Joe Biden is why fuel costs are up.
Explain using points that oppose the ones in the video please üôÇ
"This is what happens when you print money based on nothing, and then you spend it. The democrats have no friggin clue how money works‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt create wealth with a printing press, you can destroy wealth with one."
Begging countries for oil & baby formula. Record high gas prices. How bout that 'Build Back Better?' Impeach Biden. üòû
Fuel prices are so expensive because its part of the plan to further push for all electric cars... It's being done on purpose...
No audio
"New idea:





Nuclear energy!

I know, it's a crazy thought, but damn is it actually a fact that it's a far better source of energy than anything else.

No, you won't get irradiated or blown up.  That's not how it works.  Check out Kyle Hill and get yourself educated on this absolutely necessary energy efficient tool.

Hell, France has been at it for YEARS, and without an issue.  Let that sink in."
"@Nigel Marshall Kenyon Abbott 
Kyle Hill talks about how modern nuclear power plants work.  They don't explode any more, that's one point he makes known, as now there are safety precautions made to prevent that from happening."
Every........energy source is risky on some level.  The best source is the one with the least risk
"This video is so incredibly misinformed it's almost pathetic. Making the assertion that oil producers in America are not expanding investments due to volatility of markets is ridiculous. The reality is that producers are suffering from supply constraints that almost every manufacturing company is suffering from. It's not that they don't WANT to invest, it's that projects are slated for months out due to a lack of equipment, wireline, trucks, employees, and regulatory setbacks. Renewable market penetration still sits at 5% and hasn't exceeded this range at all. 

I thought this channel would offer unique insights but instead it presents biased projections based on less than substantiated conclusions."
"I just want to point something out - for those that are not early adopters of EV's. Its not entirely your fault, because cheap house doesnt give a F*** to have charging stations connect to each apartment electrical panel. So there are alot of people that cant - and wont be able to - afford EV's, they wont have a useable location to charge them. Since landlords of cheap houseing doesnt give a F*** about offering options, and for those that might say - just buy a hybrid. Well, no - those are being gobbled up by everyone that doesnt want to pay OPEC. So that solution doesnt help solve the issue."
One of many restriction involving an electric 'transformation' into the future
EVs are powered by oil.
"Yes, there were 9000+  leases, but the Mumbles administration imposed harsh review processes.  Environmental review processes can take up to 10 years before an approval.  Oil drillers said, whatever and stopped."
"@Mike AN I am not opposed, but they must be done organically, not mandated.  Electric is not a solution.  All energy sources present a risk.  These risks must be weighed out and presented to the marketplace to evaluate"
@Mike AN Yes. They don't reduce harm.
Are you opposed to measures being taken to try to reduce the excessive damage that we cause to this planet?
gas went from 2.75 a gal 3 ish months ago to 5$ a gal now wtf
Inflation = middle class make more rich know it and they want it. Wala inflation
Because Frauden and his puppets keep demonizing fossil fuels.
"I'm furious!!! Biden refuses to use our own resources.  How are all the democrats paying fir gas!?! Do you think this is poor planning?? Also these landlords are jacking up the rent in Texas.  Californians are buying up apartment buildings (not just them).  What I'm seeing is take advantage while landirds can get a lot if money and cause even medium income families not just poor not ge able to have an apartment, house nothing!! Homelessness on the rise because Biden and his team feel sorry for anyone but Americans!!! I'm not happy.  This is putting stress now on families and kids.  Food prices are out the rook.  A chuck roast, not angus not even 3 pounds $14.  Not ok.  It's cheaper to live in a hotel abp than rent. Say ac1 bedroom $1400 then dep.  admin fee and then nickel dime you to death.  I get annuity and social security but still not enough to rent.  They want three times the rent.  Get those democrats out of office.  Trump will drill and secure the border and will mKe criminals stay in prison.  Mexican mafia will be gone!! Stop this insanity!! And he will hopefully tell the education system you do not own our kids.  You teach subjects not how to have sex or change sec.  boys will not play girls sports.  Do you see how our country is a pike if shi_??? And who are the shi_ makers??  Look no further than who sits in the Whitehorse."
JihadJoe did that
The cause is Creepy Joe and the DemocRATs.
"They can create all the scarcity they want but  when it starts affecting regular Americans, eventually markets will prevail and so will the ballot box."
wishful thinking
"There is natural gas reserves for at least 300 years but nobody wants to talk about it‚Ä¶ cause that is the way politicians work, promoting their own agendas for their own economic benefits, and don‚Äôt even think your fancy electric overpriced car is the solution cause if u do ur even more ignorant that the average uneducated person on this country, rest my case"
It's the globalists that stole the election!! They are doing it on purpose!! No fn way they could be that fn stupid!!
"Let me save you time‚Ä¶ the reason is corruption money and power, they usually prey on the innocent, the more needed, the more ignorant, that is about 90% of the population‚Ä¶ so there is plenty to go around to prey on.. and as usual all we do is watch and suffer in silence, u think guns and racial issues along with migration , covid ,is a big problem? Well u r wrong it is all a big distraction while they stick it to the common man"
"It‚Äôs corporate greed plain and simple,not ‚Äúrocket science‚Äù."
"Also ""companies just don't have the appetite to drill"" couldn't be further from what's actually going on. If you think they're ""just laying down for renewable energy"" you're higher than a kite. Just because there are 9000 approved drill permits doesn't mean those companies can just go in and set up. So much more goes into it than one drill permit. You're either willingly leaving that out or are just that dumb when it comes to that point."
"The ""Era of Scarcity"" isn't here lmao that's just what they want you to think so they can sell the renewable energy idea and this electric car bs."
Your telling me there is a Oil Council that nobody knows about that is increasing prices?
there because of greed the war and covid 19 is just ab excuse
"How can a serious look at oil prices ignore the stupidity of cancelling a US pipeline and giving the go ahead to a Russian one?

This created the right conditions for Russia to invade Ukraine; no more worries about damage to trans Ukraine pipelines."
Under 45 the US exported more than it consumed. It has doubled since 46. He says get used to it. North America has the most oil in the world. I don't want to hear any excuses. OPEC is only around because it uses the backing of the US dollar.  Without OPEC the dollar plummets. One needs the other. Vicious cycle.

Is weird that any biden supported is here to respond for this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
"The renewables are not going to help much until the technology is actually developed! Electric cars are far from an ideal solution and many people just don't want to buy one for twice as much as a regular car. And incentives/rebates aren't enough to help. I'd personally go broke if I were forced to buy an EV. The tech is hopelessly immature still. And the one thing that almost nobody wants to  talk about is the fact EV batteries go bad after a while and they are enormously toxic, so where are we going to put all of those toxic, old worn out batteries? They are so bad they are only a notch below nuclear waste material!! 

If hypothetically, millions of people started buying these EVs, the storage of old batteries would become a significant problem very fast. But so far this hypothetical could not happen because the production of EVs could not keep up if people could suddenly afford these hyper expensive cars plus they'd have to suddenly actually want them, none of that is going to happen any time soon. So fuhgeddaboudit! It's mostly tree-hugging radicals that are the ones buying them right now because they like to virtue signal about how green they are. You can almost hear them patting themselves on the back.  

I do know people that have bought them for a different reason ( but did they mortgage their house in order to do so?), thinking they'll save money on gas. But since the price of the car was so much higher than a regular car, it will take a long time for them to actually see that savings! They could have bought two gas powered Honda Civics for the price of one EV. Or pretty close to it. But they don't seem to realize this stuff. And by the time they start seeing the savings, they'll need a new battery, at which time they might regret their purchase of one in the first place. So, gas cars are going nowhere for quite a while."
"Though there are other reasons that are more significant, the Russia-Ukraine war is a contributing factor to the high cost of gas, as well as food, and inflation in general."
"with uncle joe's promise to end the oil and gas industry, oil companies will not spend a ton of new money on drilling and pipelines.  until the government is more encouraging to the industry we are stuck with ever higher prices at the pump and higher utility bills.  new regulations requiring bio-fuels being added to gas will not help in lowering costs as well."
"This artificial inflation is created by Biden's admin closing and dismantling Texas and Oklahoma oil feilds, threatening huge fines, incarceration, and possibly executions if brought back online by the, now classified as terrorists, oil barrons. They also shut down the XL pipeline and sealed the Canadian pipeline at the border creating skyrocketing prices, raising delivery costs, increasing retail products prices, especially food. Eventually the shortage will cause trucking and distribution problems causing food shortages, creating panic, rioting, and unnecessary deaths.

Russia supplies 3%, of our oil and can't cause a shortage.

To reverse this economic catastrophe just reverse the procedure they followed to create it.
PUMP THAT OIL!!!

All this to force EVs on the public without upgrading the grid which currently has rolling blackouts with regular usage. Millions of EVs charging on top of regular usage should send us back to the Stone Age when the grid fails.
I wonder what happened to the trillions for infrastructure?

Our armed forces should realize that the elected officials are commiting unethical, traitorous acts and should be removed from office and replaced with true Americans that won't rape the public and America.
Thomas Jefferson shot a traitor on the White House front lawn.

WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!"
"19:37 What are you even talking about? do you not know what lubricants are? what about oil byproducts? which were mentioned at the beginning of this video?

"6:14 that pipe pretty much climbed every mountain, forded every stream"
"Oil going negative was a big shock to the system and certainly had demoralizing impact on future investment in oil production. However, having untold millions of dollars invested in a pipeline and then having it shut down out of the blue for political reasons has a much greater demoralizing impact on investment. Market demand is there, and its not going away. A random fluke caused by a one off event is much easier for the industry to adapt to than ever changing, and increasingly hostile regulatory environment. You mention the unused leases but omit the fact they are not being issued the road permits or pipeline leases. Its rather difficult to develop a lease when you are not allowed to go to or do anything on it. When faced with open hostility from the government the best option is to turtle and wait. The oil isn't going anywhere, and increasing in value. There are also still advancements being made in drilling technology and theory that will make it cheaper to drill. Why invest millions into a hole, that already has a chance of being a dud, when the government may randomly decide to kill your project, again.

When the government changes over to one that is not openly hostile to the oil companies they will ramp up drilling and in the quest to take market share and make more money they will drive the price back down. We may not see sub $2.00 gas again because of inflation, but we will see cheap oil again. It will probably start leveling off in late 2024 and falling mid 2025. If the recession we are heading into now is still going on the drop will end it and start the boom, but the boom will cause another small spike in prices but hopefully investment will keep pace and by 2026 or 2027 we will be back to relatively cheap oil. 

You can claim we are in the last days of oil, but there is still the better part of a century left of oil being the dominate energy source globally. There are still no large scale alternatives that can be rolled out world wide. There are niche alternatives like EVs for city dwellers who never leave the city, but those don't work well for rural residence, people who haul a bunch, or the guy living in a shack in Africa. Oil does. Even as renewables start taking over there will still be a need for oil in manufacturing the renewables. How much of that shiny new EV is plastic?  And that's just the residential side of things. When you start looking at commercial or even industrial needs its the same thing. Heck most of our food is grown using massive amounts of fertilizer. Care to guess what its made from?"
"@Everett L Williams II Oil has recovered, its currently around $120 a barrel. Production has not kept up with demand. Also I think you are under estimating how much oil is used for fertilizer and plastics. Nuclear is hands down the best option for base line power, however that would not end our dependence on OPEC or Russian oil. It would greatly reduce our need for coal and natural gas, both of which we are already net exporters of. We have the ability to produce enough oil domestically to meet our needs, especially if we can get the demand for oil to start declining. That so far has not happened, and hasn't really shown any indications of happening any time soon. There over all trend is up with the occasional dip that coincides with economic down turns or the tiny bits people save around the margins when it gets super expensive. Oil is not a dying beast. It is the corner stone of global economy and what allows us to keep world hunger as low as it is. 

A truly viable alternative will take a long time to develop and deploy. Electorally based vehicles and industry are not perceived as reliable, quite the opposite in many cases. There's also the question of how environmentally friendly these green technologies actually are. CO2 is not that difficult to deal with. Nature already does and we can just copy and scale her blueprint if necessary. The impact of Lithium on the other hand is not so easy to deal with. The mining process requires massive amounts of water but Lithium tends to only be found in deserts. This means they would have to drill and tap into aquifers to supply the 5,000 gallons a minute a mine would need. That would drain the aquifer and take the water from food production. Some aquifers can take hundreds or even thousands of years to refill. We can sequester carbon and turn it into a house naturally way faster than that. There's also the issues of who controls the Lithium and cobalt. The major producers of both are fans of slave labor so I'm not sure that's a solid moral argument either. 

The technology to go fully electric simply isn't there yet. Without oil the 3rd world is doomed to stay in abject poverty and millions, possibly billions will starve to death. If it perfect? No, but you have to compare the alternatives. Converting to Nuclear for baseline power is probably the best thing we can do right now and that, along with infrastructure upgrades and redundancies , will help convert more fixed location industry to electric. The power going down and having to shut the plant down because someone cant drive is bad. Anything mobile will probably still be better off being powered by oil. City commuters converting over to an EV would have a positive impact on air quality in cities for sure, but you need to be aware and accept, that as that happens child slaves in the Congo are literally dying in the mines to make it happen. 

Nothing is simple and nothing is black and white. An 'All Electric Future"" sounds great, but it comes at a cost. I personally want to see max domestic oil production where we can do it safely with minimal environmental impact and create an economic boon that benefits everybody here while at the same time increasing Nuclear power and incentivizing people to convert to electric where feasible and take practical steps to conserve energy."
"As oil tries to recover,  renewables and electrically based vehicles and industry will be perceived as the reliable source of power and products. Fertilizer production is not going to sustain the global oil industry, nor will plastics or any other side use of petroleum and gas. 

If we have any sense, nuclear will fill in the gaps for 24x7x365 energy production and for process heat. Nuclear can be entirely under national control and we will no longer care what OPEC does with oil prices. In-country oil&gas production will suffice for the production of fertilizer and plastics and lubricants while we can get enough dirty crude elsewhere cheaply enough for paving and roofing materials. If we need more carbon-based products, we can extract them from coal and use nuclear power to extract them from the atmosphere, something that we may have to do in any case to save our hides from extreme climate change. 

Yes, hydrocarbons have this narrow window to once again rip us off, but it is the dangerous thrashing of a dying beast. We need to punish them if they get too greedy."
"Yeah the video was pretty well made but that last section kinda threw me off. I‚Äôm not saying I particularly want oil to stay or go but bluntly the whole world runs on oil. Oil will die out like coal when the entire global industry begins shifting to other energy sources, which as of right now is not happening. When oil companies and investors regain faith in the industry (likely due to a more lenient future legislation) digging will resume like crazy. There is such an insane amount of oil still in the world that to claim that its on its dying breaths comes off as a little naive."
"Don't need a video to explain it's not a wars doing. Leftists are out to destroy America. Understand why the motto was, ""build back better""? It didn't need repairing but has to be ruined so Communism can be implemented."
"Because of Joe Biden and his failed policies and ""presidency""!!!!!!!!"
"Renewable energy is not really renewable. It still takes non-renewable resources to make them and the service life of wind and solar is short, they also need a reliable back which usually is based on petroleum."
@Grizzly Bear don't talk about that one it doesn't align with the agenda
What about nuclear
Sustainable energy
What was I meant to be persuaded of?
Hydrogen Fuel Cells are still as viable as ever....
"Lemme boil it down:
RAT gas: $5+ per gallon and rising.
Trump gas: $1.87.
The RATs want $12 diesel. (Can you say ""depression""?)"
Still don't want an EV...
"It might be myopic thinking, but leftists and other one world government types have been trying to kill the oil industry one way or another for decades, and they deserve the most credit for these economy killing fuel prices."
"I'll laugh when oil and gas gets so high that people can't afford to buy it and their cars and can't go to work an this is the funny part,  Can't pay Taxes ü§£ then I think the Government will look at this different.."
Capitalism‚Ä¶.
"renewables? r u shitting us? I am all about ""renewables"" but show me a dense enough commodity that can lift a plane with cargo or propel a rocket. Nuclear?? ha   with the environmental nutcases running around? Please child. Go back to making cat videos"
The one and only time I will say I'm lucky to live in Missouri. Most gas stations don't go over 4 dollars a gallon and the cheapest gas stations can be less than 2.5 dollars a gallon.
Where in Missouri? I‚Äôm right next door in Kansas and gas just jumped to 4.70 today
"Your data and story may have some truth. But when the price at the pump goes up by $1.00 or 75% per litre and they are only just talking about putting up the prices, before the tanks in the petrol station even get refilled or the oil tanker even makes it to the docks. I'm calling GREED and bad business owners. These halfwit owners are trying to make their forecasted profits that they think we owe them from the past 2 year loss to covid lockdowns. Other companies have come up with another plan, ""Demand"" faking demand gives them right to put any price they want goods. Can't wait till a loaf of bread is $10. Thanks GREEDY business owners don't you get it! Profiteering benefits no one in the end."
"I can't even begin to say how much of this is just factually wrong... 
.
Throwing opinionated ideas at an issue isn't actually helpful üëé"
"oil needs to end sooner than later.  This overpricing is just driving (excuse the pun) car owners to EVs!  Yes greedy corporate capitalism has everything to do with the price hikes and yes it has spurred the USA attempting at controlling Russia's oil resources.  Ukraine is just the playing field, and their president is just a bad actor."
No oil bec ppl now believe in fairy dust from Woke Disney?
Let‚Äôs go Brandon!
"Your persuasion didn‚Äôt work.  Me being in the medical field I have found ‚Äújust because you said it, doesn‚Äôt make it correct.‚Äù   And, you ended stating ‚Äòfor those who don‚Äôt change full sources now will pay more for it later.‚Äô   That statement missed the whole supply/demand that you talked about earlier."
*fuel not full
"The end of petroleum is no where near. All forms of alternative energy require oil. Gear oil for the gear boxes in wind turbines, transmission fluid in EV's, dielectric oil Etc, etc. Ladies, you'd pee your pants if you knew how much petroleum has to do with your make ups. This is a great video with amazing information, but it's still the same old argument that has been going on for nearly 50 years."
"you think that attacking peoples fuel, food and weapons supply is not an act of war, you are completely wrong. communications and blackouts are next."
"16:55 Of course investment in USA domestic oil production is down.  When you have a government that is threatening to shut down and disable the petrol business at every turn, even one dollar of investment doesn't make financial sense.  There is no long-term benefit to investing in a business that may soon be OUT OF BUSINESS.

Due to democratic, progressive, and eco-warrior government policies, investing in petrol is a bad idea.  Soon, if not already, the place to invest is in BICYCLES and HORSES -- because someday soon, bikes and horses might be the only way to get around if the petrol industry becomes defunct."
The actual reason fuel is so  expensive is because governments and the NG0s that own them want to make you poor and limit your ability to travel.
"Did the US policy switch after the 2020 Election change the industry much? (for example Joe Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline with an executive order day1.) How do you all think this affected the industry... Please just information, no political complaints."
"From the Daily Caller, Amanda Carey, 3/30/2011:

As director of the Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, Steven Chu, Obama‚Äôs secretary at the Department of Energy, said in an interview that gas taxes should slowly be increased over the next 15 years in order to force people to turn to alternative energy sources.

‚ÄúSomehow, we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to levels in Europe,‚Äù said Chu.

Policy definitely has changed, and politics, as usual, are heavily involved."
"Does this documentary examine the globalist war on oil, cancellation of drilling leases, cancellation of pipelines, etc. or anything actually true and relevant?"
"Everyone knows its not the war. Its just a convenient setup to invade Russia for their oil and gas resources.
Or a distraction from the Internati0nal tr3aty f0r pand3mic pr3paredness and resp0nse."
You could really thank your very dumb president for that one.
It's the highest I've ever seen it in KC... creeping in 5$ at the pump today. ive lived here since the 90s
I only found conflicting information on if rail or pipeline are safer to transport oil. I don't think that's as clear cut as stated here. Agreed with it being more expensive in the long run though.
Kinda long-winded.  Seven Sisters controlled oil for many years.  Billionaire families backed by the CIA and US State Department.  Now expanded but still super-concentrated in the hands of a few super-billionaires who control the markets and the governments.  Major reason for the war in Ukraine.  Certainly underlies all the Mideast dictators and wars.  Many people will starve this year due to their greed.
"It seems to me that the most impactful fact that leads to a surge in prices is the speculation. It seems that under the Monetary System speculation can make prices rise exponentially. There are just too many artificialities.

What until they manage to turn air into a commodity. Now it is clear to me that we are in desperate need of a completely different socio-economic system that must be superior to the preset one and all those of the past.

Trying to make the current system sustainable is not going to work in the long term, that is not a real solution to human problems. It's like applying a band-aid to the problems instead of tackling the root causes."
@obsolete optics seems like that is something worth trying and finally start generating a culture with different values of those we have today. It seems to me that a system like a Resource Based Economy as proposed by The Venus Project is a must if we manage not to destroy ourselves before
"‚Äã@gasoline you mean with any system of the past? There is absolutely no reason humans should stop at the systems we've had in the past and now. 

Just like in Science & Technology where we keep moving forward, we have to do the same when it comes to socio-economic systems, we need to implement new ideas. 

""Any system will be taken advantage of by people who want more power"" that's because there was always a lot of social stratification, where you'd always have the Haves and the Have Not, and that is not then only way of doing things."
"@Helio Cardoso Also the problem with Socialism is that in theory, everyone shares ownership or the Government, I mean people do not like the Government now, I doubt they will like it better if the Government had more control. in the end, I just believe any system will be taken advantage of by people who want more power, it has happened time and time throughout history."
"@EnchantedPencil Comics yeah I guess right now Socialism would benefit us all more than Capitalism for sure.

However it seems that we need to have something better than Socialism, Capitalism and all other systems of the past. We don't have get stuck with what we've had.

If there's a great quality in Human Beings (for better or for worse) it's the ability to innovate. And in terms of socio-economic systems there has been very little innovation. We're still stuck with old and outdated ways of arranging society"
"@Helio Cardoso You said ""we are in desperate need of a completely different socio-economic system""
We need socialism"
The laws surrounding new refineries in America are pretty messed up too.
"Gas prices went down under Trump, gas prices goes up under biden and democrats"
"Peak oil has never been reached. Half of oil production goes toward product manufacture. The demise of the internal combustion engine will not halt the requirement for oil and gas. Steel is an alloy of iron and coal and the coal fired power stations being installed every week across China, India Asia and elsewhere are being installed for 40 years service at least, therefore coal will be required for a very long time. The expanding economies of China, India, Asia, coupled with the exponential technological explosion ahead assisted by robotics and A.I. will ensure insatiable demand for fossil fuels as the world gets richer and hungrier for products for the foreseeable future . The ability of the providers of fossil fuels to adjust the taps of supply to keep profitable and keep investing will continue I think. Renewables and nuclear can provide energy but not products."
I‚Äôm convinced.
The private oil co are screwing us !
"If they hold us over the ""barrel"" there's going to be some real scary shit happening to them I foresee.
Not me personally but desperate times usually end up with desperate measures and a person who is desperate is dangerous.
Just saying."
Expensive oil will bankrupt the world. That's the objective. To make everyone beg papa mega rich for everything. This save the planet stuff is hocus pockus.
Now in Florida we are paying $4.80 a gallon it cost me $58.00 to fill my car.
Make money available for independent drilling.  - problem solved.  But not with this president.
Nice presentation but renewables are far from ready
"the direct fault of the stolen american election and joe biden's handlers policies. we were energy exporters  and energy independent under the trump administration. any other explanation is total bullshit.
people have a memory longer than the latest false flag or the next current thing."
Totally agree.
"The end made it sound like you are making the argument that oil companies are keeping supply down to keep prices high to encourage people to transition to stop using oil. I fundamentally disagree with this premise as it doesn't make sense for a company to encourage you transition away from buying their product. The main takeaway I can gather from what you said about why prices are high now, is that there is pressure from external sources (namely government) to keep prices high to pressure the populace away from oil. I was kind of confused about your conclusion other than we should stop using oil."
"Hmm, explain to me why in 2020 we paid $2/g and 6 months into 2021 it double?  Hmmm"
Uhhh this presidency is why.. no other explanations needed it is that simple
Your simple if you think that
LGB that's why.
Keep lying about oil and gas. The real problem has always been the mentally ill - AKA demoncrats
"So Biden saying he was going to destroy the Oil industry in the USA,SHUTTING DOWN THE xl PIPELINE had no effect Wendover??  :)
 Really lol.."
The price of oil would be $60 to$70 dollars a barrel in the USA if Biden would uncouple the price from world price.  He can do that today.
"Well, that's one OPINION. At least he admits this video is propaganda. But I promise you, as the price paid per barrel increases so will the investment and production of oil. Prices will come down at that point."
welcome to bidens green energy policy
I think fossil fuels and the by products will be with us for a very long time if not indefinitely. We will run out of the elements to make batteries first.
"Renewables will not take over from oil. At least not solar and wind. Right now, nuclear is the only option."
It's about economy of scale.
"The CEO of Exxon Mobil was on CNBC and he said they had just had the largest single day profit in US history of 217 billion dollars but that it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the price of a gallon of gas had gone up over a dollar in just one week.
He insisted the two things were just a coincidence and had nothing to do with each other."
"U.S. Oil Companies, like Exxon, are reporting record quarterly profits.  They are doing *NOTHING* to help consumers - they could easily take a little less profit to ease the pain at the pump for the average American gasoline consumer.  Yet they continue to do NOTHING."
Total greed
They should have waited for the Correction. Never give a knee jerk reaction
Stop üõë this Insanity
The main problem Is petro dollar and main culprit is United States no matter how you whitewash through these videos
"What a joke. Americans moan while having to pay 1,2 dollars per litre on an average of 60k per year salary, UK pays 2,2 dollars on a ~40k salary. Some european nations pay 1,8 dollars on a ~25k salary.  Gimme a break yanks, you have the cheapest gasoline in the world."
I fucking miss $1.10 gas. I pay 5x that now. :(
"Good video, but be honest, while the buildup has been happening for years to make oil companies loath to invest in extraction in another supply shortage boom, it needed a trigger to get THIS expensive, which of course is the w-...special military operation."
Opinion piece . .    Wrong and misguided . .   Fossil fuels are the future  . . . @ least for another 100 years . . .  Solar panels don't make chemical fertilizers or plastics . . . No commercial air travel would be possible with renewables  . . . Any politician that deprives the public of affordable transportation fuels and reasonably priced groceries will be promptly removed from office. Prepare for a Trump landslide in 24'   . .  The public will reject poverty and deprivation every chance they get.
This man knows nothing about the oil markets haha.
It is all a big rip off there are people in Canada who were working full time at the lower end of the pay scale who live out of town like many who live here well now they can not afford gas to drive to work and be able to eat so all they can do is go on welfare and sit at home well done you people running the country and your bosses big oil soon the peasants will have to pick up there pitchforks and fix this problem
"The only thing that can get a handle on this situation is a different president. As one or more have mentioned, oil is not going away ever and, transitioning to renewables is going to take 20 yrs. In the meantime, many many will suffer and the economy will suffer as a result. BD"
"Essay my ass, you hit the nail on the head!"
Dude really awesome video helped me understand the going on of why 12 states want electric cars on the road
Capitalism is the problem
people's unwillingness to change is the problem politicians make it far worse with the lies and propaganda about renewables that just aren't true like it or not you will change.
Wrong...
Count yourself lucky american. Here in canada it's  $ 7.90 cad a gallon .
Moving into a carbonless world... what a joke.
Great video but oil isn‚Äôt going anywhere in our lifetime.

Greed and the end of Fossil fuel dependency is the only cause
"Great presentation, as usual it did not disappoint. 

I am someone who works in one of the more extreme logistical choke points in California‚Äôs crude supply chain (I work within sight of Valero‚Äôs Wilmington refinery, but, spoiler alert: most of their crude doesn‚Äôt cross their dock in the Port of LA, but actually moves across our docks in the Port of Long Beach). 

I found much of what you said to be sensible, and on target.   There are other factors that I think are baked into the cake that has brought us $6/gallon gasoline.   Chief among them must be the effect that our COVID Dollar-printing spree had upon increasing the value of a commodity in global demand.   When you go from something like $21T in outstanding debt to $27-28T in a couple of years, there must be an impact.  

In the same way that California has been the canary in the coal mine with gasoline regulations and reformulation, the coming years will show how feasible the timelines for renewables and electrification truly are. 

In a place where keeping the lights and air conditioning 100% on during a heat wave seems to challenge the power grid, many folks are understandably skeptical about the ability of the grid operators to deliver even more electricity around the clock as a motor fuel, and time will tell if the consumers will buy into electrification on a timetable that matches up with regulation. 

As for refiners, they‚Äôll keep doing what they do..as more and more of those ships bringing oil to California are no longer leaving empty, but instead filled with diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, and other products that pacific rim nations continue to require."
Oil industry execs are fucking evil bastards
"lol ""we are done with oil"" okay? And replaced with what? Coal? Because the load-bearing grid is still reliant on coal, oil and natural gas. Even if you are driving an EV theres a really good chance you are charging your vehicle with fossil fuel electricity. Oil isn't going anywhere and I'm sick of wealthy beuracrats telling poor people to suck it up."
"BIDEN COULD NOT RUN A BOY'S CLUB, HOW THE FU*K DID THIS HAPPEN?"
I bought an EV. I have bought gas once in 8 months. $60 in 8 months on gas.
What does the electric bill look like now
It's because 5 looks cooler than 3 it's upgraded
We have a rotten President that turned off the Keystone pipeline. That's why gas is so high.
"Cut out production abd exploration, make us dependent on our enemies. These frigging quisling scumbags are the cause."
"BIDEN! YES, I AM YELLING, SEND SOME FEDERAL STIMULUS (SSI SSDI) ON FIXED BROKEN INCOME."
Oil won‚Äôt disappear overnight or even over decades. They will keep making profits for years to come.
"I hope they keep supply low, I'll be laughing all the way to the bank... Just saying, we're going to need oil for a long time."
Its bc gas is running out...peak oil was decades ago
Why Gas Got So Expensive (It‚Äôs Not the War) it is the ( Nationalist Socialist) democratic party led by sock puppet joe biden and the Nationalist Socialist Democratic (NAZI) party leadership (I mean who (whom group  what ever)  has their hand up biden's ass)
You said NOTHING about Biden's executive orders effectively stopping oil production in the US. Those executive orders are why companies quit drilling and producing. The omission of vital facts with the purpose of controlling public thought is propaganda.
"Anybody that thinks petroleum is a 'fossil fuel',  needs to do a lot of research.  Oil was proposed as natural occurring element within the earth back in the mid 70's, of course met with ridicule.  More and more evidence points to it as an almost inexhaustible supply, as the decayed vegetation and dead dinosaur theories prove to be untenable compared to how much oil has been be pumped to this point.  The improvements in the internal combustion engine, and what new improvements might have been discovered before it is being forced to the sideline would make petroleum a forever source of energy.  To do anything, the energy required can be expressed mathematically, and whether you charge a battery for propulsion, or put gas in a car, you can determine exactly what it will take.  If that battery charge comes from coal or natural gas, any environmental savings versus burning gas in an efficient engine is almost nil.  Total energy expenditure and environmental  impact is actually greater for electric vehicles if you factor everything in from mining lithium, the number of specialized items and components used, to the disposal of dead batteries.  If all power came from solar, wind, and nuclear, there might be an argument, but you will not find wind and sun a reliable source of  energy to power a city along with the arc furnaces of steel mills from anything but steam generation turning a turbine powered generator.  Perhaps there is something in the distant future that will be discovered as a replacement to the power grid we use now,  but wind and sun is not the answer as a sole source, and is just a novelty.  Yes, I have seen the endless wind farms in Indiana, seen them churning away, and also have seen thousands of them still as stone.  But I also remember the day when capitalism and competition gave us, Sinclair, Esso, American, Gulf, Texaco, Mobil, Sunoco, Shell, Murphy, Phillips 66, and other independent drillers and refiners supplying this country, and now mostly killed by Wall Street, and government regulations, forcing them into giant companies with no competition, sending oil to be refined in our biggest Texas refinery that was sold to, an now owned by the Saudis.  We screwed ourselves, and now pay the price."
Because the Union Pacific Railroad was mandated by the government to reduce its petroleum transportation in the United States 25% don't let them lie to you
This is why America started the war in Ukraine and said it was Russian influenced. Thank you to Biden and his administration.
Thanks!
The Worst Day In America's Economy Will Be The Downfall of American Greed Because You See Sometimes You Lose So Much You Simply Can't Recover Your Losses Arabs Know This All Too Well And Americans Are Discovering It For The First Time That Sometimes It's Better To Stand There And Do Nothing So That You Can Keep What You Have Instead of Losing It All Because You Thought You Could Make A Difference In Someone's Life Some Say The Age of Cheap Fuel Is Over That's Interesting I Didn't Know Anyone Was Still Driving Cars After 2001
"Its still to cheap, you voted for Biden, the Dem.  and her Green followers, know you pay the price."
Good
"When government officials state that their intent is to attack and damage the business of oil companies, how did they think it would turn out.  When they treat the largest producer in the world of Saudi Arabia badly, how did they think it would turn out?  Stop blaming anyone except Democrats in the USA, they have caused ALL of these problems.  :-/"
"We pay more than 6$US per gallon, in Canada, since April 2022."
america was mf energy independent during donald trump. stop trying to protect racist and failure joe biden. he's protected by criminals already. just stop.
"Should have known this guy is selling his product, which is his opinion. And he only wants $5 a month. Don't click on this, don't even waste you time. Save your money."
gas prices are high because of the democrats. joe biden said he would do a better job than donald trump. democrats even said that. now trump is kicking your sorry backsides into the ground if you doubted him and cursed his name.
wow great video
"Trump beat the big oil boys by over production.  Biden might be a closet oil investor?  I think this video might be an apology  for his policies.  The video says 5500 words but don't hit real problem.  Old Bob Dylan said ""you got to serve somebody"".  Who do you serve Wendover Productions?"
Trump had ineptness
america was energy independent during donald trump lol
"And yet, gas and oil companies rakes in double in 2022 what they did in 2021. 

Capitalism. It allows them to charge for what they don't need while bleeding you dry. 

There should be a law against this. But that won't happen as long as these companies literally control the government."
"I have yet to hear anyone address the problems that arise from transferring millions of work trucks, not just semis, over to electric. I personally think it is completely impossible, and their are too many cons to list. Oil will not leave any time soon because of the industrial/commercial world. Many hometown operations running trucks 10-30 years old depend on oil fuels to operate their business, and they always will. If electric vehicles were truly viable for industrial/commercial, they would already be commonplace."
"Very sad when you have a KNUCKLEHEAD of a President (Biden) who wants to appease his fellow Democrats and Destroy the FOSSIL FUELS Industry for a worthless ""Green New Deal"" with nothing as an Alternative Fuel in its place!
The average family cannot spend $60k on an Electric Car, when we live paycheck to paycheck! 100% Asswipe in the White House!"
"Whenever we have a Democrat president Big Oil raises the prices to make the president look bad. Big Oil is run and owned by wealthy Republicans. Just wait and see, if and when we get a Republican president, the prices will then go down."
"The solution is removing the anti oil and gas movement on the present supply and demand. The long term solution is nuclear energy that gas produce a gas substitute like butanol. Even alcohol could work except engines would have to be reconfigured to burn it efficiently. I'm not sure of the viability but a Sterling engine that operates on an external energy input, like the steam engines, would be even more efficient and flexible to fuel sources.

Green energy relies heavily on oil and gas fuels and byproducts to manufacture the hardware and requires more resources then it's worth. That goes with EVs that have inherent disadvantages over ICEs. There is no real fix currently except for promising technology. That goes about as far as politicians making promises with me."
"9k approved but unused drilling permits and corporations but don't want to invest??? OR COULD IT BE BIG GOVERNMENT HAS RESTARTED ALL THOSE REGULATIONS HALTING DEVELOPMENT??? Option 2 would be a ""use it or lose it"" mechanism to bust the trusts of big corporations sitting on permits."
"NO ONE SHOULD GET SOLAR POWER TILL IT'S CHEAPER & MORE HONEST, ELIMINATING THE CORRUPTION!"
"A lot of talk just to say the US is not the owner of it's own oil, it's been privatized and they set the price. Unlike the Mexican government whom has recovered back it's ownership and has built one of the largest refinery in the world to supply it's own needs keeping prices down"
"The part I don't understand is how does the gas price change day to day? Its the same gas in the ground as it was yesterday and the same gas in the ground tomorrow. They bought the gas at a certain price, they should sell that tank they bought as a fixed price until its all gone and buy more right? It would be like if I worked at an electronics store and I bought a big shipment of earbuds. Lets say that my cost for the earbuds was $1 each and I sold them in my store for $5. The next day I notice my cost for the earbuds went up to $3 so for some reason I sell the stock I have already bought for $1 for more? No that makes no sense. I already bought them at $1. If I were to buy more after my $1 cost stock is gone, then I would have to sell at a higher price."
If we used coal to heat our homes would the lower demand for oil bring down it's price?
Why did this happen at the same time Joe Biden was inaugurated.
Well uh yes the war is part of the equation and also because contrary to the so called experts the US isn't energy independent.  The pool of oil in the world is extremely sensitive to any interruptions of supply.  OPEC has refused to make up the ten percent Russia contributes to the world oil pool and the US is incapable of making up the deficit.  This convoluted explanation ignores many realities of the world oil supply and  in particular that the oil in the US is now fracked meaning the easy oil is gone.  Yes the US can increase production but at the cost of using up reserves that much faster.  The real lesson here is the time has come to completely transition from fossil fuels.
"Oxygen is gas, too."
"0:30- 0:38  ""The worst day in the oil market's history (April 2020) is responsible for ushering in a new era of record industry profits.""

Saved you 22:23 of your life."
GREED is the real reason.
"It IS the war causing the high prices because Russia exported about 25% of North America's supply. It's also the reason for the war because oil is a limited resource and Putin doesn't actually even want to export Russia's oil and furthermore wants to seize more from Georgia, Ukraine, and Turkey."
"Not sure if you're naive and just repeating what you read in some articles, or you're just out in out lying.  Based on your whiney voice I'm going to go with the former."
"This guy is good at explaining the past, but not at predicting the future. Oil isn't going anywhere for a long time.  The moment we stop interfering with the supply, it will return to true supply & demand. Staying at war with the #2 producer is just one means of interfering with the supply."
"Nah it never has been only about just supply and demand where oil is regarded. And it never will. Every major producing country has different political interests at different times. They then do what they can to increase the price because of need or power. The reason OPEC exists is the wests fault for not letting countries get a bigger part of the profit while the wests companies just worked other countries supply. And more or less prohibited local companies or states to even try to invest. That eventually created OPEC. Because companies tried to lower prices but the countries lived on the part they got. When those countries decolonised and got control of their own oil it became more than just about price. 

So oil has and allways will (as long as its big economy) be more than just supply and demand. And big local production and ownership will prevent what you are implying."
Blame environmentalist they absolutely suck
I believe the world will force oil production because the world is so unstable.
"No, you are not persuasive by any stretch of imagination. You are a leftie peddling the climate change earth saving agenda. And even your voice and the style of delivery is annoying. Your renuables are a joke. They can't fuel industries. And nobody is rushing to buy any EVs."
So it raised like $2 the week the war started but it's not the war? okay WENDOVER you have it all figured out
Do you think there is a connection between govt and oil companies to force you to buy an EV? Think about it.
Ok......
This is not true.
"Joe Biden's policies. 
Full stop."
That's an interesting way of saying you didn't watch any of the video.
"Petroleum company greed. We don't buy oil from ""the world"". Our oil comes from the USA and Canada. No reason to pay the world price. We were energy independent under Trump just a year and a half ago. Bidumb has wrecked everything. I thought it would be a long time before we saw a worse President than OBOZO ... only 4 short years of real leadership between messes."
the government is artificially creating a shortage for political reasons while also draining the strategic oil reserves.
It might not be the war but it is definitely Putin and his stooge Donald Trump. They are collaborating to keep gas prices high.
And all this time I thought it was Biden's fault
Remember when oil was $200 a barrel and gas still wasn't $5 a gallon . Now we get $5 gas when oil is $100 a barrel. Some serious price gouging.
@Bax Out The Box Gross vs net profits allude most educated by our public school system.
"One more note I learned today: oil companies‚Äô margin in a gallon of $5 gas is about $.07. The governments‚Äô take in sales and excise taxes exceeds $1.20. Refiners have hefty margins but, again, it‚Äôs a function of no new refineries being built (US) in over 40 years and several shuddering after 2020."
@Terry Bridge Gas companies are making plenty of $
@Bax Out The Box Refinement issies and govt discouragement of petroleum investments carry the blame here.
Democrats
After wasting 22 minutes of my time I still didn't hear the real truth. But I think about 85% of us know the real truth
"At least there aren‚Äôt any more mean tweets, right?"
So printing trillions of dollars had nothing to do with it? And their still printing more.
it is all GREED
Of course it doesnt help Ukraine layed a bunch of mines in the black sea and lost them after that big storm and now alot of ports in Ukraine and Turkey are blacklisted by ships that dont wanna get blown up on accident. Like how stupid can you get
"""The end of oil is near.""

A highly naive way of thinking.  There are many decades of oil left in the ground, and very high demand for the foreseeable future, even if a few ""enlightened"" nations like the US force renewables on their populations.  China, for one, will continue to use fossil fuels regardless of what climate scientists publish.  The same will be true in the developing world."
Gas was too cheap.  People drove on pennies
Use discernment while watching this propaganda and this sellout channel
"And still, I understood nothing"
"Follow the money..... and who will benefit the most from electric vehicles 
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA....."
"Ditto for oil, sheep."
I personally knew something was going to happen after the oil attack in saudi arabia
Just when I bought an overpriced F-250 and an overpriced travel trailer to go with it. Now I can't afford the gas to move them.
How you like biden now?
@TomCook1993 remind me who the other guy was
Soooo much better than the other guy.
‚ÄúMy grandparents were gas guzzling idiots who couldn‚Äôt see past their nose‚Äù‚Ä¶ - The children of the 2050‚Äôs
"10:43 We are sitting on a moutain of oil. Our politicians choose not to drill and instead choose to import oil in California. Thankfully you went on to talk about taxes, fees, and regulations. Which explains our double the average gas prices. I drive to Nevada (literally in the desert on top of a mountain) just 1 mile outside the border of California and prices are half the cost. Enough said"
How can you miss the entire point of the video? Did you even finish watching? Gas Companies REFUSE TO PUMP! It's that freaking simple.
"@dsrtodd we are exporting crude, which we shouldn't. We should refine it, which we can't apparently, due to refinery capacities. So we import refined fuel. that is your problem. We are absolutely a net exporter. Also, many independent shale oil companies are not making profit when crude is cheap. So they reduce production to keep prices high. to my point, the oil companies have no incentive to fix this as long as we keep paying the prices."
"you must not have watched the video.... we can easily produce more oil, the oil companies have no incentive to do so. They make more money with the prices being high, rather than investing billions and the resulting oil prices being low. Oil production in the US has not dropped. we are still a net exporter of oil. Oil companies do however export crude and sell it on the world market for high profits, in turn they import refined fuel at whatever the cost is, and we pay for it. They make the profits, and we pay at the pump. watch the video. 60% of the cost of gas is the price of oil."
You‚Äôre so close to understanding. And yet so far.
Very interesting.  Did the Keystone XL have any effect in the US price?
Long story short‚Ä¶buy TESLA stock.
"This is a hack, they don‚Äôt want them to produce because they want to force people to go electric, That‚Äôs why they did not like Trump because he knew the truth and he spoke it there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôre going to convert over total electric it‚Äôs really simple it‚Äôs called India and China now GFYUPOS"
No mention of the current political climate in the US.  Anti oil policies have reduced the supply and as you have indicated prices can vary substaintially depending on supply.  Renewables are the future but government policies for truly better gas milage would have helped after the 1973 oil embargo along with developing a long term plan for energy.
Gas prices are high because Green Climate Zealots want it high because they want you to buy electric cars. Oil companies are price gouging with record profits and buying their stock back. Has nothing to do with what this channel says. Oil companies reduced their production to further decrease supply. Speculators are buying oil futures contracts yet they don't have oil refineries. This channel is clueless.
0:14 Never forget the day oil companies paid you -$37.62 just to take oil off their hands!
20:29 another attempt to use your opinion to affect real world reality .
20:00 the planet is not in danger.
"19:18 wrong again , the end of oil is not near. not for thousands of years."
18:32 oil is finite but not so that a few decades means anything.
"17:15 new rigs are no longer as needed as the rigs are allready there. the company's have the appetite , but the biden administration is hampering them with the ancillary permits. thank you for shilling for joe biden."
"12:06 the price of oil itself , which is made of of lease costs, mostly a tax and then the tax on each barrel produced another tax, so yes most of the cost of fuel is a tax or taxes."
"I believe it has more to do with corporate greed. Record breaking profits for the oil companies can't be done without enough oil. Its the same old story, the rich get richer, and the working man gets screwed."
1:25 the usa was the lead producer for a few years.
Greed is all you need to know!
All oil business men need culling off... they are evil
"Nonsense, supply and demand is always the game and as prices rise there will be a rush to produce more oil so eventually, economies will slow, recessions will hit, oil production will rise and prices... WILL CRASH AGAIN."
"Biden is the cause. Any other ""reason"" is ignoring the weak leader in charge."
but but.......i thought it was biden's fault gas prices went up all over the world?
the foreseeable future
"Fantastic!  Great information.  Get sick of trumptard relatives complaining about Biden & blame on him.  It comes down to the Oil companies are purposely not obtaining oil from 9k plus locations, They are keeping supply at a low, to create high demand and causing the prices to soar as they are just about the profit. Fk the planet, Fk the people etc.... But gov't I would think could do something but they're too busy getting money too!  This country, our gov't, corporations can simply get away with everything."
"I hear ya. Hell, they're in this comments section as we speak. If only they would just change their opinion & agree more with this video, then we would be looking at more sensible conversations."
So why then did gasoline prices started rising immediately after Dickwad Biden closed the pipeline?
"What bullshit,"
"Data Time's ads just shocked me to death- Like bro, don't come out and say Wendover when i turns 100% focus on him-"
"So this wasn't big oil smashing all the little producers? Lol, this guy is so misinformed"
Right renewables -- and how are all those power plants fueled?
Why not expound on the whole losing money thing? They were expecting pipelines that would bring transportation costs way down. And look at what happened. The Whitehouse ended that -- giving more power to Russia and OPEC
"Wow, talk about misleading. Oil drilling permits are meaningless if geologists don't believe there's any or enough oil to drill."
Oil will be used well into abundance long after you have passed.
Not fact; just persuasive bullshit as a steering mechanism.
"Our fuel prices are high because of a democrat that will go down in history as the 2 stupidest public President and vice president! Global warming is not really here, or they are not sure! Scientist will tell no real proof! we have only been watching the weather for 250 years! The United States Has enough fuel to pump 100 million burels a day for next 200 years!  Biden and democrats have invested in the electric vehicles! It's Called, Insider trading!"
@Y2K Consider the life you have on earth! Research what you are saying! In reality of humans on earth and the age of MOTHER EARTH! you live 19 seconds. Mother earth is always changing!
Anyone else get a Casper ad right after this video? Too hilarious/sad
Good news for renewables!
I have a nagging feeling that Biden is the cause of this. Change my mind.
I was just in England. It‚Äôs expensive there too. I was just in Mexico. It‚Äôs expensive there too. I was just in Canada. It‚Äôs expensive there too. Why would one President have an effect on other nations oil prices? üòÇ he wouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a global issue not singular to the policies of one American President.
I am wondering if your are able to create spln or are your arguments founded in fact?
"OIl is the world's drug of choice and as such there will never be a reason other than GREED as to why it cost on the streets are high Oil prices will never go down to a reasonable price as Oil producers, brokers, refiners and their corrupt following will never allow it since they are the dealers, pushers, kingpins of the product Just like other commodities, such as gold and other metals, same type players, game and outcome! If you think otherwise, keep saying baaaa you wooly creature!!"
And watch gas prices plummet as soon as trump is back in office
"WRONG. That wasn't the first time the price went negative. Just a few years ago in Alberta Canada the same thing happened. Look outside your boarders. There is NO shortage. N. America has enough oil to be self sufficient. The shortage is just another hoax for whatever reason. Maybe another excuse to raise prices. Remember the oil crisis of the '70s? Well, we consume more gas now that we did then, yet we have a surplus. All of the prices are just manipulation of the market by the richest industry in the world. They can do whatever they want without any real controls. Their ""price fixing"" is illegal in most countries, yet has happened for 40 years. Then there are the others that take advantage of our dependence on oil and gas by taxing the crap out of it. The ""reasons"" for the prices as given by this video and the media in general are just excuses to keep the consumers confused while the price of everything the average person buys goes up. The real reasons are simple. GREED."

pedodent joe pulled the plug on production on day one...
the blame for this is our famished leader
"The reason oil prices are soo damn high is because companies aren‚Äôt drilling anymore like they were under President Trump because the first month Biden was in office he hit all the companies that were drilling with every environmental regulation he could to make sure they couldn‚Äôt drill anymore.. So everyone needs to tell a vast majority of the media, which are Liberal democrats to stop JERKING THEM OFF by giving them half the story !!!"
"Well, you were going great explaining the economics of the industry, but when you began theorizing that the supply limitations were because the industry was just giving up, you lost me.  
-Pipelines investment down: politics (you know who) is killing it.  You completely omitted the political influence which is driving all the risk in this industry..
-Oil industry confidence in their future:   Politics -- a political party declaring war on fossil fuel controls this country now.

-Lowering investment:   Politics -   Oil company capital spending has to reflect risks of political reality that their investment in an oil pipeline or a refinery may be condemned by a Federal or local government entity resulting in their losing the investment.
-War:   Fossil fuel will now be the currency of aggressors everywhere just as they were in the 70s when OPEC controlled the major supplies.  And, global warming ""activists"" like Putin and Maduro know how it all works.  
-Warning: If you hear politicians blaming oil companies and starting to talk about price fixing or taxing ""excess"" profits like in the 70s., bet big there's going to be a change in administration.  
You covered a lot of material in 22 minutes, maybe too much.  Add 5 minutes and get it right"
We know it's not the war...it's because the wrong decisions made by mindless Sleepy Joe Biden.
it is the war as well dink
"The next episode: Why cars are so expensive in 2022.
Coming next: Why inflation skyrocketed in 2022."
Government has destroyed paradise
Great analysis. No mention of the 2020 Saudi/Russian price reduction squeeze that pushed a lot of US frackers out of business because of their higher production costs. One wonders if Putin was planning Ukraine already and playing one hell of a long game or if he just got specifically lucky on a generally advantageous strategy.

"Trump supported that B.t.W. honestly, people need to agree more with this video if they don't want to not be taken seriously."
1:35 Trusted Hands = Puppets
Extremely informative. Well down as per usual.
It is because of that idiot babbling Biden. He alone is responsible for this mess.
You didn‚Äôt watch any of the video huh?
"I'm sure no one will see this comment, but Frontline recently released a 3 part series on Big Oil. Everyone in the US should be required to watch it."
Here in Australia we are paying $2.20 A litre   ...so that in American would be $8.80 A gallon     so you in America pay $1.43c a litre  at $5.73c a gallon
"Actually, they'd be paying ~$1.51 USD per litre at that rate per US gallon, which comes to pretty much exactly $2.20 AUD per litre."

"""green"" energy and that's where all the big government money seems to be heading."
This video seems to promote the narrative that somehow the Middle East has all of the oil.  HA!
Just discovered you.  FANTASTIC.  Subscribed.  Keep it up.
"@Savannah WTF, gal?"
"This world is rapidly passing away and I hope that you repent and take time to change before all out disaster occurs! Belief in messiah alone is not enough to grant you salvation - Matthew 7:21-23, John 3:3, John 3:36 (ESV is the best translation for John 3:36) if you believed in Messiah you would be following His commands as best as you could. If you are not a follower of Messiah I would highly recommend becoming one. Call on the name of Jesus and pray for Him to intervene in your life - Revelation 3:20. 

Contemplate how the Roman Empire fulfilled the role of the beast from the sea in Revelation 13. Revelation 17 confirms that it is in fact Rome. From this we can conclude that A) Jesus is the Son of God and can predict the future or make it happen, B) The world leaders/nations/governments etc have been conspiring together for the last 3000+ years going back to Babylon and before, C) History as we know it is fake. You don't really need to speculate once you start a relationship with God.

Can't get a response from God? Fasting can help increase your perception and prayer can help initiate events.  God will ignore you if your prayer does not align with His purpose (James 4:3) or if you are approaching Him when ""unclean"" (Isaiah 1:15, Isaiah 59:2, Micah 3:4). Stop eating food sacrificed to idols (McDonald's, Wendy's etc) stop glorifying yourself on social media or making other images of yourself (Second Commandment), stop gossiping about other people, stop watching obscene content etc. Have a blessed day!"
"I loved your video so much but it barely touched on market speculation as a means of driving up oil prices.  I believe that can play a significantly larger portion of the price increase in gasoline at the pump than you would have us imagine.  Seems to me that American oil producers are taking a page of OPEC's playbook by demonstrating how OPEC's slowdown of 1973-1974 production causes our gasoline prices to soar dramatically by doing the same damn thing.  Slow production, artificially create a shortage of product, and kick back to see prices climb dramatically unnecessarily.  And if in this green-centric world it's politically unfavorable to compel oil companies to increase production levels of a environmentally destroying product that gas & oil represent.  Beautiful - we're all screwed again."
least only to pay shareholders.

"@4:50 Maaaan, that's sucks. Imagine being that poor bastard North Dakota farmer that has to ride his combine and tractor down to Oklahoma and back just to work the field on the other side of the pipeline."
Let‚Äôs go Brandon!
Risk during transport has long since been known as 2-4x more than pipeline and that is safer than trucks. THANX BIDEN! 1ST ACT: F AMERICA BY SHUTTING DOWN OUR PIPELINE. F YOU!!! GET THEM OUT NOW!! We won't survive 4yrs of this asswipe regime!!
The reason is in Washington. They hate America and will destroy us entirely. It's the kind of soulless animal they are. We won't survive 4 yrs. No need for a will and final arrangements. The nukes will eliminate that need.
THE GREAT RESET
"This video is false.
There is no natural scarcity at all.
The Biden Regime intentionally shut down our own Nation's Oil Pipelines.
Then they also cancelled and terminated our Land and Offshore Drilling Leases.
These actions shutoff and crippled our own naturally flowing U.S. supply & delivery of American Oil & Gas.
This was an act of treason against the American people.
In doing this, we are now (unnecessarily) hopelessly dependent on Foreign Sources of Oil, and now face both (unnatural) Supply shortages, and are FORCED to pay High Prices.
This malicious Biden agenda has totally ruined the U.S. Economy, as all goods & services & food depend upon Energy.
As a result we have artificially created supply-chain shortages, and soaring Prices, and runaway Hyper-Inflation.
This was all unecessary.

OPEN UP THE PIPELINES.
OPEN UP U.S. ENERGY PRODUCTION

There is no reason for American Citizens to have to pay high prices for FOREIGN ENERGY sources."
Renewables taking over?  Only via nonsensical government legislation that will be reversed as soon as there's enough outrage among voters to throw the government out and replace it with a party that promises to repeal the idiocy.  How fast will that come?  I'd give it less than 5 years.
"This has absolutely nothing to do with demand and supply or the environment. (In the 70's we were 'running out' of oil. Now that we've found enough that will supply for centuries, it's the CO2 (scam). The elite plan far ahead, infiltrating media, universities etc. They brainwash to keep people from researching for themselves. And... they'll keep doing it until people critically research for themselves. Those who will research should form groups, and the joined groups can effect change by forging ahead with concrete plans. We are in a war ... not a nation against nation ... rather elite control who will do anything to keep us from the freedom and wealth everyone on earth should share in. Politicians must be held accountable ... i.e. deliver or get fired (talk is cheap.) Time for a reset alright, just not the one they're pushing. (Got friends in other countries, communicate with them.) Together we can use their agenda against them. Divided (as the elite want us to be), we will remain and become more enslaved. Our choice."
Umm so you ass wipes are ripping us off using the war as an excuse.  Woe ye take hold on people to play trickery for profit
It cost only $5.5B to build the new pipeline? That's a fraction compared to the $54B that US gave freely to Ukraine recently
I can‚Äôt believe Elon Musk paid 44 Billion for Twitter and 1.5 Billion for the largest pipeline
"This video fails to make the case that oil is on the way out as a source of power, as is abruptly concluded at the end"
weird how almost every Trump supporter has been brainwashed into thinking it's Biden's fault
Funny oil went expensive in the obama yrs and now biden ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Weird I remember gas in the cents during Obama. Gas averaged 1.30 where I lived during 44.
In the UK gas prices wholesale is the same as pre 2019 and there is 100 years of cheap gas in the North sea with a pipeline to deliver as much as we need. The government lifted the cap that is there to keep a lid on energy companies greed - they don't need anymore drilling for the stuff in the North Sea. so they don't need anymore investment at least only to pay shareholders.
"I think a huge element of oil companies not wanting to expand is that they're worried they'll be regulated into their own grave like the coal industry was. Everyone is all about ""green"" energy and that's where all the big government money seems to be heading."
"@Adam That's nonsense. Every EV made today is far more environmentally friendly than any internal combustion vehicle EVEN IF YOU CHARGE IT USING ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY COAL! And EVs are NOT subsidized to nearly the same degree as oil. There are even states that tax an EV more than the gas tax that a large truck would pay! 

You don't need to artificially increase the price of gas. Just stop subsidizing it! That alone would more double the price. Sure, I'd prefer it if we'd add more gas taxes to speed up the process, but I'd be happy to see the price of gas match what people pay in Europe.

As for the middle class, more than 50% of those who own a vehicle own a gas guzzler. It's time to pay for that."
"@The Real c too I understand what youre saying but you cant just wish this kind of technology into existence. We are still years away from having affordable, efficient, ACTUALLY environmentally friendly EVs regardless of whatever ridiculous tax on oil you want to implement. EVs are already subsidized, oil is already taxed at the federal and state level if im not mistaken, and we're already naturally heading in that direction. If you artificially increase the price of gas even more all you would do is drain money from the pockets of the middle class. And no, its not just people with big trucks that would feel the pain"
"@Adam  I don't think you are understanding how free markets work. Increase cost => lower demand. Increase cost enough, and you incentivize change. People with F150s are exactly why gas prices have skyrocketed. These vehicles use 3x the fuel they should be using, and they represent a huge segment of the market. This isn't difficult math!¬†

Pain is necessary for growth. Fortunately, the people who feel the pain of higher gas prices the most are the ones most responsible for the problem!"
"Funny diesel fuel is a by product from making Gass , they could not give that stuff away untill the diesel engine was made and the price has increased to what it is today matching Gass or more"
Thanks for the video! Prices at the pump here in CA are nuts... Time to consider electricity vehicles...?!
Cut to the chase! Don‚Äôt make this a power point expose! In a word: BORING
The government sent over $40 billion that aided in the Ukrainian against Russian war. If they really cared about how much you pay for gas that have a great way of showing it
Some I agree with and some I dispute the core issues but the US government doesn‚Äôt care about gas issues for middle to lower class. Decent battery technology is still a while out to sustain a home with renewable energy. Carbon scrubbers which are renewable are a thing but government won‚Äôt invest for larger polluted cities. Nuclear fusion and fission are not talked about positively in the US but are invested in places like France as a  testing ground. The many that aren‚Äôt in western countries still rely on coal or other coal style products to live. I would love to have renewable energy and not have to worry about pollution but in this country that is currently a luxury and not a common thing. People are worried about right now and I believe oil companies and government are winning to restrict middle and lower class folks from participating. When you family has to decide about food or gas they don‚Äôt really care as a priority on who is going renewable but who is helping them
It‚Äôs the govt. They want all these poor Americans and illegal immigrants to pay for expensive electric vehicles so he‚Äôs blaming the war to hide his true intention. I hope they pay for them for all the poor people.
JOe biden did this !
"YES IT IS because of the war. YOUR BUDDY BIDEN, signed papers to GIVE our oil reserves to England because Russia cut England off THEIR CHEAP OIL all because of this NATO countries Russia does NOT LIKE. BUT this is ONLY part of the problem. What nobody will tell you is that they found oil in Ukrane and thus oil cartels are fighting for the land."
"On day one, The Biden administration terminated our oil independence. We even exported oil.  Trump had as the first president ever made us independent on our energy.  Democrats instead started to buy oil from OPEC.  INSTEAD OF DICTATING OUR OWN OIL PRICES, WE WERE NOW IN NO CONTROL AS WE BUY OIL FROM OTHERS."
"Absolute BS, the real reason why gas prices are so high is because of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the corrupt Democrats."
It‚Äôs so odd that I just said this exact same thing a few days ago in a ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù with someone on FB.  It‚Äôs just a cash grab now because speculation by the oil companies shows a major downfall on the horizon.
"Of course it's not the war, dementia Joe and his radical left friends who shut down the oil industry in US giving OPEC total control"
"Excellent explanation. But if we learned anything here its that oil cartels and oil companies know well how to adapt to continue their profits. So called, ‚Äúrenewables‚Äù will not replace the oil industry completely. They will simply become a subset of total energy usage because renewables are not free. There is a cost for producing power from other sources than oil."
"January 20th, 2021 is the reason. Before that date, the United States was energy independent and a net oil exporter."
We‚Äôve never been oil independent üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ you right wingers are unhinged
"I have heard more then my share of Male bovine Feekel matter this one is is over the top of trying to tell one why greed is good   and what is wrong with the rest of us  
hay if one here wants there is a less efficient EV sails man that will sell you a car that is powered from What LPG but there is none   and while one can pat ones self on there back with the thinking  MY CAR has no tale pipe so i do not have to even think about oil problems   is the Government having fun  taking your money  ???

Oh yes i know about the spelling    get the point  ???"
You failed to mention the lack of forward thinking from the Biden administration has made the problem 10x worse....you are implying this is all the oil companies fault and you are absolutely wrong. It starts at the top...you are probably Biden supporter and want people to think he had nothing to do with high gas prices....well you are absolutely wrong.
Oil will exist for the next 100 years.
Cartel?! Seriously?
Because he shut down our energy independence.
We never had it. Hence why we spent so much money being in the Middle East.
This is by far up there with the rest of the propaganda on the internet. Only one question. Who's paying you? Black Rock? Or Vanguard?
and are not capable of taking over the market as a whole the way technology stands now.
Once again it all circles back around to GREED !
Brabdon shut off America's oil when he stold the Prez.
"I warned everyone I knew that this day was coming. Well, now they're all stuck with big gas guzzling SUV's, trucks and luxury vehicles that require premium fuel. I on the other hand still have my trusty 6 year old Accord that gets 34 mpg all day long on regular. ENJOY!!!!"
"Please, there are also ESG scores and the inherent political disincentives to investing in traditional energy production. I‚Äôm fine with renewables, as long as they are capable of powering an INCREASED standard of living, at a comparable price. But we all know this is not the case. Coal plants are getting shut down across the country, and big shocker- electricity bills are off the charts! It‚Äôs ideal for politicians to blame corporate/investor greed, but their decisions to do nothing in the face of supply shortfalls don‚Äôt occur in a vacuum. This is what the Great Reset and ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù are all about- fundamentally transforming our lives through crises, reaction to the crises, and coercion of the general public through cost prohibitive necessity. Like Obama, Joe Biden essentially promised a war on oil and coal, so it should not be expected that spiking energy costs coincide with his administration. No mention of this? Or the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline? This video is either informed by ideological fellow travelers or partisan political operatives, because it takes all the blame off of governments and international elitists, and puts it all on producers."
"I recently heard some very interesting history about the origins and functions of the Federal Reserve System. Perhaps a video about the FRS, who created it, why, and how it influences national debt, loan interest rates, and fractional loaning, etc, would be interesting for your viewers. I personally would be excited to see what you can come up with. 
‚ÄúThe creature from Jekyll island‚Äù, by G Edward Griffin, was the book that piqued my interest for this."
"Biden. Most oil and gas projects in the US have significant lead times and cost billions in investments. People with deep pockets aren't going to throw money away on a project that can be cancelled at the stroke of a pen. 

As of 5/22, US is the largest producer of oil. We produce almost exactly the same of oil domestically that we consume. Investors are taking into account all the projects that Biden and the democrats have shut down. Basically, investors are predicting a future supply shortage a couple years in the future that was caused by this administration."
Umm all this blabla B's will not distract the fact the USA has the LARGEST RESERVES IN Alaska. YOU LEFTWING WEF ELITES ARE DONEE
"It is for sure not the war or anyting to do with the Democrats or Republicans , it's all about profits and not much else . 48% increase in profits at this time. It must be way more than that but trust me they don't want you to know the truth ."
"STOP! Your video is hilariously bad! When I left the oil field in 2015, the supply was so insane, it was sitting in tankers sitting offshore. This video is completely insane! The production model is a joke. In 2008 the U.S. had around 500 drilling rigs. In 2014 the U.S. had over 1500 drilling rigs."
I'm finally relieved to see there are people in the world with the intelligence to not put the price of gas on the Biden administration
Having permission to frack on land means nothing when permissions for pipelines are denied.
The world isn't ready for the switch to renewables.
"It's a process, it'll take years but it's already started. Renewables big advantage is it's cheaper."
It is cause by Biden ... period
"So there's plenty of oil, but they aren't extracting, so therefore there is no future for oil because... Why? Did the oil has become unicorns and ran away? This is bargain basement exploitation and NOTHING ELSE. It didn't ""dawn"" on them they could exploit us, they just feel safe at the moment doing so. And that liberal diatribe at the end of the video has nothing to do with the rest of the video. Your car might run on electric power, but the semi trucks that deliver your food and goods don't. And unless people stop being pansies about nuclear power, fossil fuels will remain our dominant energy supply. This shameless profiteering is harming that whole world at a time when it's already suffering from recent government stupidity. Why it's almost like this ENTIRE THING was artificially created for this very purpose..."
"To be perfectly honest, I don't particularly care for the tone of your voice. Where did you learn to speak, as if you are completely bored with the topic?"
"Your analysis is too heavily dependent upon the success of weather based renewables (ie wind and solar). Sadly weather based renewables will be stuck in places with suitable weather. Sadly for us much of the lack of investment came from Wall Street who refused to finance the reopening of the rigs and told Big Oil to use the high prices to pay off the debts. They said this as many financiers think as you do that oil is on the way out so why invest in it. This leads to a self fulfilling prophecy. Oil is believed to lose market share, so there is less investment, which leads to lower supply, which leads to lower investment. However as stated previously weather based renewables only work in certain places. Outside of those places renewables just don't work no matter how hard we try. This attempt to go with weather based renewables has led to places like Germany now completely reliant on Russian oil and gas. My fear is that we will become more reliant on oil and gas the more we try to wean off of it. Instead of being reliant on oil at a low price many of us will be reliant on oil at a high price."
"We were self sufficient with energy 16 months ago. Biden's first effort, cut that off, make us buy foreign oil.   It is impossible to be this stupid, unless you want to create huge inflation and destroy the economy."
"Washington DC is the mother of cartels, if OPEC is a cartel."
It's because  it is mostly wasted!
"Last year ‚Äúwe found one of the biggest oils supplies in history‚Äù also them..‚Äùoil is becoming a scarcity.‚Äù Yes..yes,  heard the masses into the pen and slaughter their minds with propaganda. They will conform without question and listen to their masters. Democracy, what a beautiful mask. TYRANNY SHALL REIGN ANS YOU WILL OBAY"
Obey was on purpose hehe thanks for reading
Why tf the gas so high?
Obiden is why gas is so high period!
"Obama once said, and you can fact check this, that he wish gas in America was ""more like the price in Europe"".  He thought gas should be 8 a gallon on the USA.  Dont think it was a coincidence when Trump got in gas went way down and once days after he left office went way up."
I was telling my dad the other day how reminiscent this was of early-mid '08.   It was almost like timing the sound thunder after the flash from the lightning.
Greed. Saved you 22 mintues.
"With out watching the video. Gas prices are high because on Day one President Biden signed a series of executive order specifically prohibiting the issue of new exploration and drilling licences domestically. He also restricted the amount that can be refined, and prohibited the use of  over land pipelines and the building of new pipelines.

Alternately there were also orders restricting domestic coal and gas extraction. And, the issue of scavenger reclaim permits to companies that finish cleaning out old mines and wells which are the same companies that run the carbon recapture tech at existing power production facilities. He then signed in higher fuel and energy taxes across the board.

Ultimately this lead to the inital spike of fuel and energy prices. Which drove up the cost of every other product since the cost every stage of production is affected directly by the cost of fuel and energy. 

This artificial inflation gets larger every month because as domestic sources dwindle companies are forced to import raw energy resourced from foreign sources. 

They import these fuels over sea via tankers and cargo ships which unlike a pipeline also take fuel. Also a factor is the potental impact of a spill. Over land a spill can be managed in a way where there is limited enviornmental impact. In fact in the case of a liquid like oil the product its self can be reclaimed from the soil which saves both the oil and the dirt from each other. However a spill at sea causes the product to mix with sea water where as contaminants quickly dissolve and leech out while the product is contaminated with things like salts and mercury making it completely unusable as fuel.

The absolute best is that now that all this in place the effort to replace existing fossil fuel production with green alternative has slowed to a crawl. Because the cost to replace the massive US energy infrastructure is costly on a good day and impossible when cost range too high.

So every one applauding the current energy situation is a complete moron who does not understand the negative environmental impact their iddiot elected officials have caused. These ninnies also do not understand that they have stunted our ability to switch to green alternatives.

I will tell you who does understand though its the millions of people who were barely scrapping by at the bottom of the middle class or lower. Those folks understand that they can no longer afford to be even some what happy because they are paying three times as much for every damn product, for their gas, and for their electricity. And, thats why those are the same people who who you see showing up in mass to Trump rallys."
i swear to got if he doesn‚Äôt say biden i‚Äôm gonna have to write a paragraph
"Oil and gas is expensive because the oil companies want it to be so they can continue to lobby politicians, so they won't cap oil prices, so they can keep oil expensive, and so on in a cycle. Which inevitably makes renewables increasingly interesting to individuals who can afford them, but as they're being lobbied not so much to politicians."
"Pretty moronic to imply the war has NO impact on oil prices when Russia was literally the second largest export of oil.  Yes all these facts also help, but, to say ""It's not the war"" is not true, at all.   Most of the world just sanctioned Russia, as well, Putin said that if anyone wanted their oil, they had to pay in Russian Rupel."
capitalism in action serving greed all over the world
"Great report!
So are you saying NO ONE will risk investing in a ‚Äúdying industry‚Äù.  No bank, and no Warren Buffet will give away $1 Million to build any new capacity while being threatened with NEGATIVE prices as soon as Tesla (or Toyota) perfects the electric car?
Makes sense to me!  They may be lucky to get their previous investments OUT before they become worthless.  Or even worse, states like California may make the industry pay to remove obsolete assets as a ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù requirement after they become worthless.

So we will be stuck paying Russia or OPEC whatever $$$ they want until we stop using propane, jet fuel, asphalt and many ‚Äúnecessities‚Äù made from or transported by petroleum products.

OPEC must really love global warming.

Now, where do we get the NEW Megawatts to power electric cars, trucks, and everything else?"
"Let‚Äôs go Brandon, I agree"
Because Biden killed the American oil and gas industry with the stroke of a pen exactly when we were trying to revocer from a pandemic. Dumbest move I ever saw from any president. The entire world depends on oil and gas for everything and every product and delivery and manufacture including food.
I see you say nothing about regulations.
... all gas has MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether). It's the essential anti-knock component that enabled us to ditch leaded gasoline. Don't use it just to sound fancy
"This is a Democrat Talking point.. They WANT HIGH FUEL PRICES.. they want to ruin the industry. Globalist agenda would love 12$ a gallon Gasoline.. oh, and we hear Psaki talk endlessly about the 7000-9000 Drilling Approvals but this isn‚Äôt always a ‚ÄúProven Zone‚Äù drilling matrix. Oil companies apply for these drilling contracts on speculation of oil production not the actual oil production that is produced because they can spend $10 million on a well only to find out that it‚Äôs a dry hole or no oil is present. I spent 32 years in the industry and a lot of your video is accurate but some of it is still government speculation and who controls the approval process depends on state to state ownership."
"Why do americans call a liqud,  gas?"
the longest answer to a question ever!
Your Government & Elites are pushing this
"If the hours in labor to produce a set quantity of anything doesn‚Äôt change much, then the value of your money is the issue!! Things lately DO NOT ‚Äúcost‚Äù more, your paper money is worth less! And THAT is something to be angry at government about. The government doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúmoney‚Äù. They have your LABOR, i.e. you work a certain number of hours and the value of your LABOR goes to the government under the title ‚Äútaxes‚Äù. LABOR has value! Paper money is a tool that unfortunately our government can manipulate as they need for their benefit."
Very well informed video on a topic that is incredibly misinformed in general. One point to add to the record number of federal drilling permits was not driven by near term drilling activity. It was the Biden administrations threats to ban drilling on Federal lands. That both made federal leasing almost come to a vault and a rush to secure as many permits as possible in an attempt to preserve value of any Federal leases.
"The OPEC and Russia continued to pump oil when demand dropped in 2020. They did it to destroy the smaller producers and it worked. Couple that with oil paid government officials and president, they have insured oil and gas prices stay high by getting us off oilüôÑ. 
There is no green energy, just different energy."
the foreseeable future
"Horse shit... Renewables cost 4x more to produce...Then you have the Central Banks borrowing the Federal Reserve Cheap Interest rates. Since 2008 Housing Crisis...So the Central banks borrow that cheap money. Jack up the price of Oil Contracts. Take their profits. Pay back the Federal Reserve. Then they let the price fall. Then do it all over again... How the hell you think all these banks are recouping the $10 Trillion in lost equity they had? They get the Taxpayers to bail them out. At the gas pump.....

Think I'm kidding. Just mention raising Margins on oil contracts to 35%....The banks and MSM go crazy...As the price on oil contracts fell like a rock just mentioning it..."
Someone who sees whats really happening. üëèüëè
Why didn't you put things in a cost per gallon. That would show how greedy the states are with taxes. Also it is easier to understand than percentages that are not true at all prices.
"To paraphrase a self-professed ""very smart person"", who could have known that the oil market is so complicated."
Of course the endgame is to fill in as much banks as they can.
"The ones that own Union Pacific has cut off 26%, Why? to go electric, fact, the CEO testified about"
ONLY WAY TO BEAT THE OIL BASTARDS US EVERYONE GO SOLAR AS QUICK AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
"The ONLY way to fix climate change is POPULATION CONTROL and that includes the whole world. Until that happens you can shove your EVs where the sun don't shine. Get China and India onboard, get the air quality index in New Delhi below 100 and we'll talk."

Joe Biden fault. Jas prices soaring since January 2021.
Sounds like horseshit
"GREED, DUH!"
I feel like the govt uses the news outlets to place blame on Russia so that nobody goes on a fucking rampage over this. The tower of Babyl will crumble beneath its own weight eventually
years of oil capacity.
I wish prices stayed where they were in the thumbnail
Persuasive Essay.  Sounds like a Fancy Word for Brainwashing or Propoganda.  What a Big disappointment  after watching a video that showed many believable facts about the Oil Industry .
"Biden, Biden, Biden."
its this climate change crap thats killing us with gas...its a scam...dreamed up by left wing communists and ecomentalists...co2 is harmless...
Idk I feel like he brushed off US policy. Why won't oil companies invest? Because the US government knee caps them and is encouraging their competition. So. I think it's a yes and argument
Hi really enjoy uour informative videos. Iam having s problem with your sound editor playing back ground music louder than yourpir narrative and no closed caption so i can read it
"In other words, we're f**ked."
The fact that the US has waged war on the oil and gas industry has nothing to do with it? Would you take profits now or invest in something the government is trying to destroy? Your graph shows us a spike in price at the change of the administration but you'll go ahead and blame it on the pandemic.
"It is the war. Russia is a major oil producer and this obsession with destroying Russia has pushed up oil prices. The West has been trying to cripple Russia ever since Obama came into office. Covid policies had already put us on a path to economic ruin. NATO has been aggressively expanding and western leaders have been sanctioning Russia for over a decade. The war in Ukraine has exasperated many of the already worsening problems. It's the Great Reset. Gas prices have been re-set along with the price of food, plastics, computer chips, lumber and everything else. The policies of the current administration have created artificial sacristy and that is pushing us into a recession. Our Domestic and foreign policies are the reason the world is so screwed up right now I only wish people would stop getting distracted with Roe V Wade and gun control and wake up to the fact that their economic future is being systematically destroyed."
"I have to say, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed with this video. 

There‚Äôs so much that was left out that proved to be detrimental to the validity of the video.
1) The Idea Of ‚Äò9000 Leases‚Äô: I was honestly saddened to see you use this point, as it‚Äôs been pretty debunked. Of those 9000 leases, only about 90 will likely ever produce oil, and oil producers need licenses to build each rig and structure on those properties, something that is being slow rolled by the government on purpose.
2) Biden‚Äôs Policies: you never even remotely mentioned Biden‚Äôs anti-oil policies, and how it‚Äôs impacted the market. You even mentioned that oil is a futures market and is based on market speculation, but never once brought up the correlation between Biden cancelling leases and the day after prices skyrocketing, the most recent involving a 30c+ price increase. (this occurred multiple times).
3) Ethanol: the now higher restrictions of ethanol and it‚Äôs impact on small producers that can‚Äôt support the even more restrictive level requirement in their gasoline, causing multiple shutdowns of plants. (To be fair, you did bring up California‚Äôs already strict restrictions, but not U.S. as a whole and that impact on price).

I feel that these would have brought a true and non-partisan picture into what‚Äôs going on, if included with the rest of the video, but I‚Äôm sad to see these things were left out. I truly don't want to believe that it was left out due to political ideology, but it's very hard not to considering the items that were left out."
Oil companies are pimps and politicians are there hoes!
Oil consumption does not destroy the planet because CO2 does not destroy the planet.  Every ounce of food on the planet comes from CO2
Biden policies took 2 million barrels of oil / day off the market.  That started the long increase in gasoline prices.  Oil is not finite in a significant way.  The earth has hundreds of years of oil capacity.
"Electric electric electric....how long is it gonna take to convert all the equipment that makes the world go round today,that runs on diesel over,to electric by tomorrow? 
That electric bus fire in France I saw recently was interesting.
I've never seen a bus with a full fuel tank spontaneously combust. 
Not saying I've got any love for oil, but you're fooling yourself if you think diesel fuel can be turned off tomorrow like a water faucet."
"And yes, the investments that I did have in oil, are no longer in oil.
 I might have been born at night, but it wasn't last night."
"Warren Buffett and his buddies forcing   diesel fuel higher in  the futures trading, deliberately getting the cost high  making it more feasible to buy there new electric semi trucks so buffet and his buddies get rich on their new corporate semi trucks."
"Wow, just 11% tax. In the Netherlands it's over 50%"
It is also that the Biden admin and the left wont give them 100% of the permits they need to get the oil flowing!
im glad i sat out on red and blue for awhile. some stuff is still waiting to change but is changing.
Its quite simple.The oil companies own our politicians.The politicians manufacture an oil crisis for political theater.The people are trapped and must pay whatever price the oil companies want.Meanwhile politicians and oil companies reap the rewards of said manufactured crisis by making record profits.Also keep in mind the politicians travel on the tax payers dime so its no money out of their pocket.
a long video to say that oil producing countries got greedy and messed with the supply/demand for profit.
"If they are not investing their profits back into their companies then that becomes evidence of price gouging.
They have begun sucking out all the value for the owners profit. I have seen this type of thing before in my many years of life's experience. In the meantime they will keep the price high as long as they are allowed to, until they go bankrupt leaving all the cleanup to someone else... Probably the taxpayers."
They wouldn't HAVE investors if they were never allowed to pay out their profits. Econ 101.
The solution is nuclear energy
3:25 to 3:35 Pipeline cheaper than Train Railway. Joe Biden's first day of Presidential Political Office he tries to totally kill the Keystone Pipeline new section from Canada to USA. ü§îüò¢ Hum?
Easy it‚Äôs the current administration trying to shove this ‚Äúgreen new deal‚Äù crap down our throats ie no govt subsidies for petroleum exploration etc etc the beatings will continue until morale improves
"But but but Biden, and Fauci.....and,..,,jobs"
So why no green hydrogen? Why no pipelines?
"No Fuel = No Food - No Heat-  No Electricity,    Mass Starvation will cause mass Riots.."
Shutting down Nuclear Power Plants..  They want to starve a Couple Billion to Death ..
Greed blah blah blah more greed blah blah blah.
Thank You! This is the very FIRST video I have seen that is NOT blaming Puddin for EVERYTHING. The sad part is 95% of the population must believe it because they continue to market it. How can there be WAR CRIMES in a WAR?
this channel lies like creepy joe biden and the government.. stop lying ! trying to make up a story about gas prices.. it has all to do with the government..
"The fact that Biden was not mentioned as a cause for higher gas prices is pretty rediculous. He is the number one factor on why OPEC has a monopoly, day one he took every step possible to make sure that the US wasn't energy independent, he also canceled the keystone XL which would have driven US oil production way up as well as sustain thousands of US jobs.  Oil companies in the US are very discouraged to drill new wells even though they have the ability to, they chose not to because of Bidens executive regulations that strangle them making it not even worth it. Btw the war definately had a direct effect on gas prices, everyone knows this to be fact. Russia controlled 5-10 percent of oil production and are now at zero, guess who picked up their slack? OPEC giving them an even bigger monopoly. Imagine if the US market was encouraged to increase production by our president because of a oil crises. The gas prices would be way down because then US oil companies can control the price of gas by providing competition to opec and in turn lowering gas prices. Also in my opinion biden showed weak leadership when the US pulled out of IRAQ wich Puttin took note of, this is why puttin decided to attack Ukraine, he thought consequences would be light from biden. So basically it's bidens fault... pretty plain and simple. Good video though!"
"Over 22 minutes to just say ""bullshit policies of western powers"" is mighty overkill, not even gonna watch this"
Democrats is killing the USA! 2020 fuel n food was 1/2 Price! Remember that in November when you Vote!
When an American says 'gas' they don't mean gas they mean a petrochemical liquid. Or do they? Is this about actual gas ie natural gas which is a gas or about the petroleum derivative used to fuel cars which is called gas but is not gas but a liquid? I'm confused.
It's the Democrats Stupid- Plato.
"I give up on paying rediculous gas prices.
I will make my own Free fuel from water!

A great tech book to teach people. 3 ways to break the covalent bonds of water to release hydrogen gas and oxygen gas.

It is a detailed book about 2 farmers that ran their farms and equipment on hydrogen gas!

Which is easy and now cheap to do!

An excellent way to make money from others. Just like solar energy."
What's all this story for?   Gas is expensive because Biden went executive order crazy as soon as he stole the election.  We were self reliant until this jackass started his destruction of our country.   See?  Super easy to explain without a video.  And 100% fact.
Sounds like they're bidding themselves out of a job with electric and regenerative systems being deployed today.
And those who get screwed are the normal hard working person. Maybe the governments should finally release the captured and crashed UFO tech
I heard that when the democrats heard that gas was nearly 5 dollars a gallon in much of America they said what took us so long ? This is great .
"they wee 5 when the black dude was in office,as well - democrats never miss an opportunity to f things up"
"Am I missing something here? Alaska has 17 trillion barrels of oil sitting in a reserve. This is pure greed that‚Äôs all. And Biden is in on it by closing pipelines, regardless of the 9k permits."
This is absurd
Ok.  How many gas stations can not get gas?  How many are rationing gas?  How many are out?  How many are closed?  Zero you say?  Shortage......expensive why?
"Uh, not even a single mention of the C-event that happened? USA literally stopped driving. That had some impact on supply demand."
A new Prius gets 58 mpg. How hard would it be to get100 mpg? Then the price of gas is irrelevant. üëç
"So explain to everyone why gas was cheaper when orange man was in office than now with dumb ass green boy? I see some of your points but I believe you leave some important details out. Which obiden has said even before he was given the office that he was not going to let more leasing on public lands, this is all by design, so more money can be squeezed out of the common man. All by design"
"and electricty suddenly up 150% in australia,this is pure economic war on the common peole"
"so, nothing to do with America no longer drilling/producing its own oil, or completion of keystone pipeline that would have pumped 35m gallons daily? ok, got it!  whats weird, you would think something we have on our own soil would be cheaper, but if you say it's not true, I guess its not true. I will simply believe you and  join others who watch and agree without checking things out for myself. knowledge and reading is so 2020"
"Excellent explanation. Unfortunately, it is too complex for what appears to be way too many people with too short of an attention span who won't think past ""I did that"" stickers of Biden on the gas pumps."
"look up the term ""lie by omission"" and then realize that the stickers are correct."
We are at 4.24 per gallon in Minnesota today. Anyway Thumbs Up on your video. Peace you all.
"@Nick T. Too Much, Wow !"
$7.09 in California
"I just thought of this, what about all the associated jobs lost, gas stations, mechanics (we'll need some). There's a whole support industry that will be lost. I don't think wind farms will be enough as a power source."
"High prices from a pipeline on the other side of the world? I'm simple-minded, I look at canceling the xl pipeline, throwing a monkey wrench into domestic production and other regional causes being the main culprit. Bad relationships with producing countries are another. We have the green new deal, if we don't everyone dies in a couple years, if they can afford an electric transportation device. Even so, we'll still be using a lot of oil, that never changes.This is a mostly self- inflicted wound."
What people don thinks about is oil will be used for decades to come because almost everything in your house has had oil used in it production.
"We (the USA) have the oil, we just lack the leadership to utilize our resources. So until we are forced out of our fossil burners we can buy oil from countries that want to kill us! 
Thats the plan......Lets Go Brandon!"
Fun Fact. Video is wrong. The war causes unstable markets. Now the war may not cause real price increase the CEOs use this as a chance to jack up priaces even if their cost isn't changing and use the excuse of war). I'm un-subing because wendover is f%$K stupid claiming this. Now there are other reasons for price to increase and not just the war; but a title saying the war is not a reason is straight up lie.
"At this moment the Federal tax on gasoline is 36 cents, the California state tax is about 50 cents and so California will always have the most expensive gasoline in the US."
United States has a shit ton of oil. It's a marketing scheme and a bluff.
"This is all by design from the communist, democrat party of China.   At least we don‚Äôt have mean tweets."
"You have solid points and it is very thought out.  You however mentioned that ""America's big oil"" isn't reinvesting and that is incorrect.  They are investing in Renewable Energy like crazy and they would all be reinvesting in shale oil, but Biden's "" Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad"" has shut off supply so we are now Importer, instead of exporter. Which states in there ""indefinite ‚Äúpause on new oil and natural gas leases on public lands‚Äù until a comprehensive review on the climate change impacts can be completed.""  So, now you know why they aren't reinvesting and why we are once again importer of crude instead or exporter where we control the price.  It is completely political problem and that is the way they want it."
"This is why I‚Äôm switching to electric, I‚Äôm sick of oil companies controlling the world xD"
"BIG OIL  isn't going anywhere.   70% of a barrel of oil, is used for gasoline and diesel.   So even  if you got rid of every internal combustion engine on earth (fat chance)  that still makes ""big oil"" a multi billion dollar industry anyway, as the remaining   30% of each barrel of oil  is used for other stuff,  for which NO REPLACEMENT is available.   You can't pave roads with solar panels.   You can't make a roof watertight with windmills.   You need asphalt, made from OIL .   Plastic, electronics,  even deodorant and lipstick are all made with petrochemicals.    You'd be hard pressed to find a product that ISN'T made with petrochemicals.    Hardly worth mentioning, the batteries for electric cars, are, you guessed it, also fabricated with petrochemicals, to say nothing of the giant 2 story size DIESEL POWERED earth movers  that are required to STRIP MINE THE EARTH for the rare earth elements for solar panels  and EV  production.   Strip mining operations don't run on rainbow powered Priuses, they run on  twin 16 cylinder 2300 horsepower turbodiesel engines, that guzzle  diesel by the barrel.   Try making a solar panel or an EV battery without petroleum, HA!   Good luck!      Interesting video, but the conclusion that big oil is circling the drain, couldn't be any further from the truth."
TLDR: the oil producers produced too much and fucked themselves so to fix that they're purposely not producing enough to fuck us to fix their mistake and to keep it going as long as possible for more record profits.
Why are we buying oil from Russia when we have more oil and wasted it.
It‚Äôs so sad to hear that these trillion dollar companies are having such a hard time making more trillions of dollars. Absolutely breaks my heart.
"wow, that's some propaganda"
How do I turn this into a sticker to vandalize my local gas pump though?
"No shit it's not the war!!! It was know before Biden hijacked the election., this was going to happen..... thank you democratic voters... üñïüñï"
Petrol in Congo costs today: 5 US dollar for 5 liters! The elite working with states and countryes to rob people!
Sad what 2 years of biden has done....btw california pays the highest taxes on gas in the country....nothing to do with geographic location just their state government
Wow just think 2 years ago we not only were oil independant but also an oil exporter....independant of opec..
And 2 years ago the demand for fuel was in the basement. Today fuel demand is record high.
Thanks Obama
It‚Äôs cuz the rich peeps can‚Äôt get enough money so they raise the price
High gas prices aren't because of the war? Really?But that's what the news says.(Sarcasm)
"It's just like a big domino effect, with oil prices gone crazy causing gas to go up and other things like natural gas which is making it difficult for people on fixed incomes to even keep their homes warm to come in winter, unless our leaders and other sources can come to a mutual agreement gas and other things are only going to get worse or beyond nightmare level God help us all"
I noticed that there was no mention of regulation causing a lack of interest in losing billions due expenses and time needed to possibly get an oil field producing.
"This video neglects to mention another radical change: a different president. The current president is very anti fossil fuel. I guarantee if in 2024 we get a president who is fossil fuel friendly then the US will start producing more. We DO NOT have an alternative to fossil fuels at this time. The US could never go to üíØ renewables. The science isn‚Äôt there yet. Obviously the maker of this video is attempting to persuade the viewer that it is possible but that‚Äôs nonsense. ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù energy is anything but green. The state of RI has plowed down acres and acres of trees trees to put up solar panels because of the high subsidies. The EVs use cobalt, nickel, copper and other metals that are NOT renewable. We don‚Äôt have enough lithium on earth for everyone to drive an EV. I could go on."
@Meghan McCarthy Better than coal and oil
The US could easily go 100% renewables. Just put solar panels on every roof and build a few nuclear reactors in places where there are no earthquakes
biden i did  that
"Oil companies are not working on scarcity

Companies are financially distressed, bankruptcies and low profit margins especially in the shale plays with most basins. Also over-regulation

The price is going up mostly as the result of inflation

The US printing 12 trillion dollars out of thin air"
Because the democrat party hates oil because they didn't discover any on their land only sulfur and tin .
I remember the gas wars of the late 60's and early 70's.  At one point for a day or so 15 cents / gallon was a reality. 3 packs of cigs for a dollar and fill a tank and get change back from a $10. Always had money for beer and herb in those days. Happy girlfriends for sure!
Who could have guessed how horrible it would have turned out for our great grandchildren?
major oils PUSHES PRICES WAY ABOVE THEIR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DECENT PROFITS........
"Gas prices are high for TWO reasons (neither of which you'll discussed in this video btw)

1)  Saudi Arabia and UAE are refusing to raise production because the USA will NOT support their war in Yemen.

2)  Nobody else wants to spend the money to raise production when the war in Ukraine could possibly be over very soon and oil sanctions on Russia are lifted."
Record high demand for fuel.
"Why in the world would oil companies make any investment with Biden in office, or even the risk of another liberal....   Democrats are awful."
I can't even find 2 thermometers that read within a degree let alone 100 years apart.  YT blocks any debate on this anyway.  Do your part and off yourself.

"The company I work for though it changed ownership recently has serious pressure from the government and continue to be unsure about future laws that will affect the operating cost. There are absolutely people that have agendas that want to shut down oil and gas in the governing bodies that regulate them. This translates into reluctance to invest. There are many rules to point too but one has to do with water permitting where the water has to be re-injected into the ground rather then given to the local ranchers even though the water is cleaner then the surface water. This just increases cost and since it is a retroactive rule, an unexpected cost for already established practices."

"Gas it's not that expensive it is  basically 0.30 cents a gallon, because a dollar is only worth $0.06.
In other words it looks expensive because it's a dollar has less buying power. A dollar used to be worth a 1.06$ in buying power. A $15 an hour job is actually paying $0.90 an hour. So if you look at it any other way you're just fooling yourself.
That's reality for you."

"No need to even watch the video its simple. Prices are up over market manipulation, media hype and greed.  Big Oil here in the states... if you haven't been paying attention for the last 50+ years bases its prices on import costs. Their production and delivery costs are pennies on the truck load. Their profit margins are insane when they go with ""Market"" pricing of foreign oil as American oil production and delivery costs are a fraction of that.  Its all profiteering by corporate scumbags and their company board members. NOTHING more. They are laughing at people paying those prices because in the few months they can keep that price matching before people start setting their gas stations on fire will exponentially boost that profit margin the longer they can keep up the fa√ßade."
If it's all price-gouging then why do prices ever go down? Why was it so cheap when Trump was president? Why didn't they gouge the price then?

Notice the price skyrocketed just before the recession‚Ä¶
It may be that the oil industry is trying to cash in before hydrino technology takes over.
"That might explain the price in the US. In South Africa we have a corrupt government that added more than 50% of the price in taxes and using Brent crude oil as a benchmark for the price, while importing middle east oil that's a lot cheaper. Their friends who ship the oil to us also charge double for transport and gives a kickback to the anc.
We sell fuel to negbouring countries at abou half of the pump price we pay here. There's an export tax on the fuel we sell and the countries also add their tax and its still about 35-40% cheaper than our fuel.
Renewable energy is a scam and we will rue the day that we permanently go off of oil. The only renewables being propagated negates internal combustion, if there was a concerted effort to negate greenhouse gases, methane would be a much better place to start. All as you can't measure methane like carbon, and everything that decompose release methane.
Methane is the best way to harvest renewable energy and burns cleaner than most other fuels."

"So when will we create electric planes? Until then oil will always be a lucrative industry. The actual answer to why oil crashed was that no one was flying. Add federal reserve induced inflation, and the fact that people are flying and driving back to work gives you higher prices. Now that the federal reserve is raising rates finally, will give us deflation and lower prices...but it hasn't sunk in just yet due to the China/US tariffs and the Ukrainian/Russian conflict, both adding major inflation."

"Hay idoits!  Wonder if the closing of the Key Stone pipeline, or the Federal ban on fracking or the ban on Alaska North slope oil has anything to do with oil prices?"

@OverscorePlayZ it is that grumpy fools fault. america was energy independent just a couple years ago and then old man grump ended that. now we are suffering.
"When i'm hearing about renewables i'm losing my shit. You can not destroy or create new energy, that's now how it works, that's not the way. What we need to do first is develop another kind of fuel and then cut supply. We can't cut supply with the hope that we'll develop something else, you're looking for troubles this way. Why isn't biodiesel made by pyrolisis more promoted? Or ethanol, or maybe hydrogen or maybe porsches synthetic gasoline."
"Can't help with the democrats shutting things down....you keep saying renewables...do all of are cars run on electric??..i don't think so!!..i think your leaving out some of the story buddy!!..I don't think the grid will be ready for battery operated cars for a long time a very long time,what are you gonna burn to charge the cars....WHAT COAL. ??

"there has been a push, in Australia, for last 12 years to reduce carbon, and the government brought in carbon credits that did nothing but make themselves a lot richer and just cost the people more.
With oil, its weird that a country like ours that is so rich in resources would rather sell it all , but it does make ""sense"" from a government economic point of view. 
Back to fuel prices, its not just costing us all more to drive around, Fuel is needed in road and rail transport to move goods and services, and obviously,. that cost of fuel is being passed onto consumers, hence massive increases in food costs at the shops.
so while they all say ""lets go electric"" , its not feasible as electric cars are pretty expensive to buy, and theres very little infrastructure for EV.
Id say the oil companies are raking in the extra for the future when they start to not sell as much oil, but also to ""invest "" in EV equipment. Which, on one side does make sense.
Another issue, governments make good taxes from fuel tax, so with that eventually going to go, jacking up fuel costs to ""make up for future"" unfortunately, also makes sense, but only to those in power. The rest of us have to struggle and work more just to pay for 100% increase in cost of living, and for what......"
Solar energy and wind will require ten times the workers that oil does.  We need to stop building oil infrastructure and build out solar.
"I am fascinated by the need to move to 100% carbon free by this date and that date, but oil is a requirement in daily life. Plastic?. How much of the natural environment would ""green companies"" need to clear cut to produce the energy needs of a city of 50,000? 100,000? 500,000? And a city with a large population also has industries that require significant electric needs and I currently don't see that a turbine or solar farm is going to provide power to a steel plant. Going green is the trend of the decade and according to ""science"" turbines and solar farms will transform the U.S. and world into a carbon-free utopia were everything built in China is second to none went it comes to quality and durability."
Before Biden got shoe horned into office the US was the biggest producer of oil in the world. Now we are importing it from Iran and Russia. Now American oil company's cant even get a permit. You are right about it NOT being the war though. :rolleyes:
"The irony is that oil could have maintained their hold on the game for much much longer. But at a cost of profits. Volkswagen made a production model car sold 200 of them they got 200 miles to the gallon as a diesel electric hybrid. Amazingly it was about a month later that suddenly they were in trouble for a mission standards on their diesel engines. Nothing fishy there at all. 

But diesel electric hybrids which would have made their supply go much farther would have allowed them to stay in the game longer as renewables would seen to be less useful."
"Dieselgate was two years after the XL1's production. It's also not remotely limited to VW's diesel engines. Turns out, just about all automakers found software that could manipulate emissions test results."
"We reached peak oil and they know it. You'd be a fool to invest in infrastructure for a product you can't get. If you are counting on tarsand (Keystone) you're already in desperation mode. The EIOER is abysmal, in fact you can hardly support a civilization of our complexity on 1 to 10 ratios when conventional oil gave 1 to 100. This ain't rocket surgery one retired Texas oil man said. Renewables won't support our complexity, it's a pipe dream. It's going to be a wild ride."
It's called profiteering!
Built back better by Joe briben!
"So in synthesis the negative value of oil a few years ago killed the competition, now that only big boy companies have the whole power on supply, the WILL Undersupply so gas is expensive and line goes up. This is one example of money‚â†actual value. It would be better to have enough gas on the market so everybody has a realiable way of transporting themselves, but that doesn't make the line go up and don't forget THE LINE HAS TO GO UP NO MATTER WHAT."
"Blahblahblah

"Yep, Biden refusing to give out any permits for pipelines or drilling is killing oil futures.
This is not a market problem, it's a market manipulation problem."
"Would be nice if we were willing to allow new domestic US exploration. A robust US production (and refining) capacity would be doing a lot to reign in the current market. Instead, we are begging the Saudis (and the rest of the mostly evil regimes with massive oil industries) for help. We beg foreign producers while denying new leases, repeatedly delaying permitting, and artificially constricting capital investment because of ESG ""principles""."
"Even with electric vehicles, oil is still the major energy source for the world by 5x."
Yes. But the whole point is that re investing billions of usd is risky when a hugeee chunk of your customers are switching to electric in the next decade. Oil still rules but the returns of investment is not 100% sure anymore.
@Rum Have I fudging despise the electric push and so do my friends. Only flaming homes drive fully electric vehicles.
"@FlamingViperV12 no it does not, the only CO2 comes as far as i can check from the machines that extract it which are powered by oil but eventually those could be made electric

the biggest impact of lithium minning is on the local water of the region where its extracted and processed because lithium consumes a lot of water to be procesed and that water needs to come from somewhere, so this causes that for example local farmers have less access to water and it can cause droughs in said regions, and if there is a spill lithium is toxic so it can affect local ecosystems

lithium is extracted from salt deposits underground like most other minerals, this is not something exclusive to lithium 

but if we are talking of the impact of lithium minning why dont we talk of the impact of oil extraction now that we are at it, how giant drills need to be used how the open holes leak huge amounts of even worse greenhouse gases like methane and how regions are affected by oil extraction
if we take all processes from extraction to final use into account while lithium is not exactly 100% clean oil is worse from extraction to its final uses"
"@carso1500 Saying that lithium's impact is limited is not accurate, not only is the location that it is disposed of that causes issues, but the location itself also gets affect by destroying the local ecosystem and in order to harvest lithium, the crust needs to be broken, doing so releases more carbon than what a gas car ever makes in its lifetime, so that is still an inaccurate statement."
"In Canada it is trudeaus goveretment, they take 45% of the price and our local pirates in Powell River are ramping it up to $2.35 a litre the highest price in southeren Canada."
Trump adamantly imposed for the building of pipelines while Biden and many of his supporters are against it.
Pure propaganda.
there isnt investment because political investment is electrical.
Did everyone forget. Within 7-months of trump being president gas dropped approximately 1 dollar from the almost 4.00 under obama. And in 15mo under trump after he came in we were exporting oil and energy independent. Funny how people think covid was the cause of low gas prices. I would say it was if covid started right at the beginning of trumps presidency.   Bit it didn't happen till the end. Also historically speaking since Carter. Every seriously high gas price and inflation scenario has happened under the watchful eye of the DNC?
"Thanks for making this clear as day: high class government stifled oil production rather than incentivize 'green' energy... basically forcing the industry to change whether consumers want it or not, and now the lower class is suffering the most.  It's just the government playing Sim City all over again. There is no race war in this country, it's a class war."
"Lets go Brandon, everyone knows it's joe bidens fault (bidenflation)"
I don‚Äôt agree with this. The average person cannot afford this increase. Conversely they can‚Äôt afford a 40k electric car. Political pressure will come into play very soon. November will be a blood bath for politicians pushing for higher gas prices.
"Good point. That's why countries with better governments have been investing in electric vehicles and green energy, to improve the technology and lower costs for the consumer. They also artificially lower the price by removing taxes/adding them to has engines. So in some places it's less expensive to have an electric vehicle."

This is not going to sell to the average American.  Your party has caused this on purpose.  Just admit it. Biden basically admitted it a day or two ago. A prolonged pain of gas prices will force your green energy dream.  See you after this November."
"The fascists are attempting to shut down refineries.

"Anyone paying attention understands the majority of the  ""9000 unused permits"" are not promising enough to invest in long term investments. This guy loses credibility when he uses the same excuse as the current administration. Couple that with more permits being much harder and costlier to acquire and extraction fees increased, domestic production is going to stagnate. With the automakers trend of moving to EVs and federal and state mandates pushing to eliminate the internal combustion engine, Big Oil has no incentive for long term domestic production. It's too bad we are so woefully unprepared to make the switch away from fuel and diesel and the majority of electricity production is ""dirty""."
"Right... no mention that the majority of those ""9000 unused permits"" are basically JUNK, because the locations don't yield enough to be profitable."
"Time for the government to pay oil companies a certain fee to drill the oil, then pass on the profits to the citizens at a lower cost."
So you don't think the companies will turn  to something more profitable like maybe video games.
You keep saying Azerbaijan wrong and it is so annoying.
"why gas got so expensive - joe , joe , joe , brain dead joe"
one of the big reasons why gas is so expensive is bidens anti oil production policies. people can deny it all they want but its a simple fact that that importing costs more than producing
Its the greed of gas companies..  shell reported 1st quarter 9 billion in profits
It is how the Liberal Democrats think they can force people to buy electric automobiles.

"And has zero to do with Biden.
Oh, wait, it DOES have a lot to do with the war. Oops."
But I thought it was all Biden's fault?
"Good video to add a global perspective. The discussion on the 9,000 unused permits needs context and is well off the mark. To keep it simple you need at least 4 things to drill. You need the permits, you need regulatory approval, you need to step over significant legal challenges and then you need the location to be able to produce the product (viable wells). 

About 9,200 permits are currently not producing oil.

You also need to get a lease. With this you need to get air/water and pollution approval permits. Just one law firm represents litigation for 2200 of these permits answering to environmentalists. This litigation must be solved before oil producers can start drilling - There are many more cases like this.

There are 700 million acres of federal mineral estates available. The Fed has given permits to 26 million acres, which sound like a lot, but it is actually a historic low.

Not all wells are producers: if your company has 20 leases in one area, you drill in one location and its dust, you're not going to drill the others.

There are supply chain issues in getting equipment to drill and there is a severe shortage of qualified oil riggers to get the job done.

Do oil drillers hold off on drilling until prices are in a range that makes them profitable? Absolutely, however this is akin to you selling your home.. would you sell it during a down economy and take a loss? Not if you didn't have to, you would wait until the market comes up to a point that would give you a profit.

So the simple fact is, there are NOT 9,000 permits that are available today, which have cleared ALL hurdles to start drilling. 
Regulation and approvals at the Fed and State level are not allowing drilling on a large proportion of these locations
Legal obstacles are blocking 2,200 or more permits
OPEC driving prices down makes it financially reckless to drill at this time
Labor and Supply chain issues make it logistically difficult if not impossible to drill in the near future."
"@Norton Newmann We haven't had capitalism in a long time. Businesses got in bed with government and created a usurer's paradise. The problem I have with phrases like ""late-stage capitalism"" or blaming capitalism as a system rather than the exploitative cretins in business and government, is that almost invariably the speaker's next step is to say why we need communism - a system that has only ever functioned to redistribute wealth from the 1% to the 0.0001% and persecute the serf class with aggressive propaganda.
This is not some defense of the US in its current state. We're an imperialist nation that exports postmodern consumerism to other nations in order to erode their culture and values and make them the same glassy-eyed consumers that we are. Our leaders are owned by puppeteers answerable to none but others in their little cabals and cults, and the primary function of the democratic system is to allow our rulers to put the blame onto our neighbors with differing political beliefs, as well as to release pressure by pretending the people have scored a victory when someone with a different tie takes office.
But an indictment of capitalism - a name coined by Marx because to everyone at the time it was simply ""this works"" and they had no need to codify a name for something that was so universal and natural - typically precedes an argument for any number of hybrid economic and governmental systems that lead to enslavement and ethnic cleansing. But they call it equality so I guess that's okay then."
"Excellent points. Not as easy as for politicians as scapegoating, however"
"Ultimately we need to decide if oil is just another commodity or a national security issue. Currently U.S. citizens have been duped into accepting healthcare as a profit driven commodity. How do they feel about fuel for transportation/heating purposes? Should it be classified as a ""national emergency"" if the fuel supply is severely disrupted, or the price is inflated beyond reach of most Americans? Because this is EXACTLY what has happened to healthcare in the U.S. Question is... how long before starving people eventually revolt against a corrupt Kleptocracy? Late stage Capitalism is collapsing all around us... the deniers are simply rearranging chairs in disbelief on a sinking Titanic. Change had better come soon..."
"If you think oil is just used for cars   You are very wrong. It will be more than just a few years until airlines can use something else to send planes in their routes across the world.They burn more barrels per year than cars. Almost every product manufactured from cell phones to car interiors use petroleum.  Refineries are being shut down for various reasons, some never to reopen, and that will increase fuel prices even more."
If the government was a corporation that had to operate without our tax money...  It would go broke and everyone in government would be fired.

"This business strategy is similar to that of a credit card company. When a borrower fails to make a few payments on their credit card, it triggers a default rate of 30%. Managers I talked to said this was so the company could capture as much profit as it possibly could before the borrower inevitably would stop paying the balance off. It's also similar to cable/satellite TV companies who pushed up rates significantly as people cord cut to Netflix/Hulu. Industries on a downward trend will turn up the money printing just before shutting off the lights."
"Great explanation.  I've been trying to explain a handful of these points over the last several weeks, but this video lays it all out very clearly.  Thank you!"
"@Jesse Williams I work in the oil and gas industry and people forget this is a global market. Many countries in Europe and Asia rely on Russian oil. Some countries are not participating in the embargo since their countries aren't equipped to handle ""different ""types of oil. There are plenty of other videos you can watch in regards to the oil futures contracts,  along with the struggles many countries will have of the Ukraine-Russia conflict continues through this winter."
"@Phuong Tao oddly, I don't think that premise is really correct.  Sure, an unstable supply from Russia may have caused SOME fluctuation, but if you look at the US specifically (I just happen to be American), the US is set to have a net export of crude again this year.  If supply was such a crucial component, we wouldn't be exporting nearly as much as we're importing.  But overall domestic production is slightly down even despite record land leases - mostly because the oil companies are simply not exploring those leases.  The oil companies are making record profits because the money they'd normally invest in expanding operations and exploring leases (capital reinvestment) is being kept aside as profit instead and paid out to shareholders and the like.

If all of the other issues (oil company reinvestments, commodity and futures trading, etc) hadn't changed and we JUST had the Russian war against Ukraine, we'l likely have seen no more than 10-15c increase at the pump."
"person making the video isn't 100% correct, though, despite what the title of the video states.  The war in Ukraine / Russia does have an impact on the current crude oil prices. Once the Russia sanctions and oil embargo were implemented, countries that agreed to participate had to source contracts with other countries for their oil needs.  This is essentially supply and demand.  The demand drastically increased but the other supply is now in higher demand, driving up the oil contract prices.  This is why crude oil went from $90 USD to $120 USD/barrel in a short time frame."
"So what‚Äôs the answer to to high oil costs? Politicians are feeding us a lie that renewals and clean electricity will save us from these robbing prices, I can guarantee you when we switch over totally to clean energy, wind and solar, the prices of that will go through the roof also. We will never escape it."
"if you ask my FB friends list, this video would have been 5 seconds long... you would have said ""Joe Biden"" and roll credits.  I love informed and researched arguments."

"Pretty good summary, but you missed a huge story on the reinvestment side.  Institutional investing is now effectively dominated by Blackrock/Vanguard.  They are putting the squeeze on reinvestment in domestic energy projects via so-called ESG rules, which are arbitrarily set policies having a veneer of social responsibility to hide behind.  The dark side of this equation is you have a small group of people who can effectively put their finger on the scale of the entire US and even global economy with no oversight or market driven safety valve, and even the ability to run things into the ground if it gives them an opportunity to consolidate power further.  The grassroots nature of the shale market was a huge source of consternation to the global power brokers.  Enter COVID, and suddenly they are relevant again.  How convenient.  From the price of energy, everything cascades."

"Exxon was infected with a few board members, Gregory Goff, Kaisa Hietala and Alexander Karsner, who were supported by Blackrock.  A video about Vanguard, State Street and Blackrock would be interesting."
Paid for by the Joe Biden administration. Thankyou.
It's corporate greed and only corporate greed to stir the electricity vs gas. Pass the carbon tax to the user and blame them for climate change. No accountability from governments and big corp.
As long as you're buying it...they're selling it.
The guy that ran concrete funding the war to the guy running iron funding the war now the guy funding oil and gas going to fund the war until robotics take everything out
"You started out pretty good until 17 min in.  Worked in oil for 15 years.  Corpo side, not a rough neck.  You are speaking Biden Admin Propaganda.

DM me and I will happy go over every detail of why ""9000"" open leases doesn't mean anything to the industry."
It‚Äôs Joe f america Biden‚Äôs fault for destroying our energy independence
Why did prices go so low?
"Meanwhile, there is plenty of crude in the US to keep the US economy from collapsing!
The oil giants only see their big profits and short gains.
The social and security impacts caused by the decrease in oil production has so many future negative consequences.
Renewable energy currently isn‚Äôt in place to sustain a national economy.   It just isn‚Äôt!"
"Yes the world oil production has shifted to different locations 

But the US oil did not shut down for profit it was forced out by this administration 

There is no reason why North American needs any oil from other countries 

Yes transmission of oil is costly 
But a pipeline has a big upfront investment but the returns are big and very long turm 

Now add in endless federal regulation state and federal and permitting requirements from every ware and taxes 
At state and federal levels

Then the geo political bullshit and here we are 
Or current leadership has cut off ties with OPEC by giving their hateful neighbors nuclear capability threatening their existence
Or leadership is hell bent on giving Putin money to fund his war and then we have Venezuela that we are now going to reward its corrupt leader ship that was on the way out 
With a new lease on life with lots of cash from oil 

Oh what a great idea 

One simple pipe line from Canada would move more oil then we are now getting from Russia 
And it‚Äôs 90 percent complete  ( really )
Cutting off Putins money to fund his war 

It would also relieve pressure on the market here bringing prices down 

Yes oil is a world commodity 
But local supply helps stabilize the local price 
But we our leadership killed it and cut our local supply 
Doing away with endless regulation would make it much easier to ramp up production when demand requires it  But it‚Äôs back to our leadership to fix 
and they chose to make things worse with more red tape 

But the biggest lies of all is we don‚Äôt need carbon based petroleum products

There‚Äôs so many different types of things made from petroleum that no one ever considers 
There are Very few products on the Shell today that are derived from a petroleum in some small way 
These products have no other alternatives or man made substitutions
So these products will simply not exist with out oil"
don't forget countries taxes too.
Greedy Oil Companies and Congress let it happen with its Lobbyist buying Senators just like the Food Corporations
"XIDEN fires 1,000,000 piplene workers.. XIDEN cuts off 100% of American oil drilling.. XIDEN
cancels oil leases in Mexico and Alaska.. XIDEN begs countries that chant DEATH TO AMERICA for oil..
the  countries that chant DEATH TO AMERICA say.. WE...WILL..NAME..THE..PRICE.. XIDEN says
'ok I'm getting mine FREE anyway.. just get me my 10%'.. end of story."
"so lets be honest, those pricks do what they want and milk us all dry and our government has not the balls to do something against it ...
what are we suppost to do ?"
"Here is the REAL reason why gasoline prices keep going up and that is because the Luciferian globalist elite are making a false narrative about internal combustion engines, and all other petroleum based fuels, as well as wood, oil, coal, and natural gas, usage, all being bad for the environment when, in fact, it is the electric batteries that are far worse to the environment than internal combustion engines.  Moreover, the Luciferian globalist elite are really owning BOTH sides of the debate, as they own ALL of the fuel and power companies in the world, thus they have you all suckered into their bad bill of goods."
I thought Biden pulled the Expensive Gas lever
Drill more in the us and the Gulf
"I am worried about the politicians that are used to getting their regular oil company bribe money, oops I mean lobbying money that they won't be getting as much as they are used to getting and may only be able to take the family on 5 vacations to foreign countries instead of 6."
So all of us poor people who cannot afford an electric car will be selling kidneys for fuel soon .
"Sorry we have our own oil don't believe it .
Another thing all this countries need us and Swiss banks now that alone prove enough. 
We don't need foreign oil for 100 years in reality remember the old oil pimps .
Open not few years ago sadly we have and worse president history in modern times 5 major mistakes this president has especially too middle class it our taxes that pays for all things running in America especially with hand out people even that Obama and this president cut off 15 percent what shameful presidents numbers don't lie what shame"
I'm pretty sure it's way more complex than this. If supply is lower then demand than naturally new companies will arise and if the US actually gave permission for drilling then these new companies would be able to drill and lower prices. Biden still sucks
"The United States have all the Oils, Gas an still thy get it from overseas that waste of $$$$ but yet gas still goes up , Biden don't care because he don't drive a vehicle"
I remember when oil was 200 a barrel gas still wasn't $5 a gallon .
Oh come on we all here know it's Biden's fault lol. I love how people blame whoever the current president is for very complex issues like these
@Douglas Lippi That's the point! If most car manufacturers are saying we're going to be 100% electric by 2030 or 2035. A large percentage of the demand is going to be going with it. Since oil & gas investments have to be planned way in advance to meet demand why would they invest when their current infrastructure will meet demand in 10 years? Sure it isn't meeting demand now but that just means massive profits.
"@UpNorthCatsFan I prefer markets decide. Most people like the product the oil industry provides, and some question that the environment is in imminent danger. For me (electric car owner btw), I prefer governments giving temporary incentives (like tax credits) to achieve long-term goals rather than blatantly trying to destroy an industry that provide goods that many people (I'd even say the vast majority of people) like and want to purchase."
"@Douglas Lippi I agree with you. I guess I don't mind goverments having the intrest of the planet (and therfore the people on said planet) before the intrest of people with deep pockets in a particular industry. If people felt as if there was an environmental issue on the horizon and they were left with the choice of either A) start now to combat said issue or B) allow it to continue so some could pad their pockets a little more, I'm happy A) was the choice, but that's just me."
"@UpNorthCatsFan valid point, but electric cars still represent a minority of vehicles. Without government cracking down I think the oil industry still would have several decades of profitable quarters ahead."
"@Douglas Lippi not a dime, and I don‚Äôt blame them for it. But if the general public is accepting the idea of electric vehicles more and more everyday and car manufacturers are also fully on board with electric vehicles‚Äôs, why in gods name would I invest money into the future of an industry that‚Äôs on its last legs today?"
The price of oil was negative? So...they pay people to take it? Wish I'd known. I'd take some off their hands if they paid me enough
Miss President Trump yet???
No
But but..Biden said..
Propaganda!
"Cheaper oil prices will come again, when I don't know, but high oil prices are also unsustainable."
Because joe biden isnt letting oil companies drill on more land that has oil
Wrong
"Of course it's not the war - Joe Biden pulled the big gas prices lever in the Oval office towards the end of the scale labelled ""expensive"". That's how it works!"
"95% of the world expected a video about gas - the um gas that the world uses for cooking and heating. Americans expected, and created, a video about a liquid: petrol. Weird."
"Cause it's what cost more here, duh"
Democrats are evil.
"Can't be because of all the printing of money and then funnel it back to theirselves could it. If you've been around long enough you notice the patterns before each new economy starts. They just move their money around each industry to avoid inflation and yes sometimes to fund wars. There's only about 3 left after gas prices. 
Housing,gold/silver and stocks. Which is first,hmmmm?"
lots of horse hurt being thrown out by Biden eexcuse  makers.
Government policies are the  reason why the gas prices are so high. supply from our own oil is cut by this  administration. when the supply is  was lower than demand  prices rise. if you are believing all the excuses being thrown out because you want oil to fail th then you believing a lie. the uncontrolled  spending is why we bvn have inflation. we don't have a greed problem  we have a leadership problem.
hahaha all plastics and metals utilize crude oil in multiple derivatives
everyone in the comments and this video has no idea that oil is only part of the crude oil column
crude oil will never go away.
Thank ur fellow biden administration
"""Renewables are taking over""
""The 'idea' of renewables are taking over"" is much more apt imo.
Renewables just can't meet the energy demands of the world.
Solar isn't super efficient and requires lots of area and a lot of sunlight which many areas can't supply enough of for their energy demands.
Wind is kind of garbage. Again, taking up a lot of area and being not super efficient. Maintenance takes a good chunk of the cost of a wind farm. Turbines kind of suck.
Hydroelectric, not really much of an option for most places.

Fossil fuels and coal don't really have much competition at the moment. There hasn't been any breakthrough to dethrone them as our energy producers. Many of these renewable methods are simply used to help offset the use of them, not to replace them.

Trying to introduce legislation to remove or reduce the use of fossil fuels and coal by force of law is quite misguided since it's the best option for most people, and the more the state tries to persuade companies to get out of fossil fuels, I think the worse off we'll be unless there's some breakthrough."
"Yeah, a persuasive essay. Not a damn word about the Green New Deal. Didn't want to touch it huh?

So are we to believe that it doesn't have an effect? With the Biden Administration killing the Keystone Pipeline and the excessive fear mongering of global warming not even an afterthought?

Yeah, a persuasive essay."
"It's heartbreaking, because I know that because of my financial situation and no improvement in the near future, that I'm going to be paying an ungodly amount for gas for at least the foreseeable future"
"@kirakira most of your paycheck to gas? highly unlikely.  unless you literally travel several hours a day by car to work, and make almost nothing. even at high gas prices, the cost of gas should be negligible to your paycheck unless you drive a crazy amount of miles. in which case, you cant blame it on gas prices, but your driving habits."
"@kirakira work a better, or another job"
@Justin Trimbull i'm paying most of my paycheck to gas and medical bills so i can keep working. what do you want me to do???
@1LT Trent no y‚Äôall just gotta improvise. Gas isn‚Äôt forcing anyone in to bankruptcy. Adapt and adjust. Help isn‚Äôt coming. Help yourself.
"That's the plan - we're poor, die younger, and can't travel"
"Greed is driving it all, and will get worse."
I love this guy
"Moral of the story is, stop laying off people who have 35 plus years experience in oil and gas contracting, then hire someone right out of high school for $10 and hour when they need their hand held like a 2 year old. What ceo's are doing are getting rid of people who don't need a boss there to make things happen. You get dumb $10 an hour guys runnings things, things will get fouled up and eventually close."
BIDEN‚ÄôS ADMINISTRATION IS A BUNCH OF IDIOTS
If there is such a shortage of oil why does the USA export so much oil and fossil fuel products?
"There's too much history and too many facts presented to hold the attention of those who would prefer to blame one man instead of recognizing the labyrinthian system that has brought us to this point. I wish there were an elevator speech to summarize this video in 30 seconds or less for all those who are blaming Biden. I may be wrong, but I believe most people are simply unaware that no administration has the power to control the price of fuel at the pumps, much as it might irk us to acknowledge that."
Blame biden
"We know it's not the war, it started far before that, in fact I think it was a few days after the inauguration....."
@QdMaster btw no one told you to get a car/truck with a 40 gallon gas tank
"@Make_Me oh I drive, have to spend 110 dollars every three days, it's killing me, and what I meant was this big spike started as soon as us production started getting shut down as soon as Biden started signing shit, some of which he has been caught on camera signing while he says he doesn't know what he is signing, don't believe me?"
You don‚Äôt drive a car huh. If you did you would have seen gas climbing in September 2020.
"so funny, oil never went ""Negative"" only that current ""front"" month's futures contract which is a derivative... no, sorry, oil never went below $0.00 per 55 gallon barrel..."
Biden is a lot of the reason ! - Trump's energy police was much better !!!
Trumps energy policy was getting his palm greased by big oily companies
I'm surprised people in the comments aren't just calling this fake news and saying its all the president of the US's fault lmao. That's genuinely what I expected to see.
"If you sort by new, you‚Äôll find plenty of that. People are unable to accept that the president‚Äôs energy policy has little to no effect on the prices we‚Äôre seeing"
Joe Biden
There is some truth to this well executed video but I feel there are some items I disagree with. It is politically motivated as well. And I don't feel the oil industry is particularly bad. It's an industry.
...you gonna elaborate there or do we just kinda have to trust you?
"Yeah this was borderline propaganda, unlike many other good videos on the channel. Either that or he did not adequately research the subject"
@thewaffle003 def makes stupid seem like a small word in comparison.
You didnt cover the fact that 97% of Demacrats including the entire BIDEN family has a lot of stock in oil and opec and how just the state of Oklahoma has enough oil to supply the whole of the US and all of Europe until 2510
@Make_Me you may eant to do some research. And they own lots of stocks in go green as well. Its call covering your bet. Dont comment what you dont know
Wow! Misinformation much?. How does big oil support the party that want to go green. But in your simple mind doesn‚Äôt support the party want to stick with petrol oil and coal ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Wait doesnt your government care about you?.
They want you to buy an electric car that costs 70 thousand and up and only go 300 miles. Golf carts would be a better option but no money in that.
The reason is Brandon. Full stop.
"How the hell is the Russia War NOT PART OF THE GAS GOING UP???? you do realize that with this weak ass president America has, putin said screw it, I ll attack. Come on dont be ignorant"
Cause it didn't cause the price to rise
"Except you have no scientific comparison.  War happened, price of gas went up.  When there was no war (Russia vs Ukraine) prices weren't this high.  You can't say it's not the war."
"If you think you are immune to the high cost of fuel because you have an electric car think again. With diesel at an all time high the cost of everything you buy is now reflecting that absurd cost of diesel. With the market in crash mode, inflation running away, and interest rates reaching all time highs for the last 30 years this just adds to the possibility of another depression era. All thanks to the greed of the oil companies who sit back and make billion dollar profits."
Joe Biden did that
I REALLY wish those damn EV's were in the proper price range- my dream was always to give a middle finger to the oil industry and tell them to take a good long hike. That dream is still a number of years away
Hear me out... Maybe.. Just maybe we nationalize the oil industry in the USA... Even temporarily to curve the prices.
"The WEF's ""Great Reset"" opportunity came and they took advantage of it."
pipelines are cheap compared to what we're giving Ukraine to hold out a little longer just so Russia can take over them any ways and take our money from them.
Age of oil is over yet the chart you show has it going up still. Can't make this shit up. World is thirsting for oil more than ever right now. It dropped because everything shut down.
There's no better cure for high prices than high prices.  There's so much profit in a Barrell of oil right now that these countries will cheat each other and pump more oil than agreed to reap the rewards.  And small producers will fire up rigs to take part.  The OPPORTUNITY cost is too much of a risk to miss than the risk of over investment.
"Biden threatening contractors with swift repercussions to drilling with no plan of green house recourse, then complaining about companies not drilling enough. Then begging our enemies for said resources because lack of supply, gas prices and shit. Proceeds to the dream of ""net zero"" meanwhile importing the record high of lithium mined from China to build batteries and also electric fucking cars which are a fossil fuel on wheels and uses up more FF energy to produce in factories than it does refining oil. What a seriously dumb situation. To proclaim net zero as priority when it is actually impossible to do, over the peace of energy independence. If you piss off Russia and China, there goes your energy grid and your way of living. No more imports, no more anything and you have only woke politics to blame. Bye bye America."
This video is such bs.
You sad you couldn‚Äôt find your confirmation bias here?
"I think there 2 or 3 ways out of this predicament. In fact I  would propose that the cost of gas at the pump is more important than the 50 to 100 jet fighters we could build in the next few years. One of these companies should be nationalized, and become the low cost competitor they refuse to act like. The oil biz is no longer playing by market rules (as they have done a few times in the past). Getting to a green future means we should be paying less for the carbon present. The dollars left over get invested in green. But you know what, politicians will simply spew BS to say we can't. Vote every incumbent out until we get some brains in those positions."
It's all Biden.  He f'ed it all up.
"This is opinion and hardly fact as we‚Äôve seen the price of oil do this time and time again. Also, renewables are hardly as environmentally conscious as the left will lead you to believe"
"We are passing Peak Oil, but most people don't want to think that geology impacts our lives.   The average US citizen has as much understanding where stuff comes from as the average cat or dog knows about pet food factories."
"This guys seriously not gonna mention the Biden Administration once ? Closed pipelines , more regulation/ our right banning fracking, Extreme inflation‚Ä¶.. like come on dude we all know the politics had a huge effect."
"The problem here is, there is NOTHING being done in the long term, to replace the cheap Oil energy.  We could possibly go Nuke and produce lots of electricity for Cars and homes, but what about Trucking? Shipping? or Airlines? What is going to power those industries? 
Sorry, but carbon is here to stay.. and someone needs to get it going again or everyone is going to suffer equally except those at the top that live off of taxpayers."
"Oil bro here. Our company has 50 plus fed leases that we definatly want to drill. Fed epa approval for one take 2 years after the lease is approved. And the epa does often say no. If its a privatle lease, it take 2-5 days in midland. Also industry wide its agreed that there are 75 years of conventional reserves to match expecting global growing demand so no worries."
"The Biden administration has closed off a significant portion of US production capacity. The reason just two short years ago US gas prices were so low is, the US was the largest producer/exporter of refined products and exceeded Russia as an exporter of crude oil. It's called supply and demand limit the supply the price goes up exponentially especially since the demand is not decreasing. Biden closed all the valves Trump opened our supply of oil has not changed.... foriegn oil has little to do with prices here when we produce enough of our own!"
"It‚Äôs the Democrats fault‚Ä¶‚Ä¶after all they are in charge of everything‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they promised better, now you can see how much they lie."
"But I was told it's all Joe Bidens fault.  DUR HUR HUR HUR HUR!
VT247"
Actually. iys down to QE too. More QE than anything else
"Not exactly the fix but one massive reason we are in this position is because CEOs and corporation board members/elected officials do not fear us showing up at their homes and killing them. They‚Äôve never had to deal with or think about this fear, maybe time to change that."
"We have the technology to switch over to compressed natural gas.  Natural gas is abundant in the US and relatively cheap, and it burns much cleaner.   And it con be used with little modification in current combustion engines.  All that is needed is the development of a greater infrastructure.  But instead, we are driving toward a completely different and much more expensive technology, electric.  In the meantime, gas is becoming more and more scarce and expensive.  Complete stupidity."
Joe Biden.
My opinion is because a bad in his administration wants the gas prices to go up they want us to stop driving it‚Äôs not gonna happen they purposely shut down the keystone pipeline and they are preventing oil drilling or at least making it hard to drill that‚Äôs my opinion
$5-10 per barrel shipping cost? Really ? That seems really high.
Republicans will still say it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs fault.
"And we would be right. Go buy a Tesla. Spend 80 thousand dollars, That is what Biden said to do."
Two words you just need to know:   Joe Biden*.
I pay $1.25-$1.50 for RED diesel recycled fuel.   I have to filter it 3x.
"It's the oil companies causing the high prices let's stop beating around the bush, you cannot be making record breaking profits every quarter and then say we can't do anything about the price LOL You just don't want too."
"So why did gas get so expensive?   I got lost in the details.   I think the reason is that oil and fracking companies see the handwriting on the wall for their future, therefore limiting current drilling.  Is that correct?  Thank you."
United States should nationalize their oil industry.  Fuck the private companies and their price gouging!
VENEZUELA! Viva la revolucion!!!!!!!!!!!
"The MAJOR cause of high energy prices in America is the democrats and the biden administration. The democrats are trying to shut down American energy production and give it to OPEC, Venezuela, Russia or any other non-democracy source.  LGB"
Wait so what you are saying this is neither Trump or Obama‚Äòs fault
"Gas Price will stay high and sky high
Me: Just ordered a 10MPG(24L/100km) pickup for daily drivingüí∏"
"A fundamental mistake made in this otherwise fine dissertation is the assumption that oil companies' policy today to not invest in the future but instead invest in the now - is the overwhelmingly majority opinion.


Leaving out the fact that the oil industry (although heavily regulated) is still run on capitalism cannot be done.  This means that for every person/entity that doesn't want to hold visionary views, there are others that spot fantastic opportunities to exploit this limited view.  There will always be competition.  Always.  That is, if capitalism is allowed to remain. 


I just don't see that oil prices will remain high.  They quite possibly won't go as low as they once were (just a guess), but I don't see this spike lasting. No way (based on all history)."
"The oil industry, the same industry that entrapped the earth with energy from oil, bought patents, eliminated those in the way, now playing it nice to usher in a cleaner world, BS. Their strategy is solely profit driven, nothing more. They are not the good guys. They support carbon taxes and environmentalist by playing both sides. Megalithic corporatocracies will never roll over üëé. Furthermore, consider how much carbon and environmental devastation results in producing batteries for EVs. SMH."
"They can have it. Half the cost here are gov taxes, another portion is the fixed world price, which is bs since we produce our own from coal and shouldnt care for international price, cost should be 6 bucks a litre not 24. 

Im happy to watch it all crumble to dust, zero concern,  wont be stressed by the pricks who did this, just like 2 yrs in lockdown didnt stress me, nor threat of a pandemic that i still see zero evidence of besides having to take experts word. 

Not a single person i know , knows anyone who has died from some exotic virus, normal deaths have occurred,  some labeled as c complications,  my rebuttal, advanced in age well beyond average life expectancy here, sickly, life of heavy drinking, it was their time, not as listed on their certificates"
Sad story we need more crude oil
Gas cost so much thanks to the damm Democrats and Biden dumm ass.  They need to go or we need to go to civil war to get rid of the democrats once and for good
"Why isn't there more investment? Could it be because of the policies of the current administration as it was during the Obama admin? So far the Biden administration has reentered the Paris Climate Accord, canceled the Keystone pipeline, halted leasing programs in Anwar, and halted leases for oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters. Also imposing new regulations on the industry regarding methane emissions. Not to mention the vaccine mandates for federal workers/contractors which likely caused a lack of workers, thus a lack of production. 

These policies handicap American suppliers and provide OPEC with less competition, thus giving OPEC more control over the market. Even during the presidential debates candidate Joe Biden said ‚ÄúI would transition from the oil industry, yes."" Then went on to say in the same debate ‚ÄúIt has to be replaced by renewable energy over time‚Äù. 

The oil industry is not going to be replaced by renewables anytime soon. How do you think the raw materials that make up the solar panels, wind turbines, and hydro turbines are mined? If anything you will see Europe return to nuclear power. France has been running on nuclear power since the 80s and the Messmer plan for nuclear power came from the oil crisis in 1973. 

Furthermore, the drop in demand was due to governmental overreactions to Covid-19. This means that the dramatic drop in demand was artificial as in not based on trends. Renewables may be the future, but until we can find a way to store the energy produced by them at a reasonable cost oil will continue to be the way the world gets its energy. 

TLDR: Biden energy/covid policies are hurting American oil production (even Biden has mentioned doing so in debate), thus giving OPEC an open invitation to take advantage. Drop in demand is artificial due to government overreactions due to COVID. Nuclear is more likely going to be the dominate energy source in the future."
"So in other words the oiI companies are seeing the writings on the wall and before their industry despairs they're going to milk us out of every dollar we have. Seems almost like a Rattle snake that's bitten someone, it knows the human will win in the end but it's going to pump a little more venom in while it's still attached. in the hope of taking the human with it."
Propaganda
Greed
Dude coulda just said inflation lmao also interested in hearing about the shut downs of leases in the US on federal land.
"How are renewables taking over??  Also, the assertion that oil companies are not taking advantage of the ""9K"" available leases is preposterous.  They don't want to make more money???  Lots of assertions made in this video with little or no evidence and some that are more political narrative then based on actual facts."
As a motorsports enthusiast this video hurts my soul.
"The ajar chess respectively arrest because ukraine strikingly bore qua a puny cherries. piquant, tidy scarecrow"
"Interesting video. 
Your thesis boils down to a claim about the psychology holding sway in the oil industry: a lack of desire to reinvest. There's nothing wrong with that thesis, exactly, but it is extremely difficult to show that you are right when reading sentiment in this way. In this case, I don't think you've done a sufficient job of eliminating other factors. If companies are increasing their payout ratio, the usual suspect is a lack of opportunity to reinvest profitably. You have insufficiently examined this explanation, it seems to me.

 If we allow that it is the attitudes of the oil industry decision makers are behind the recent price run up, and not more objective economic factors, why ignore the obvious question? With the price of this commodity at an enormous high, why do people in the oil industry NOT see a reason to invest in production? Why would American producers, say, NOT want to take market share from OPEC through greater production, when the potential profits are so high? Or more specifically, why are people foregoing potential profits FOR US NOW in favor of greater long term profits for us and EVERYONE ELSE in the industry LATER, which may end up being less for us overall? This is directly counter to how industries usually behave. You are postulating what I call an ""organic conspiracy"" - i.e. no direct collusion required -  between industry rivals (and rival countries, politically). This can happen, surely, but it's unusual enough on a global scale that I think you have to lay it out more than you've done here."
I heard on the news that the high gas prices is because of the Russian war on Ukraine and the sanctions put on Russia because of it.
"Gee, it couldn't be because the potato head cancelled all domestic oil production."
"Oil and gas are from from being on thier way out, I do agree oil companies are proably just taking thier profits and running for now, but renewables are not really winning, they are winning the hearts of alot of people, but they cant compete. I went to school for renewables, had a job in the industry for a year or two, and have been in the oil and gas industry for about 15 years. When you do simple math and examination of both energy sources, oil and gas will win 98% of the time. Politics is what makes the differnce. That's what's been changing. Oil and gas will be here for decades to come"
It's BIDEN!
"The future for the first time for me is so scary idk what I‚Äôm gonna do before it was always oh I‚Äôll make it thru, it‚Äôll be rough but I‚Äôll be fine, but now idk"

Thanks Biden!
"My take away from this video is that Oil's price is uniquely affected when supply is lower than demand, the oil cartels have far too much influence, and building American cities in such a way that necessitates everyone drive everywhere for everything makes the average American's quality of life, dependent on the price of gasoline. But I still just fundamentally disagree with the idea that renewables are ready to take over, maybe 20 years from now, but I think it's just a fantasy to think that EVs will displace traditional cars any time soon."
"Unless we become incredibly aggressive with cannibalizing components from electronics from waste streams in a uniform manner, which the chances are slim-to-none. I agree with you."
"Just think of how to disperse the power, and such shows that gas is going to stay for a long time.
To actually upgrade most of the Western infastructure to support just 1/4 of all car owners with EV's would cost trillions that they do not have.  
Those trillions, if you really believe in reducing carbon emissions, should be going to a million other places before EV's.

Most of the gas price where I live is tax; in a lot of states, that is also some of the cost.  And in a lot of the Western world, that is also the cost."
"@Martin Latvian Yeah, I'm in fact considering building my own belt driven Ebike.  Short trips I sometimes take would be ideal for that sort of vehicle, and the regulations for such a thing are pretty lax at the moment.  here in Canada.  I did once look into building a car myself, something I always wanted to do - but getting it licensed is highly cost prohibitive, and I imagine getting a Chinese car certified would be about the same but i'd have to check of course."
"@Mike Richards Thats why I never use Apple products. I love Android open source. Easy to manipulate. Once You buy the product it is Yours, but with iPhone nooo Once You buy it it is still a property of Apple."
@Mike Richards But You can buy Chinese EV where You have full control of Your vehicle and computer. Open Source. Of course it requires a bit of intellect and expierence.
Well done. Entertaining to watch.
"@Infinity Dragon, Trick Question: Which of the 3 basic EV drivetrains - BEV vs PHEV vs HFCEV - offers the most advantages, applications and potential to reduce fuel/energy consumption, emissions AND insane traffic? Thee CORRECT answer is PHEV plug-in hybrid, even burning fossil fuels albeit much more sparingly, eventually with combustible hydrogen that stores at lower pressures in smaller tanks and meters more reliably in a PHEV H-ICEngine drivetrain than in a fuel cell EV. Plug-in Hybrid PHEV tech is especially applicable to long haul freight truck fleets."
@Tanner88 don't you mean go Brandon
"Entertaining? This couldn't be more boring! This video only explains part of the problem, throw some correlations, some nice graphs and stories, and claim it's the only cause of high prices while we see other causes and policies causing negative effects.
Yeah, not buying the 'oil man bad' narrative this time."
Not well done Has nothing to do with high gas prices. All B.S.
"Ok if that doesn't prove the whole system is broken, that oil can be valued at a NEGATIVE amount, then I don't know what does."
B-b-but BiDeN kIlLeD tHe KeYsToNe PiPeLiNe?!
While there is alot of truth in this there is also alot of misleading information.
"Here's something to think about. A woman who lives next door to me drives a small SUV, mainly because she has three kids. Her husband drives a truck. The husband's trucking company just announced they're shutting down because their main cargo is food transport. The cost of diesel has risen to $6.88/gal, and they can no longer provide a service within a price range which the market will bear. He's currently taking home around $650 per week driving a tractor trailer. 40hrs/wk. His job pays the families health insurance and mortgage. That's about to end. No local companies are hiring drivers, there are none left. I've looked and no one is hiring for more than minimum wage.
The wife, who worked as a dispatcher for a local bus service got laid off when the ended bus service due to fuel costs, the company realized customers wouldn't be able to afford higher rates so they decided to shut down. She now works at a fast food restaurant, who because of the new state min. wage pays her $15/hr. However, her SUV gets 12 mpg and she has to drive 38 miles a day to that job, all while dropping kids off at both a paid daycare and school, or around 48 miles of city driving or four gallons of gas a day or about $22 per day in gas. Times 6 days.  To avoid the state requirement of paying for health benefits, she's only allowed to work 22 hours per week. So her paycheck last week was $261 after deductions, then subtract about $130 per week in gas, and she's left with $131 after expenses for the week. 
On top of that they have a mortgage, about $1800 per month, plus utilities and food. They have no savings, it likely was never possible. On top of that, the city just raised property taxes again to cover expenses by $850 per year. Making the average property tax rate for a 100x100ft property and a two bedroom home around $7k to $8k per year. 
Dozens of people are in the same mess because of the high fuel prices. Its not only digging into peoples pockets at the pump, its forcing companies to close and taking away their means to make a decent living. 
Meanwhile they keep saying people would rather sit home and collect, i don't see that here, there's just no one hiring, at least no one hiring that's paying more than minimum wage, and a good many now have started paying less than the new minimum saying that if you want to work, you'll take it or have no job. They can't seem to enforce the new minimum wage any more than they could enforce the mandatory health insurance. All it did was put half the population on state healthcare because employers refused to pay or just couldn't afford it. 
There's more to this whole mess than we're being told, the high fuel prices are just a part of it. 
They say go solar, but if folks don't have jobs, they can't buy solar panels. 
If they don't have jobs, they can't afford $50K for a new electric car.
About 1 in 50 people drive a plug in car here, and the power company is already warning about when to charge your car and when to run your ac to cool your house. In an area where homes have 60a and 100a services, if everyone gets an EV, they're not able to handle that. 
A car is required in most areas of this country, the EV idea is fine but were far from ready and won't be for another decade or more. By then, at these fuel prices we'll all be broke and out of work with no means to fuel our paid for cars, no trucks to deliver food to the supermarkets, and no money to pay for the $9/gal heating oil to heat our homes in the winter. 

Also, why on earth if red dyed diesel/no2 heating oil higher now than taxed road diesel??? 
I'm told their the same fuel, but heating oil or off road diesel has less tax, but its somehow higher now by nearly $2/gal???"
Absolute bullshit. 10 dollars a gallon gas is not here to stay and windmills are a pipe dream. People won‚Äôt be able to afford food and any society is nine meals away from collapsing. This will all result in a depression and a civil war. You can see the crash on the horizon right now in America. The left cheating to get Joe Biden elected was the first nail in the coffin. The right in America will not stand for this much longer and they possess over 350 million guns. The left posses none. You do the math.
"major miss information in here..

A switch in government policy that drove the cost of production up also destroys profit...

Shutting down one of the major pipelines destroys profit and drives cost up...

Forcing the industry to ship and import.droves.up.cost... it's all artificial and most of it is by government policy"
"Well rounded video as usual.  The one thing I feel like was missed was the increase in the refining crack spread.  I have seen reports for the crack spread increase as much as 5x from pre pandemic levels.  sense March the crude oil prices have dropped as countries released more oil from their reserves, however the price of finished products have stayed high as the crack spread has increased."
"One thing to note: there's always been ""fracking"" (short for ""fracturing"") in the oil industry, long before shale oil was possible. It's just back then they used explosives (often"
"shale oil extraction possible is a bit misleading. Fracking makes all oil extraction possible, it's just hydrofracking that works on shale."
"The control of the information pipeline is the true investment used today by the oligarchs because it crosses all lines of energy production. The one solution that I believe addresses the most problems is local is recycling. Biden‚Äôs infrastructure and BBB plans NEVER EVEN MENTIONED that option? Fully promoting recycling must involve new production? Build things that are more easily recycled instead of becoming total trash should be true goal? Look around America to count the unused vehicles whether running or not is scary? As electric vehicles, being forced on Americans, these numbers will grow exponentially? Solution? Vehicle recycling plants build in America. Could you start with tires, batteries, computer chips? How about starters, alternators and other components like the large numbers of motors as in windshield and window motors. Lastly the precious metals used in catalytic converters and other components? Could this be the new high paying industry that robots can‚Äôt replace?"
Joe Biden is waging a war on oil....and the American people and our way of life.  He is a traitor.
*Why isn't the Republican partyüá∑üá∫üêñ fighting to drive down prices‚ÅâÔ∏è*
democrat party agenda is why gas is go expensive.
Lies this is all lies....US has Canadian oil next door and US supplies this is just price gouging....extortion....Hydrocarbon fuel is dirty Hydrogen...cars run better on clean hydrogen...hydrogen generation can be extracted from ocean water...cars all run on hydrogen...gasoline is a dirty expensive Hydrogen carbon fuel....clean Hydrogen burns clean....the carbon does not power our engines only the hydrogen...this video is all lies and propaganda...
"There's a huge disconnect in understanding of economics here where the video points out that oil companies have underperformed the market for decades and then treats the oil companies as reducing investment exceptional. 

It's just another form  of supply and demand. Low profits over the long term reduces investment which decreased supply which increases profits for existing investment which if it occurs long enough causes increased investment.  The oil industry not matching other stocks performance means they've been over-investing the whole time and larger profits than historically is just a return to rationality. 

And this video acted like oil producers in the US did so voluntarily when actually they went bankrupt enmasse because they weren't getting a return on investment and couldn't find investors because everybody knew that investors lost their shirt over dropping oil prices. 

But this also failed to point out that OPEC was largely behind this because OPEC decided correctly they could keep production up during the oil glut and bankrupt small American producers. Which of course is always the easiest thing to do because individually each a OPEC country wants to produce more to get more profits. 

And perhaps most egregiously of all it didn't even mention the ongoing massive demand shock caused by the pandemic.  Oil producers everywhere, just like everyone else, is uncertain how long and how big the effect of the pandemic will have on demand. 

Risk demands higher returns for investment."
"It's not the war, according to everyone in my Bible thumper hickville town it's Joe Bidens fault"
What‚Äôs everyone paying rn for gas? It‚Äôs like $3.80 a gallon where I‚Äôm at
"Gasoline was around before the invention of the internal combustion engine but¬†for many years was considered a useless byproduct of the refining of crude oil to make kerosene,  how can a waste cost so much to make? They still make kerosene so wouldn't gas will be the byproduct of that still?"
"It‚Äôs the WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM‚Ä¶ and their GREAT RESET is why everything is going up‚Ä¶.. call me a Liar. Has nothing to do with Supply, War or anything else. It‚Äôs them the WEF. Trust and believe."
5.5 billion for the worlds most expensive pipeline? doesnt sound like a lot for an industry that made 170 billion profit in 2021..
more like the Era of Artificial Scarcity caused by Marxist Globalists that want massive depopulation (Georgia Guidestones).
"The end of oil is near.
GYFOH. I‚Äôve been hearing that for Fukn decades.  What is that?  The DNC Channel?"
Key to storytelling‚Ä¶. This got way to boring way to fast.
its about time the americans pay the same price as fuel is in canada and australia
Wth am I watching
The View doesn't think there is inflation. Whats 100% more for their gas.
"Calling OPEC a cartel sounds like inviting an armed conflict, as if it's something to be combated, like drug cartels. propagandistic languages here."
"*I work in the oil and gas industry and can tell you it's simple... Dumb ass democrat policies of tax, regulate, fine, ban, tax, regulate, fine, ban, tax, regulate, fine, ban so those costs are passed DIRECTLY onto the end user!*"
I remember in 2015 January. I was a cementer at Halliburton and they kept saying if gas hits $3 then we‚Äôre gone get fired. Sure enough that February we were all let go.
"Of course you were. There's no incentive for oil companies to ""staff up"" because they want to create scarcity."
And a lot others.
"YES THEY DO WANT TO DRILL.  Soros had Biden kill oil 

Not a change in demand"
"Bring back mean tweets and 1.82 Gas! 

Biden killed American energy independence...gas costs soared .WE know this ..
Bernie Sanders blaming corporate greed is not the reason why in August we will see 6.00 gas 
NO Putin is not to blame.   But the Biden admin marxists would prefer u believe it"
"So, we have all the oil we need. However, it‚Äôs being held out of the market so as to increase the price at the pump. In other words, the oil companies are responsible for the gouging at the pump. They can lower the price at the pump by increasing production to meet the demand. However, their record profits are more important than the community they serve."
Bottom line? Grab the cash while you can !  Internal combustion going the way of the dinosaur!
"Planning a itinerary for Joe Bidens trip to 
Baskin Robbins?"
"I love how you completely ignore the reason for the 2017 glut.  They could not maintain their price why you say because buyers could find supply in other places ... what were the other places?  This was predominantly the USA. You parrot the Biden administration miss leading line about 9000 sites for they have leases to drill but what you completely ignore is the fact that they still have to get their drilling plan's and EPA approval on the sites something the administration is denying.  Sad really you put so much time and effort in to this video... Do you think if Exon could sell you gas for 50cents less than Shell and take massive market share they would not jump at the opportunity for this? 

Tost on the 3rd Cost .50 Cents you market it up 10% thats .05cents 
Tost on the 5th cost 5 dollors  10% of that is .50cents .. 
the repeted line about record profit shows total ignorance of how profit margin works the facts are the USA was the price control supplier for Crude and the Biden administration is doing exactly what they said they would do miss lead people ...

I had high hopes for this video but your just shilling a fake naritive."
In short: collusion to increase the prices.
See right there how this guy doesn‚Äôt say that opec actually caused the drop in 1015? They did increase production to get the price low so guys in the dakotas would slow down and it worked like a charm. This guy is holding back details
What a bunch of bs! Anyone who has been paying attention to where fuel comes from and how it moves around for the past several decades knows this is bs. Did we all forget what happened the very first day that Biden got into office? Look back and see what drastic decisions he made that day. Duh. This is a very well produced video. Well done propaganda!
"Russia only accounted for 13% of oil imports to the US, most comes from inside the USA, offshore wells, Canada, Mexico or the Middle east"
9000 permits of mostly natural gas.  Government still won't give permits to build roads to even get that.
No this is the cost of putting a senile decrepit crook in office this is the cause of voting stupidly.
Talk to me in 20 years when oil and natural gas remain integral parts of our economy. Maybe check out a list of all the things made from petroleum?
You are extremely misguided.  OPEC exists because of an agreement between the USA and those OPEC members.  The only thing that has driven oil prices up in there last decade is OBAMA and BIDEN green policies.   The fact that we had the lowest prices in FOUR DECADES under Trump nullifies everything you said and if he gets reelected we will see low prices again.
B.S.
"The big question is, how high will cost per gallon get? Is there no limit?"
"I don't like how this video,  which is really opinion, is presented in a way that  pretends it is factual. The narrator never uses phrases like ""I think..."", it's always ""this is how it is"". It is a persuasive strategy but it seems kind of tricky. 

I don't know enough about oil economics to contest anything said, but I can feel that there is another side of this story."
How many channels do you have??
Thanks!
great video and you could be completely wrong
"Such a long video for a short message.  Go by bicycle whenever possible.  Drive as little as possible.  Take public transportation.  Park farther away.  If you can't do those things, do what you can.  And vote for candidates and policies that encourage biking and transit."
Everyone should get a 90 mpg motorcycle and drop their consumption as much as possible....5 gal/week instead of 40 gal/week would go a long ways to lesson the impact of the sodomization we are being subjected to.............
Seems to me you left out how brandon and the rest of the Dimwitted dems are doing Every thing they can to Screw over anyone that wants to produce oil in the US. You also Fail to explain the face the world will ALWAYS need oil to make  all sorts of chemicals and the plastic for you electric car.
Its the result of a dictatorship crushing the civilian population with economics ! That comes first ! Trying to confiscate firearms and mass murder always comes next !
I'm a little confused. How's the era of cheap fuel over if almost everybody is still dependent on it. I guess I probably just missed the point of the video
"@Entropy I see, thank you"
"Now that producers have the control over the market price, why would they ever give up that control?"
"The end of Oil is near.
It's time for Biden to nationalize US oil companies since they choose to preserve capitol. It's no worse than OPEC +  and russia  reducing oil production while they subsidize gas at 91 cent per gallon for their people.
Cheap gas will get Biden re-elected."
"OPEC is not countries. it's a Person who, controls and manages their business: Rockefeller."
"Rockefeller paid off USA gov't to use oil instead of cheaper Alcohol to power cars. This fraud is still perpetrated on sheeple. This Monopoly is pretending to be ""oil companies"" but the prices in gas stations show otherwise. collaboration is a crime."
"Biden's energy policies and axing the Keystone XL pipeline definitely aren't helping either. At least in America that's everyone's perspective, including mine."
"@Scotty Milhouse Right, and the majority of other news outlets in America aren't biased in the other direction. I follow the Daily Wire. They don't lie about their bias like CNN, MSNBC, ABC, and FOX do."
"No, it's not everyone's perspective. FOX news, maybe."
Joe Biden.
One word GREED !!!
"Lol. ""Renewables"" are not taking over from fossil fuels. Solar and wind are not reliable or scalable and no one wants nuclear. Fussion is consistently decades away. We're about to find out how much we need fossil fuels soon."
Great video. Thanks for taking the time to make it.
"What day of week and hours does the ""church"" offer church services?  Oh yeah, they don't!"
"it's price gouging nothing more,  BTW there is no shortage in Canada, 37% of the price of fuel is tax.   Consumers have the power to say no,  problem is humans are to greedy and or to stupid!"
So you didn't watch the vid?  Typical.
"Gas prices spiked in January right after Biden closed Keystone. He then proceeded to ask OPEC to increase production which they refused. He took us from energy independent, to begging others. Then NATO decided to try to expand to Ukraine, right along Russia's border. Imagine if Russia was down in Mexico. Same thing. A threat to national security. Russia stopped it. This then triggered Biden and other globalist sell outs to boycott Russian oil in an attempt to financially hurt Russia. This all because the puppet they have been trying to install there, Navalny, is a loser. They want world government and the nations that resist, must have puppets installed who will sell out their people for a NWO"
Its biden!
"The crucial thing this video does not discuss is Barrator Joe Biden's WAR on fossil fuels.  Wake up, people.  Joe is destroying our country through energy using climate nonsense."
"""it is not the ""WaR"". Yeah, right, pal."
Every heard of futures?   I thought so.
Wrong
Trump fix this no problem
"I get it, it's a convoluted market... but decisions were consciously made to make it even worst and unstable to maximize profits."
When Trump gets back in the office in two years it will drop back down about two bucks a gallon i  guarantee it
"i tried telling people it wasn't the war driving up prices, people thought I was dumb or something."
"Say what you want. This is all a result of the corrupt Biden Admin. Biden causes everything they said Trump would, but they lied. War, famine, inflation, all caused by Biden."
High gas prices are a good thing at the moment. This will take money out of peoples pockets to slow down spending on goods and services. The reduction in demand will allow industries to catch-up on production. Employment demands won't be as high. Companies won't be bidding up wages to secure a workforce. The Fed is doing this with interest rates. High rates mean less money borrowed to buy things. The cure for high inflation is painful and this time may be more painful than others.
@jaim haas 60 billion(a lot of weapons) is nothing compared to trillions in stimmy checks. All the weapons we are sending to Ukraine are going to need to be replaced in our arsenal. Do you believe we should be helping them?
Still need to slow the spending...too much gov spending currently.  Another 60 Bill just sent to Ukraine....Biden wants to keep this inflation stoked.
Painful for the majority of people but  profitable for the elite. Those making the painful decisions never suffer the consequences.
Lol in Germany we easy have over 50% taxes on gas and most other countries also have more this kind of taxes.
we know its not war. were not stupid.
Where is the evidence renewables are taking over ?
"Wow, contrary to what the stickers on the gas pumps always say, this video never mentions Joe Biden, once! lol"
Advanced dual mode EVs will get 297mpgE so oil is toast.
Jerry you need to look up the problem with Lithium.  Your idea of nervana ain't happening dude.
Great explanation!
"There are some valid points in this video but it‚Äôs filled with lies and falsehoods as well. The ‚Äú9000 unused permits‚Äù talking point is a complete and utter falsehood. There are a lot of unused permits however that‚Äôs the norm, in fact there were a lot more unused permits during the previous US administration, however that doesn‚Äôt mean anything as a lot of these lands are deemed to be not worth investing after an assessment is done. The problem is that it‚Äôs exponentially more difficult to get permits required for extraction and transportation under the Biden administration and that‚Äôs ultimately the main reason behind the sharp rise in gas prices."
This talking point was take verbatim from Jen Psaki.
"... not sure this... any of it... ends well. Sure, oil has it's 'issues', but doesn't the battery/EV industry have them too? I am concerned that we are just jumping from one path of destruction to another. I would rather have two or more paths... lol."
The biggest reason is the liberals war on fossil fuels. So the Mideast knows they can raise the price and the Biden administration won‚Äôt do anything to offset it. Just make up fake excuses and blame everyone else for their ineptitude. We went from energy independence to energy dependence in less than a year. It was planned.
I guess you didn't watch the video??
2.16 $ a liter is the max I have seen here I belive which is 9.8 $ for one gallon almost 10$ for one gallon if your amercian

Not only the mining but the location of some of those deposits.
Imagine a oil pegged dollar not going up when the price of oil goes up. Lol üòÜ
Pure naked greed.  17 billion US tax dollars are going to boost record war profiteering profits.  ALL oil subsidies should be ended NOW!
"The incentive to keep oil prices down will keep the economy growing when price of oil goes up the price of food and other necessities will end up going up. Causes the fed to decrease the ability to loan by raising the fed rate. Causes wall street to sell off growth stocks, causes lack of IPO's and companies going public slows down the rate of technological advancements, this is why Tesla has been getting smoked with the rest of the market. The price of oil is the price of energy, the cheaper the price of energy is the stronger the economy remains.  Seems like one bad thing leading to another keeping in line with the same theme, each event makes the problem worse. Destruction of civilization. The government needs to step in and nationalize energy production it will be a national security issue with the price seemingly heading to 10 bucks a gallon congress refuses to act when the world needs a plan to transition of fuels not when the technology is ready but when the business completes the expectancy of an oil refinery something needs to come and stabilize prices."
prices fell. It's as simple as that.
"Sounds like we should produce here and make our own competition. Too bad the current administration won‚Äôt do it. They‚Äôd rather us get r*ped by OPEC in hopes we‚Äôd buy into their electric future. Unfortunately infrastructure isn‚Äôt ready for electric vehicles, especially in rural areas where poverty is high. And when we‚Äôre all struggling, I don‚Äôt think telling everyone to get an electric car is a solution. But ehh, why do they care? They‚Äôre rich."

"For the USA, don't forget to mention the day JB took office he started importing oil vs exporting. Exporting oil is the reason why gasoline was much cheaper when DT was in office."
Exports are up under JB. LNG in particular. Crude exports are up about 200k barrels/day from 2019.  LNG exports have nearly doubled from 5.4 billion cubic feet per day in 2019 to 9.7 bcf/d in 2021.
This whole video has nothing to do with US oil prices. Propaganda at its finest.
@RAYNINN so oil prices are set by whether the U.S. is a net producer and not by opec?
@Nick Brother I am in the oil and gas industry and have been for close to 30 yrs now and that is untrue almost to the point of being ridiculous.
@RAYNINN the u.s. being an exporter or importer of oil does not change the price of the commodity
@Nick No as I stated before we should be a exporter of oil.
@RAYNINN we are a producer. Literally the largest in the world. Doesn‚Äôt change that oil is a commodity that‚Äôs most affected by global market forces outside of U.S. control. So should we leave that global market?
we have enough reserves to bring gas back down to pre 2000 prices... so lest use our gas Instead of foriegn oil
LOL
everything is expensive in California..... I'm surprised the state still had any one live there

But at least the president isn‚Äôt making mean tweets right guys? Right?
The reason gasoline is so expensive is because Biden banned fracking on his first day in office. Obama did the same thing with the same results. When trump allowed fracking prices fell. It's as simple as that.
Except he didn't.
Argue with the price at the pump.   Red Wave.
Gas and rent is so high because  of the Californian's.
no its OBIDEN voters fault oeriod.
"poor americans richest on planet and have to pay almost half of that most develop world pays , poor souls ...."
fkn greedy bastards!
"the most important thing we sent 40B to Ukraine , that will fix oil prices in no time"
"Good vid but doesn't answer its own question. OPEC keeps production low enough to keep prices high, sure. But traditionally production outside OPEC (Canada & esp US fracking) broke the price. OPEC boosted production & use is falling so price fell enough it was uneconomical for frackers - we get it. But the price is HIGH now: supply & demand suggests fracking would be back on. Especially since (as vid mentions) fracking investment costs are lower & build is faster than with traditional drilling.
What the vid doesn't consider is that the industry has consolidated, is vertically integrated (exploration & drilling through refining to distribution & retail). This enables the majors to constrain supply to market just like OPEC does, keeping prices high & milking the public for profit. 
THAT'S the story Wendover needs to investigate next: How do the oil companies control the market? Look into industry consolidation, anti-competitive practices, constraint of trade, political influence, market gaming. Shouldn't be hard to document: the industry is so confident of its power its sloppy. For instance, Exxon is on the S&P ESG list while Tesla gets kicked off it. That's bizarre, suggests political pull."
This is what you get for voting blue
Ethanol is not good for engines. Especially 2 stroke and 4 stroke
Even Jonboy Walton's family was producing it in the 40's
One word: Biden. 'Nuff said.
"The next time you hear politicians talking about how their opponents are pro fossil fuel or anti oil, just remember: oil companies are just like any other company that sells a product and they would much rather sell their product for $6 a gallon than $3 a gallon."
"it's a bit more complicated than just wanting to sell the oil for a higher price. shale oil fields aren't just a tap that you can turn to make more oil, they need more investment to drill and frac new wells.  investors and banks are tighter with money after the dismal performance of past years, field development plans need to be laid out for the year, and drilling rigs and frac fleets and sand supplies need to be lined up.  a lot of rigs, fleets and sand plants have been idled and a vast majority of industry workers were laid off during the pandemic, so most of the service industry's calendars are full until they can reactivate and rehire enough to keep up with demand (and oil service prices are skyrocketing as a result).  many returning workers are demanding 2/2 (two weeks on, two weeks off) schedules instead of the tradition 2/1, so service companies are having to hire a higher headcount per rig/fleet than before.  a lot of independent oil companies would be drilling and fracing more if they could get more rigs or sand loads, or afford the rising service costs."
"My takeaway- if you can afford it, get solar panels and an EV and never have to worry about gas prices again"
FJB
"My ASS  we had a president for the people , most reasonable gas prices in the last ten years or more and now we have no president who the hell knows who is running the USA and now we are a third world country in less than two years ."
so its not the putin price hike? lmao
Outstanding presentation and explanation of the factors involved with this topic....well done!
Yes it is
Sooooo its Biden‚Äôs fault
So when does hi gas or fuel costs help production
Greed .....
hupmh. So from propane and asphalt it's oil all the way down.
Blame the Green New Deal against all fossil fuels.
I cannot wait until cold fusion is figured out.
great timing for the car companies coming out with electric cars
"When the price of gas went over $1.00/gallon everybody panicked in the early 1970's. Then the long gas lines under President Jimmy Carter when I had to get up at 6:00AM to get in line for gas. My tank had to be 1/4 full max. or the gas station attendant would not fill up my tank. Because ""topping off"" was considered hoarding fuel."
"I was a teen gas jockey back in the day. Chevron delivery drivers told us that there was no shortage, that tankers were being held offshore in order to raise prices and that's why our deliveries were rationed ~ it was politics. Then we suddenly got sugar, coffee and paper product '$hortage$' too.



The irony was that even with our somewhat rationed fuel deliveries, we pumped nearly as much as a typical day before the shortage. We just did it in 4-hours instead of the usual 16-hours due to waiting, fearful  and sometimes hostile customers. But the consensus seemed that the shortage was mostly fabricated."
cant sell not so many cars at $2 a gallon
"car prices are extremely high , so that's not really a problem. their problem is getting parts for east asia."
Love how the title of this video is past tense. Wishful thinking.
Stupidity is the cause find out how much of a Robot mind you have.
"This video forgot to mention Brandon's being a 'Green-hole' bully, and Obummer was a HUGE Bully to the US Oil Industry for years before the cognitively declined potato/puppet was 'installed'.  We need Orange Man Bad back in office NOW!!!"
I know plenty of people who will never buy an electric car so saying the industry wants to move to carbon less is naive
"Exactly 8 seconds in, I stopped listening. You‚Äôre going to give me an education in a financial matter, and in your opening sentence you ask me if I remember when the price of a commodity dropped by 300%
Do tell, if a barrel of oil costs $100 and it‚Äôs price drops by 100%, what is its new cost?"
THANK YOU!!
"Joe, it's cause of Joe, nothing more nothing less"
Renewables are more expensive it so many ways! It‚Äôs dumb
Nice politicians and fake news have screwed us all!
"Nice video.

Oil goes up for 1 reason and 1 reason only, commodity traders buy it pushing prices up, oil markets are traded worldwide, US doesn't set the price lol, traders do! It's basic supply and demand is why they buy or sell. Nothing more nothing less, everything else is a sideshow, so everyone keep your political panties on. Oh and oil spiked over $100 right when war was starting, so that's BS lol! Seen this with my own trader eyes, look at chart. If you trade, you saw this coming.  Have a great day everyone."
"Entire video has a leftist lean. Be honest, biased garbage."
There is no shortage. Gas goes up under every democrat eco terrorism administration. If you cant see that by now there is no saving you
IMO isnt it also largely also dictated by the turn around time from finding the oil to selling the gas. I mean shale did wonders because of the WH refusal and general markets reluctance of fossil fuels in favour of no risk/low risk renewables that just couldnt compete with the cheap and fast fracking. Like the only real reason solar panels are what they are today for the cost is because of chinas massive subsidies and Americas enforced usage of green power.
Communist bass turds that‚Äôs why !
I've no idea why you guys call it gas..... it's a liquid!
gasoline
END ALL FOREIGN AIDE NOW ! ! ! Anything else  has kick backs
The cost of oil controls the rate the economy grows
Somebody must finance the war.
"If this video isn't putting a LOT of blame on the Biden fraudministration, it's wasting my time.  In fact, I suspect you're trying to blame anything but Biden, because you were foolish enough to vote for him."
So they don't need a drill all they need to do is turn the pumps back on how come it's so simple but yet so hard to flip a switch
"This is very persuasive indeed. If you‚Äôre going to go out, you might as well go out with a bang. Also, it‚Äôs worth noting that any limited resource will ALWAYS have more demand than there is supply, even if they don‚Äôt realize it at the time. Demand for anything is indefinite. That isn‚Äôt the case with non-recyclable, natural resources."
Oil is not a limited resource though.
"Can you clarify something here ?
You are stating that  'Demand for anything is not known and not decided""
Is that correct ?
Is that what you are stating ?

"I think I watched this Very Same Video on a Projector back in the 70s! ""Look to the Past to forecast the future"", because ""Everything that has happened before, will happen again"" (So Say We Allüòú)  Oil Companies Never went bankrupt when a barrel of oil went negative... WHY do you think that is?? This Story is Way more intricate than you will ever know & if Oil Companies Don't want to ""Go Away"", then they won't. Figure out who pulls the strings & there will be your answer (Maybe). ""The Truth is Out There"" , but only a small minority are in on it!!"
Looking at the timeline you can see it started well before the war started.
You mean a subversive essay.
$14 to fill up F150 lighting . $100 to fill up gas F150. It nots rocket science. Why do you think major car companies are investigating billions in new technology.
"Don‚Äôt forget the Biden administration‚Äôs order to banks to stop lending to these investors, the all out war on fossil fuels from every federal agency, ending annual lease auctions, war on fracking (which is carbon neutral), war in clean propane‚Ä¶.your wish of transitioning is like modern gender theory, this world can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt change at the whims of the so-called experts.  Do a video on the environmental harm caused by battery mineral mining and when the batteries are spent.   I know some are recycled."
This is a pretty solid explanation.  It is not perfect and misses many reasons.  It is right that high oil prices are here to stay.
"I‚Äôm not gonna buy a new car till prices drop, so potentially never. Any dealership owner out there, blame your lose in profit on the oil companies"
Gas is more expensive because Biden stopped all oil and gas exploration and cancelled pipelines.  Nothing to do with America and Nato starting WW3 on purpose with Putin.
Sounds like oil is outdated and we need more electric powered machinery.  That way we can eliminate dependency on other countries for energy and basically kill off the competition
Oil isn‚Äôt going anywhere. All the plastic used to make these wonderful electric cars is made from oil.
What a great video. Thank you.
If someone started stay at home weekend and 60% of the United States people did it. Could we control gas prices and stop them from making profit?
"If a large part of the population stoppes buying gas it could decrease the gas price, but it would be very stupid since it would destroy the rest of the economy."
Working for an Oil and Gas company in the logistics space.  The company i work for is a midstream company so we are buying market bbls so the products we produce is based on a margin and we are not making more money like people think.  We did turn profit but not anywhere close to where we were in 2019. 2020 the company lost 3 billion on the year.  The US has a major logistics issue so more drilling and increase supply does no good.  I know the Bakken area was slated for 3 major pipelines to increase supply to refineries instead of railing them out which railroad companies are one of the poorest miss managed companies on earth.  My company is a more major transporter of crude and products through pipeline in the country so without more transportation space in our pipe we aren't making more money we will just float by near the bottom.
"It's time to put a name to faces we as the public keep taking hit after hitand nobody pays for it, pull all the board members, execute them. Keep it going down the line"
"I think it's awesome! Now many more people will buy electric cars, like I just did. Wank"
Lots of under valued oil stocks. BRK
"YET, the US politicians are still suppressing easy and independent energies like solar and wind. 
Because they are in OPEC's pockets."
Or could be the cancel of XL crazy how old Joe has the ability to Fu¬¢k up every thing
"Peak oil investment? I don't see how this can't age poorly.

You've just outlined issues with supply, which would imply a serious need for money to flow in to resolve this. But then at the end you basically said, none of this matters because renewables.

The biggest input costs of renewables is energy, the fossil fuel part, because mining."
I blame Biden and the democrats
They are certainly not helping but it‚Äôs also far beyond just Brandon
"Carbonless,green energy is a fantasy.Only a tool used to impoverish the common man.All part of the 2030 agenda."
"""Moving to a carbonless world will take time"" . Yeah, like forever..."
the earth is just a giant engine what happens to your engines when they run out of oil
"It's called collusion, all producers everywhere know they can profit so they won't do a darn thing to address the supply shock because if they do they likely will not come on-line until oil prices moderate or crash. The Russia situation absolutely is impacting the price of fuel and oil as the Russian supply has left the market and at an inopportune time.  The situation with refining is that US east coast refineries are sending their fuel to Europe as they depend on Russia for fuels so there is a shortage of finished product as well.  Just look we've had $150 per barrel oil but I've never seen $7 per gallon diesel until now. The video fails to explain this situation well, the falling oil prices were a result of both the Russians and Opec trying to bankrupt the shale producers, this threat prevents lots of new investment in shale.  Then we complicate the matter with financiers not willing to invest in fossil fuels and we end up where we are.¬†

I also blame the saudis, given what's going on in the world OPEC should increase production to at least stabilize prices.  They are shooting themselves in the foot as this causes volatility versus being able to sell $100 per barrel oil.

All this talk of a post fossil fuel world is premature.  As we are witnessing fossil fuels are the life blood of modern societies.  We use fertilizers from oil to grow our food, diesel to power the farm equipment, to move goods, to make goods, even to make electricity, to make plastics, etc.  What we will see is energy diversification but the move entirely away from oil is a ways off as we do not have an economically viable replacement most green energy is still snake oil at this point."
Thank you for clearing things up. Good reply!
Funny how gas goes up and poor people are even worse off but hey buy an electric car because you get a little bit of a tax incentive. Like you can afford that anyway. The US is a joke now.
"So if gasoline is called gas, what is gas called? When he‚Äôs talking about ‚Äúoil and gas‚Äù is he talking the oil and the gaseous stuff?"
"He's referring to all types of fossil fuels. The liquid fuels we use are refined from crude oil, but the literal gaseous stuff you're referring to is called natural gas and its mostly methane. We use it for heating our homes and for gas stoves among many other applications. ""The separation process already transpires as the fluid flows through the reservoir rocks until it reaches the well tubing. The process beginning at the wellhead extracts the composition of natural gas according to the type, depth, and location of the underground deposit and the geology of the area. Oil and natural gas are often found together in the same reservoir."""
In Other words California is a JOKE ü§£.
Blame Joe Biden
‚ÄúThe age of oil is near‚Äù. Lol.
"With the birth of the nuclear diamond battery the world will die. 

Reason: millions of years ago there was abundant co2 in the atmosphere. The plants thrived and pumped out massive amounts of o2. 
That o2 strengthened the ozone layer which is made of o3. And it shielded the earth a little too good. This created the ice ages. In these ice ages the snow and glaciers covered these immense forests of plants that produced massive amounts of o2. Sealing the carbon in the ground. 

Without that carbon for the plants, they will not be I thrive mode. They will not grow as big. And as a result they will not continue to produce massive amounts of o2. And will not strengthen the ozone layer. 

The ozone layer will over time continue to weaken. And heat up the planet to a point where we cannot live. 

We need to pump out these carbon deposits and burn them. Without them we will be doomed. What they have been telling you about co2 is a lie."
I'll tell you the reason in one pathetic word... BIDEN!
''iTs nOt ThE wAr''
Yeah it‚Äôs not definitely not the war they just sent 40 billion over there again! USA just having there way on us.
Just wait for one or two cold winters and electric heating failing to keep up and you will hear a loud clamor for oil and gas.
"They forgot to mention Brandon turnoff the pipelines from Alaska, Canada and Texas gulf."
"The cause? Really ?
Democrats !
Every Democrat since Jiminy Carter has done serious damage to America with their insane green agendas.
Let's go Brandon I agree !"
Excellent commentary of facts in a historical context.
I believe the that the lack of reinvestment is due to economic downturn rather than the end of fossil fuels.. but we will see how this video ages over the next 10 years.
Who will the silly liberals blame now if it is not the war...............is Trump still around...............they can blame him now!
Crap! Stopped watching a few minutes in. All of a sudden it‚Äôs the oil companies greed. From the moment that idiot got in office they‚Äôve been waging a war against fossil fuel. Manchin just called out the government on shutting down drilling/exploration. Get your head out of the sand.
Capitalism will destroy this planet for profits
"I‚Äôve been hearing that those unused permits aren‚Äôt because the companies don‚Äôt have the appetite to drill but because most of the permits are either small, unprofitable deposits in controversial locations or they require other permits for roads and pipelines that don‚Äôt get approved. 

Sure drill for oil but you aren‚Äôt allowed to take it anywhere. Hey why are you not drilling?"

"@paul munoz I'm completely hearing you.

All the dentists were trained and degreed here. We can do things about these situations, like buying an electric car as I have recently done."

"At the end of it, its politics that are hurting the common person.   Maybe if a fair market was forced (removal of all government funding and kickbacks for electric power, which isn't any cleaner when you trace it all the way through the supply chain) prices to the common person would decrease and stabilize again."
"Did you not even factor in the problems that constant government prattle about ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù, and constant threats from politicians that ‚Äúwe will end the fossil fuels market‚Äù make investors not want to invest in oil? Or that your fascination with ‚Äúrenewables‚Äù is a pipe dream? Or that BILLIONS of people will die by killing fossil fuels before renewables are even CLOSE to replacing them?"
yeah... that's why exxon's stock price is so low... why it's like it's about to go bankrupt.
The fact that you define global warming in quotations and as ‚Äúprattle‚Äù tells me all I need to know about you. Seethe.
Why is our government blaming the war
"I dont believe what this guy says. As soon as biden started with his magic pen gas prices in cali went up $2 a gallon almost instantly.  That blows everything he says out of the water. There might be some truth to it, but there are other factors at work here and thats democrats causing these problems."
"@Robert M Again, as soon as the took office it went up $2 in cali.  So what you said did not make any sense.  IF it would have taken say 8 months and slowly kept rising that would be one thing, but it not. As soon as the pipeline project was scrapped it was almost overnight. I filled my truck up in Texas diesel was 1.79 Nov 2020. I took a picture of it. It was like 2.39 In Cali at that time."
"It was 2.35 trumps last week. gasoline was actually high (given demand) in 2020, the pandemic slowdown just masked it."
Nothing about the US and UN banning Russia import?! Homie is SUS.
"So your persuasion technique is to 1) Talk at a difficult to understand awkward cadence (slur the important words, drag out the simple, basic words) and 2) Leave out inconvenient facts that don't fit your narrative, such as the role of US Government regulation of pipelines (Keystone et all) and permitting (frozen!).  Oh, and Russia.
Typical leftist rhetoric masquerading as documentary."
"American truckers are struggling with higher diesel pricers. So why is Biden sending 700,000 barrels of diesel fuel to Europe when it is desperately needed here? I know Biden said America will not be first (priority) but Biden‚Äôs job is to take care of America and Americans. If America is not first America will eventually become a third world country."
"I disagree, I don't think gas is going anywhere within the next 50 years. Renewable just isn't reliable enough yet. For every 2 electric vehicles sold in the US, 98 combustion vehicles are sold. They're cheap, reliable, and familiar, and there's just not enough demand on renewable energy, especially with the controversy that lithium mining comes with."
"@MrRjsnowden  The average trucking company can spend 70,000 per truck/year for diesel fuel, electric trucks eliminate that,  now multiply that by 100 trucks. That's 7 million a year. Even if the cost to recharge the batteries is half of what diesel cost that is still a 3.5 million dollars saving. You can buy a lot of trucks for 3.5 mil. 

They spend anywhere 75,000 to 200,000 for a new truck depending on needs and type. Long haul trucks(sleeper) are usually 150,000 and up.

Now figure in the cost of repairs and maintenance for a diesel motor oil changes antifreeze, oil filters, water separator filters for the diesel fuel, the savings   keep adding up.  Is it cost effective without having concrete figures it is hard to say exactly how much electric over diesel will save. But just on the fuel cost alone I would say it is cost effective."
@Tripe lmao. Don't like that we agree on energy independence?
@Himedo15 go away
@Tripe i agree. We should be energy independent. But we're not and we're not going to be with the current administration.

Manipulative bullshit.  Thats all this is.
Total BULLCRAP!
"Paying more, much more at the pump. Two words: Joe Biden!! PERIOD!!"

"FACT TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT =$1.99 A GALLON. FACT BIDEN SAID HE WAS GOING TO CUT OIL PRODUCTION =$5.00 A GALLON.
FACT UNDER TRUMP THE US WAS THE NUMBER 1 PRODUCER AND EXPORTER OF OIL."
Oil and the demand for it will ALWAYS be diminished only by the GREED of those peddling it. You can throw all the word salads you want at the situation but cutting off American supply hurt AMERICA.
Oh another problem that increasing taxes would help? Looks like prices will stay high forever folks!
wow i hate capitalism
"The heading should say (""It's not just the War"").  US has had it easy.  Europe is getting raped by fuel prices since March and gas as well."
Its the Oil companies
"I mean the actual oil left in Earth could keep us going for another couple hundred years at least, oil companies are just building capital for renewable projects. Artificial shortage with no solid plan or tech to replace oil with is just greed and stupidity at it's worst...."
"Thanks, so you taught a class on how to effectively spread propaganda.... cheers mate"
"So Biden and his administration was lying? 
That's unheard of."
"""Oil and Gas has found a new way to extract more money than ever"". No, that's 100% incorrect. Oil is a commodity whose price is determined by buyers and sellers, and what they BELIEVE will be the future availability. This price increase is from the number 1 oil producer, the US, being run by an old man with Dementia, and a party that wants to make Oil so expensive we end up spending more of our limited personal budgets on energy for some insane unproven theory that we are destroying the climate. I'm not sure why people have such a hard time doing just even a little research and coming to that reality, one that every Oil producing company will tell you, and you will ignore. The oil industry has done an amazing job, and found so much oil at affordable methods of extraction that short of Politicians making stupid decisions, Gas should never be above $4 a gallon. Stop blaming the oil producers, when the problem is always and will always be the US federal government sticking it's finger in the Oil industry's business, and causing the prices to crank up. The US could crush the oil market, flooding it with low profit making oil that OPEC would never be a problem, but our politicians get involved and stop an amazing US oil industry from bringing us low energy costs."
If they keep prices high they will force people to seek alternative fuel sources.  I'm okay with that.
"They‚Äôre only ‚Äúceding the market‚Äù because the current economic policies in place in the western world put them at a disadvantage. Forcing over a billion people to stop driving their cars isn‚Äôt going to work, especially when 350 million of them rely heavily on them to get anywhere.

I agree that society should be less car focused. I agree that, should cars remain we need a better energy source. Governments forcing oil companies out of the market by making it harder for them to turn profits isn‚Äôt the way to do that.

Hundreds of millions are going to suffer economic drought for years, potentially decades, just to convince them that green energy is better? The pushback will be devastating."
"I think a lot of people forget that much of the country doesn't live in a large city. For more rural and suburban areas outside of cities gasoline is still king. Public transportation isn't a thing and battery tech isn't good enough yet for electric to take over in these places. Plus, a good majority of people can't afford electric vehicles still, they can barely afford a gasoline vehicle from the last decade even. Going to completely renewable energy isn't going to happen within the next 20 years without putting many many people in hardship."
"So even though there's a lot of supply, the oil industry is like ""nah. Let people suffer. They'll pay whatever.""
That feels so scummy. Yet on the other hand.. ""it's just business"". Why invest in something that isn't worth it? That's understandable. Yet... this also proves just how scum they are to take advantage."
"Political strongarming of a bunch of CEO's would help this. If a certain orange man was around, he would be like, ""Get those meat heads in here, I want to know who is responsible for this shortage, what do they think they are doing? Not in my country! YOU, why arn't you making more oil for America?""

Then again, you do not have to be the POTUS to do that. Perhaps some protests outside corporate headquarters are in order."
We know why they got expensive.  Didn't need a video for that . What we need is a how are we going to bring it back down this dumb ass is not going to open up dometic drilling
"There is currently no replacement energy source for oil. hopefully the high price of oil will spur research to find a new resource of energy to replace oil as eventually oil will run out.
small Nuclear reactors might be the solution or something equivalent to that."
I‚Äôll save you some time. It‚Äôs the Arabs. That and the idiot Joe Biden but not allowing us to harvest our energy resources.
"new conspiracy
after realizing that independent business owners in the US were crippling the Global Mafia that is OPEC, globalists devised a plan to release a common respiratory virus and completely destroy the industry leaving them the come out on top again
and as usual big oil wins again"
imagine if someone decided to buy all of the worlds oil when it was negative. just simply becoming a billionaire from buying and not selling
So their doing artificial scarcity because they don‚Äôt want to invest more when renewables are taking over and it‚Äôs an unsafe investment.
So youre telling all of the conservatives its not Biden? They may become addicted to copium when they watch this.
"Lol fossil fuels are not going anywhere unless we find a more reliable and ready new fuel.  

Natural gas is a step up, cleaner than gasoline and cheaper/more dependable than wind and solar.

Nuclear is a obvious good source of power however radioactive waste is a problem.

Honestly I believe the future will hold a new discovery that will make combustion engines obsolete (think sci-fi)"
"Anyone Tell Biden This?

"Americans need to stop calling petrol and diesel, ‚Äúgas‚Äù. It‚Äôs confusing when you‚Äôre discussing fuels such as‚Ä¶ actual gas!"
"@Tyler Kozlow First of all, it's an issue that affects the whole world. And secondly, it's a platform that is watched worldwide. You're just proving a point that Americans can't think outside their own country's bubble."
I know right? Why would an American youtuber create a video about an issue in America and use words that Americans use?!
Democratic Party is entirely responsible.
Pipelines spill 3x more than rail transport.
*I blame Biden because I don't like Democrats*
Biden cutting production by not allowing drilling.  I saved you 20 minutes jagoffs
Well prices are up globally. I suppose you think he did that too?
"Well, for the whole video I was telling my self this guy is making a narrative and completely ignoring 1/2 the story on almost every event that happened.   Then to your credit, you admitted you were doing so intentionally at the end of the video.  Only stupid people will be convinced of your narrative. The problem is, there is a bunch of stupid people that can't realize when wool is being pulled over their eyes.  Tough you are correct that the war could have little to do with oil price. But it has taken a larger impact than needed due to political decisions."

"you had me until you said producers don't have the appetite to drill. that is an outright lie. i know some of them personally, and they DO have the appetite. but are prevented. you're spewing the talking points from the White House. about these unused drilling permits. a drilling permit does not mean that there is enough oil below the land to drill in a cost effective way. with prices so high, there is another factor. government regulation. i.e., Joe Biden."
"@ 17:25 ‚Ä¶.. ‚Äú9,000 approved sites to drill, they just don‚Äôt have the appetite.‚Äù  This is incorrect. They have the appetite to drill. But you wouldn‚Äôt drill in a spot with no oil. Those 9,000 spots do not have any oil underlying the area. They can do LYDAR scanning an determine this before ever breaking ground. Our current administration will not approve drilling in sites where there is underlying oil."
Thanks Biden!!!!!!
in 2020 this wall street people gutted hard on the oil future market when they saw one of the Chinese bank went all in. they made billions but also made a lot of people lost everything in Asia.

"When the price of oil fluctuated by +\- hundreds of percent, how is it possible that the cost of refining oil into gas represents a certain % of the price? It would imply the unrefined cost fluctuates accordingly with the price which cannot be true."
"That confused me a little as well, but considering he said average a couple times in there I'm assuming it's either the average over some time frame or what it looks like at present day."
I really appreciate this non-political view of the crude oil market. It's pretty rare to see this kind of detailed research in 2022.
"It's totally political, it's ignoring the fact that biden's policies directly caused the hike."
The cost of energy is so high because Democrat policies are working. This is by design.
"Mostly good info here.  The problem with the current gas price increases is they have absolutely nothing due with supply\demand or any increases in costs including input materials or transportation in the US.  The large refineries have pre-negotiated contracts that span for up to 18 months.  The large transportation companies like the large national trucking companies and the airlines have the same kind of pre-negotiated contracts for fuel.  So when you hear the MSM over hyped hysteria headlines for the cost of ""oil"", ""jet fuel"" and ""diesel"", it only affects the average person and small companies buying the product, not the large ones.  The large ones will not see their costs go up for months.  Even when they do see their costs go up eventually, they're no where near what the MSM hyped hysteria says they are.  Worth noting is the prices being reported by the MSM are for the ""Spot"" market, meaning for delivery in 4-6 weeks which again, most refineries don't buy on the ""Spot"" market.  Also, over 5 million bpd of US domestically produced crude oil is sold\exported to other countries.  So there is no ""real"" supply problem in the US.  Simple put, the price at the pump is high and going higher because the refineries and retailers can charge these prices and 'Merican's will keep using it like it's going out of style."
Prices drop before midterms. Mark my words...
"That still seems to side-step the logistical problem of oil sustainability. 

They can charge the prices but that still includes having to ensure their shareholders and congresspeople are happy and that people are willing to do these jobs. Whatever price increases happen, wherever it happens in the chain ‚Äî it‚Äôs still going to be felt by consumers who are using more and more and will through the summer. The U.S. reserve hasn‚Äôt been as low as it‚Äôs been since the 70s I believe. So I disagree with that assessment mostly because the mention of supply and demand argument is not without merit. And as mentioned: the geological and transport implications still apply."
It's the leftist criminals shutting down the industry in the USA. They have tied down the energy industry
"What are you talking about? The industry here doesn't want to produce, because they don't get as much profit."
WOW. I had no idea that more than 900 drilling permits were not used. What then is the point of opening offshore drilling? A political statement?
"Video's question : Why Gas Got So Expensive?
Simple answer : some rich guy somewhere wants a new yacht."
"Who produced this? Who paid for it? How about doing some research as the actual cost of production of a gallon of gas or Diesel. The cost of fuel here skyrocketed as soon as the socialist in charge attacked the pipeline and drilling industry. AND the fields in North Dakota are still drilling I had a conversation with a driver who hauls material into ND last weekend. The price is entirely controlled by the global market which is controlled, for the most part by OPEC and none of them are the friends of the ‚ÄúWestern democracies‚Äù About 20 years ago a neighbor in central AK who had recently retired from Alyeska, told me that cost of a gallon of diesel fuel out of the refinery at Fairbanks AK, which furnished fuel for the company trucks ect, was 5 CENTS a gallon. But they were not selling themselves the oil at OPEC prices. They were using THEIR oil to make THEIR diesel. Was he lying? I doubt it, why would he. Was he ill informed? I doubt that too. Electric cars? If you live in the North they can be a death trap if you get stuck for 3-5 hours on some mountain pass due to a vehicle pileup with no way to get off the pass once blocked in by traffic. Temp below zero, how long will the heat last? Happens within 10-15 miles of me pretty often. Several times last winter. 3-4 hours to cover 5-10 miles. Finally late at night and very cold when the traffic finally starts running. Nor is there now or likely to be large numbers of electric cars since there is not enough electricity in the West to run industry and housing with California likely going brown or rolling blackouts again if they switch heavily to battery powered cars. It will not work for trains or farm equipment or trucks hauling your food thousands of miles since all of these frequently run in schedule and for famers and truckers sometimes it gets REALLY tight with no time for dead batteries. AND the cars are not the primary source of particulate poplution right now anyway. The PROBLEM in the US is not supply. Its the ability to REFINE the oil. The ‚Äúgreens‚Äù fight new refinery production, and almost anything else that might be pro-capitalism, tooth and nail. Even when its highly beneficial to the populace in the area. Health and safety wise. But the greens only care about one thing, their socialist/communist agenda. Yeah I have trust issues here. There are some it seems that there are some things stated that seen to contradict other things stated. But thats typical."
"Cool story, but you seem out of tune with the average person. The average person won‚Äôt be able to switch to renewable any time soon as it‚Äôs expensive and this only makes them more tight on money"
"@Jonathan Guez and lose all their investments? Either way some did start dipping their toes in the market.

And renewables aren't that costly especially if they're subsidized like oil was."
"He completely brushed by that point. If renewables were more profitable and effective, then the oil companies would switch to it."
"Let me sum it up in one word. ""BIDEN"""
Then why did it start in 2020?
Could have used that 40 billion we gave to Ukraine
Could have used that 6+ trillion we gave to the ultra rich.
"Bad Management in Canada ‚Äòs policy:

Why sell the crude oil $30. per barrel (50 gallons drum) to USA.

After  USA refine the oil,  sell it back to Canada for 100 times as much,

not 100% as much,  but 100 times more !

(According selling $10 to $30  per 50 gallons drum. )to USA.

Don‚Äôt believe that green peace party protests about pollution,

these people are rich and they are not care about how much the gas cost, 

their pension is twice as much as your two jobs combined.

Of course any kind of mining are dirty and with pollution,

might as well leave the gold in the ground and stay poor.

One solution is to have our own refinery, as Middle East

canada will be our own boss."
"Vote out Biden, and vote in Trump and I can GUARANTEE you gas goes way down. I know I know, every excuse in the book. But if you do it, come back to this comment and see how gas goes down. I get that there are factors outside of the presidents control, but Biden has purposely made this worse. Here in AZ gas WAS 2.49, and is currently 4.99-5.49. It SHOULD be 3.49ish. So higher, but not this stupid double+ garbage.

Go ahead and rip me in the comments. I don't care. Mean tweets + a roaring economy, no inflation, cheap gas, and no wars is more than a fine tradeoff."
"You can almost double those prices in Britain. Around ¬£8.50 per gallon (~$10.65) is the price of Diesel, near to where I live. In some places it's more expensive than that."
"""One last oil great rally""..."
"""Acrosst"" is not a word and never start a sentence with ""Myself"""
U  get too greedy  the world goes into  a major depression asap just saying
"soon, which is hard to believe given the current status quo."
"Everyone knows already- it‚Äôs not rocket science. Gas was 1.50 a gallon a month before Biden went into office. Once in office, he cancels the key stone pipeline- gas jumped 1dollar a gallon and kept climbing- now, this morning, gas is 4.49 a gallon. It‚Äôs all driven by the so-called ‚Äúelite‚Äôs‚Äù, fleecing Americans"
"Thanks Biden and his cronies,"
Of course it's to fund the war! Nice try!
Was accurate up until 2020.  Didn't mention anything what Joe Biden has done to restrict drilling and canceling the Keystone pipeline causing the oil prices to dramatically go up from $2.15 national average in 2020 to over $4 before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Why would leave that out??  Have some agenda or just trying to cover for Joe Biden?
"Biden, Biden, Biden is the reason Petro, gas prices
Are so high. The cost $

BEING CONNED BY HIM!
"6:25 ""A stratospheric price tag... inflation-adjusted 5.5 billion dollars"" in other words, less than 1 tenth of what the United States alone has spent in Ukraine"
Gas prices are so expensive because the Biden Administration is very weak and Putin can do whatever he wants.
"Horrible takes here. Oil going negative didn't happen in a vacuum. This was an engineered crisis, and not by oil industry. Also, oil isn't going anywhere. You might not get to drive anymore, but oil is here to stay forever. Just not for you, because you aren't considered essential."
"Sure it'll be here, but relative to now it's going away whether you like it or not. This is peak demand. Oil companies are hastening it by keeping prices high. Russia is doing its part by incentivizing all of Europe to look for temporary alternatives, and long term solutions to move away from oil."
You think you‚Äôre the smartest guy in every room don‚Äôt you ü§£

"Great job not mentioning:
- lockdowns and supply chain problems
- FED printing at 5x speed causing massive hyperinflation
- Biden killing pipelines"
"I feel like going from saying, ""The oil industry has a flooded market and is changing,"" to ""the industry is hurting from different green technologies, "" is a huge jump between topics. I understand the correlation but just because something correlates doesn't mean it causes it. If it is truly the case I'd like to see more evidence showing a drop of dependence of oil and gas (at least for this topic) for electricity."
"Why? Aside from oil as used in plastics/lubrication etc, they are directly competing industries. Power generation and consumer vehicles are pretty big industries. I doubt many other factors could be much more prominent."
"I don't think the point is that the industry is hurting from a drop in demand /now/. The demand is projected to keep growing in the coming years. Still, the renewable takeover is looming on the horizon (I hope), so I understand why they would want to take the pandemic price drop as a turning point, since they're now having to deal with multiple uncertainties."
"The video does not intend to be a comprehensive summary of the science, it may be a bit out of scope to delve into that"
I run on pure ethanol couldn‚Äôt be happier rn
Thank you for your work!
"Keep thinking that. Shutting down the pipeline, shutting down drilling on federal land, and NOW canceling oil leases absolutely will  increase cost. WE just need to stop sending our fuel ANYWHERE. Drilled in the US....STAYS in the US. Now we DONT need a line that crosses the US, delivering to a 70+ year old refinery. Welding is WORK not JOBS. BUILD a new refinery in North Dakota. There isnt shit there and the pipe line would be shorter. Better for the environment, creates JOBS at the refinery, and the US and Canada can make a deal."
"I find the thinking here fairly accurate but from an entirely American point of view. American oil is nowhere near as influential as Americans would like to think it is. OPEC, which includes Russia by the way, is firmly controlling oil supply and therefore prices. The US government has been running all over the world begging other nations to increase production to help supply American demand. But the USA is hated so much in the rest of the world that they have, so far, all refused! The American hegemony over the world is coming to an end and America is slipping into it's new role as a second rate third world country. Or possibly several smaller countries if the US breaks up."
"You're leaving out the major driver behind oil going negative: lockdowns. When people stopped using oil, demand fell out. Oil companies have realized that their market is not immune to the whims of government, and with government largely working in concert on a global scale. To industry, government mandates like this represent 'black swans', impossible to predict existential events. Now that the governments of the world have demonstrated a willingness to obliterate oil demand at will, and are actually working on WHO based mechanisms for globally united hard mandates in response to future pandemics, the risk associated with massive investments are not covered by either financial or sociological responsibilities. Combining this with elections which confirm politicians who outright campaign on 'ending fossil fuels' ensures that no further investments are feasible. If we want to move off of fossil fuels we must do so after having a replacement strategy, not before. Given a sufficient alternative it will be unlikely that a government effort would be required to convince consumers to switch anyway. In the end, as always, it boils down to a government created crisis. Government controlling industry has been the single most prevalent source of failure, and hindrance to quality of life, across all industries and countries. Much as we had a separation of church and state, to prevent the government from using religion as leverage for authoritarian gain, so we need a separation of industry and state. This is the only true way to let markets function effectively, keep money out of politics, and fend off corruption and a new rise of authoritarianism."
Well said sir.
"I said something similar 3 days ago, triggered the nanny bot, and my comment doesn't show up unless I'm logged in. Glad your comment got through. I probably included too many keywords like the place of origin of a certain thing related to lockdowns. Hooray for the ministry of truth"

"Venezuela, Scotland, Iraq, Nigeria...etc. All these places have 1 thing in common. They're all foreign nations! We here in the U.S. have the opportunity to supply ourselves with fuel. But instead of tapping into the natural resources we have here at home our politicians much rather get in bed with OPEC because their families owe them favors. They much rather ban fracking under the guise of ""environmental protection"" while at the same time purchasing oil from non-environmental friendly places. The cost of gas is so expensive because corrupt politicians get kick backs from their buddies in OPEC and would sell all of us up shits creek for a buck."
What will happen to gasoline when EV‚Äôs are the mode of transportation and ICE cars are no longer on the market?

You pronounced Azerbaijan wrong
TLDR: gas prices are directly associated with Biden's first day in office canceling the expansion of the Keystone pipeline.
Why did Trump do away with gas mileage standards for car makers in 2017? We are using 70% more now than on that day.
"What ‚Äúscarcity‚Äù are you talking about?   The singular reason gas prices are so high is because of criminal Biden‚Äôs corrupt energy policy and shutting down US pipelines forcing the US to start importing oil again.  And even then, only about 10% of us oil is imported.  Rennet 4 years ago when the US was completely energy self sufficient and we stopped importing oil at all under the previous administration?  Gas prices were at a decades low, and had recovered from Biden‚Äôs previous stint as Vice President where he was also in charge of energy relations with eastern Russia and the Ikraine and had caused gas prices to hit records high back then‚Ä¶.  The common thread is Biden‚Äôs corruption."
Let's Go Brandon!

A tractor burns through roughly a liter of diesel every 15HP it has per hour. And there is simply no battery tech that can output 150HP for 8-10h a day.

Your power bill will get more expensive. So does your fuel costs, food and every basic need. Untill you can no longer afford to live.

"There are so many pieces of the ""renewable energy"" argument that no one chooses to discuss that one can begin almost anywhere.  Germany has been in the grips of the Greens to the point where they shut down their nuclear (and while it may be aging, simply going cold turkey - to mix some metaphors - has come home to roost); finally realizing the Russia is a loose cannon on the deck has put them in a serious hurt.  

If one stands back, the race to EVs is amusing.  Little is said, for example, of the fact that about 50% of people who have leased EVs and hybrids shift back to gasoline for their next vehicle; and while the Far Left is insisting that somewhere around 2025 to 2030 (or whatever number they choose to bandy about) we will all be in EVs of one breed or another, they are ignoring massive issues and costs to get there.  Meanwhile we have three grids, not particularly well connected to deliver electricity, grids which are in need of maintenance which is of uncertain timing and cost, and which cannot provide the demand presently, summer being a prime example of when the brownouts and blackouts start.  And even assuming that could be addressed, short of going to nuclear, we have no means of providing the increased demand Evs will make.  California, with about 4.5% of vehicles being plug-ins has requested (not yet mandated) that the not be charged between 5 and 9 p.m.  Their network of delivery of electricity would collapse well before hitting 25% plug ins of all vehicles.

Between demand for far more electric power than we now generate and the likelihood that the public simply will not comply with a complete shift to EVs is going to make for some interesting times in the next 20 to 50 years."
allways begging for money
"Gas prices were cheaper when Trump was president. When he was in office, the national average never went above 3 bucks a gallon. Now look at Biden and his failing presidency. National average for gas now is $4.50."
"The us government makes as much money off oil as the oil companies , joe Biden caused this by basically canceling domestic production on day one"
BS
Biden‚Äôs campaign promises to end fracking and fossil fuels also helped people decide to stop reinventing
Oil just feels like a dirty business that mobsters would be apart of.
Oil won‚Äôt be going away anytime soon. Many of these projected EV adoption rates are way too optimistic
Joe Biden‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Period
"Not all of those 9000 leases are usable and typically take years to develop into new oil producing sites. They're leases that let oil companies search for oil in those areas. Factor that with an administration that's openly hostile to the oil industry and makes major policy changes on a whim (like shutting down Keystone XL immediately after gaining control -- Warren Buffet was no doubt pleased with what he got for his political contributions), and there's little reason for those companies to gamble on unproven leases.

Oil investment is stagnant because the friends of the WEF are actively throwing the market into chaos and unpredictability. They're using ESG scores to manipulate financing availability for oil companies. The WEF's politicians actively use policy to throw the market into chaos. They want to make petroleum artificially expensive through policy, limited or expensive financing, and playing the speculators in order to drive the price artificially high. All while they haven't come close to finding EV tech that's actually a viable alternative for anything other than sedans and subcompact SUV's in only certain markets. Oh and 75+% of the US electrical grid cannot handle the power demand of a massive conversion from ICE to EV... while the same anti-petroleum billionaires are also pushing to shut down reliable base load power plants or are replacing them with natural gas electric generation plants that will drive heating costs for hundreds of millions of Americans sky-high."
Time to nationalize the oil companies. Even Adam Smith would agree.
Just buy an EV. Don‚Äôt missing paying $80 at the pump one bit.
shirley nothing to do with shutting down our oil production right?
I heard an oil guy say that of those 9000 unused permits all but 300 were for exploratory drilling sites that turned out to be no good (which is why they're unused). He says they have thousands of more permit applications in that are being sat on by DC Greens and they would love to increase production to get a larger share of the OPEC peg.
"@Dale Betterton I never said anything about prices, but what you said would make sense if there was a shortage of drilling permits and the industry had an appetite for production. However the opposite is true, and federal lands only make up a small fraction of the oil drilling production in the country, so the impact would be inconsequential."
@Random Person Markets are forward looking. When you restrict future production it impacts prices NOW.
"@david leonard I mean most of what that person said about leasing is correct and easily verifiable, acting incredulous about it doesn't change the fact. You can be against the moratorium on leases on federal land, but there's little evidence to suggest it is holding back production that's already been slowed down with the many unused permits they're currently sitting on."
"Oil isn't going away, it has so many uses beyond burning it for energy."
"It's politically motivated to depress economies until conservatives are in office, because conservatives wont trend toward renewables and energy independence. They'll settle for lower oil/gas prices that boost economy from that point."
oil company CEO's needed more profits to give their paid GOP Congress members their BRIBES.
"This video is nothing but a propaganda buck of bullsheet.  Already been proven that oil reserves will last way longer than what this ""BS video"" suggests."
No it‚Äôs not bc of the war. It‚Äôs plain politics. There‚Äôs a democrat back in office so ofc inflation has skyrocketed and the economy sucks. Stop voting for jackass democrats üê¥
"Oil is NOT killing the planet.

That‚Äôs the ultimate in stupidity‚Ä¶..

So their concept is to increase the price of things we already can‚Äôt afford‚Ä¶ to help us afford it‚Ä¶.. That is insane."
"UK ""we're going to invest billions into renewables"".

Reality then hits, the wind doesn't blow and natural gas usage reaches record levels as the amount of potential wind power also hits record levels but sits idle as nature laughs and says ""no wind for you""."
As a normal retired person with a fixed income I wonder where it will end for us.  I can't afford to buy an EV and also can't afford to drive anywhere except to the grocery store so the future seems to become a very dark and scary place and death will be a welcomed sight to some people.  I never would have thought it would come to this and the young people are so screwed~!!
"Honestly this alone is a great reason why cities need to either step up their public transportation game or start making the effort of making their spaces more ""walkable"".

"I wonder what policy we set for oil companies to do that smh, hmm I forgot what year our government want to go full green ? Yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs forced alright."
Because Big Oil is Greedy
Anyone who doesn't know why gasoline is expensive is an idiot. Including the producer of this video. Biden-haris polycies.
Biden is the reason we have high gas prices!
The US has 300 - 400 years of oil easily
"Just not getting Azerbaijan takes up the most of this story.  Seems you could leave this out and nothing would change on why the gas prices are at the level they are now. Isn't the fact that the oil companies especially in America gave in and invested in Alternative energies and are not willing to put capital into expanding to market to demand.    Biden has no sway with OPEC as he is not feared and is a bubbling idiot which has been the solution President to President made up until Osama who just did nothing, but things expanded anyway, and Trump who released the Kraken on suppression. on US Corporate profits.  I wonder what profits Oil Companies are making on Alternative energy?"
This video is BS. If you want to know why the gas price is so  high look no further than the Biden administration.
It's the war.
Why are they not looking to invest in more production? Because the EV market in EU and China have now stopped demand from growing. The demand is only going to go in one direction from this point forward. With EV sales doubling their market share every year now the industry knows its only a matter of time before they are going to catch a falling knife. 2 million bl a day in over supply can turn 70% of the global reserves into stranded assets over night.
But biden blamed putin.
government permission to install a door frame?
All I got out of this entire video is humans are greedy and they are seeing the world's push toward electric  cars (which nowhere on earth can we sustain the electricity required to make thst switch 100%) so they are not investing in the future of oil and gas instead they are just raking in profits so they can call it quits and live lavish lives rich af
are we selling europe diesel? YES...10 dollars a gallon...coming here
you mean it's not just the war. It's ignorance to say that russias war had nothing to do with high prices.
end up president again.
What we have here is tree hugger propaganda.
"I work in the industry and trade in it as well. You schooling has seemed to pay off, in regards to attempts at persuasion. As with any attempt such as this, it requires a considerable amount of factual information, especially historical. This way you can add or subtract information under the guise of whatever the narrative is.   While it is true that the oil industry, if left to it's own devices,  will seek maximum profit with limited expenditures, you ""forget"" to explain this is not how it works. Our government dictates how much leash the oil industry gets. Depending on the narrative of the administration, will depend on the type and amount of control leveraged against the oil industry. This leverage is to control the industry within a channel. Now if the administration wants lower oil prices, then policies are adopted that direct pricing in that direction. Same is true of the opposite. Current prices are representative of policies, being exerted on the industry to maintain the desired result, or narrative. 
So your neat little box, seems to make sense of situation, if you never leave the box..."
"I don't like to be persuaded
Now I think all you said was a lie than facts"
"so, it went up because of market speculation?"
Is because electric cars are the new thing so government and companys like Tesla came out with this beautiful idea of making gas go really high so that people has no other choice but to buy their electric vehicles like biden said by 2030 I will make america fully electric so that's why this is happening
"this is propaganda. the reason is the global warming nuts and russian propaganda. there is no oil shortage. 20 years ago in my home state of WV. they did geo surveys and in the surrounding areas. it was stated that we were sitting on 210 million years of shale oil and gas. so much so that for the last twenty i have watched drilling rigs and gas rigs pop up every where here and in PA and eastern OH. of course that stopped when the eco mob's buddy biden got elected in november of 2020. gasoline has also almost doubled in price thanks to him, not the war in the ukraine."
For California It‚Äôs cheaper to ship oil from the Middle East then it is by train from North Dakota or Texas?
Awesome video
"Ok so for anyone that actually paid attention through the entire 22 minutes video, what's the reason gas is now $5/gallon in the US?"
osama bin laden
Oil companies are keeping supply low intentionally to keep the prices high so if there is another market crash they don't lose their asses again. They aren't investing in new drilling projects because there isn't a guarantee that they will make money. So they are saving their money and reporting it as profits while we pay more for less supply.
I remember them saying the same thing in 2008. So tell me again why Key Stone was not finished because you made it seem like pipelines are the safest way to go. And would Key Stone take power away from OPEC

"Ironically, the day Biden was sworn in office as president having destroyed the keystone pipeline, the gas prices began it‚Äôs climb. It‚Äôs not complicated. It‚Äôs simple Supply & Demand. Democrats destroy supply all the time, and prices ALWAYS go up."
"Dude it is LITERALLY because of the war . If you mean gas going from 3$ to 5$ . THAT was the war . We don‚Äôt get much oil from Russia , but Europe does . And if their oil market is affected so is ours . This is LITERALLY BECAUSE of the war and nothing else ."
We need to price fix on OIL $80 a barrel. We need to stop taxing OIL as we get enough tax revenue after the pump. Limit Market share in each State to 1/8th. Stop Subsidizing any part of the energy sector.  Clearly pipes cost less than rail and tankers and should be our first choice.  $2 a gallon at the pump should be the norm it is good for business.
Biden did that.
"At the end of the day, Americans vote their wallets and Biden is relentlessly blamed for these high ass prices. In other bye bye Biden. I just hope that lump of orange shit don‚Äôt end up president again."
There is no renewable alternative to feed 11 billion people.

"its diesel. they know big companies need diesel and they know they will buy it. construction equipment, truckers, garbage trucks, trains, gas its just collateral"
We will never see gas prices go backwards the new norm will be over 5$ gallon.
When Biden said that he shut down the carbon neutral keystone pipeline because of global warming I knew we were in trouble.  Then relying on totalitarian governments to supply our oil what could go wrong with that!
What if it then? I don't have the time to watch this
It‚Äôs literally 20 min just watch it in 1.5x speed and it‚Äôs even shorter

"Interesting take but the end sways way off course. Renewables, with today's technology, will never come close to meeting the world's energy demands. The days of fossil fuels is far from over"

WELL ! I have to complain about that so he can correct what he's saying."
"As an oil worker, great video. Also funny to see the proclaim death of oil as decades before. it's probably just as likely as this boom lasting forever."
"Right... People seem to conflate renewable with indefinite. But all of these renewables will need to be replaced every 10-20 years.

 That will require energy. Those calories will come from fossil fuels. For good or bad this stuff is with us until it runs out. 

Hopefully by then we figured out a replacement energy source and carbon capture."
Nobody going to mention how he says Azerbaijan?
"Nice propaganda piece. Those 9,000 leases are mostly not profitable. Biden just cancelled another MASSIVE land lease of millions of acres for oil and gas drilling in Alaska. STOP MISINFORMING AND LYING TO YOUR VIEWERS."
"Over what time frame? Almost no alternative heavy equipment exist, or transport trucks, or refueling stations for the larger capacity batteries a fleet like this will require.  Not to mention farming equipment.  The time frame is a decade, if not decades."
"for the (love of) money, is the root of evrry evil - 1 Timothy 6:10.  like Lucifer, his human servants are addicted to power over humanity."
So it's everyone's fault but Biden's... cool story bro
A persuasive essay mean it's an opinion piece. Get on board with renewables... just get a $56k tesla everyone and you will be fine.
Profit gouging plain and simple greedy corpsrat pocket stuffers.
"So, it isn‚Äôt the presidents fault?"
I believe that Trump would figure out how to control the prices for us
I believe that a giant unicorn 50 billion light years away is eating a purple tangerine. I guess we both have some pretty stupid beliefs
"Everything goes up when democrats take over ,that's what they do"
Negative oil as a paradigm shift in investment was the best part of this. COVID may have saved the planet.
One person by the name Joe Biden and his dumb ass ideas made oil prices go up.
"It's not the war, it's our braindead presidential cabinet sitting in the white house."
now what does this mean for saudi princes
What a shock that yet again the problem for the average consumer is just the rich and powerful deciding they want to squeeze more out of the common person because ‚Äúfuck it we can‚Äù.  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"""Three decades ago"" ""End of august, 1991"" Ah... right. 3 decades ago doesn't mean the 70s anymore"
Um...so are you saying Biden didn't run up gas prices all over the world?  'Cuz people on Facebook keep saying that.
Last part was a bit of speculation/opinion. Renewable energy technology is not affordable nor effective enough to latch on to the middle class American. Until then fossil fuels will alway remain dominant
"Renewables as much as I like the idea isn't going to be able to be the main source.  This, is just another move for oil firms to keep higher prices, higher salaries and higher profits until .... that comes to the end where they can't do that any more.  This can come from national mandates, global mandates, price controls, legal moves, salary controls, federalization, globalization, etc.  This will force them to start to produce again because it will be at x percentage and y prices.  It's more to the point they have had a gun to the worlds head and when breaks come to break; the gun will be at their heads.  Saying that, it will take about six months to a year for a full gear up to what the production levels should be at.  Now, what I think will happen is everything with grind to a halt!  No fuel, no travel, no food production to starvation.  This is the likely outcome of the present strategy."
"That is what the strategic reserves are for.  Many more people will have gardens to grow their own food., bake their own bread from wheat grains they crushed themselves.  Like medieval Europe.  Them suckers lived and they had BEER too."
That‚Äôs what happens when you cut off leases on federal property and stop keystone pipeline thanks sleepy Joe
This is propaganda

"Personally, without doing any research feel there is tonnes of supply to reach current demand at the moment, and that is without counting fracking and northern pipeline, since new huge discoveries have been brought online recently by Exxon that cost less per barrel"
I tried explaining this to a few people and they blame it on the preaident and that single pipeline. Im really into economics so i know whats really going on. Im not some special person but omg i hate that if gas is expensive no matter whos fault it is(gas companies usually) they blame the president in the USA. I just twll them that if they dont like it to go pay 10 Euro for a liter of petrol ü§£
"freight is not paying more to small trucking companies...

I haven‚Äôt watched the video yet but my first guess: Planes?
Interesting until the obvious bias and leaps of faith were employed. Nice try though
it's late stage capitalism
"The truth is large oil companies have bought up the equipment independents in shale fields use to keep them from drilling new wells. Effectively making sure they can not affect the price ever again. 
Drilling rigs are impossible to find, they are being cut up for scrap."
"@Wyatt Best ask them if the equipment they need or want is available to them. 
In Texas various yards have equipment sitting in them but there is a shortage of equipment to purchase or lease."
I live in Wyoming; my friends and neighbors work for the independents. I'd love to hear more about this.

So basically....DEMOCRATS?....Thanx for clearing that up for us!
"In other words, the greedy oil industry is why oil is so expensive, not administrative policy. It is possible that both politics and greedy oil are to blame."
The reason starts with B and ends with N.
This is about 50% of an accurate picture of what's going on.
"@kathrynck Thank you for elaborating, I appreciate that."
"@Jeffrey Kregel Keystone pipeline canceled. Some assorted elements of 'green new deal' ideas have put roadblocks on increasing US oil production. Some european countries really over-extended on highly optimistic estimates of the availability and output of renewables. US not granting drilling leases for new wells for like a year now. Just a general assortment of things which could be called an environmentally minded excess of optimism.

But the largest factor, inflation. As well as a biproduct of that, also erosion of faith in the US petro dollar.

All of these are more ""political"" than what's in the video though. So if they were trying to avoid 'being political' with the video, then it's a good summary of 'everything else' which is going on with oil. It's a good video, it just tip toes around some of the issues involved.

Also, a senate sub-committee passed ""NOPEC"" as well... Now that's far from making it law, but it forwards the bill to be available to vote on in the senate. After which it would go to the house, etc. BUT, the nature of NOPEC could have a Huge impact on the price of oil later this year, depending on what happens with that bill. Specifically, the further NOPEC goes in congress, the higher the price of oil will get.

Mind you there's a nice sentiment behind NOPEC, but it's devoid of realism. And you can't legislate-away foreign collecting bargaining groups. It's just a gross misunderstanding of who's holding the cards, and where jurisdictions lay.

Basically, I don't think we're anywhere near the peak of this crisis yet. Too much bad timing, bad luck, and bad ideas snowballing into it still. And the price of oil has been artificially lowered (briefly) by drawing down the US oil reserve. So I mean, that somewhat obscures and/or blunts the edge of the problem, but that also means you have less emergency stash to work with if you really need it.

Frankly food is going to be worse though..."
"Can you elaborate on that, what is the other 50%"
if the Western countries do not want to buy energy resources in Russia should blame their own government.
"This video fails to mention the real reason why gas got so expensive. Under President Trump, gas prices was cheap, and America for the very first time was energy independent. When Biden cheated his way into presidency, on the very first day, Biden cancelled the Keystone Pipelines, which single handed ended America independence, and that caused gas prices to double. KEYSTONE PIPELINES is the main reason why America has high gas prices!!!"
Wasn't expecting to hear the name of my country üá¶üáø
"So, the real reason gas prices are insanely high is because oil execs are all a bunch of greedy corrupt pieces of subhuman garbage, who's only care in the world is how much money they can line their pockets with? You don't say!

Joking aside, I really appreciate this video essay. I learned a lot, and it was very well researched and well paced. A lot of the information was new to me, and I think you've made the world a richer place with this video. Cheers!"
Cheap fuel you guys have our fuel/Gas is like over  $10 us dollars in Australia.
So in short... BIG OIL... Has a position where they have all the money & control the world. Really.... and who in the world doesn't know this?
BIDEN
No
"Oil isn't going away. Even while the Dems/global warmists are trying to end gasoline vehicles, the batteries and plastics in the EVs still need petroleum to produce them."
Biden must have paid Wendover Productions for this video.  So it's just a coincidence that fuel prices started going up as soon as he was elected?
"Your inflictions and cadence need work. I'm hearing too much lead up and drop of your tone within one sentence, let alone a paragraph, or a full essay."

"ah yes the oil lines from russia get cut off due to the war ""not the war"""
So OPEC and other western oil fracters cut back on production in order to elevate oil prices because renewables are threatening to the market. They want to maximize money instead of investing in capital. Investors are not confident in them either
"Tell the Biden White House to stop the WAR on North American energy, and we'll be good."
"It's not so much the producers as it is the gas stations. Oil has pulled back from its highs, yet gas prices have remained steady, and even drifted higher. They can keep playing if they want. My next vehicle will be an EV."

"Three words:  Lets Go Brandon!    I don't blame companies not investing in oil/gas (WHICH WE NEED in the US), when Biden's entire administration is blinded by the ""green fantasy"".

HOME heating oil is $6.00/gallon, it was $2.18 a year ago!"
WRONG! One day two years ago isn‚Äôt responsible for high gas. The war is one reason. Shutting down pipelines is another. Biden is the main reason although ppl like to say the President doesnt have any control over oil prices. Biden put most of the reasons in motion. His weakness in handling Russia is another.
"Most expensive pipeline ever was $600 a foot, and mile is 5280 ft, $1 billion a mild be $189,000 a foot"

He stopped the Keystone pipeline for his buddies that on the train service and the Trucking service of that oil Joe Biden made America rely on other countries when he took office America imported zero oil we actually exported

"get your facts straight. , behind only Texas and North Dakota. In the 20th century, California's oil industry grew to become the state's number one GDP export and one of the most profitable industries in the region."
No has nothing to do with oil prices today
Not the war. Oil companies want fascists to win.
"No shit, it‚Äôs NOT THE WAR.  ITS BIDEN and his policies and his cronies.  They need to be impeached, but never will.  He‚Äôs killing the US.  RECORD inflation, gas, crime, border crossings.  A debacle in Afghanistan and stupid policies thinking they will stop Russia.  His involvement with his sons shadiness, and poor foreign relations. This is the short version.

"Oil ain‚Äôt going anywhere , renewables are not strong enough yet to sustain the world üåé"
I heard no talk of the ESG rules... Probably a bigger factor then you are giving it credit
It's interesting that not once was mentioned oil is bought on speculation its not the price it costs to pump transport and refine it is on what the replacement cost is estimated at its a commodity and this latest surge in price can be tracked down to the first 60 days in office for Biden where he stopped new fracking and exploration on public lands and the xl pipeline which increased the speculated future price and further passing of the green new deal drove it some more this seems like one of those save the planet videos where the solution destroys it in a different way.

"America was energy independent in 2019. Democrats took over in 2020, signed or rescinded 13 executive orders and you see that massive cliff on all of these graphics.

"Interesting information up to the point where he started spouting his ""renewable energy"" agenda. What do you think could have caused the sudden low demand of oil, and the high demand of ""renewables"" that he mentions? Could it possibly be the world's politicians shutting down the economy in reaction to a manufactured chinese virus? Could the ""demand"" for ""renewables"" perhaps be propped up by billions of tax money being funneled into certain pork programs? Even with Opec in the mix, the free market gave consumers a cheap, plentiful source of energy. It was the meddling politicians who screwed it all up in favor of ""renewables"" that require fossil fuels to produce, which in effect adds another middle man to pay with no additional benefit.

Edit: apparently this comment set off Google's nannyware, which prompted me to review the ""community guidelines"" before posting. If in the unlikely event this comment isn't banned, ask yourself what could prompt the benevolent Google to prevent you from reading it. Hmmmmm"
"Rising gas and oil prices are telling you that peak oil has been reached and passed.  The oil companies do a good job of suppressing this point,  so you can continue to hide your head in the sand.  üíÑ"
Renewables? Which ones do you mean? :))
"If you listen carefully and watch the graph closely, you can tell that this is complete propaganda."
"They've been predicting the end of oil since I was in school in the 1980s. Gas in particular is valuable since it is the least polluting fossil fuel and a key fuel that ENABLES renewables. Electric companies need energy that can be called on at will when the sun doesn't shine or the wind isn't blowing. Gas turbines can be switched on in 60s unlike thermal (steam) plants (nuke/coal/gas/biomass fired) additionally it can be run long term which batteries can't. Massive batteries only last 1 to 4 hrs (Big one in SA is the equivalent of only 1 gas turbine and lasts 1 hour). Batteries are great for frequency matching but the cost to build a huge battery and loads of mining involved to run for only a short time gas will still be needed.

A mix of energy sources and storage methods will be needed."
"@Amos Batto Battery Storage costs - doesn't matter how low they come they use VAST amounts of minerals which takes huge CO2 and massive environmental hits. Even if 1/4 the price a massive battery like in South Australia will get you a battery that can only match 1 turbine for 1 hour - so for 1 turbine for 12 hrs say until next day's solar is generating you'll need 12 batteries ie. 4X the cost but you cannot keep it running multiple days - STORING energy is not the same as generating it.
Our grid is a Hybrid not an EV i.e. Renewables let you switch off Fuels for several hours but you will always need backup despatchable power. Simply cannot build enough storage economically for all the world.
Gas Turbines are able to start quickly like Pumped hydro (better storage option if you have the topography) and COGAT where you use the waste heat for steam turbines for a 2nd bite at the cherry if you are keeping them on longer than 6 hours is great. UK for example has often several weeks at a time per year of cold, still weather with days no wind and cold so you actually have to send power to wind turbines to keep them from freezing. For decades we will need a complete mix solar, wind, wave (costly and huge maintenance/ damage), gas turbine, COGAT, storage (batts, gravity, pumped hydro)."
"In the short term, natural gas peakers are necessary when adding a large amount of renewable energy to the electrical grid, but the cost of storage (mostly LFP batteries) is falling so fast, that I doubt that natural gas peakers will be necessary in the long term. Between cheaper storage and the building of better electrical grids that can do energy trading over over long distances and HVDC lines, and the ability to vary demand to match supply (with smart appliances and smart charging of EVs and home batteries), I don't see a long-term market for gas peakers. The business of the natural gas turbine makers like GE and Siemens is now shrinking. 

With little in new investment for oil and natural gas, I think the handwriting is on the wall that natural gas and oil is going to follow the same path as coal. They won't be phased out nearly as quickly as coal, since they still have a ton of industrial uses in plastics, chemicals, etc., but I definitely can see their end as a fuel source within the next 2-3 decades. EVs and plugin hybrids are now 20% of new European and Chinese auto sales. Tesla plans to build 20 million EVs and 1.5 GWh of battery storage per year by 2030. Renewable energy accounted for 90% of new electricity generating capacity added globally in 2020, according to the IEA. We are seeing the accelerating S-curve of new tech adoption in EVs, wind, solar and battery storage."
This is bullshit.  Just like in the the mid to late 2000's deisel prices started making a jump from $1 a gallon to $3 or more.  People were taking about how deisel will never go up in price but yet it did. Then the media came out with this story that the reason that deisel was going up was because it's being stolen from the refineries. A complete bullshit story.  Just like this explanation.
"Your obviously misinformed and buying the garbage that the left led new media is feeding you. Oil crashed the very first day when Biden signed his presidential orders to put an end to the Keystone pipeline and stopped approving anymore drilling permits and as for the ones they have, which is not 9000, they are not able to use them as not every drilling permit given is workable! Biden and the Democrats made it clear right from the start that they were going to make the oil industry go out of business and that is what they are doing! They want prices high so that when you are looking at the green options, the high prices for those options won't feel as high when you are paying as much as you are for gas. Stop listening to the left run media and big tech!"
Most of this is bullshit just like the renewable energy hustle is bullshit
Taxes are cause 1 in Europe
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE  WAR !
"There's no such thing as a 'frac'ing rig'.. 15:10 That was footage of a DRILLING rig.  As well put together as the rest of the video is, that sort of misnomer really ruins credibility.

On another note, I don't think O&G is disappearing anytime soon so long as the modern world likes its plastics, medicines, teslas, north face jackets, and entertainment platforms."
You can blame all the Tesla drivers for increased gas prices. ;)
"It got expensive because Biden and Democrats are complete morons who are doing this on purpose to create economic collapse that they can rush in to fix.  They're like these occasional volunteer firemen/medics who go out and throw cinderblocks off of overpasses to create massive wrecks that they can then rush in and be heroes.
Except, y'know, the result of the dems is going to be overpasses and ropes."
Ethanol does not help with a cleaner burn. It actually has the opposite effect.

Demoncrap Filth caused this garbage
Its Joe Biden
Why would they increase production? Record profits speak wonders. Wonder if it‚Äôll ever change.

"So, crying like a bitch and blaming everything on Joe Biden is... INACCURATE?! I'm shocked. Absolutely shocked!
Great job on this video. You took a complicated topic and distilled it into a product that's easy to consume without inducing any headaches."
all this footage of oil rigs it‚Äôs proof of the flat earth do your research look up the black swan you will be shocked
BAD GOVERNMENT policy is why oil is expensive now
"So long story short, get an electric car and some personal renewables, especially if you live in California. Take advantage of those rebates, they exist for a reason."
And the producers of this video finally show their liberal bias. Talking about all the different leases that are available. Yet you talk to anyone in the oil industry they will tell you one they are not giving out drilling permits. The majority of the leases do not have enough oil on them to be worth it.
It has nothing to the war. There aren't any supply problems. Its 100% corporate greed and the oil companies are just trying to make up the difference in loss from the beginning of the pandemic.
"fuel prices are the direct responsibility of biden and his commiecrat handlers along with the STOLEN elections. and NOTHING else.
put the blame where it belongs."
This video is pretty much bullshit entirely. Oil and gas prices currently are 100% a direct result of the war. You can simply look at the 25 year trends of WTI. Abs easily see when they spiked. Oil is still cheaper than even 2007 and similar to 2014.
"Well you left out a key fact. Here in the USA a LOT of the problem lies with Joe Biden's choices to executive order to stop the Keystone Oil Pipeline Project and to stop fracking in USA, twice. One just recently. Hence the prices going up again just recently. When Trump was in office he had the Keystone Pipeline under construction, which Was going to help a lot, but he also really helped the fracking industry a lot while in office. To the point that while he was in office we were producing enough oil to actually export supply. Now that Joe Biden has put a stop to all that we are having to import a majority of supply, from countries that hate us, like Russia and Iran. So obviously our current problem has a lot more to do with politics than you want to admit."
@SuperSirianRigel (AdamNetherton) the keystone pipeline is different from the keystone xl pipeline
@Robert M I heard it's Not in operation.
Also the US has been an oil exporter for years.
The keystone pipline has been in operation for years.
"So, to summarize, the climate alarmists have scared the public away from investing in oil, and now oil is giving up...
It's an interesting analysis, but I would change the last part: oil is not giving up; it is simply biding its time. Eventually the political climate will change, people will realize the prophecies of climate alarmists have not come to pass(because they never do), new political leaders will take office who prioritize economic growth over green lobbying, and oil will again rise as ""God's gift in the ground,"" the cheapest source of energy for mankind. 
It's the neverending cycle that each new generation goes through. There really is no end to it."
"People realize today that climate change is real. In 2022, everyone on this planet can see, especially if you remember the climate decades ago. You're living in a different world if you don't see it

"Sorry, Wendover. Gonna have to dislike this video for the mix of accurate and inaccurate info. Really disappointed you‚Äôre not speaking about the real reasons gas is astronomically high right now."
"@ProfessorPepper This is strictly regarding the US, not Europe, but Sleepy Joe cancelling the Keystone XL pipeline and making it extraordinarily difficult for oil companies to obtain permits/leases just to start drilling has made inflation worse."
Where's your counterargument
"Left hates capitaliss and big oil but want their cheap gas, they hate large food companies but want their cheap baby formulas."
Biden blames Putin because they are both on there deathbed using our countries as ego fulfillment
"Making windmills, solar panels, nuclear powerplants takes HUGE amount of fossil fuel.

Ever seen a solar bulldozer?

It will ALL get burned, but not by cars... by industry. 

Buy oil (gas) while you can, before governments and corporations hoard it all.  

WE have used more than half of it, its their turn."
Global warming hoax
We will never live in a carbon-free world never never to there may be a finite availability oil but there's always oil the Earth produces oil continuously just not at the present levels that we're able to extract it
Nice video.
That image with the gas prices should say ‚ÄúBendover‚Äù üò¨
"Maybe the end of oil as a fuel is near, but the end of oil is not near at all. We still need plastics and other petrochemicals. Until we find non-oil replacements for those we will continue to rely on oil to function as a modern society."
"I don't agree with your summarization at the end.  Oil isn't over, it is just markets doing what markets do.  With how close war is all over the place now?  Ya, oil is going to have a lot of new customers...

The idiot in the white house isn't helping things either, canceling leases, I live in a very oil focused area in Wyoming.  Biden's admin pleaded with our state to increase production, but they told him to pack sand, since a month earlier he said he was going to eventually outlaw their industry.  Once he is gone?  It will probably cause a shock, with more leases being used.  I know, hippies point to leases not being done, but in order to do said leases they make all sorts of weird rules, like have to have so many trans employees (not joking) and other nonsense.  Want to know why they aren't doing them?  Go look deeper, without a political bias.  I know someone is going to look at this comment and go, but you're being politically biased!  Yep, cause what I was taught in school, and college, is a lie, the enemy isn't who you think it is."
It‚Äôs strange tho the atmospheric rise of oil prices seemed to coincide nearly perfectly with the war in Ukraine
"Wow, it's so much cheaper to build pipelines by the kilometer. Why would anyone build them by the mile? It doesn't make any sense. 












I am just kidding üòÖ"
"It is actually due to increased regulations and restrictions and costs per site. It is 100% because of the ""green"" new administration in the United States. So based on your information presented, I can fundamentally guess that your non-US information is incorrect as well."
"this whole video is kind of a lie. Oil is not in scarcity right now, THEY ARE JUST TREATING IT LIKE IT IS. America still has more than 90% of its oil reserves. WHILE RUSSIA HAS 92% OF THEIR NATURAL GAS RESERVES STILL. MEANWHILE IN THE MIDDLE EAST WE DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT PORTION OF OIL WEVE COLLECTED. THEIR IS SO FUCKING MUCH THEIR WE GENUINELY CANT TELL WHAT PERCENTAGE HAS BEEN COLLECTED. ITS PURE SPECULATION.

FACT: THEIR IS NO GENUINE REASONING FOR A CHANGE IN OIL PRICE."
"I take issue with the claim US producers cost of $20.00 per barrel. Frackers break even was around $60 until they walked away from $321 billion in debt through bankruptcies between 2015 - 2020.

Having washed that debt of sunk costs they're now claiming break even of $50 per barrel in some of the Permian, but costs in other parts are still much higher.

The St Louis Fed has mapped the TX counties and breakeven costs.

Overall a fairly accurate assessment given the time allotted but there's a lot more to it."
"No pipeline in history has lowered gas prices.
 all they do is take money out of the hands of workers and into the pockets of the lazy rich.
And destroy the environment."
My answer to this before even watching is... DUH!
This video is too long and the narrator has an annoying voice
"15:50 This is flat wrong.

Large Organizations ALWAYS dump the price to kill smaller organizations.

You know this and yet you CHOSE to say otherwise."
"Very sad story. Only rich people can convert away from normal fuels. And the price of everything is based on the fuels we use. So everything will get more expensive for normal people while it gets cheaper for rich people. We don't even have the technology or resources to convert the whole planet to this new system. So there are only enough resources for the rich and after a while normal people will just die out. And they even say it out loud: save the planet.
Listen to them. If you have to die to save the planet they are more than willing to sacrifice you."
Print then ask
"The Biden administration wont allow oil to be drilled in mass here in the USA. Somehow, when its done in other countries its better for the Earth. (at least that's the lie that they tell)

The actual fact is, they are so corrupt they wont allow the USA to prosper. They have back room deals with people like Warren Buffett that owns the railroad and makes billions transporting oil. 

LETS GO BRANDON!"
"Kind of a good encouragement to switch to renewables though, no? Just sucks the gauged part of the price goes to profit rather than to investment in making renewables more available..."
"This presentation sometimes sounds like an evangelist sermon for renewable energy. Renewable energy isn't taking over. The planet isn't being destroyed by carbon emissions. When I hear ""considering the driving force behind the transition is the prevention of the destruction of the planet..."" No, that isn't a driving force. Most people aren't concerned that carbon emissions are ""destroying the planet"" and that included 1.2 billion Chinese. People are more concerned about being able to afford to live on the planet - that's a driving force."
Very true
"Well done video EXCEPT for the lack of mention of what happens when government increases the risk of investment in the industry. When government fails to support oil industry investment in the infrastructure necessary to support the expansion of production by denying permits essential to improving and expanding that infrastructure, the industry will naturally pull back and gladly accept the higher margins available all while avoiding the additional risk of investment. Who wouldn't? Its not like these investments don't carry other risks unrelated to government policy. Dry holes are relatively common."
"American gallon is 4 litres right!? Americans in 2022,holy shi* gas is $5 a gallon!! about $1.25 a litre.. rest of the world except for the middle east, remember that price from about 2005...Americans catching up to the rest causing mass whingeing... however I will say when the super rich of the world are running a greenie gangbang on you, do you expect them to help the oil industry or destroy it... I'll wait for your answer..."
"So what you're saying is, gas is so expensive on purpose, to further encourage the transition to renewable energy? I call bullshit!"
"No one wants to invest in exploration or extraction for the same reason foreign countries don't trust the US now.
The White House changes hands and the new regime might just screw you because they don't agree with the last one."
imagine putin invading countries with full electric tanks :DDD
Is there any fool that thinks Cars ever going 100% EV ?  no a mix is the best shirt term solution
Shutting down a couple of large pipeline projects didnt help .
This big lie about the destruction of the planet is the reason to destroy our energy system is going to be a gigantic human catastrophe.  You failed to mention ESG as the mechanism to stop carbon investment. ESG must be stopped. This big lie about renewables will be a hard lesson to learn when the people will not have heat or food.  Write an essay on that.
Oil IS the most cost effective fuel.
Gas for higher because of Biden. He stopped the cheaper route via pipe line. He now ships it via trains which costs more because he has stock in the train company. It‚Äôs all about money in his pocket. Just like Obama
"Make me an offer,  show me an electric truck that can tow a fifth wheel camper trailer half way across the country in a few days.  I'm willing to change,  but there's nothing to change to. What's wrong with this picture? Green new deal,  I don't see any deal, I see this country going downhill day by day,  the middle class can barely afford to make a living.  I don't see any hope  in sight.  The most influential generation in the history of the planet is killing the prospect of any kind of future as far as I'm concerned."
try the f150 lightning. also the middle class owns homes that appreciated a lot recently
"Super is now 2.059‚Ç¨/l and Diesel 2.009‚Ç¨/l at the station. That is about $8.18/gal and $7.99/gal respectively for our non-metric friends. (E10 Super is also 2.009‚Ç¨/l) And only about 45-50% of that is for various taxes and environmental fees. And the same amount goes into getting it here in the first place.
At the same time gas has increased by 30% exactly because of the war. Most of the heating here is done via natural gas, and most of that comes from Russia. Electricity production is around 40-50% from renewables, but subsidies for that means we have one of the highest price, with around 0.25-0.26‚Ç¨/kWh"
What is the average pay over there?
Nah its Biden
The Diamond and gemstone industry also participated in this manufactured scarcity scheme. They lock up gems and only release a specific amount each year- supply and demand is an illusion across many of our industries.
"Yep, Debeers is not your friend."
Plus massive amounts of PR. The whole thing of a diamond for engagement rings is basically a huge PR stunt to increase demand.
"Just like when the truck fills the gas station tank,    that cost is fixed. Then suddenly the prices jump up on the pump over the next few weeks.  They are screwing us."
The oil companies bought this oil at extremely low cost under contract. Oil companies are not buying oil at these asking prices.
Simple answer: Biden
@Sciron And that made gas go up around the world?
@Freighter 109 he got rid of domestic oil fracking and is contemplating buying oil from Iran
"@Freighter 109 could encourage and maybe even give $ for fracking, oil exploration which would flood the market with additional oil causing a price reduction"
@powermetaladdict So what does that have to do with global gas prices being up?
You never explained why investors had a investing shift. The pandemic crash is not enough. Oil still has 40 more years to go. Also you did not explain once government policies interference on the oil industry free markets. So I deem this video incomplete information.

"Investment is only if you have high prices. then the money will come. If the price stays high you'll have more production, but companies like high prices so don't expect a lot of price competition soon."
"Have you ever looked into just how much oil is used to build, ship and maintain renewables? All that rubber and plastic on your Tesla comes from oil. You can not build anything without some dependency on oil. Everything is made possible because of oil. Take veganism for example. I would love to have seen someone try and be a vegan 200 years ago. Mankind has progressed to this point because of oil. Same as the last 200 years mankind could not have progressed without the use of animal products. Science"
"The reason Gas prices are so high is because the Elites/Environmentalists(the Left) are in control in the US. The Green New Deal? They raise gas prices to force less usage of fossil fuels. The last President had the US as the #1 exporter of oil ect., so Gas prices were considerably lower."
"Exxon is elitist, they like high prices.  Go tell them to refine more."
it is Joe Biden and the democrat party.
"According to the Los Angeles Times, SoFi Stadium cost more than $5 billion to build."
"Its opec abusing its monopolistic power, since Everyone has stopped using Russian fuel, Opec has more power. Thats why Biden and the President of Italy are working on forming an Anti-Opec coalition."
"22 minutes of ""Please don't blame Biden """
"Sounds like it's some kind of reset, a great reset if you will. Useless governments should be working with the oil industry to slowly phase out oil, nope shut it all down now."
"It literally is the war. Countries around the world rely on each other. The US might not get gas from Russia, however other countries do."
"Crazy enough,  there is a gasoline alternative that already exists for combustion engines.  
It's available anywhere you can find a good Marijuana or Hemp supply, and denatured alcohol.  Sure, it'll take some experimentation to get it right, but hemp oil infused alcohol burns like gasoline. It's also explosive, in the correct ratio. 

Js, natural alternatives have been available for decades.  It's not the combustion engine's fault that crude oil is easier, cheaper, more plentiful, and more legal. That's entirely the fault of politicians everywhere."
"Here we have fuel with 10% ethanol at basically every station, for a lower price than the usual 5% mixture. And some other countries, like Brazil are mostly running on 85% ethanol."
republicans be like nah Joe Biden
$6.95 diesel in Crescent City Commiefornia !
So it's all arbitrary and made up .... got it
When the US was drilling its own oil our gas was at historic lows...the economy was booming...then Biden came in and killed it off so we are back to spending quadruple the cost per barrel to foriegn countries. Which in turn is killing our economy.
The economy is going extremely well. that's why the home prices are the highest ever.
I‚Äôve gotta be honest. This was a piss poor video. You added a bunch of Pork to the video. The beginning was good and the last part where you actually started laying out your reasoning behind the title was good. But I didn‚Äôt need to know the history of Azerbaijani Oil. That wasn‚Äôt the point of the video and it leads to extra time that I didn‚Äôt need to watch.
This system is so fake it needs to crumble tomorrow
nationalize it and get rid of the social parasites.
They can also plant many drought resistant vegetation including grains like Millet and sorghum. The wolfberry or  Gogi is a fantastic idea since it is in very high demand worldwide as long as it is organically-grown.
"shale oil extraction possible is a bit misleading. Fracking makes all oil extraction possible, it's just hydrofracking that works on shale."
"At the end of the day regardless of whether renewables reach 100% market share, we still need oil and gas.
Why? Science. Plastic. Electronics etc. Oil will transition from a source of power to a resource like iron, steel, etc."
"@3ducs Slip form paving is fast, smooth, hard wearing but expensive. It's a trade off. It's not necessary to use oil by-products. Pitch lakes occur naturally in a few places. That said,I would still expect us to use some oil for manufacturing, lubricants and other purposes."
"@Little Britain Concrete is slow to build and expensive, bumpy too."
"@3ducs as I have already mentioned, there are large pitch or tar deposits such as in Trinidad, and many roads are made of other materials such as concrete. Also - I am not saying oil mining will stop. I am saying oil burning will drop to a tiny fraction of today's consumption."
Roads that electric vehicles will travel on are made of tar and rocks. Tar is a by-product of gas and Diesel production.
"@Funny Guy Trinidad has a pitch lake. Also, most NA new highway is concrete. But yes, to your point, we still use petroleum products for manufacturing, and likely will for the foreseeable future. However that is a fraction of current production."
Please just say Iran and Iraq like a normal person.
Doesn‚Äôt help that American production of oil has gone down significantly
"Production is higher then 2018,. yet prices are at 2018 prices."
"19:30 ""rewnewables are taking over""

They are very much not. The groth  of revwevables have been lower than that of fosilfuel the last 20 years . They really just taken market shares of nuclear

Oil industry is not giving up, they are rather the one that wants rewnewvables because it push there competitor out of the market."
"17:33 ""have 9000 aprover  permits""

That is a lie. There is 9000 permits.. but only 7500 of them are pre apeoved, and of them non of them have total aproval. So stop lying."
"9:58 ""18% comes from this step alone""
Well that would be of the crued woul be at about $50-60/barrel. At $120 its way less, its closed to 10-12%. 

Its a bit complicated because in the old days the refineries was powered by the fuel oil they produced, but nowdays they are powered by natural gas that is generally cheaper. And that is for the cost of the tax free fuel

12:00 the statment that its a strawman is just right down wrong. The issue is that most of the state tax is based on the price of fuel, and not actually on the carbon emitted, there for the tax also swings with the cost."
@HappyBeezerStudios - by Lord_Mogul the was only spiked the price with 10-15%. At least the first month. How much it is now we have to wait untill it ends
"And the gas prices are about to spike, exactly because of the war."
"Woke piece of trash video. Oil is not going anywhere, not any time soon."
"Basically, asphalt comes from coker which is at the tail end of crude processing.  Essentially, the trash of the refining process is turned into asphalt. So, if gas, and other high value chemicals, essentially approaches zero due to renewables then how does asphalt get made?

Maybe, asphalt becomes unaffordable and roads have to be built and repaired from concrete again.  But isn't that even more CO2 intensive?"
Isn't asphalt like almost perfectly reusable? Couldn't we just reuse what we've already made for most everything?
Life was soooooo good in February of 2020 in every way possible! Then March of 2020 came and ruined everything forever!
Is anyone else doubting the whole 'peak oil' thing? Is it really a finite resource?
"soon, which is hard to believe given the current status quo."
It‚Äôs not a war never was
"Great the green hippies will drive prices up 
Oil is natural byproduct of the earth evelution it won't kill it"
how does value of something drop by 300%?
But they have one giant problem.   When we go to renewables - what do they do with the un-used gasoline?
you turn the oil in to plastic
"Bullshit bullshit and more bullshit, it's all about central banking systems, globalist, and greedy politicians that need to fill there pockets! Welcome to the one world order"
Just switch to solar power bro..
im dreading the day i wont be able to get gasoline regardless of the price. renewables and EV's are making it impossible to live
Why not just get all our oil from Mexico. It would allow the a lot of income.
Wow don't know if I'm ready for this.
"Lets not beat around the bush, gas is this high because grossly incompetent politicians in many nations are intentionally doing everything they can to destroy the economy. To deny that being the case would require incredible amounts of obliviousness. gas and diesel literally costs more than double what it did 16 months ago. Nothing justifies that, it can only be done with complete negligence or intentional policy."
"""Renewables are taking over""
Not yet. And governments are far too eager to rush it. The tech isn't equipped to meet a fraction of demand. There are serious problems with each style of non-fossil fuel energy generation. Nuclear is the best of the bunch but the same governments pushing for a move away from fossil fuels are not at all keen on nuclear either. The major problem is that things like wind, solar, and hydro are not equipped to handle what is being asked of them. This is a disastrous situation. I don't want to see news stories about gas prices being so high and supply so low that heating homes becomes prohibitively expensive. However, that is what will continue to happen when a ""renewable"" energy tech incapable of meeting demand is asked to, I dunno, try its best? Furthermore, the push to electric vehicles is going to put even greater strain on a power grid that can barely keep up with demand NOW let alone when millions of electric vehicles are pulling from it."
"Liar, liar pants on üî•. The fact is production is low because the land made available is poor not companies refuse to invest. That's the clever way the current administration is able to say "" we have leases available "" but it's üíØ B.S. That's a fact."
Prices go up when supply goes down? Groundbreaking.
"Always a shame to watch someone like Wendover - who's clearly a leftie of some stripe - wade through a bunch of stats and facts, and then end up with some brain dead conclusion that basically says ""Renewables will save us"". They won't, and they can't - it's just a Greenie utopian wet dream they will. It's ""fun"" for you lefties to paint the oil industry as evil, money-hungry oligarchs who care nothing for the planet (which is actually true), while insinuation the ""righteous"" Greenies are the opposite. Tell that to the countries using ""slave labour"" to mine all the expensive minerals and such for EV batteries, using ""dirty"" oil in the massive machines necessary for gouging millions of tons of Earth to make components for ""green"" cars, wind turbines and solar panels. I haven't even touched on the short life span of all the ""green"" technology, how almost-impossible it is to recycle, and the damage IT does to the ""holy"" environment. Not saying we shouldn't aim to getting away from fossil fuels as and when we can, but jumping without looking into the mess that is the ""green revolution"" (now an oligarchy worth trillions to a few corrupt, power-hungry conglomerates/people) is just as stupid as trying to ""turn the tap off"" on that which has driven success and prosperity for the better part of 100+ years."
"BUY ONLY BITCOIN AND ETHERUM AND HODL!STAKES!TEAM WORK GUYS,TEAM WORK!!!"
Also the industry is being diminished slowly by alternative fuels and power sources. Gotta make money while they still have influence.
"People stopped driving when covid hit so the oil companies cut back how much they make because they are cheap cunts and then now they make more than they ever could imagine 

I live in a city with a refinery and I'm paying 6 dollars a gallon. Blaming Russia is just a slap in the face to basic intelligence."
"It was never about the war, it's Biden and this administration why gas is going up, we're all being screwed, the same with Food ,what does the war have to do with the price of food  going through the roof,  this country been in wars before and never affected the price of fuel or food, it the Democrats that have always been the problem with the high cost of inflation it never fails every time there's a Democratic president the inflation goes up and it's harder to make a living."
Food in the US is shipped a long way so fuel price has a big effect. Also food companies like money.
Simple answer DEMOCRATS!! All these people trying to come up with everything under the sun to get their fellow idiot democrats to take the bait and its all FAKE NEWS!! Its gas prices started going up the day that idiot Biden got elected and democrats got both the senate and the house!! EVERYTHING THESE IDIOTS COME UP WITH IS A BUNCH OF BS!!
"No it's, clinton. Or it's Bush or it's trump or it's Obama or it's Biden....haha. I'm glad you examined this. So .any people cannot or don't want to look into this they just wanna grab low hanging fruit..."
As long as we continue to demonize Maduro as the world's worse dictator we will continue to punish ourselves with much higher gas prices and rampant inflation.
How is the war not mentioned as a factor for the sudden price increase in gasoline? The price jumped up as soon as Russian oil was sanctioned.
"Good primer of oil energy.  But you lost me at the end.  Making wind turbines and solar panels can only happen if mining, shipping, construction, and material supplies support it.  Lower oil prices would not ""Slow down"" the switch to renewables. The switch to renewables requires big production and fossil hydrocarbons, at a cheaper rate, would support more ""big production"".... more wind turbines, more solar panels.  The thing that seems more alarming though is the narrative that we need to replace fossil hydrocarbons from the total daily energy requirement with renewables by 2050 instead of allowing renewables to add to the total output. A stagnating or contracting total energy output would put tremendous downward pressure on the economy. Energy is production and hydrocarbons are the benchmark metric for costs of production.  If output is continually decreased standard of living will decrease.  That actually seems to be more the case.  It does not matter where the energy comes from, oil, gas, wind turbine, solar panel... It just has to be there at the end of the day or the economy will contract."
"Climate change alarmism is a big reason why so many people hold less than scientific stances on climate change and what to do about it. 

At the moment there is no viable replacement for petroleum based energy, especially considering that the fossil fuel industry is critical even to renewable energy sources for the time being."
It's greed
It's the incompetence of the Biden/Harris junta.
Well gas prices are up globally. Care to explain how that's his fault too?
"So, when land is an oil field, the owner ""owns"" it and has infinite of rights, while all other ""land owners"" are standing on borrowed land that can be seized at any time, and needs government permission to install a door frame?"
"@TinyfatƒÉ Well your homeowner's insurance sure won't cover damage to that part of the home ‚Äî actually, they may not cover damage to any part of the home due to misrepresentation. In addition, the county or municipality will impose additional taxation (and may also impose fines for making changes to your home without a permit, depending on county/municipality rules) to account for the increased value of the structure now that it has a tiny apartment attached to it. The rule is, if you make any changes to the dwelling structure, i.e. something that may affect the property value, you must report this change to the taxation authority for a reevaluation, and you must report this change to your homeowner's insurance company for, you guessed it ‚Äî a reevaluation. This ensures that you are taxed the right amount, and that your entire home is covered by your insurance."
"You don't ""own"" land or mineral rights, you own the right to use it. The right to use can be retracted though. You are still subject to sovereign oversight."
@TinyfatƒÉ It's possible you missed the point of this persons post.
"@TinyfatƒÉ Western USA here, and from what I understand, building modifications need to be ""inspected"". I assume if something like a fire or flood happens, insurance will blame those modifications if Vader's guys didn't approve them"
"... Where do you live? I literally built a tiny apartment attachment to my dad's house, door frames and all, with no government permission. I live in Southeastern USA."
"Renewables aren't all great. Ask the child laborers mining cobalt in the Congo. Renewables are a luxury the developed world ""may be able to"" afford, but when forcing underdeveloped nations to rely on unreliable and more costly forms of energy to simply light their homes, it smacks of raising the ladder on after climbing it."
Plus the transition costs money. And who pays that? The taxpayer.
Biden did it
"19:55 what was that ""planet"" pronunciation lol"
Biden
"They keep bringing up the 9000 available permits but fail to mention that those are all legacy permits. Once those dry up there may not be more. Furthermore those spots aren't a guarantee that there will be oil at those locations. Then we have the investment issue. After all the talk of closing down the fossil fuel industry, investors were already getting nervous. When the XL Keystone got shut down, those investors lost a mountain of cash and other potential investors view any other projects to be just as vulnerable. Why take that kind of risk? The Biden admin is already cancelling any incentives for drilling, have done all they can to block fracking, and may shut down any new pipeline or major project if activists complain too much."
Either use the leases or lose the leases.
"...of course not, its simply Joe Biden and the cowards otherwise knowing as liberals.They take responsibility for nothing!"
It's Iran not I ran
Biden. Liberals. Democrats. Etc.
"Brandon shut down the Keystone pipeline and stopped new leases on Federal lands. The US is also directing a lot of energy to Europe, turning its back on its own citizens, again."
"the keystone pipeline has been in operation for years, still it. the LNG is being sold for money to the EU by private companies, not the govt."
Can't wait to hear this because it is 100% affected by the war and the stupid truckers that are or were on strike
Where are those truckers are protesting skyrocketing diesel prices instead of vax mandates?
"Great video, love all of your work and this is no exception. However I did have trouble keeping up with the speed of the voiceover in this one - it felt a bit rushed and I had to keep pausing and going back over things to understand what was said fully. Just some constructive feedback. Keep up the great work! :-)"
I have the same issue.  It seems as if they're trying to put in too much information to keep within the time available for the video; otherwise an excellent piece of work.
Climate change is destroying our future
There‚Äôs no reason for them in the US to reinvest it because you have a president he‚Äôs not willing to back any of them. This schmuck would rather reinvest in foreign companies where his money can get cleaned and let his own people hang high and dry.
Worlds oil demand is actually rising quite alot.
Every 5 seconds listen for: ‚ÄúBlah blah blah blah blah bla-blaaaa-blaaaaaaaahh‚Ä¶. Blah blah blah blah blah blaaa-blaaaaaaa-blah.
This is a reason for oil regulations and forming a Western OPEC
"Don't forget that nearly everything we buy and use has some component of oil in it and/or is processed using petroleum extracts.  
Yeah, you might drive an electric car charged exclusively by wind and solar power,

"Do you pronounce Adamantium ""Adaman-shm""? Consor-shm just sounds so pretentious XD"
"All of this is complete BS.  Why would we care about international oil markets if we didn't need to import any oil, and instead went back to using our own domestic oil supply???  That's where we were just two years ago.  Which is why we saw such a boom in our national economy.  But when idiots completely shut down domestic oil production and oil transportation pipelines, we then gotta go back to being dependent on people that hate us for our oil needs."
"Intnl oil is cheaper to produce, that's the iraq reference. Oil production is higher than 2018."
"The bankers owned USSA Inc   government has made it clear that it's MORE profitable for them to make us pay - via economic corrsion, aka scarcity - for going electric while simultaneously divesting themeselves of costly military watch over existential risks assets, oil.

Translation: Democrats = higher gas prices
gasoline is not gas.
"You have A nice voice, and dialectic in your voice......"
If the oil companies are posting record profits wouldn‚Äôt it entice smaller producers to create new fracking rigs to cash in on it thus eventually balancing out prices?
"If they think it will stay high, yes."
It is the war
It's sadly still cheaper than public transit
"Ngl, the video kinda contains a lot of unnecessary fluff that doesn't really answer the question posed in the title. In fact, the video doesn't start to answer it's own question until around the 11:52 mark.

TLDR, oil companies know that the death of fossil fuels is imminent as the rest of the world turns to renewable energy, so they have started to purposefully drill less oil, making it more scarce so that prices go up so that they can seize their final chance at earning big profits before the oil industry completely dies out."
but lets go brandon?? :c sad conservative noises
"""Why is Gas so Expensive?""

Central Banks - Central Planning.

(Mic Drop)

Enter the Biden Puppet - Central Banks close down US Pipelines & exhaust the majority of US strategic reserves . . . 

This isn't incompetence, its war - Gloablists vs. Any Sane Person"
"""Gas"" is not the right word to use here. I understand that it may be your intention to use it as an acronym for ""gasoline"" but it is still incorrect as ""gas"" refers to pressurized fuels that exist in a gaseous state. If this video was primarily about fuels like ""natural gas"" then it would be correct to use the word ""gas""."
"So ANNOYING that an explanatory video keeps referring to ""gas"" for that particular petroleum product. There IS a very important to world economy GAS industry, and this isn't it. Economists,  Scientists and Chemical Engineers don't call it ""gas"". This is a video about the Petroleum Industry. Someone else make a video about the real gas industry! It's very topical and current since Russia just turned of the 'gas', yes, real gas, to Europe"
"I would really like to see a video on the current baby formula shortage.

"People always mention that one of the major factories was shut down due to a bacterial infection scare and may say that it hasn't reopened, but that sort of glosses over the fact that no contaminants were found and it had every reason to reopen, especially to produce product to be sold. Along with so many food processing plants burning down, this all reeks of something being orchestrated.
Also, much like with our food shortages, so much of what we make is exported to other nations and then we import inferior product for ourselves. But now nobody's importing to us and we're still exporting. A pretty simple solution would be to cut export contracts and agreements due to emergency and give the American people the food and formula we're producing rather than shipping in a tiny amount and acting like it's a victory."
@J D we are waiting. Where‚Äôs your answer? Oh that‚Äôs right you don‚Äôt have one.
@Shawn Smurawa *would HAVE thought...
5.5 billions alot? How much did Joe give away last month?
"Another important thing to note is the prevalence of credit in the petro industry. These companies often rely on loans to get operations up and running until they can get that oil to market. For the 2010s they had access to really cheap debt because the Fed kept interest rates down. With the recent oil prices a lot of the big corps have finally paid a lot of the debts they incurred during the cyclical crash. Now that the fed is raising rates, they will want to account for that interest expense in their operating margins."
Absolutely...Also keep in mind the pressure of ESG investing. They effectively remove capital from drilling projects.
so how dose this video explain that its not the war for are increasing gas and oil prices? also did the vidoe mention Joe biden banning of the Keystone pipeline and how it affected the gas prices as woo. as he came into office in the USA?
In the meantime we can all tighten our belts I suppose. Not like I'm buying an electric car anytime in the vaguely near future. I hate my life.

Everyone knows it's not the war...lol
Americans aren't investing in oil? Weird. Maybe it has something to do with the gubment threatening to shut them down every 17 minutes.
How about greddy bullshit ?

"13,000 litres or about 3,435 U.S. Gallons. At your estimated cost per gallon, it means that one tanker charges 34, 350.00 US$. The average length of a rail shipment is about 100 tankers. That means.....$3,435,000. 00, in shipping costs!! A nice sum for the railroards. Then how many of these shipments are handled weekly?? The ROTHCHILDS / ROCKEFELLERS / IRVINGS and a handful of others are still in control and the CENTRAL BANK for all of this is THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE which is privately owned and controlled by the ROTHCHILDS/ & 11 others and headed by THE VATICAN BANK ??!!!!!!!!  This is the answer you need. Then of course, the oil producers want their equal cut so the consumer pays and pays and pays!!!!  In CANADA, the ANTI-COMBINES ACT was set in order to prevent such fixing but guess what CORPORATION is right in there with the others? CANADA!  
trivia:   How many Canadian men died in WW1 and WW2?   ................................ The answer;  'none' !  The colonists of Canada were still under British rule therefore everyone was a British Subject, not a Canadian. The 1st Canadian was sworn in in 1947. Look it up and tell me if you find out who that was!!!!  ttfn"
"i just started watching your video ad stopped at 3:41. Suffice to say, the rest of the video is not really needed because it can be summed up in one word;  G R E E D !..i think it was 1926when the Rockefeller family sewed up a deal with the railroads. The deal was that they would receive a low rate for transport but all other oil suppliers would have to pay a much larger fee. This caused widespread panic amongst the producers and led to the eventual buy-outs of these producers by the ROCKEFELLERS. Remember, the ROCKEFELLERS have a long standing inter-family with the ROTHCHILDS!. This same scenerio is happening again and oddly enough, almost a century afteer the first blitz. Now, who owns the tanker lines? In some cases, it is the IRVING FAMILY of New Brunswick, CANADA. IRVING got his real start when STANDARD OIL teamed up with him. STANDARD OIL can be linked back to the ROCKEFELLERS! OPEC and RUSSIA were not a part of this CABAL so something had to be done! An average rail tanker carries about"

"Renewables will not change anyone's life. New efficiency tech would have made reserves seem ""endless"" and cleaner burning tech could have brought oil CO2 output to manageable levels if we put the same r&d money in it as we do other energy sources. But that never was the goal. It was to take global energy power out of Opec's hands (out of oil). Resources as abundant as water still cause people problems. Those same problems will plague people with renewables. Manage your expectations and keep the patting on your back to a minimum."
"5.5 billion dollars!!!

That‚Äôs absolutely nothing to Joe Biden. He loves spending hundreds of billions if not trillions on things we don‚Äôt need, while simultaneously shutting down our pipeline that was almost completed. Complete joke of a president. Phuck you if you voted for him"
Oil money don't care about people they keep their profits by raising prices.  They want and will have their money.
"Why didn't you mention Biden shutting down the keystone Pipeline and removing leases from Anwar and the North slope in Alaska? Prices went up within 30 days after those decisions were announced. And saying that oil is on its deathbed when fuel is actually a fraction of the uses of oil and that renewables are pushing their way in is a little bit closed-minded of you. I love the amount of research and interest that you display in these videos, but you obviously have a bias and should state that."
No mention of Biden closing our pipeline in America. Lol
Talk about being dense! Do you really believe that oil does NOT own renewable technologies development?
The idea of extracting oil from the earth to use as a portable energy source is just... crude.
Great overview.  Nice to be able to understand the reasoning without all the political bs.
"Wait, they are trading futures on gas prices? Well that fucking explains everything. The damage futures cause to 99% of consumers in all markets is fucking absurd and needs to be stopped."

I like learning but it‚Äôs hard to listen to a narrator that ends every other sentence making it sound like a question when it is not

"nice historical revisioning, poor explanation of political pressures"
"Very Far Left Leaning Prospective. Is it paid by the DNC? According to Reuters less than 1% of the vehicles on the road are EVS & will only reach 30% of new car sales after 2030, so how exactly is the oil industry doomed? At least not in our lifetime & with Crude Oil @ $100 a barrel Thanks to Biden, very profitable as well"
"As sad as this might be for some people who love their petrol powered cars, for me this is nothing but great news. The best incentive for the switch to green energy will be the economic costs of fuel in general increasing. This is something to be celebrated, the death of the co2 and pollution pumping automobile is nothing but a benefit for humanity."
Definitely not the war it‚Äôs the biden administration pushing electrification to cash out on the biggest pump and dump in history electric cars or worst for the environment
The conclusion of this video is bs. Oil is here to stay - longer than we all think.
True
The part I don't agree with is you say that we are switching to renewables to save the planet. Yet the main driver of greenhouse gases is industry overseas. And studies have shown that getting rid of all fossil fuel vehicles would not even put a dent into climate change. So all this is doing is hurting everyday people. And why would the oil company invest when the government is rallying against them for this renewable unsustainable plan
It's high because some idiot shut off the pipeline and drilling. FJB
"This sad, greed money and the weakness of America!"
Because we have a Communist with Alzheimers in The White House
CORPORATE    GREED          NOW          SETS       THE         PRICE      OF          OIL      !!!
I get that we should switch to different forms of energy but certain places don't have a choice
"If you think we're going to completely switch to renewables in less than 20 years, you're kidding yourself. Not only would that be a bad idea, it would be bad for the environment.  Every car, boat, truck, train, construction equipment, portable fuel based power tools and more would need to be replaced. Imagine the energy and natural resources it would take to build the replacements alone. Not to mention the energy needed to scrap or recycle the discarded ones. 

It's amazing how we are perfectly fine with letting other countries pull oil out of the ground in whatever way they want, but we can't let anyone in the US do that. California has oil off the coast but we'd rather import it cause we can't see the source that way."
"@Byolock The lifespan of any vehicle depends on so many determining factors. There are cars over 100 years old but they are usually seen in collections and are maintained well and hardly driven. 

On the other hand take a car that is driven daily which most people do if they work or have kids. Then it depends on how many miles you drive and how well you maintain the vehicle."
How long is the lifespan of a typical car? I don't think a nearly all Electric Car Future in 20 years is that unthinkable without destroying working cars.
"We have 289.5 million cars registered in the US as of 2021. roughly 8 million of those are hybrid or electric vehicles.  A single gas powered passenger car emits around 4.6 metric tons of CO2 a year do the math. It comes out to 1
Billion + metric tons of CO2 just from passenger vehicles alone.  Transportation accounts for about 32% of all co2 emitted yearly . 

I have watched more than one video where people have converted their gas cars to electric relatively inexpensively.  Solid state batteries offer faster charge times and longer range for electric vehicles and I believe are friendlier for the environment than lithium ion.  

It is painfully obvious when you look at the numbers business as usual is not an option."
"@HappyBeezerStudios - by Lord_Mogul I agree completely. We might see a very long tail that way, possibly 40+ years.  California thinks making it a requirement for all new cars to be electric is the way to go, but I don't see how people with incomes less that 100k per year will be able to afford them when they are nearly double the cost of gas vehicles.  This stuff is complicated and forcing this type of change will lead to problems, possibly problems of epic proportions.  

We already have electric grid problems in California and if every car was suddenly needing to plug in, is that going to make it worse? It seems like our grid problems have gotten worse as we have more electric cars, but maybe it's not related. 

We also need to solve the storage problem, or have reliable/clean alternatives to renewables, like nuclear."
"@Kevin Harker We are already at around 40-50% on renewables for electricity here.
In terms of replacing stuff with new, ""greener"" parts it comes back to the old question. Is it better to buy the new and efficient thing, or continue using the old one. Yes the new fridge or car might be better for the environment during operation, but it would also need to be produced first and the old one recycled.
A good take would probably be a slow and steady transition. Add environmental fees and taxes on less efficient ones and subsidise the production and usage of greener new versions.
Instead of forcing everyone to switch, just keep driving your existing car, and the next time to buy one anyway, go for electric or hybrid. But that electricity would need to be produced the right way, or you just shift the environmental impact from you driving to whoever is supplying the energy. It isn't greener to drive an electric car, if the electricity comes from coal."
It's expensive   cause the government prints money like It's going out of fashion  and buying oil from russia driving cost of everything
"You spent over 19 minutes on the history of the oil industry. That wasn't the title. You also demonstrated a lack of some basics in pricing in the industry with disruptions like the pandemic and war, and therefore got the title that you did put up wrong as well. A good part of today's price is very much about the war and geopolitical / market instability generally. Oh, and by the way, oil futures are not the same thing as the cash trade. They affect one another, but that is all."
"I think we'll soon see oil companies investing in the creation of solid-state battery packs for car makers. This way they still make the ""fuel"" that powers vehicles."
Gas is 2.059/L CAD here wtffff
"How are they gonna produce them batteries without emissions? Tesla is already receiving carbon credits from Chrysler because of reaching its carbon footprint for the year with less than 16 batteries. You know how lithium batteries are made? Lolz bet you can‚Äôt post that video on here. Lithium is in the dirt, it‚Äôs something plants need to grow in the dirt, anyways it‚Äôs dump trucked out & goes into a acid bath basically then else‚Äôs where. Each dump truck load only makes enough lithium for cells of the Tesla batteries. There‚Äôs 18,650 cells into 1 Tesla battery. Lolz the emissions that are being put out by these dump trucks to gather the lithium alone isn‚Äôt worth the ‚Äú0‚Äù emissions strategy. We‚Äôre not moving forward we‚Äôre moving backwards. Fuck"

"Propaganda 17:37 - because they have 9,000 permits, this doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs actually oil on these private lands for them to drill. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt want to use them they can‚Äôt use them because there‚Äôs no fucking oil on these approved permitted lands."

So no one sees the lithium prices rsie leveles never seen before? M? Only oil right?
"This could be a domestic oil boom.  Instead, it's a crisis."
Funny thing is the higher oil prices go more people will switch to electric vehicles.  Oil companies are actually destroying their industry.
"If people cannot afford gas, how are they going to afford an electric vehicle, when oil prices directly affect the prices of lithium?"
You‚Äôre a propagandist.
The US government isn‚Äôt allowing them to use their permits!!!! This video is propaganda!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"For nearly a decade I worked construction for oil and gas shale assets in the Utica and Marcellus shale. We changed lives, rebuilt schools, roads and parks. We stocked food pantries shelves. Restored wetlands and reclaimed coal mines. We donated equipment to local fire departments and EMS. We provided masks and PPE during covid. I have a lot of pride for the work I did. Ultimately the investors are demanding returns, the major infrastructure is built and they are looking to maintain production.  The big American lines are built. The processing plants are built. The power plants are built. Oil and gas does have a future, but I firmly beleive I saw the last American oil boom. As a 6th generation oil employee, I am proud but all good things come to an end"

"Why are you not mentioning the obviously destructive political factors happening in the US right now? The shut down of the pipeline, restrictions on oil production in the US? People dont buy the cheap excuse that its because of the war. Its solely joe biden. Theres literally nothing else you can say."

"But according to all these right-wing memes, Joe Biden personally calls each and every gas station in America on a daily basis to tell them what to set their prices to. Could I have been...lied to?"
"It's all bull ""$""."
"ya fergot to include Biden's war on oil via regulations and carbon tax scares. No wonder capital investment has halted. What of lithium shortages and lack of small nuclear power. We are not nearly ready for a carbon-less all renewable electric energy society, and never will be. too many plastics and medicines and fertilizers are derived from oil."
"Every time you say cheap or expensive, I have to mentally check myself and be reminded we're talking in Oil company terms here.

Price per barrel has dropped in real terms though when you take into account inflation. But that's a sign of a good working market still.
We had an increase of around 70% over the last half year for car fuel here.
I am 7 minutes in and wondering if I really have to sit through 20 minutes to find the answer to the question.
"To be fair, $5.00 is worth about what 50 cents was a couple yeard ago, so in comparison to everything else, gasoline isn't that bad."
This could have been summed up with just two words. JOE BIDEN
In America we experienced a stolen election where mail in voting fraud was successful. Then the false president shut down all federal land oil production. Now we have 5 dollar diesel fuel. Thanks Joe.
"This isn't relevant to the economics of fuel but you know aside from the negative environmental impacts of fossil fuel industries, as an engineer I can't help but be fascinated by the technology that has made it such a major aspect of our lives.

I work at a plastics plant that's associated with a nearby oil refinery and looking at the mess of pipes, flare stacks, and distillation towers makes me think about the complicated processes that people had to figure out from scratch (and unbeknownst to them would contribute to major pollution and a looming climate disaster).

It's simply amazing how many different compounds come from a black fluid created by 10s to 100s of millions of years of geological processes turning dead plants and animals into the substance that accelerated the industrial revolution and thrust us into the modern era.

And the coolest part is at the most basic level you just have to distill it to separate it into useful substances."
"Maybe if people voted for Trump we wouldn't be in this situation??? Biden closed the pipe line WHY???? Didn't need to Biden and Harris and their Dumb ass administration had other ideas, Well Two years later they're still wrong! Weak leadership that doesn't know what to do and are just puppets for the elite MMMM! They have an agenda and want the poor poor and the rich rich! Poor leadership period! Might as well sell everything move to the country buy a little piece of land and have a piece of mind, grow your own Veggies and small food sources. Be happy with your family and not the material things in life!"
"Biden and excessive state regulation are what's causing oil/gas prices to soar in the US. A good example touched on in this video, how California's strict environmental policies contribute to higher production and marketing costs - you should've touched on how the president's halting of the Keystone pipeline due to political pressure is harming the oil industry. 

There are a lot of evils within the oil biz, but it's largely a necessary evil as it powers most of our daily lives. The same goes for nuclear energy, people always point out Chernobyl as a reason for being against it yet it was state mismanagement and broad coverups which contributed to that incident, even the HBO miniseries does a good job at highlighting that."
If the oil companies are posting record profits wouldn‚Äôt it entice smaller producers to create new fracking rigs to cash in on it thus eventually balancing out prices?
"Free markets are a lie. It's all been manipulated to the benefit of few, and keep a certain social order."
Is it just me or does 5.5 billion dollars for the longest pipeline in the world sound cheap?
It seems that they will get us one way or another. If I get an electric vehicle my electrical company will screw me. Big power will continue to rule one way or another. If I was younger I would probably go solar and put in battery packs and whatever it took to get off the grid. Good luck young people I am pulling for you.
"It's called financial terrorism. The economy is the fraud market and the fraud market is rigged by the government. You can't have anything make sense when the game is rigged.

"You're wrong the pandemic didn't cause the gas prices of today. Bad government policy did.  We were energy independent when the pandemic started, since Biden was ""elected"" the pipelines and pumping of American oil has been stopped."
11% taxes?  Meanwhile in Europe ~ 50%
no mention of Biden closing the Keystone Pipeline? Or Biden banning drilling on federal land? Because that had NOTHING to do with it üôÑ
"Correction, drilling rigs do not do the fracturing or ""fracking"".  First, explosives are set off at he desired depths, then hydraulic pumps brought in after the well is sealed in metal pipe and concrete to create pressure that is forced into the drilled hole to create the factures in the desired layers.  It is NOT CHEAP.  Smaller oil firms did this because they are forced to contend with lower production wells, of which fracturing allows them to get more or longer production from those wells.  You do excellent research... please make this correction."
@Tre16 Did you read the o.r.?
@Travis R. You're arguing on a YouTube comment section and talking about IQ lmfao
"Travis R. You are right on spot on this one.  It is not cheap, I am a Mud Logger, and there are several vendors on-site during the drilling process.  Apart from the company man, and the tool pusher, we have mud engineer, mwd engineers, directional drillers, mud loggers, solid waist collectors (who collect the cutting coming from the well) safety man. Then you have the external vendors, water dilvery, ceptic gineers, drill bit sales man, cheminal sales man/dilivery. There is so much going into drilling a well for production, and you are so right it is NOT CHEAP."
"@Travis R. He was so embarrassed, he deleted his comments."
"@God Slayer It isn't shilling for Big Oil to get the F'ing mechanics and steps behind the whole process correct.  I am LEED and EPA trained for sustainable design and construction.  Are you?  Doubt it, being sustainable requires IQ."
Bullshit propaganda.
This dude thinks everyone makes over 6 figs and that everyone can buy a Tesla. I think it‚Äôs near sighted to think that renewable energy is going to be a big player in the next 10 years. There is still so much profit to be made and when the US president changes the oil prices will go back down. Calling it now
"Lol you don't need six figures for a Tesla, and they aren't the only ones making electric cars. This argument sucks. Your second point is probably true, unfortunately."
Surprised how most people have forgotten 2020 oil prices falling into negatives m
Should definitely cover the baby formula shortage.
I have 12 brain cells so I think you're wrong. Let's go Brandon!
You use too many periods in your narration. It. Is. Annoying.
When ever you look at the price of fuel right now you have to take into account how much of that price increase is a make up charge for the loss the industry took to already invested resources when Biden Killed the heavily invested Keystone pipeline. Do you really think that The industry will sit back and take that kind of loss and when you add in the astronomically inflated costs of refinement under Biden's regulations and the fines associated with non compliance you can see why they cannot afford to keep refineries open either. Biden has made total enemies of one of Americas Vital Industries and cost them billions in investment losses and many times that in future earnings. The Progressives have screwed everybody via Biden and even Stopping the baby killing wont change the minds of enough Broke families to allow them to do anything of substance in the next 2 elections. It will take years to get back from this and that's only if we can get the progressives out of our pockets and into their own
Excellent explanation.
Of course it‚Äôs not the war you gottta be a total idiot to be believe a word that Joe Biden says blaming the high prices on Russia
9000 unused leases is misinformation.  The oil industry at its peak had 35000 leases.  Also owning a lease does not mean one can drill if access is limited and local permits are restricted.
nice

"Jeez.  Do I really have to bail out after only 20 seconds?  What does it mean for the price of something to drop by 300%?  That is just nonsense.  If an arbitrary unit of oil costs $1, and then it drops by 300%, any rational mathematical interpretation would say that its new value is $-2.  And I'm pretty sure I would have noticed if someone was paying ME to put gas in my tank.  Just to be clear: it is not possible for the value of something to drop more than 100%.

Stupid kids."
Oh wait.  I guess that IS what happened.  Never mind.
"So basically, the rising price of oil is another symptom of the slow, painful death of western civilization that we're currently in the middle of.   Makes sense."

"This video is nothing but propaganda and spin and I like how he just weaves a bunch of random events together to support his conspiracy if you know anything about Commodities trading or future Commodities market then you know why that one month two years ago oil went negative $40 a barrel and it had nothing to do with supply and demand it was a bunch of retail commodity traders who had bought future oil contracts with the intention of selling them at a later date to make more money they were speculating that the price would be higher and when covid head and a pandemic and the price of oil dropped dramatically they got stuck with all these contracts that they didn't know what to do with and on the very last day when all of these contracts were going to have to be filled and these people started to realize that trucks of oil were going to show up to their apartment in Manhattan they literally had to pay Oriole companies to buy the oil from them because if you live in an apartment in Manhattan you can't have 10,000 barrels of oil show up that you bought three months ago so they literally had to pay actual refineries to buy their oil contracts from them and take possession of the physical oil Commodities are not like stocks when you buy a stock you're just buying a piece of paper that says you own one share of a company when you buy a commodity you are actually buying that commodity and at some point you are expected to take possession of said commodity that's why buecher trading and commodity trading is a very risky form of investing what are you going to do with 10,000 Fork bellies if you are forced to take possession of them?

LOL the real reason that oil went negative $40 a barrel two years ago was because of all the little wannabe retail speculators that were playing with the big boys in the oil Commodities market and when their 90-day contracts at the end of the month had expired and they realize that they would either have to sell their contracts at any price or actually take possession of the oil that they had bought they panic and literally were paying companies to buy their contracts from them because if you're some Commodities Trader or retail person with an ETrade account and you bought thousands of barrels of oil on the Commodities Market with no intention of ever taking possession of it you had to get rid of those contracts at the end of the month when they expired and that's the real reason oil went negative $40
DRILL BABY DRILL
Obviously this guy has watched all of Oliver stones JFK movie where you take accepted and very well known facts of an event and then you weave all these random facts into a tapestry to support whatever insane narrative or conspiracy theory that you've come up with this is a very common version of propaganda the fact is is that there was no real evidence at all presented in this video that would collaborate any of the information in this video he simply regurgitating known facts about the oil industry without any sort of proof or any corroborating evidence to support his hypothesis in other words it's like many movies a nice work of fiction
YouTube is full of videos like this this is the perfect example of how you stitch together known facts with very compelling flashy video and then you create a narrative whether it's true or not and you use all of these random facts to support your narrative even though you actually don't have any proof that any of this is actually true it's simply one man's opinion of known facts and at the end of the day never underestimate people's greed which the video doesn't really address the greed of man
"Sounds like this video was sponsored by the Democratic Party.

We heard this same form of surrender to ‚Äúinevitability‚Äù back in the gas shortages (and stagflation) of the Obama years (remember ‚Äúthe ‚Äònew‚Äô normal?‚Äù)

As Thomas Sowell would say, ‚ÄúIf you let true free market forces work, things will correct themselves.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not falling for this video‚Äôs spin, and, crap.

Nice try."
"Oil's not going anywhere, we use oil in much much more than just gas."
"Bring back Trump! We were energy independent under him, and we were the #1 exporter of oil! Under Creepy Joe, we buy oil from Russia... WTF!?! Trump is about ""America 1st""! Biden is NOT!"
Joe Biden: I did that! FJB!
"I expected so much more from you than to propagate the ""9000 oil leases"" propaganda that the white house has been pushing. It's so much more complicated than that.

Simply put, these oil leases are mostly for DISCOVERY, and they only cover a fairly small plot of land. It requires more than just one lease to make drilling in the area viable at all, assuming there's even oil in that leased land (because most of the time, there isn't.) Most land that is explored in these leases will not turn up with any significant amount of oil. And with each rig that an oil producer needs to build on the plots that DO have oil, they need additional federal permits and leases to build the infrastructure like roads, pipelines, and rigs to get to these plots of land, extract the oil, and pump the oil out.

The problem is that the white house has been incredibly hostile to domestic oil production. The head of our own department of energy laughed at the prospect of expanding oil production mid-pandemic. It's not their platform and they openly campaigned against oil production. That's fine, if people want to move away from oil then great! But the white house has haulted these federal permits and leases and turned the blame around on big oil producers saying essentially what this video's conclusion is; they simply don't want to produce. That makes 0 sense when you realize most of the oil companies producing domestically that are being affected by the white house oil hesitancy are small oil producers who need to produce more oil to stay competitive. The guys with very few reserves and no over-seas drills. It makes 0 sense for any oil company to sit on oil leases when they have all the means of production already at their disposal, even for some supply and demand fuckery.

This stagnat number of ""9000 oil leases"" this administration has been using to gaslight voters for months is the greatest limiting factor that domestic producers have faced, that's why it's so controversial. The U.S. will continue to push away from domestic manufacturing in favor of importing like it's been doing over the last two years. 

In my opinion this is a national virtue signal where we're going to invest in other nation's oil production so that we can pretend to be clean and green on our side of the pond when we're still burning oil and making middle eastern and south american countries suffer the consequences and deal with additional American interventionism. Goin over-seas and buying oil at gunpoint is one of our specialties."
Let's Go Brandon!!!
"This is so stupid, i want to eat!  Tractors, combines, trucks boats planes use Diesel, bunker oil or jet fuel.

Invent the replacement FIRST before shutting those operations down.  Once i see a battery operated 600hp tractor working day and night to seed fields, with ten minute downtime for refueling, I'll feel better."
ONLY 5.5 BILLION For a PIPELINE FOR THE COUNTRY I LIVE In THATS  PEANUTS
What a big caucus
Just when I got a truck üòë
Why call petroleum . a liquid.  gas
"I highly doubt that this is the end for oil. We've been hearing that for two decades now and it never happens. Will renewables play a bigger part? Of course. But we still have decades to go with oil. Also, governments trying to rapidly transition from oil to renewables are idiotic and are harming their people"
"So he's saying when anyone that is able of fracking would make millions in this current market, they won't frack because of money, when nearly over 90% of everyday use requires oil or some form.  I call BS on the argument at the end."
"Still doesn't explain the recent pipeline dispute, and why fracking hasn't been able to pick up supply when demand is so high.  The reason is the recent political intervention from the administration of 2020"
The American govt. going to war with the oil and gas industry for renewables is not currently fees able. Its comparable to fighting a war against the U.S. military using civil war era weapons. Our muskets represent the shrinking U.S. dollar. Should have gone into partnership with oil/gas to develop a new source that isnt fossil based.
Both sides would passively deny the partnership.üòï
"you can't have a 300% drop, only 100% or less drops (a quantity can not decrease by more than 100% of itself).  you can however have 300% if it's to the upside (or any percentage higher than 100% works."
"Pipelines have been shut down in the US. People have been 'laid off'. The government officials currently in charge want people to buy electric cars.  It is proven that we are energy independent and can export oil when at capacity. Foreign influence on our market is a manufactured problem by the current administration. Priced will continue to rise until people buy electric cars, then taxes on electric will come to 'maintain' the roads."
"@bloodandguts weird, cause I just read we exported 8.6 million barrels of oil per day in 2021. I'm not gaslighting. I'm simply pointing out that 90% of this country's problems can be boiled down to cooperate greed. Rich get richer off the backs of hard working Americans."
"@Exceededcircle Because we no longer export oil we import oil. Gas is expensive under this administration. Everyone gets it, you are gaslighting."
"So how has this administration's changes effected all of the other nations oil prices and gas prices? While oil companies also post record profits like 100 billion dollars in just q1 of 2022. This is a greed problem, not a policy problem."
^^^
I wish you would stop. talking. like. this.
It‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs plan to ruin the country
did you watch the video lol
Basically they're bleeding us dry until we decide to make the switch away from oil
"It is all about making money. The higher the price a gallon of gas is the more money you can make in selling it. What is enough money for each person to make? Who cares as long as you can make more money? It all a big game of making more money. What are you going to do with all that money? Well, the governments will take their fair or unfair share of it."
"This is probably the least accurate thing you have made, but it was still somewhat accurate. The war did play a role in the prices, and the oil played a role in the reason for the war. No, I do not think high oil prices are here to stay. No, I do not for a moment believe we are shifting or even Truly, beginning that shift. It's not far off, but it's certainly not happening today. Renewables have a long long way to go. We likely won't see a decent amount of adoption in it until 2050."
"They ""cut back"" no they went out of business. The majority of land and wells has already been through an exchange since the crash. Only a handful of those smaller groups are still in operation. The 50+ year old company I worked at shut down after that negative drop."
Yes now a monster group control the price this video is just one way to get the people to except it
"how did Elon foresee all this happening way back in his college dorm days, so that he could strategically position Tesla against this? If he knew gas prices would be locked at high levels, it would pressure people to jump to electric cars, and so BOOM... Elon decides to position himself in the electric vehicle market, just like Bezos could foresee the shift of people buying stuff online and exploiting that to the max. Amazing! They must have advanced simulation rehearsals that reveal these things to them."
"Futurism is a skill, but so is it's implementation. If you're stuck in nowhere with nothing, foresight is no use at all."
"The Price went negative because of the sudden decrease in demand from Covid did it not? I feel like you should be mentioning that. It also seems to me that a big reason for the hesitancy of companies to re-invest in oil is political. The admin slashed the keystone pipeline.  It seems like as long as the Democratic party is in charge of the legislator and the executive branch,  there's serious uncertainty about future industry regulations concerning oil supply and refinement."
"this is super biased üóëÔ∏è. Oil isn't going anywhere, and wouldn't matter anyway. The same people who own oil are investing in electric to take from the market because they can. When that gets tired, it will be back to oil or whatever the next biggest sham is."
"While a few good talking points, but fatally flawed to people who work in the industry. Essay written by college educated but sadly no experience. #1 asphalt is a trash byproduct. But the price it is sold for more than pays for all refining of every other product (gas, diesel, kerosene, etc.). All the other products are 100% profit. #2 The current administration cut active permits from over 50000 to just over 9000, in one day. Not all the permits mean oil is there or how much is there. Just because you own a permit doesn't mean you can drill. A 2 to 3 year environmental studies have to be completed first. Another thing the current administration is not allowing, oil industry is stuck with 9000 permits they can't use. #3 you are correct the oil industry is not investing. Oil is a long term expensive investment which you also stated. The industry thinks 20 years down the road. No investment can be made in current political climate. In America, having one president being oil friendly and 4 years later a different administration declaring war on oil, kills the investment opportunity. Sadly the push for green energy only hurts the poor and puts strain on the power grid that it isn't prepared for.... So high gas prices lay strictly in the hands of the current administration who laughs(literally) when gas prices rise. 

Good video and essay though, even though it is b.s. It might convince or brainwash  some people who don't know how it really works. 35 years experience tells me your essay is flawed. I'm not pro oil or pro green energy. It will take both for humankind to survive and to keep the poor from being lost. 

My advice is to stick to things you actually know and not just pulled from some book or ideology. Live a little."
There is also the fact of the antihuman ESG agenda taking root at Black Rock and other large custodial investment management companies.
"I normally like you're videos, but as soon as you mentioned the 9,000 leases, I was looking for Jen Psaki as a source.. you bring up some good points, but, renewables and storage are not ready to replace fossil fuels for energy production, let alone electricity specific production.  if I'm wrong, do a video in the plans on who, how, when, time-frames and costs to do so...I have yet to see more than the same statements on the future, rather than a PLAN...As for those leases.   We are using more energy than ever. As is demonstrated by the current administration's pressure on OPEC to increase production and shopping other petrol producing countries .  The cost of energy is speculative in futures.  I'd like to see you cover this administrations regulations, the difficulty securing drilling permits,and how they effect drilling investment..  Your video came to a conclusion without reviewing these points... and by the way, China is still building coal plants.  I doubt with 5k comments at this point you'll even see this...but if you're going to have a discussion, it needs to be complete."
"You would have been more ""persuasive"" had you addressed the demolition by design of the oil markets, first by the insane lockdowns and then them killing the XL pipelines, since, as you say, it's the most efficient way to move oil......better luck next time"
"OK but not great overview. You have several factual inaccuracies here, I have to presume skipped over because of your personal biases. 
1. The invention of ""Fracking"" did not trigger the shale revolution. Fracking has been a common practice since the 1970s as a completion strategy in tighter rock. The Shale Revolution occurred when Petroleum Engineers under George Mitchell first successfully combined horizontal drilling with fracking. This was a quantum leap in energy generation, as instead of having to locate and exploit a highly mobile fluid in the shattered, topologically complex subsurface, energy workers could directly target the largely immobile oil entrained in the 'source rock'. This was likely the most consequential engineering breakthrough of the 21st century so far.
2. Shale is not a dense rock. RHOB (Bulk Density) of shale is the lowest of the three buckets sedimentary rocks are put into, with both Sandstones and Limestones being considerably more dense. This is important in petrophysical and geophysical evaluation. Shale is impermeable, as you correctly state, but that is not correlative to density. 
3. The Permian Basin isn't really a 'Shale Basin'. It certainly has argillaceous and TOC rich strata, but the fact that it was drilled for a century before the shale revolution should be a clue that the majority of target benches there are not shales. By that logic, all oil targets ever drilled were shale basins, as all require a generating source rock, which is almost always a shale. 
4. You mention the high wages created in oil boomtowns, but overlook the eye-watering checks we right landowners for right to extract minerals on their property, and critically, overlook the fact that Federal Leases to oil companies are literally the #2 largest source of revenue to the US Government after Personal Income Tax. Without us paying those leases, your taxes would increase noticeably. 
5. There aren't special fracking rigs, per se. The frac fleet is separate from the rig, and almost always run/owned by a different company. Fracks are put into wells months or years after the actual hole is drilled (a DUC--drilled uncompleted). Only 'frack rig' type thing would be a trend toward increased Torque/Horsepower on Top Drives in rigs over the last 20 years as horizontal wells, unsurprisingly, put a LOT more torque demands on the drill string and rig than a regular old vertical well. 
6. Operators didn't drill a bunch and swamp the market out of greed or total ignorance of supply and demand as you imply, but because we have 'drilling obligations' as part of any lease. Regardless of profitability, the landowners REQUIRE us to drill and complete a certain footage per year. Even if we are loosing millions on each well, we are legally obligated to drill the stipulated footage. There is no allowance for changes in oil price or services cost etc. Landowners will happily bankrupt an operator to make 20-30k overrides when they could have waived the obligation for a year and made 100x that. Seen it happen several times in my career. 
7. No mention of the role the Shale Revolution played in driving recovery from the Banker's 2009 Housing Crisis economic meltdown. Major topic glossed over for partisan reasons."
A really fascinating turn of events and a really wonderful development for Nebula!!
GREED
If leaders tried to force a quick move away from fossil fuels the effect on the economy and peoples lives would be catastrophic
"$5.5 billion seems like a good deal to me, the ram's new stadium cost about $5.5 billion"
Biden did this.
One word: Democrats
"More than ever, electric cars is going to become a thing. That's why everybody's making them. I can see gas cars slowly start to disappear as electric cars become more affordable to the point where majority of the people are going to be owning electric cars. I for one am up to the change. I'm a big fan behind Tesla because they're the ones that kind of started this. Yes we've had electric cars 50 years ago or something but none of it ever succeeded or had to push that Tesla gave it so we got to thank them because now everybody is competing with Tesla in the electric market from Ford to Hummer to a Porsche you name it even Kia now"
@snapon666 well from what I've seen not the idiots speeding but normal accidents it's been safer then in a regular car since no engine in the front
over a hundred years ago in the early 1900's there were dozens of electric car manufacturers and it was the battery tech that has always held them back ...you don't want to be in an accident in a car full of lead acid batteries
I figured this was the issue. I'm glad to see that somebody backed up what I was thinking
"All it took to cause gas prices to rise was Biden (and his puppeteer) shutting down the Keystone XL Pipeline in 2021. As soon as Trump opened up the Keystone XL Pipeline in 2017, the gas prices went down to under $2 per gallon. Biden is merely copying what Obama did."
@pryda22 Not understanding the mechanism behind planning for a future to gauge supply and demand.
"How was Keystone XL opened when it was not even 10% built, in 2021? God is laughing at you."
So it isn‚Äôt just stickers of Biden on pumps causing this
"Wouldn't it be nice if we were energy independent? 
Oh wait, we were... 

This is basic economics. Supply was decreased, demand ~ stayed the same, prices went up. Add to that inflation (companies also adjust their rates when inflation goes up, that's necessary.) and (as was shown here) decreased imports, you get expensive gas."
wellhead and bore out in multiple directions both horizontally and vertically making multiple wellheads redundant.
I disagree
"No, no, no. It's all Biden's fault. I know because Tucker told me so."
Why gas got so expensive? A Senile moron and Democrats stole the 2020 election.
"The Video was going well... until it abruptly stopped the titled topic, took a left turn, and very loosely tied in a save the world via renewables.
-- 
This totally negates the ""power"" of persuasion""  class.
If the author can't maintain a central topic... why would we listen to more?"
About 4% of cars on the road today are electric. No doubt the oil companies are worried. We'll still need oil for a multitude of products. Including automotive parts both gas and electric.
Your content is insanely well researched and explained so clearly. Well done again
That's if you believe global warming exists and is caused by human carbon dioxide (which its not and has been proven at least a dozen times and I can't stop laughing at how everyone believes the news lmfao).
"So oil is going to dry up for the most part. Scarcity will become the dominant force. All the petro chemicals used in consumer goods today will still be required in the future though. Useless byproducts from a barrel of oil will become gasoline and diesel and propane in the quest to extract petro chemicals from a barrel of oil to produce consumer goods. That surplus of oil which will be caused by renewables will likely cause oil to become dirt cheap at some point, maybe 20 30 years down the road and the renewable energy support chain to become very expensive as demand grows. OPEC nations will likely experience instability and wars will break out as their source of revenue drys up. By that time the much ignored depletion of ocean wildlife will be complete and the earths ecosystem will collapse but rest assured the profits will have been made for the few that are driving the great transition to a so called renewable energy world."
"I could shoot holes in sop many of these arguments, but let's start with this: People will not drill when their leases have been limited by the government. This occurred in Biden's first executive, drilling was limited. Not only that, oil that would have come from Canada and would have been refined and used was extremely limited because of the termination of future oil distribution by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline. You did not mention that."
It‚Äôs all Joe Biden‚Äôs a fault man literally vowed to take down the oil industry and his literally trying to destroy America
"I love how the fact of US energy policy wasn't mentioned once. Before 2021, the US had been emerging as a net exporter, thus taking the power away from OPEC to determine oil prices (also known as competition). When two companies fight against each other to get more sales, they don't increase cost, they decrease the price as an incentive to purchase their product over their competitor. However, when a company has a monopoly over the market (what OPEC more or less has now after US oil production has been capped/limited due to executive action) they have sole discretion over their prices and can charge whatever they want to suit their wallet. It's rather simple economics."
There it is.  I had to scroll down half a page to find someone with come common sense.  Thank you.
"@Aviation Hobbies 
Also simple economics: Oil from Iran and Venezuela was largely taken off the markets thanks to executive action. Ontop of Russia being in the process of being cut out. Finally, the failure to defend Saudi Arabia from attacks from Iran as well as the Jamal Khasogi fiasco resulted in Saudi Arabia being unwilling to increase production to help us out. Saudi Arabia along with OPEC is purposely restricting supply to artificially keep prices high. In the past, the US had sway over saudi arabia as an ally.

Finally, US companies are for profit, not for working for the good of the US government. They also want to take this opportunity to rake in some extra profits after many years of slim profit margins.

I think that even with US oil companies working full steam: they probably still couldn't replace the total supply lost from Venezula, Iran, and Russia."
@Brad Hicks  it makes no difference if there are unused permits to drill NEW WELLS if the companies can't even collect from existing wells due to executive action
"Did you watch the video, he explained in detail how it is not executive action but market forces.  Even stating there are a great quantity of issued permits not being utilized.
Now, yes, if the industry is taking into consideration Biden's intended policy to move away from fossil fuels it would impact the long-term strategic direction discussed being that of disinvestment and grab maximum $ now.  However, it has proved easy to derail those professed policy objectives as Biden has largely caved."
Joe Biden stopping pipelines and not approving any leases on federal land is the reason. We all know gas would be much cheaper under a Republican.
@pryda22 Not understanding the mechanism behind planning for a future to gauge supply and demand...
Oh the keystone XL pipeline that was 8% completed? That one? The same one that wouldn‚Äôt have been completed for another 10 years. Did you even watch this video before commenting? Did you watch this video before commenting on it? Sure doesn‚Äôt sound like it.
"Nice documentary...but doesn't change ANYTHING. Going to ""electtic everything"" just puts U.S. in deeper trouble and less conttol. Like the old days of Cable T.V. you can only buy what is sold in your area.. So if the ""power fails"" like it almost did in 2012 by a EMP that missed us by a week, then we get James Camrron's ""Dark Angel"" which was as posituve as he could make it and therefore ""unrealistic"". If the Gird shuts down, it is estimated ""civilization "" would be losr completey in a few months...."
"Basically our installed leader isn‚Äôt friends with oil, so why ramp up production just to see environmental regulations zap profit. The Chinese and the Russians have us just where the want us, arguing over frivolous things while they are holding all the cards."
Excellent summation.
I love this style of video and all the good information. Well researched. Im looking up all your work you got a fan
Lol you Californians do everything to justify your shity policies which created the most expensive oil prices of the country. Good luck with your renewable energies üòÇüòÇ
"If the oil industry wants a fight, let‚Äôs give them a fight. A car should be a luxury, not a requirement to support oneself and family."
"""A car should be a luxury"" 

How dare the plebs wanting to be not confined inside hamsterwheels..."
Thank good ol joe
"Okay but we WERE oil independent at one point, we clearly aren't now, so what caused that?"
"Your facts may be true but your inference that oil companies' profits are to blame for high prices is misleading.  The government has openly declared that it intends to destroy petro industry. Regulation, vast government credits and funding for alternative energy (non-competitive competitors) plus using non-democratic mechanisms like the arbitrary & ideological  ESG standards to obstruct  capital (both bank lending and government funding) are WHY the industry is focused on near term profits.  Under the previous administration, gas was $2/gallon.  This is not some random coincidence.   So ultimately a hostile government is why petro industry is not focused on long term growth and sustainability."
"Era of high prices is here to stay, it's kind like saying, manipulation is here to stay.  Once Electric vehicles hit 500 miles, oil will race to the bottom.  Btw, California produces a fair amount of crude oil and is a national leader in renewable energy production.  I had to buy a new mower last month and went with electric, so satisfying mowing the lawn and not smelling like oil and gas."
Thanks!
Biden
5.5 billion is nothing
"Oil industry is trying (and succeeding) to make us pay for their losses during the pandemic, and using the government's sanctions to russian oil as an excuse."
"This is why governments around the world  wants to break away from oil dependency and go green or nuclear, everyone is getting fed up with oils bullshit"
The oil industry currently has a scape goat. I doubt they'd do this if they didn't.
Bid3n put sanctions on us in US when he got in office. Stopped our oil rigs and pipeline. Caused energy shortage and rise in cost. Then his dumb sanctions on russia backfired on us as he designed them to . Wake up.
"Look, I'm not very knowledgeable on this kind of thing but doesn't oil move the world along as we know it? Without it we starve. Farms need to fuel machinery. You need fuel to run everything pretty much. Am i understanding this wrong and this is saying that oil isn't a safe investment and on it's way out? I don't buy any of that but it's just my opinion. Engines litterally fuel every facet of our way of life. If I'm wrong, I'll accept that but just doesn't add up to me. Prices were ok before the war in Ukraine but now are skyrocketing."
ohhh 'Gas'. Took me 10 mins to get what you meant.
I don't think renewable resources are just around the corner from replacing oil... Even the biggest purveyor of electric cars and pusher of renewable resources is not naive enough to believe that the end immediate end of oil is either practical or realistic.
"This will be a good thing in the long run as the high price will drive consumers to go with alternative forms of energy. Most of my friends and family don't see it this way, they only see that it's costing them now, and it seems that's all they really care about."
"@D G Gasoline engines in automobiles will become a thing of the past and only used under special circumstances. You might not like it but it's happening. I build drag racing chassis for a living, there are now a few 200mph electric drag cars coming on the scene. The instant torque from the electric motor as compared to a gasoline or fuel engine is such that there is no need for a transmission and the cars have a better 60ft time than gasoline and fuel powered cars, also you don't have to carry around jugs of expensive and dangerous gasoline or racing fuel. Plus there's no motor oil, transmission fluid, radiator coolant, or exhaust fumes, and they are super quite. Most of the racers I know are like you, they don't like what's coming either. I remember when dirt bikes were all two cycle and everyone said four strokes would never keep up, well now everyone runs four strokes if they want to win. Electric motorcycles are also happening."
"@Charles Zorn my point was that even if we mass produce anything including electric cars, it doesn't mean that the price will fall down as evidenced by the smartphone industry or even the current car industry. Check the car prices in 2000 and compare them to modern day cars and you will notice that all prices do is go up.

The notion that the mass production of EVs will somehow lower their price isn't an accurate one, because EVs have been a thing for more than 20 years now.

As for ""why I'm afraid of change?"" I'm not. I'm all for change as long as it's organic. This though isn't. It's the demolition of the American independence of the energy sector and putting it under China's control via their American proxies in congress and corporations.

And if you think that is a crazy conspiracy theory just look who has the on of the largest lithium industries in the world: China.

Who has 0 petrol reserves? China

Even if we look at the Paris accord we will see that the US has taken way more responsibilities to curb their emissions, while the likes of China did some basic symbolic gestures despite being at the leading precipice of harmful emissions. Do see any outrage about that? Why not?

It's not that hard to see that the CCP are using their bribed agents in the US congress and the American corporations to push this agenda as a ""green initiative"" and a ""fight against climate change"" and save our future while making America less energy independent.

To answer your question: why would I embrace a change that would limit my freedom and the freedom of my descendants."

"@Charles Zorn Hate to break to you buddy, but brand new flat screen tv's are still in the 2000$ range.

But hey ho, you are saving the planet while these ""green activists"" fly around in their private jets all other the world lecturing everyone on how we should reduce emissions while buying multi million dollar mansions on the bank of Martha's Vineyard or Florida."
Bidens son doesn‚Äôt make any money here in US. Why do you think Biden is sending so much money to Ukraine. Hunter got his gas business down there
"So many disingenuous points here that calls into question the entire video. Some of what I caught was
1. You said there were 9k unused permits but you failed to mention that before Biden the average permits were 35k, Biden has stopped the permitting process.
2. That sudden price drop was because Biden shut down the economy and scared everyone into staying home using false case numbers and over reporting of infections and over reporting of hospitalisations, any case with infection was reported to be there because of the infection. Example: At the er for a broken leg and test positive for infection, you are now reported there BECAUSE of the infection, not the broken leg. 
3. Renewables will never be able to replace all of the products oil creates. From durable plastics to almost every medication made, all depend on chemicals that can only be found in oil. 
4. Renewables suck, many studies have proven that ""green"" solutions produce more carbon than what they replaced. Example: electric cars have proven to generate 10-20% MORE greenhouse gasses over their lifespan than traditional vehicles. From production of the batteries, charging of those batteries on the current grid and disposal of those toxic batteries actually produce more Co2 than just using traditional technology.
I'm all for a cleaner, better environment but one has to be open and unbiased reality they create."

Also, oil. ;D"
I know what you did there
Speculation   That is all...We as humans using the same amount of oil we driving the same distance.they producing the same amount of crude oil...SO!!!! why the price is too high...SPECULATION  1000 times SPECULATION..why should i sell my oil for 50$ a barrel  when i can sell it for 150$
"I was on board the whole time but let's face the facts, we are nowhere near a time when we can part with oil, renewables aren't here, not to take over yet. Not to mention we need oil to produce those ""renewables"" so no, oil isn't going anywhere. We still need plastic to make your electric cars so you need oil. Solar is laughably inefficient, and so is wind. Nuclear is the most efficient and always has been but that train is still in the station. Oil and gas ain't going away anytime soon. We'll all be long gone and turned to dirt before oil is out of date. This is simply a matter of greed, not obsolescence. I mean let's face it, most countries on the planet are still powered by coal, something that is leaps and bounds above solar and wind but nothing compared to oil and gas in terms of efficiency. This is a temporary price point, and we all know it most just won't admit it. Until electric cars become properly affordable to low earners (who make up most of a countries population) and nuclear takes over oil will be here"
BIDEN'S FAULT!!!!!! MAGA
"How can the value of anything plummet 300%?  That would mean something was worth ten dollars and now it's not only worth nothing, you owe $20 to someone for it.  I don't think that's quite what happened, but whatever the situation was, there's got to be a better way to phrase a description of it.  You could just hang on to it and not owe anyone anything, so I think it's fairer to say it fell 100%.
  Let's say you buy an awful car for $100 and it crumbles a day later.  You have to pay $300 to have it hauled away.  Its value didn't ""plummet 400%""."
"But that's the point - with futures you don't have the option to hang on to it.  If you have a future contract that specifies that you will buy x barrels of oil at $75/bbl on a given date then you either have to execute the contract or settle it.  For example, if the projected price of the underlying commodity is $85/bbl then the contract has a notional value of $10 - if the projected price then drops to $55/bbl then the contract has a notional value of -$20.

If you hit the contract date and the market price is still $55/bbl then you have to either execute the contract (I.E. buy the oil at $20/bbl more than its market price) or pay the counterparty $20/bbl to buy them out of the contract.

This is why futures are extremely dangerous."
"He actually said that it was a ""staggering"" cost to build a pipeline at $1.5 million per mile?   Compare that to the cost of building a highway capable of transporting that oil.   That would be anywhere from $7 million to over $14 million per mile, then having to overhaul every few years at $2 to $4 million per mile.  So yeah, Biden shutting down our pipeline did affect the price of gas in America, along with many of his other policies.  Many on the leftü§£ still claim that he had no effect on the price of gas.

Negative oil prices sounds like a huge lie.
Do they really think people are going to switch to electric vehicles? That shit is expensive and unrealistic
"FOR YOU YOUNGER GENS:  There was a time not long ago when the rising price of a barrel of oil was reported as a bad thing, for obvious reasons. But today the very opposite is true. Leftist publications love to tell you that the rising costs of oil is a good thing. The manner in which it is reported is exceptionally deceptive to the ignorant. Its the same thing when it comes to taxation in America. The left cannot tax you enough. Its ALWAYS the same when the dems are in the whitehouse, like it or not, its historically factual."
"Thousands of unused permits, doesn't mean those were profitable, likely not, and investment under this regime, why would you, your own government is threatening your business as the enemy."
"Oil is not disappearing for a long long time. All of our infrastructure is still very dependent on oil.  Just looking at transportation, even if every person in the US switched to electric cars, you still have diesel electric trains, diesel powered ships, tractors, trucks, kerosene powered airplanes.... Not to mention all the developing countries who still burn oil to light their houses. Most of the worlds population can't afford ""clean alternatives"" like solar and electric cars. (As a sidenote, lithium mining is terrible for the environment, so your Tesla is not as clean as you want to believe.) The ""carbonless future"" is still a very long way away, if it comes at all."

"Renewables cannot possibly supply the energy needs of modern civilization because their energy density is too low. The oil pigs know that, so they just jack up the prices while keeping supply low. Bastards. There's a way out: Generation 4 nuclear technologies, with walk-away-safe molten salt reactors, and cheap, plentiful thorium fuel, and some that even burn stockpiled nuclear waste as fuel. But fear and ignorance abound, and Gen 4 nuclear remains the solution no one knows about. (sigh)"
"@Winston Oatsvall Did you not know that the term ""walk-away safe"" has nothing to do with the materials of construction? Rather, it refers to the fundamental physics underlying the operation of the reactors, whose intrinsically fail-safe characteristics rely on the laws of nature, and not on any human intervention or even any automated safety features. Meltdown is impossible. Apparently you were unaware of that fact.¬†

BTW, your assertion about ""no material that can perform..."" is simply false. The materials that can perform satisfactorily in such an environment are currently being used in the prototype reactors already in operation or construction. They will require maintenance, but so do all other forms of power generation. That is a fact of life, and it is not relevant to the ""walk-away safe"" design specification.

I'm not sure what your point is regarding U-233. If your purpose in mentioning it is to invoke the Uranium Boogeyman to frighten me, it didn't work. I prefer scientific fact rather than ignorance and fear.

U-233 is a by-product of the thorium fuel cycle‚Äîa source of fissile uranium fuel that is available without having to mine non-fissile U-238 for costly enrichment into fissile U-235. The fact remains that the fuel is thorium, which is why it's called the thorium fuel cycle. Thorium is readily available, and thorium reactors consume ~95% of their fuel, by contrast with fast breeder reactors, which produce ~95% waste."
"Did you not know that the materials used to manufacture the various reactor components will be exposed to hot salts that are chemically corrosive, while being bombarded by radioactive particles. So far, there is no material that can perform satisfactorily in such an environment.  So ""walk-away-safe"" is not true. Thorium is not able to power a reactor by itself. It has to be bombarded with neutrons to create, guess what?  Yep u-233, so they are not really thorium reactors, just U-233 reactors.   Apparently no one knows about it still."

"Very misleading video. Citing the 9k unused drilling permits that companies aren't using because of ""corporate greed"". No mention of Covid-19, no mention of oil over-supply (although the ""negative prices"" implied this), no mention of the Biden administration's war on energy. The energy density of gasoline is about 46 MJ/kg Lithium-ion batteries are at 2.4 MJ/kg. They've improved -- ten years ago Lithium Ion batteries were around 1.7 MJ/kg...but we're still talking about over an order of magnitude difference.

Oil and Gas are going to be here a long time. Is plastic going away too? Propane, butane... paraffin, tar, etc... it all comes from oil!

The idea that the global economy would be overturned on account of the most competitive alternative to gasoline now being 1/20th the efficiency is nonsense.

If there's one thing I learned from my time in corporate America, it's that companies want to just keep doing the same. The era of oil won't end because of some rosy corporate idealism about green energy and saving the planet, etc...it'll end when we run out of oil. And if we're lucky, that will be a gradual, decade-long process that won't be as painful as what the average consumer is experiencing now."

"‚ÄúThe prevention of the destruction of the planet‚Ä¶‚Äù  What a grossly irresponsible, sloppy comment.  Up til now I thought your videos have been reasonably analytical.  But with your casual comment you are carelessly buying into and perpetuating a mass stampede mentality:  there is zero evidence that humans are THE cause of climate change.  How ignorant are you?  The climate has been changing‚Äîcycling hot and cold‚Äîcontinuously for more than THREE BILLION YEARS.  That‚Äôs what hard science (geology) irrefutably shows.   And such natural change, sometimes slower, sometimes faster, has NOT destroyed the planet.

Geology.  I‚Äôm talking real science. Not Al Gore science, not Bill Nye science, not vote-for-Progressives-because-you‚Äôll-save-the-planet science.  And not 50-year or 100-year computer models that can never be checked‚Äîand that are subject to high-stakes political distortion and the new extreme zealotry, the new religion, of human-caused climate change.  I‚Äôm talking hard science, not politicized science theory or garbage-in-garbage-out computer projections.  I‚Äôm talking unpoliticized hard science, geology.

Your casual phrase ‚Äúdestruction of the planet‚Äù is of course not based on hard science.  It‚Äôs at best based on political fear-mongering resting on deeply fallible, highly manipulatable computer modeling‚Äîi.e., purportedly modeling the infinitely complex climate of the entire globe for a half century or full century out in time‚Äîwhen other similar but MUCH more modest fluid dynamics models (weather models) CAN‚ÄôT EVEN PREDICT the tiniest slice of the atmosphere across a tiny sliver of geography for a miniscule amount of time, e.g., a week‚Äôs projection of the path of a hurricane along the US coast.   

And no I don‚Äôt work for an oil company or own any oil company stock.  I just hate to see an energy system, that has been the foundation of endless innovation and rampant prosperity and freedom, dumped by a political movement full of boobs who create crises for political and dollar profits.  

I have lived long enough to watch boobs and charlatans use ‚Äúscience‚Äù to start a secular feel-good religion‚Ä¶to create a political power machine, by frightening people who have no clue apparently that dreaded climate change is a natural ongoing process and has been for billions of years, without the planet imploding.  

And speaking of Al Gore pseudo science‚Äîname me one American city that has been innondated by human-caused, non-natural, rising sea level in the last 30 years as predicted by Gore and Hollywood and various Leftist pols.  In fact name me any city that has been innondated by encroaching seas.  Which one?  I‚Äôve watched both coasts for 50 years.  No city is innondated, no town.  The CORE PREDICTION of the global warming alarmists for decades and decades.  Innondated cities.  Alarmist, but useful political nonsense.  The dire predictions of the climate change zealots have been and are hype and nonsense.

And don‚Äôt waste my time with cities like Norfolk that are on subsiding terrain or New Orleans built below sea level‚Äîbeing affected by storm surges.  (And what happened to the dozens of Katrina-like hurricanes that we were supposed to see ravage the US in the last 17 years?  And don‚Äôt waste my time with ‚Äúextreme weather‚Äù hysteria; ‚Äúextreme‚Äù weather has been going on since earth formed an atmosphere.)

And last‚Äîwho says climate change will ‚Äúdestroy the planet‚Äù?  What a ridiculous sloppy comment.  Who says that?   Why of course, sloppy journalists and Leftist politicians, the high priests and priestesses of the climate change religion, who must of course never be questioned‚Ä¶politicians who stand everything to gain by a terrified stampeding population."

"assuming this is all true, this is an impresive amount of information to learn and then say in a youtube video"
"it doesn't matter at all what the global price of oil is and how every nation went up because the simple fact is under republican leadership the US prices were low because we were so independent in our oil production that we were selling excess oil to other countries. when biden took office, he shut down the keystone XL pipeline as well as fracking and ended our energy independence which meant within a month the price per gallon in the US was already up 50% from when he took office. throughout the rest of the year it would keep climbing until it had already more than doubled before the war even started. these are indisputable facts."

No supply has actually changed hands and the tens of thousands of gallons the gas station has sitting in its tanks which is paid $X for are now suddenly worth $X+0.10? That's not supply and demand that's I have something you need and I'm going to raise the cost of it because I want more money."
Greed is a /major/ factor
@Brad Coleman The oil and gas industry has been manipulating supplies and costs since the early 2000's at least. I do see what he's talking about as far as market manipulation for short term profits over long term investments. I mentioned supply and demand because he mentioned it in the video.
I thought his main point was that they've chosen profit in the short term over re-investment. Supplies are certainly controlled/manipulated/hidden. No doubt about that. The question is WHY are those supplies and cost being controlled right now? The answer according to this video is to grab as much money right now as possible due to an uncertain future.
artifical scarcity.
"What about the fact that oil was close to $150/barrel under W and gas and diesel was never even close to $5/gal. Damn Oil companies are gouging us horribly. Right now oil is trading at circa $107/barrel and diesel is at $5.39/gal or higher. This has nothing to do with Biden or the war and everything to do with Oil Companies who receive BILLIONS in tax payer dollars to look for oil, robbing us."
Nice video but why are you randomly talking about California? Such a weird thing to do.
"""World leaders have little to no impact on gas prices is what I hear in this persuasive essay."" The spin is real."

Or is Joe Biden playing dumb while rubbing elbows with Chinese Communist Party Leaders and modeling the new Misinformation Committee or Bureau or Agency and translating their public affairs civilian relations policies, and implementing their methods for his pro socialism, blind denial, anti-constitution, anti-capitalist, propagandized citizen censorship, and executive privilege ordered policies on regulating free speech, with his feigned status of complete ignorance giving him plausible deniability as he implements laws under the radar with littke or no sales pitch during the virtue triggered backlash over the bogus Roe vs Wade leak bullshit, nothing took place to initiate public outcry other than falsely installing the loser of the election by blatantly stealing it with Communist Party Designed Dominion Voting Machines post count deadline vote counting, mail in votes dead people votes, ballot stuffing ballot destroying, vote count tampering."
very interesting video !
Literally everything about electric cars makes more sense than doing this. Especially if we can get rid of the problem materials in batteries.

"Not just only war on Ukraine, but also inflation."
Renewables  will never overtake  oil  .  The energy density is just not there .. at the moment  Renewables actually  have a larger carbon footprint  than oil . So the idea is nice  but it's bs
"Cool opinion, wrong though."
"Fantastic research and footage, as always!"
What caused the high gas prices?..Biden...ruined our energy independence..
How did he do that?
No
"It was Joe Biden, he stole the election from Trump using ballot harvesting mules and tried to implement ""socialism"" and it caused gas prices to rise because the free market was very scared that wealth creators are now being persecuted by Brandon's ""socialist cartel"".

Or maybe it's this stuff in the video, I dunno ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
The reason is greed plain and simple.
Just Pryor to Joe and the ho taking office the united states was energy independent but as soon as the communist Chinese agent took office he put a stop to it
When did insane asylums get Internet.
"‚ÄúThe end of oil is near‚Äù

Demand isn‚Äôt even slated to peak until after 2035. And from the peak it‚Äôs a long way to zero."
Negative oil under Trump caused lack of confidence in investing...shocking.
im so glad i use solar and recycled batteries for transportation
But the GQP vandalized a million gas pumps so I could 'thank Biden'.

"11:27 - ooh how funny is to watch video cantered on US market, in US 11% of tax is considered ""major"" contributor to petrol price... In Europe tax is ~60-80% of petrol price depending on the country... Talking about impact on consumer prices by excessive taxation - how about that?! 
For example in UK there is static fuel duty which is ¬£0.5795/L (or ~$2.72/US Gallon), then on top of that 20% of VAT (sales tax) is added. Meaning that when we buy 1L of petrol in UK at current price of ¬£1.47/L (~$6.89/US Gallon) 59% of that is just tax on top of the actual price of petrol which is ¬£0.5965/L (~$2.80/US Gallon). Even if petrol would be literally free we would have to pay ¬£0.6954/L (~$3.26/US Gallon) for it. When petrol price drops (as it had done few years back) to ~¬£1.10 this tax makes up even bigger part of price (73%) because of how duty is set-up as static amount."
One major aspect that was somewhat eluded to but not outright said is that banks and large investment players have their hands tied and don't want to invest in fossil fuels due to ESG (aka CCP style social credit score).
Oil is not going anywhere. Its needed to build every renewable energy source.
You failed to mention the political landscape in the US. They don‚Äôt reinvest in production  because they‚Äôre scared of the crazies.
1:28 what cartel idiot west impealis

"lol because of lack of confidence in the future they give motivation for people to change from being dependent on them in the future 
they could provide stability and get certainty, but profits today are more important then profits for generations 
instant gratification, humans are idiots"
No mention of how US was a exporter in 2016-2020 and no mention of keystone pipeline... kinda sus
the covid virus was released to make gas more expensive
Wow‚Ä¶ok. Never thought of it that way. Thank you for the education Wendover!
Build the frigging pipeline!!!
Let's go Brandon.
what a nonsense video. Renewables with current tech is the biggest sham of the century
Wrong.
You could have saved 20 minutes and just said one word... Biden..
@Will Vandermeer and that is unrelated.
@a fax machine no actually not. 2 years ago gas was $2
@Page 2 good excuse. Let me close down pipelines and not have things to replace them.
And you would be wrong.
"Only 11% Tax? Oh boy, try Sweden, OVER 50% of the price on the pump here is just tax because politicians hate gasoline and want everyone to afford a Tesla which is bullshit."
"I thought a 22 minute video would finally educate people on the real cause. Unfortunately, your video spent very little time on the real cause and almost didn't mention it at all. Most of the video was spent on talking about some random state that produces oil and a 5.5B price tag. Yawnnn.  A single bank could cover the entire cost. Supply doesn't matter because any overproduction can simply be held as reserves and not be dumped into the market. The only time your video glossed over the real reason was when you mentioned 60% of the cost is the actual oil itself. 

It's very unfortunate you chose not to dedicate much time to 60% of the cost influence. Speculation and inflation is what lead to the increase. The REAL reason of the soaring price in oil is INFLATION of the American dollar. The stock market was in freefall once covid hit and of course, Donald Trump would not let that happen because he loved bragging about the stock market. He instructed Jerome Powell to announce Infinite Quantitative Easing which is literally the Fed printing out infinite money in order to buy up assets in the struggling markets in order to prop them up and make sure they do not keep falling. This of course led to a soaring rise in the stock market because you would be an idiot to fight against an infinite money printer and with 0% interest rates, a hedge fund or company could use that easy money to buy up its own stock or any asset. The result of this buying frenzy culminated into today's inflation. Inflation is the measure of cost of regular consumer item costs or CPI (Consumer Price Index). The price of Oil of course is decided by the free markets. That means that hedgefunds and the Fed were able to buy up Oil and prop it's price up because Oil itself is a tradeable commodity. Just as lumber, pork, wheat, cotton , steel , coal etc all are. Oil is not the only commodity that skyrocketed, all of the previously mentioned also all skyrocketed over 100% in value because the price was tied to the rising asset values from infinite buying of these assets. So who cares that money was being pumped into these commodities and markets started to recover? That is a healthy market, right? Except that a commodity is literally what the average person buys. If Oil is traded at $100 a barrel (42 gallons) it would mean that the underlying Oil is $2.38/ gallon. All of a sudden, infinite money is buying up Oil futures and has propped up the price of the barrel to $220/barrel or $5.23/ gallon. Whenever a person goes to the pump, now they will have to pay $5.23 for that gallon of Oil because of the propped up commodity price. It doesn't matter when AAPL stock rises from $150 to $250. The average person can forego buying AAPL stock. The average person can not forego buying Oil when it is propped up. To make matters worse, the US controls the entire world through the dollar. Every single commodity is traded in the dollar so if the dollar ever has inflation, it means the commodity will also rise in price because it is traded against the inflated US Dollar which is why Oil prices rose throughout the entire world, not just the US. A common misconception people have is that inflation is measuring the currency when it is actually measuring the price of commodities that are traded in the free market. 

Your video was actually pretty dull imo and I kept checking how much time was left until it was finally over. I tuned out a lot in many of your irrelevant arguments as well. There was so much potential but you did not go much into the 60% you mentioned and completely glossed over. A more appropriate title would be WHAT makes gas expensive not WHY is gas expensive because you spoke of all the factors that were baked into the price but not the actual reason."
But that profit gouging strategy is going to fail when the government takes over and controls oil production and prices...while unlikely it COULD happen sooner than you think.
So in other words the Wests low production is Biden's fault.
"""The oil industry ain't going down without a fight!"" - I love how Sam points this out"
"There is nothing we can do to stop ""the destruction of the planet."" Climate change is a naturally occurring cycle and humanity needs to adjust and adapt not waste niey and lives trying to stop it. PS. The planet will go on, it's been thru this many times. Humans just need to deal with it."
Biden.
$5.5B is still cheaper than the new Narrows Bridge.
"I remember because I took a pay cut that I never got back, so i risk my life for people to have energy to fuel their lives. I am away from my family for months at a time as are most of my coworkers in this industry. That's ok because cheap labor is on its way legally crossing the border every day."
Defining OPEC as a 'cartel' as if they were an illegal drug organization is hilarious. Simply becasue they are not on the same team as the US. (Although they sorta are)
"@Azurite But fake scarcity is the key behind capitalism as a whole. That definition would apply to a myriad of organizations around the globe. The only reason they call them a 'cartel'  is to defamate a group that opposes the traditional power structure. I'm not denying their cartelization, just that it is a word that is used very selectively and usually with an agenda."
@Azurite So think all these counties are operating as one world gov to keep oil prices high even though they got pull it from the ground and there‚Äôs limited supply and they can‚Äôt just make it.
Their entire philosophy is to make sure the price of oil is never cheap to retain power at the expense of regular citizens. How is that not a cartel?
Time to go electric
"Because the oil cartels want us to pay more after a few year of record low prices, I summarized the whole video in 10 seconds"
Holy crap. Slow down. 20 mins of anxiety wrenching narrative.
"So what I gather from this is the US needs to nationalize the oil industry.
The companies only care about profit and have no incentive to drill so there's no reason why they should be allowed to hoard a limited resource then."
Republicans think it's biden fault. It's like blaming trump for the record number of sexual assaults just because he's a serial rapist and pedophile.
"""From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."" Matthew 4:17.."
A carbonless world would mean death for all of us.
This happens every single time a liberal is in the office. Look back on history. Every. Single. Time. Roll some corporate and politician heads and those prices will come back down.
"That's the most one sided nonsensical rant.   End is near?  So the planes,cars,boats,farm equipment just not factoring that in for demand eh.  Or the dozens of taxes and restrictions an regulations from sleepy joe.  Think your rainbow bandana is on to tight there bud seems to be cutting off circulation to your brain.  Another halfwit channel to block."
LET'S GO BRANDON!!!
tldr; Peak Oil.
Biden.
"If the industry was smart, they would find a way, to cut the price, to slow down, progress to cheaper alternatives"
His tune and way of delivery fits well for starting a propaganda. Full of inaccurate information.
"So basically, all this higher prices is because of human greed, deliberately manipulating the market by lowering supply? Fucking pigs as always"
Here's a little fun fact that absolutely blew my mind. I am not trying to get into politics idc who you voted for but I have for so long heard that Trump got us cheap gas that my mind was absolutely blown away when a picture I took at a gas station  on January 26 2016 an entire year before trump got into office popped up in my memories on FB. The price of gas was $1.33. It's so engrained in people's mind's that gas got cheap under trump that people think I'm lying when I say that lol. It in fact was dirt cheap under Obama in 2016.
Because of bad president.
"The Biden administration opposes the domestic oil production that Trump administration championed. Add the man made pandemic and the Russian/Ukraine conflict to the mix, that's the main reason why we're seeing record high gas prices."
Dallas sucks
5.5 Billion isnt that much nowadays. Elon Musk just bought Twitter for 44 Billion

Green house gasses grow plants, in a C02 deficient period on earth greener is better greener isn't less C02 it more . Its not the exhaust pipes destroying the world,  it is arrogant to think we have that much in influence over the climate what's going kill us is the ego controlled ignorance of a  cult that is burning it to the ground wake up its too late we missed it..."
Joe Biden loves OPEC and Russia being in charge instead of US...makes u wonder...
Joe did that!
Complete BS. This kid has no idea what he's talking about. YT has become click bait garbage created by kids and clowns.
"Umm, did you forget the funny parts?"
5.5 billion dollars. That's chump change to the us military. But hey you know what and stuff good.
"9000 is not a lot, its below average"
great video. hopefully gas prices favor the consumer sooner than later

At the end of the day it‚Äôs the average joe at the fuel pump that gets screwed with this. We‚Äôre caught in a terrible limbo where electric cars aren‚Äôt cheap or viable enough for most people and gas is too expensive
Building more public transportation is the way forward
"Yep, all because an administration feels compelled to force an issue so that they can feel morally virtuous."
"@twistershift You're ignoring that demand is kept high through aggressive marketing which in turn comes from poor regulations. 

It costs a lot of money to manufacture vehicles with lower emissions, yet the government enables auto-manufacturers to produce 34% more CO2 emissions per mile with larger vehicles. (this is the lowest its ever been during the truck boom it was damn near 40%) Thus manufacturers saved money on designing more polluting motors.

This was the entire reason for the so called ""crossover"" market, it enabled manufacturers to produce smaller vehicles and classify them as trucks and or vans to skirt emission laws."
"Meh, the average Joe isn't completely innocent. Remember very few people actually need full-size trucks or 500 horsepower cars, but we keep buying them, thus keeping that demand sky high. Yeah, there are necessary things we can't get away from easily that use oil, but we still abuse the privileges we have probably more than we should."

Simple answer stock market investors and oil companies already see renewable energy is going to take over the industry and oil is on its way out  have fast technology is moving  20 to  40 years may seem like a long time but it's short when they see the writing on the wall how renewable energy is moving so fast and being developed so they don't want to invest and drill more oil when it can take that money and buy up and move into the renewable energy sector cuz look at how many car companies are making electric cars more and more as the years go by Tesla release their first electric car in 2008 and it only been 14 years and you can see how fast electric cars have grown from a niche market to the main New market for car company and consumers oil will still be needed but and another 10 years you can see the oil industry probably drop by 50% so they're all just getting their money now cuz they know it's already over with
Gas still isn't expensive!  Americans don't know what high gas prices are.  Gas prices are where they were in 2004 when GWB was well into the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.  Am I the only one who remembers this?  Sure it was only $4 a gallon but at the time I was only making $10/h at the time.  Gas is still cheaper in America than most of the rest of the world.  THERE IS NO SHORTAGE.  Calm the fuck down.
The South American nation of Gyana is now supplying North America also as of a year or 2 ago
"Oil companies are only going to invest more, when they feel safe in doing so.  Under Biden, one of the biggest morons to ever ‚Äúso-called‚Äù be elected, there is no safe profit in oil.  Put Trump or a Republican back in and watch prices drop for the consumer like a rock again."
"The argument is sound, except for the assumption.  The essay is framed that oil is used only for gasoline production.  in reality, only about 40% is used for gasoline (according to the US Energy Department).  It is still a sizable chuck, but other uses of oil are still used mainly in plastics and chemicals.  The cost of oil doesn't only affect the price at the pump but on the manufacturing of everyday products.  While we have strides in using bioplastic alternatives, it is not enough at present day to fully replace oil."
No it's directly the fault of the administration. You cannot tell me that it's just coincidence that every time a window licking dem gets in office oil prices skyrocket.
"I appreciate you putting the references in the description, it helps me understand this alot better."
How much did Biden pay you?
"this is good honestly, hopefully when we fully switch to renewables there might still be oil left for use in other thigs"
"So‚Ä¶we could have cheap domestic fuel, but not everyone wants to share.  Nice."
"Someone will flood the market again. When prices are high, it's money making time! But it won't happen overnight"
It kind of seems like this is a greater political issue that the Biden administration can change. You didn‚Äôt give a good enough reasoning and seemed like you stayed from the actually reasoning. Why did the market suddenly lose??
"It's the one world government.  Destroy our economy,  starve out anyone who does not submit to full government control bc of famine disease and poverty"
This is so inaccurate it's comical. Btw renewable energy is a fairytale and a lie.
@WARLOCKDOG There‚Äôs not enough batteries for everyone to drive electric cars also batteries are worse for the environment than getting oil out the ground is.
What you're not understand it is he's saying what oil company and stock market investors who invest in oil and gas already knows oil and gas is basically on its way out already they're going to all switch over to renewable energy industry even if it take 20 to 50 years so they rather get their money now as they're jumping ship and investment in renewable energy companies for when that time come. Look at electric cars and think about Tesla as an example they release their first car in 2008  in that 14 years electric cars have made a huge leap forward and other renewable energies so give it to 50 years oil and gas it's going to be a small market being used by industries that can't switch over to electricity or some form of renewable energy look at the car industry they know about electric cars and know how to make them more than 40 years ago and chose not to and look at them now all switching over trying to catch up to other electric car companies this is happening to a lot of industries now. Look at truck driver industry it's already on its way out cuz of self driving trucks so give 20 to 40 years the number of truck drivers in the US and other first world countries it's going to be super low. It's not renewable energy forcing oil and gas out it's technology doing it
"The other side of the story is that the leases that are open have no to little oil on that land so oil companies will not drill where they can‚Äôt make a profit that‚Äôs worth it. I can‚Äôt blame them, I wouldn‚Äôt go to work knowing my check is going to be really low"
"The OTHER other side of the story is that more than half of the leases oil companies have already purchased are predicted to expire soon because they're not drilling on them. They're purchasing land and not using it, presumably just for the purpose of asset denial against competing companies."
"The FUMBDUCKS currently in DC turned all the taps off to hammer private transportation for individuals to control us. If we allow this, the consequences will be a totalitarian communist paradise that will leave us in chains."
Like ICE car legacy auto . The oil industry  is a dying industry . Electric cars will destroy gas demand permanently oil will go to $30 in less than 2 years
the earth makes oil so it will never run out and should never cost what it does.
"Wait, so are you saying Biden DIDN'T do this?!"
Let‚Äôs Go Brandon
One word... greed.
"Politicians are ultimately to blame for oil prices here, because politicians created the lockdowns that caused the price to go negative."
"Biden needs to open the pipelines, or the strategic reserve. This is not our burden to bear."
"@Arthur Morgan ¬† I didn't blame them at all, I just explained that even if he were to try to open more pipelines those take time and procedures and abiding by the wishes of those tribes tends to be important for alot of pipelines. If you want to go into why the gas shortage does exist, I could do so though can't at this exact moment, so I will just suggest watching the video you are currently on."
@Luka Jolich Why are you blaming native americans for the gas prices and oil being scarce.
"@Arthur Morgan Dude, they're still considered their own independent nations and we maintain treaties with them. I swear, please don't tell me you're gonna go down the ""we already screwed them over so much, we might as well just keep doing so"" approach I've been told by a guy I know."
"@Arthur Morgan Dude, they're still considered their own independent nations and we maintain treaties with them. I swear, please don't tell me you're gonna go down the ""we already screwed them over so much, we might as well just keep doing so"" approach I've been told by a guy I know."
@Luka Jolich treaties? This isn‚Äôt 1645 also native Americans have 1% population in America lol
"There may be about 9000 permits approved (APDs) that aren't being used but this number is purely a political one. About 650 of these are on tribal lands that the companies cannot drill on, some of them are for natural gas, some are for exploration, most of them were approved before 2014 and cannot be used due to local regulations or court decisions. There are also over 9000 permits approved and in active use, the highest in the history of the US. To say US oil production companies aren't trying to produce is a bold faced lie considering there are more drilling sites running as I write this than in the history of the nation. You just need to remember that the Bureau of Land Management only manages about 10% of the land where oil and natural gas is drilled from, and about 90% of it is from land the US government does not own or control. That means, given the 9991 federal permits approved and in use making up 10% of the total drill sites actively in use right now, there are about 99,910 total sites actively drilling right now as you read this. While its nice to imagine a world where the oil industry isn't going to kill ""the planet"", it'll be a lot more interesting to see Elon Musk hire mercenaries to kill for LIthium so I am very interested in the slow death rattle of the oil industry.... its just not happening yet."
@Explodated Faces This video explained that pipelines are the most efficient way to transport gasoline.  If fossil fuels had a bright future companies would be lobbying out the ass  to get them back.  Did you watch the video? Lol.
"@Nirvz HD oh , you can tell renewables are winning on account of all the renewables being used by ordinary members of the populat.... wait... no... thats oil."
"He never said oil was dying, he said renewables are winning.  Winning just means in the long run, oil and gas don't have to be the energy standard..."
How much did the Biden administration pay this mothfcker? dishonest YouTuber. Sad
"This is the first Wendover video that shakes my trust in his judgement. As he shares in the final minutes, he's trying to influence, not inform. More infotainment propo? No thanks."
...and it's not Biden or the Democrats.
At least we never had this problem when Trump was in office!
"Are you saying pipelines are cheaper than trucks or rails? Thanks Biden for spending money we do not have? One of the issues you did not talk about is the electric grid burning out IF 23% of DRIVERS have an ELECTRIC CAR. On one hand the poor, who cannot afford an electric vehicle, are holding out while people who drive long distance are also holding out because the electric vehicle can not make the distances."
On 22 January 2021 the current administration put in place policies that artificially raise energy and labor costs. The war only acerbated the consequences of the policies.
Joe Biden ended leases on BLM land and a judge shut down an 80 million acre offshore oil project citing climate change
"This will lead to a recession in the oil and gas industry much like Venezuelas oil fields.
Not enough money to upgrade drilling operations because you cashed out."
"""The end of oil is near"" I really disagree with this statement. Yes, renewable energy as a percentage of the world's total energy consumption is increasing, but oil consumption is still increasing and is projected to continue increasing for decades to come, as much of the world is still developing. 

Simple mathematical thought experiment:
If the world consumes 10 million barrels of oil worth of energy in a year, but renewable energy comprises 10% of energy consumption, then that means we need 9 million barrels of oil to meet energy demand.

Next year, the world consumes 20 million barrels of oil worth of energy, and renewable energy now comprises 15% of energy consumption. This means that renewable energy usage has gone up as a percentage, but a closer look at the numbers reveals that we need 17 million barrels of oil this year to meet energy demand. Clearly, oil is not on the way out in this scenario, even if renewable energy usage is just going up."
@Frans 122 Indonesia DOES have availability for major hydroelectric expansion. Solar does have *current* battery problems however having them on the buildings of many stores and businesses still reduces many emissions and is more cost effective.
"@sw1tch I really wish we hv that in here tbh, but, solar has the problem about battery stuff, wind need much open space to make some imppact that we dont have, and water, we dont have strong enough current to make that impact :/, and about that system of worker, yeah I hope we can change it but I dont see it will change in the next 10 or more years, ohh and about the hiring of outside people, yeah 10/10 will cause an outrage, already happened a few years ago, so yeah it is how it is in my country, I do hope it can change for the better :/"
"‚Äã@Frans 122 Okay well nuclear isn't the only other option. Again you have solar, hydro, and wind also. If you have a problem with people there I mean for one they could have a better system to make sure they do their stuff right but other than that they could get people from abroad to help with it."
"@sw1tch well the thing is Im not sure Indonesia can use nuclear yet tbh, the worker here are kinnda... lets just say unreliable, for that kind of responsibilities and commitment üò£üò£, thats why we cant use any other stuff beside fossil fuel, domt get me wrong having another power source is good, but I also dont want to have any chernobyl incedent üò∂üò∂"

"So oil prices are high because oil producers are trying to make their last profits? Well i would cry in happiness if i were as environment focused as before but now thinking about it this will hurt all the underdeveloped economies that were unable to transition to renewables as fast as Western economies so it will only cause a bigger percentage of populations unable to have electricity and the developing industries will never be able to fully develope and feed their nations with walue they produced. It is just sad to think about because they will stay as undereducated agricultural societies that almost never contributes to development of technology and science and only purpose for them to exist is for selling guns to them and extracting minerals, no nation deserves such a fate but at the end i hope the sun will shine for them even if not this century"
"That's weird.  Because when I look at the price of oil, it really jumped up when the war started.  I guess oil prices were just a lie then."
"How do oil companies plan on selling oil when there are no gasoline vehicles without investment? Sure they will loose 40% of demand but still need future production for everything else produce in the world so it seems to me as though investment will always be needed and Biden should have allowed the Keystone XL to be finished unless we don't plan on producing any products, medications, or fertilizer in the future."
"the most sound/logical conclusion that I've been explaining my friends. you did a great job putting it in perfect words from 18:53. it is not that they're the evil people who's making us all suffer, but pure game theory. if you have a sinking business, which soon gonna ran out of customers, all you could do is milk that cow well before it hits the ground. and with an astonishing growth in EV sales and renewable energy sector explosion, this aint worth betting for longer term."
In the 90‚Äôs there were talks about the end of the Fossil Fuel industry it‚Äôs just not gonna happen. Renewables and green energy are promising but more likely to fill niche markets.
"@Raven What this video doesn't tell and is intergral to understanding the price hike, is that the United States Government takes as much money in taxes, as the various companies pay in order to remain active. Basically the government is part of the reason gas prices are soaring right now. California for instance, has a gas tax, that is applied to anything that uses gas as well as gas stations sells of it, that causes a secondary bump in gas prices as well. Biden wants to implement such a tax for the rest of the country, and sees what California has done as a success, though you have to wonder how making it harder for a person to get from their home to their job, is in any way a success."
"@PeterroGr Though governments being peer pressured into heavily restricting staffing at businesses during a ""disease outbreak"" whose average age of death, even with gamed numbers, is still older than the average life expectancy, causing a global supply chain shortage that will last years to come, is indeed ""the evil people whose making us all suffer""."
"@ChaoChromeMessor ‚Äã  As I said, the explosion is both in EV and renewable energy consumption. which means the focus might be shifting to new frontiers due to the modern narratives. which in turn will affect the oil industry badly. and also, conglomorates could fund researchers to find whether there are any alternative use cases for it, but people with such small rigs wont really think about that and that's why they stopped fixing it."
"Excellent explanation of how oil in the ground, from around the world, ends up in our gas tanks, and why it costs what it does. 
Thank you so much for producing this video! I'm sharing it with EVERYONE!"
"We need to use less of the stuff anyway, both for climate and national security."
Joe Biden.
‚ÄúSocial‚Äù media and oil companies are the same scummy thing. Supermarkets are the same. They all hold the means of production and therefore the balls of everyone. It‚Äôs gross.
The fact that this is a thing shows how much of a BS society we live in and how politicians are even more clearly just puppets.
"Pipelines also leak frequently and are an eyesore.
We should totally keep doing what we're doing with our economy, basing everything on profit and fossil fuels. üëç"
But I‚Äôve been instructed by my partisan news source that provides me with all of my opinions that a political boogeyman from the opposite party was entirely to blame! Now who will provide me with the confirmation bias I so desperately crave?
Gas prices go brrrrr
What‚Äôs the problem? I only ever put ¬£20 in when I fill up!
19:01  Big D!
All of this is just another good reason for the world move as fast as it can away from energy that depends on oil and other fossil fuels.
"This is the core problem with American Conservatism; it pretends that the world cannot change and when it does change, it blames the Democrats. Rather than face the fact that markets change, needs change, customers change and energy needs change as well, they instead act like the changing world isn't real and that our way of living must extend into the future unchanging for infinity. That is a con."
"If oil company keeps supply low to artificially incrwaw profit, just tax those profit MUCH MORE and use the added revenue to decrease the price at the pump"
"I still don't understand why is this happening.
Should someone not regulate this?"
"Unintentionally BULLSHIT. They are intentionally creating shortages to drive higher profits. Because them foreclosing on your home, robbing your retirement, owning every farm, and breaking profit records year after year aren't enough. And we totally ""unintentionally"" left 2 billion dollars worth of equipment to ISIS not once, but twice. And totally not to have a ready made excuse to effect prices and manipulate and rob nations. Just an honest mistake of leaving billions in weapons, vehicles, and explosives to terrorist, twice. Anyone who thinks the leftist in America are honestly that incompetent. And not intentionally doing that. Should be screaming for them to be removed from office. Obama and Biden. One after the other. And they are the reason for the next major war in the middle east. And it's coming within 3 years."
It‚Äôs the plan! Wag the dog.
"Or it could be that the price of oil is high because the petrodollar and all the money printing.
If some country wants to buy oil from OPEC, they have to pay in US dollars.
How does that country get US dollars? They export goods to the US and the US uses its military to ensure that the oil flows.
How did it go negative? The market suddenly stopped and it costs more to hold onto oil than to keep it flowing. Economic version of water hammer."
Biden
He did not even mention Ukraine invasion even once!
There is a way to deal with this it's called tax policy. If the reason that we have the problems we do is because there's excess profit taking and insufficient investment will then we start adjusting tax policies so then it makes more sense to invest in production then to take profits at least within a reasonable extent. And maybe the next thing we should do is to reverse the 2015 law that allowed the US to export its oil supply to the global market therefore causing the United States to be vulnerable to the global supply at market then then the domestic.
(It's because of the war)

How does the value of something plummet 300%? It went from costing $100 to being given away for $200?
"Renewables will only take over if there is grid-scale energy storage, due to wind and solar being intermittent. And with current technology there are not enough materials to create all those grid-scale batteries. There aren't even enough materials to create batteries for vehicles.  So it's hard to see how we are near the end of oil investment."

in USA its super cheap .. here in Norway its more like 9usd a gallon..
"This is true, the US has largely enjoyed cheap fuel compared to most of the first world. We're more toward the average now."
you skipped the fact that the us gov raised their royalty profit on oil and gas which means people in the us figure they'll produce less so they can cover that royalty cost. I'm surprise you didn't start out what with dinosaurs and how oil became to be.

"The high prices of 2007 were partly responsible for the demand destruction of 2008. Electric vehicles are now beginning to provide an alternative for transport. Indeed, this may be the industry's last hurrah."
"For public transport that will take a while. For that exact reason I recently did some math with the prices of currently available electric buses, and it would cost around 600 billion ‚Ç¨ to replace each one of them in the country with electric. And that is assuming that the high demand wouldn't increase the price. And doesn't answer the question of how to supply all of them. The infrastructure for charging stations and energy prices would have to be added on top.
And with the typical consumption of each they would maybe save 0.20-0.70‚Ç¨/km"
"Why would you invest in pipeline and shale when you are at the mercy and punishment of the current government. EV driver and I am so disappointed with those who claim to ""care for the earth"" ... Dems a re a joke."

Who needs oil when solar energy is available now. The world is still so dependent on oil as oil is primitive now. Just saying.

its like when my mom got her drivers license in March 1979 gas cost around 80 cents a gallon had I not had the disabilities I do gas would've cost about 1.50 a gallon when I got my license in Sept 2001 currently it costs nearly 80 dollars to fill my moms 2012 Hyundai Azera while it costs Between 89 dollars and 102.30 dollars to fill my dads used 2011 Cadillac SRX depending on if he uses regular unleaded or premium unleaded he's thinking of trading in the SRX for a 2022/2023 XT5 when the city of Boston accepts his retirement papers from Boston Police Department. both of my maternal grandparents drove Cadillacs at different times including a 68 Eldorado a 78 Sedan Deville and a used 79 Coupe Deville mind you the Eldorado was a convertible having 375HP

"Wow...have been researching your video and YOU ARE SPOT ON!!! This is stuff CNN, BBC,MSNBC etc will never tell us"
OIl doesn't have the appetite to drill because Biden has told them he wants to put them out of business. It isn't difficult. Joe Biden is the main reason behind high gas prices.
"@Thomas Ryan Spoon me, conspiracy daddy."
@Sir Bones IV I don't doubt it.
@Thomas Ryan I'd rather spoon.
@Sir Bones IV Fork you.
It's a load of crap. The oil companies see the end coming and they are putting the boots to everyone before the bottom falls out of the market
"I have to say I disagree with your conclusion and your assertion that oil is akin to a sinking ship. Global oil consumption has been and will continue to rise year after year. The reason oil companies are not expanding production at rates of the past, or even shutting in production is because many governments are pandering to the environmentalist lobby groups. Governments in the ""west"" are obsessed with climate change, climate catastrophe and have made it a keystone of their political platforms. This means they are making it much harder, more expensive, and in some cases impossible for oil companies to expand production.

The rest is basic economics. When demand out paces supply, prices go up. The world will not stop consuming oil, and so long as societies make it difficult and expensive to produce, they will pay the price."
Why Gas Got So Expensive (It‚Äôs Not the War): SNIFFY JOE BIDEN'S RIDICULOUS FOOLISH POLICIES.
"Which policies, exactly?"
Overall inflation and disincentives to producers from the current administration definitely have something to do with it as well.  Demand should still be below pre-pandemic levels with a lot of people still or permanently working from home.  Agreed it's definitely not the war but why did it start rising as soon as Biden took office?
Another green energy BS propaganda. None of the facts you present supports your hypothesis.
and are not capable of taking over the market as a whole the way technology stands now.
"Remember when Trump tried to refill our SPR storage when oil was $30, And Democrats blocked the measure? Today price $110, and that price is because we have been using our one SPR oil and China lockdown, if not would be a lot higher. Wait until China opens again, EU stop using Russian oil and Summers gets here‚Ä¶ $200"

"yeah they should print a few trillion more, that will solve everything"
"The talk of permits sitting unused is not 100% oil companies fault, the current administration in the USA banned all drilling on public land so there really isn't anywhere for the companies to start new drilling."
"Biden gets in office, prices skyrocket, then they hold‚Ä¶. March 2nd, after the state of the union address, prices go up 40 cents in a single day."
Imagine calling 5.6 billion stratospheric when  the US government spends triple that amount every single day.

@TheEndlessVoid 7 When you take that much oil off the market the price goes up for everybody. We were oil independent and the Saudi Arabia of natural gas meaning we exerted the most influence on the price
"Europe has high prices too. I didn't realize that Joe Biden is president of Europe, too."
It's because of the corrupt Demonrat elite.

"You missed the point entirely.  The oil companies know that demand will not be shrinking for the next 30 years.  2 billion people are moving from poverty to the middle class and they want our way of life.  That takes oil and gas for transportation, manufacturing, plastics, fertilizer, concrete, asphalt, home heating, air conditioning, etc.  The climate zealots have been attacking the oil industry for forty years and have places weak leadership at the head of western governments that know nothing about how our economy functions.  They have reduced access to permits, transportation and financing to the point that O&G executives can't take the risk of initiating major projects because there is no certainty their own government and financial institutions won't act against them.  Dictator states are laughing all the way to the bank.  O&G investors are happy, and everyone else suffers at the pumps, at the grocery store and with massive inflation.  This is what you voted for.  Congratulations.  You got it."

"The clip at 11:33 shows an ""eyepopping"" price of 3.549 USD/ US Gallon. That's nothing compared to current prices in Europe (namely Germany).
Do the math if you will please: 3.549 USD/ 3.785412 liter. -> 0.937547 USD/ liter -> 0,89 ‚Ç¨/ liter.
Instead we pay 1.7 to 2.3 ‚Ç¨/ liter (1.79 to 2.42 USD/ liter) for gasoline. Take an average of 2 ‚Ç¨/ liter price.
That would be 2.11 USD/ liter or *7.987 USD/ US Gallon*. 'murica please stop complaining about high gas prices, lol."
But the government told me it was ‚ÄúPutin‚Äôs Price Hike‚Äù.  They can‚Äôt possibly be lying?
"Canceling pipelines, increasing regulations, and reducing US drilling does not help gas prices for the USA."
He never mentioned any of that. Especially the government restrictions.

the number of people in my mind who deserve a 9mm permanent bedtime has increased substantially
"As many of these things as you did get right, you got one thing colossally wrong. 19:22 The end of oil is nowhere near, and is not happening. Everything is plastic and plastic is petroleum based, all machinery and vehicles need lubrication and oil is the basis of that, aircraft and ships cannot be electric due to the incredible difference in energy density between even the best batteries and petroleum based fuels plus the basic fact that and empty battery is no lighter than a full one. Sure, demand will fall a bit as electric cars reach prevalence and alternative energy sources come online for power generation, but oil is never going to be over."
"I disagree. It is not renewable energy, and eventually it will run out. If we slowly moved away from fossil fuels, we (Americans) would be much better off in the world stage when that time comes"
remember when it would have been trumps fault? i member
Why did E85 go up in price as well? Shouldn‚Äôt it be isolated from the ebbs and flows of the global oil economy?
Time for the good old USA to nationalize it's oil production and we can dictate both production levels and what is done with those profits.  Let the oil companies take the money from the nationalisation and invest into future energy.
"The one great fallacy of your video is the XXXX number of oil drilling permits that aren't being used, so therefore the oil companies must be restricting production to keep profits high. This...is bullshit. A drilling permit does not automatically result in a productive well-in fact, most do not. Most of these unused permits are in areas that do not have a history of productive wells. There's no sense in drilling where there is very little chance of having a productive well come in for the expense of drilling. So your ""persuasive essay"" (read: opinion piece) is false on it's face on this point, which makes me question how many of your other points are skewed to come to your pre-determined conclusion. Slick production values and a pleasing voiceover do not make up for incorrect data points."

Why were gasoline prices like 5 cents a gallon way back when. Just more lie for profit and tax.
"Fracking rig?? 
There is no such thing as a fracking rig. 
Hydraulic fracturing is done by pumping a slurry of sand, gel, chemicals and water into a well. This is done from anything from 1 pump up to 30 pumps. These pumps are on the back of trailers, bought to the oil lease by trucks.

Simple, Biden cut shale production, refused to let the Canadian pipeline construction and everything went to hell.  You might be too smart for your own good or maybe you love liberal politicians?

Your credibility has just dropped a few notches."

"How does the $400 billion, 25 year investment by China into the Iranian energy market in 2020 factor into this theory that 'oil is dead'? Or the fact that the energy ministers of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran signed an agreement in 2012 to supply Europe with crude oil and hydrocarbons via pipelines? What about the billions that Russia has invested into this plan? The conflict all across the Levant over the past 12 years not only reflects Iran's dedication to eschatology, but also the dedication to these pipeline investments."

Only thing inaccurate about the video is the plastics industry. Oil become one of two things either fuel or plastic(outside of cooking and fragrance oils). 90% of the profits of production or product of Oil is plastics so.... Where is the oil industry going? the Drilling part may evaporate but what about the refining sector? Nice to have a heads up on the drilling part of the Oil industry though. May need a part two explaining how the plastics industry is preforming in relation to all this. Great video by the way .
Research how many products are made from oil. Now you will see its not going anywhere no time soon.....lol..
Thank Joe biden
Anyone who thinks it isn't the war is naive to the bone. You think it's a total coincidence that prices started rising rapidly right after the war began? Come on now...
Just buy hybrid car (like prius) and don't think about gas prices anymore!
"Soooo... I have to say, $5.5B? That's all?  In a world like ours, where the top performing companies can fluctuate in value by 4-6 times that amount rapidly, then reverse that fluctuation, $5.5B really doesn't seem that much."
Man I'm proud of you guys. I read a ton of comments and not one of you blamed the gas prices on the current or former presidents or an opposing political party. That's progress fellas.
"near the end of the video, author claims oil is dead...propaganda... we need oil... who paid this guy to make this video..."
Trans mountain pipeline in Canada is being built with TAXPAYER dollars and is $17.5 billion so far
"Renewables taking over... LMAO not even close man. Pretty good up until the end with that silly assertion. So much of the world runs off different forms of oil that there is no way in a hundred years that anything is gonna replace it. Even if everyone suddenly drove electric cars, that would simply force oil consumption to switch to more power plants, not eliminate it. Furthermore, it wouldn't change the fact that every plane, boat, tank, truck, etc etc is still gonna run off petroleum products. The future will be changing, somewhat, but I will be driving gas powered trucks until I die and your groceries and toys will be delivered on diesel trucks for many many decades to come. Oil is far from dead."
"Aha, so the REAL problem is that Trump was asleep at his desk when oil prices plummeted in April 2020, and instead of buying up all the cheap oil to refill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, he ate burgers and farted... I mean, made speeches. Got it!"
"Without the sun, we die. So as long as we have the sun, we have unlimited source of energy right there. 
So does water & wind. Unlimited source of energy right there in front of us.

Earth can‚Äôt produce oil or gas. If so, prove me wrong. That‚Äôs why we need to move away from them sooner. Eventually, humans will suck the last drop of oil and gas, SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:
If you‚Äôre complaining about oil and gas prices NOW, 
When we actually suck the last drop of oil and gas, when it happens, what are we going to rely on now?
Think about that. 

Unless we go nuclear energy, it takes decades for it to be built and be operation so until it happens, we can‚Äôt rely on oil and gas. We have unlimited source of energy right there in front of us VIA sun, water, and wind.

Think about that."

While waiting in line for gas in 1973 I told everyone the age of cheap fuel is over . The market made a fool of me so many times.
"FAST CHARGING and GASOLINE cost the same!  I will Prove it!
 
Lets say you have a 2021 Tesla Model S Performance.  You need to know the EPA fuel economy or basically how many mpg it gets using a battery.  The Electric car EPA fuel economy is 30.6 kWh/100  miles(combined hwy/city) for a Tesla S Performance.  So to go 100 miles we need 30.6kWh.  The cost of charging at a Fast Charger is  .43 cents per kWh
So 30.6kWh  x  .43 cents is  = $13.16  So the Tesla can go 100 miles and to Fast charge it cost $13.16

Now Lets use a Gasoline Car
For a Gas car lets us a 2021 Toyota Corolla it gets 34/mpg combined city/hwy
In Florida avg price is like $4.06 a gallon.   So lets use the same money the $13.16 from the EV
13.16/4.06 = 3.24 gallons of fuel.   So if we pay $13.16 we get 3.24 gallons of gas. 
3.24gal x 34mpg = 110.16 Miles.     You can go 110 miles in a Corolla for $13.16


---WHERE IS THIS MASSIVE SAVINGS---
Toyota Corolla will go 110 miles for $13.16
Tesla Model S will go 100 miles for $13.16
If you can charge at home on a 240VAC charger for hours its basically like getting gas in a car.  The FAST DC charge can give 80% charge in about 30 mins    See the lie they tell us!"
"Yes me too. I fell for the ""alternative energy"" lie and spent twenty years of my life in the AE world.  It never materialized.  By the late 80's oil was cheap and we all forgot about alternative energy"
"Hell, I remember back in 1988, when I first started driving.  The price for a gallon of gas, was ,88 cents. That would be a welcomed price, right now.  Imagine filling  your tank, which is almost on empty, for less then ten dollars."
@Richard Newhouse ugh. You are embarassing yourself.
39 seconds in and this video is BS. I guess our country going from energy independence to closing pipelines and stopping drilling and fracking had nothing to do with it.
Wait... you mean the sticker some MAGA chud put on my local gas pump didn't tell the whole story????

"This video did not mention the political reasons for what's happening, and neither did it bother to mention the Canadian oil sands (and the political reasons there). Shameful."
"Great video in general.  Though the part at the end is a bit of a stretch (that oil is on its deathbed)... you literally said most oil goes into things that society needs every day other than fuel, I don't see that changing anytime soon.  Certainly the golden age may be over, but I don't see it going away EVER.

Besides, with world population growing it doesn't mean demand will fall necessarily in line with market share of EVs and renewable alternatives vs the oil based product's market share.  Demand for oil may still increase under such conditions.  It seems more likely to me that the non-oil based products will only fill specific niches of market demand in markets they are part of, at least for the time being, and are not capable of taking over the market as a whole the way technology stands now."
"@Grey guy. Also, it's not in big oils best interest to tell us that we are going to run out of oil reserves in the next century. It's just going to spurn research into alternative technologies, that don't benefit big oil.

Not totally true. A President can in the stroke of a pen ban all oil drilling in most of the U.S. How would that affect the prices?

"No, the price of gas has nothing to do with the war. 
Our gas here in California is just over $6 a gallon.
All the gas for west coast markets come from Alaska.
We refine that crude here at west coast refineries. The
war has not disrupted our petroleum supply chain. 
HOWEVER, nobody gouges more than the oil co's.
When the blueberry crop is killed by frost in Argentina
our gas prices spike. When hurricane Katrina trashed
New Orleans our gas went to over $5. No it just gouging.
Thats why I cant wait for e cars to take over. Experts are
estimating it should take about 8 years for e cars to
displace fuel cars. The gov will help too with rebates
to help climate change. Oh, sure the oil co will still
fuel power plants with natural gas but if they want to
gouge it will be the local utility they will have to bullshit
and I think the utility will demand evidence for a price spike.
vehicles make up 80% or oil co market. Or, did.

No one wants to work in the industry because it went bust and they found other jobs and got stimmies. This exacerbates the problem for supply. Fracking is a treadmill with wells declining quickly. It‚Äôs not as profitable as they thought it would be.

Companies don‚Äôt take chances when the government that regulates them hates their business model.
BELIEVE  WHATEVER  YOU  WANT  BUT OIL  SPECULATORS  ON  THE  COMMODITIES  MARKET  ARE  RESPONSIBLE  FOR  THE  PRICE  OF  OIL. The commodities market is basically a gambling arrangement on the stock market just like the currency market and all the other commodities. Investors put a lot of money on what they are gambling/ guessing the price of oil will be on a certain date. The values they gamble on affects the price DIRECTLY. NOT the actual supply and demand curve. If their do diligence tells them the price is going to crash then they bet the futures low and EVERYONE  FOLLOWS  THEIR  LEAD. This is why the price crashed for such a short time and then rebounded to a reasonable amount in weeks LONG before covid was even dreamed of being over. The market demand for oil forced speculators to have to bid their futures higher or be left not making money. Take oil off the commodities market and it would NEVER  EVER  make such wide price swings.
How can you look at the chart of supply and demand and say the end of oil is near?! That‚Äôs mental illness right there. Near as in 50-100 years.

What are the biggest arguments against this video?
"This is somewhat of a misnomer, re ""oil going negative"".  ONE type of spot futures contract went negative for ONE day, due to specifics of the WTI contract and lack of storage at Cushing, OK.  The actual price of oil overall, globally, was relatively stable during that.  No one was being paid to take gasoline from gas stations, for example, or anything REMOTELY close to that.  

I think all the arm waving of this weird event is way overblown.  I will admit I didn't even realize such futures contracts could go negative in price, much less STRONGLY negative, and rapidly.  But that didn't change anything fundamental in the world in itself.   As you pointed out, oil prices are still very much about supply and demand, as per the laws of economics. 

And given the reality of AGW and the global demand for oil, it's a GOOD thing if oil prices stay generally high, and the transition to clean energy and transport is faster as a result."
I beleive on his other channel he did a whole video on it
Meh‚Ä¶
"The ""end of oil"" is overstated.  Even if ZERO oil is used in engines for ground transport in, say, 30 years globally (which is quite doubtful), there will very likely be LOTS of oil used for other things -- just less than is used today. 

Examples; asphalt will likely still come from oil, and EV's will be driving on lots of that.  Petrochemicals will be growing consistently for decades, and perhaps for MANY decades, as global population and the global middle class continues to grow.  All air travel going electric, including the military, might happen someday, but that going all electric anytime soon is WILDLY speculative."

Wow... Touting the 9000 leases lie... none of those 9000 leases have confirmed oil and statistically less than a third of them will.

"I wish you would have dug a little deeper because you hit on the point. There ARE a TON of contracts out for oil to be drilled. HOWEVER, in my opinion it is a political facade. It has been reported by multiple sources as well that there is not enough oil in the land of these contracts to make it ultimately profitable  and is only there for Biden to excuse high oil prices onto corporate America, saying they are greedy profiteers.

Think about it for even a second - If there were enough oil there to profit, wouldn't they drill for it? Does it make sense they are literally sitting on potential profits? I don't think so.

The objective of a company or corporation is to make money. This is just another thing that doesn't pass the smell test for the Biden family."

America has oil but we sell it off to other nations
"At 20:00 you lost me with ""renewables are winning.""  They are not.  They are a political trend that is detrimental to our economy.  The dip occurred during COVID due to the lack of any movement and now the oil companies see no need to increase supply when demand has barely recovered.  As demand increases they are happy to let the price skyrocket and reap a great benefit.  However that is temporary and will back fire on them and lead to a market crash in the future which will lead to a recovery after they drop the artificially high prices."

"Largely very good and accurate, the main thing that wasn‚Äôt covered was the real logistical constants preventing large scale ramp up, while oil companies especially in the US weren‚Äôt preparing, those that are trying to increase production now (I know by in person discussion I‚Äôve had with their executives for my work) is being limited by rampant inflation (steel pipes necessary for new well lining has increased by 16-20% in March alone, and to get the materials to drill a new well currently has around a 2 year waiting period just from a supply chain failure perspective. This means that those that are ramping up reinvestment are having those increases (20-40% increases sometimes more, only result in single digit production growth). Another factor that‚Äôs incredibly important is the DUC (drilled but uncompleted wells) since oil went negative many producers (the majors were the largest offenders in this) used the DUC inventory to avoid reinvestment and increase/maintain production, now the DUC inventory is at the lowest in around a decade meaning the lack of reinvestment has caught up to the industry. The companies that took the profits and distributed value to shareholders instead of increased reinvestment were rewarded by the market with increasing share prices and positive market signals while the inverse also occurred. Overall this isn‚Äôt some broad scheme to go down kicking (at least on the US shale side) it‚Äôs a web of complex issues with many causes and effects. 
Saying the war isn‚Äôt the reason also isn‚Äôt purely true as it has had a outsized impact on the global oil market constraining global supply, disrupting trade and taking key barrels off the market thus overall adding pressure to an already strained market. 
Oil likely would have reached over $100 without it but if it wasn‚Äôt for the war it wouldn‚Äôt be over $100 right now due to the tampered demand from renewed Chinese lockdowns."
"That's some terrible formatting and sentence structuring, mate."
"@Strangely Ukrainian all I'm gonna say is watch climate town's video on gas companies profiteering off the war in Ukraine. It answers a lot of the things you posed here re. The government.

But otherwise, I agree it's a complex situation"
"@Adityan 
Yeah, because prices skyrocketed. They don‚Äôt entirely control oil prices, they influence it, but they‚Äôre still subject to market forces. Recent market shifts where demand plummeted from the lockdowns and then the subsequent lowering of production caused the price to plummet as suddenly the cost of storing the oil became expensive as well. Now they need to ramp production back up, and on those 9000 leases, companies are going through h*ll to get their production back up and running because of a lot of the things this comment thread‚Äôs OP mentioned. But the government is also playing massive role in it. For every lease with crude oil on it, only about 1 in 100 of those leases would be worth the cost to even drill. So actually, there‚Äôs 90 leases that companies could profit from, but the government has been withholding and extending waiting periods for the  permits required to build the infrastructure and do the actual drilling. 

Now of course, companies are still making record profits, but these companies sell a resource that they extract, meaning that if their current already extracted supply starts to dwindle, they won‚Äôt be able to meet an constant rising demand, and they‚Äôll start to lose money. Those profits will vanish very quickly. These companies do not want to make money off of scarcity. Scarcity will destroy their business. There are several many layers to this whole thing, the ‚Äúrecord profits‚Äù are barely at the surface level"
"If USA had the prices we have in Finland, then a gallon of gas would cost nearly 10$"

"With VAT and fuel duty, taxes make up nearly half of our fuel pump price in the UK üôÉ"
"High prices will hold until behavior changes which we are starting to see at the margins. This will impact profits and producers will thus have a new incentive to lower costs in a variety of ways. However as mentioned before energy producers also win from these high prices due to investments in renewables but those only go so far.

The very unstable nature of prices over the last 15 years makes it extremely difficult to predict the future including the claim they are ceding the market. At some point high prices impact demand which impacts profit. Automakers cannot make enough cars for renewable and so on. Producers likely know they will have to hike supply again at least one more time and in the short term are looking for one more high profit hurrah. It won't last if it crashed the economy which hurts them as much as anybody else."
I believe you are correct about changing behavior. That seems to be what ESG investing is all about.
I thing you for got about the lock downs that forced a drop in demand due to the minimal travel.
Actually they can ship commodities through the Volga-Don Canal.
Oh the illegitimate dream of renewables. They are a complete lie and grift. But the destruction of the oil and gas markets remain. It‚Äôs funny how in the US we are destroying real carbon energy while china is going wild. Our decline is others gain.

"here in the Permian Basin, due to international investors via ESGC rules, and new FEC rules, oilfield service companies can not get loans. this is a large part of why the private oil industry has not ramped up production. Not solely due to the conservative strategy of operators post 2020 crash. it's not an unwillingness to put up new rigs, the cost of putting up a new rig increases with each additional rig put back in service, and operators need to pay the bill up front, rather than the old tradition of paying back loans over time, which stabilizes prices."
"Not only is this a persuasive essay, it‚Äôs a perversely misinformed one. As evident in the fact he calls anything a ‚Äúfracking rig‚Äù. American oil and gas is here to stay because international demand is here to stay, and it‚Äôs cleaner and cheaper produced than foreign import. The real reason prices are so high are the blocking of the keystone pipeline and the ban on drilling on federal lands. Present some unbiased research."
"Baloney. Many of your assumptions are plain junk. Yet you talk with such reassuring authority. Thumbs down to you and stop spreading misinformation. For instance, as world consumption of oil continues to dry up, who says oil producing countries won't go after market share by boosting production and lowering price? You're just envisioning your own delusion."
"Seems to me when Biden stopped our drilling and pipeline while giving Russia the green light on theirs, he literally saved OPEC and gave them back their power. So you're right, the war isn't causing gas prices to go up, it was Biden's (and the entire Dem Party) stupid hate for everything Trump."

If you want to look into the history of OPEC and the USSR, that's a little (lot) more indirect pertaining to the current crisis we're in.

MTBE has been banned in California since 2002 so cannot be a required fuel additive in California. MTBE has been mostly phased out of the US gasoline blend pool.
"@Mike    there‚Äôs a difference between a proprietary additive, which I agree is in too small a concentration to actually move the needle, and a gasoline blendstock, which MTBE would be considered and could definitely affect the price of finished gasoline. I used the same phrasing as Wendover to remain consistent. 
The isolation of California definitely comes into play in the price of gasoline due to the increased feedstock costs to produce the gasoline. Refineries in Texas or Louisiana have enough WTI-priced crude oil production to satisfy their refinery demand. California on the other hand has little domestic crude to run and has to rely on crude oil from overseas, which is typically priced off Brent (usually from Alaska, South America, and the Middle East, among others). That increased feedstock cost flows directly to the finished product price."
Gas additives cost practically nothing and are in such small concentrations. Arguing the California's prices are largely caused by isolation is incredibly stupid considering I can drive from LA to Las Vegas and pay 50% less for the same gasoline. That's like arguing Cigarettes costing $15 a pack in New York is because logistical constraints.
"So in a nut shell, it‚Äôs all about greed lol."
Hes not telling the whole story. Their is a lot components that drive up oil.
"Oil futures speculators should be broken down and rendered into crude oil themselves, then refined into gasoline, it‚Äôs a beneficial use for scumbag parasites, and they‚Äôre a renewable resource."
:) :) :)
**Biden did this**
"Thank you, I used to play the markets, so many different variables come to play- biden is the biggest reason for this. For example, look at the price from a year ago, or a few years back. People can search for charts and also you have to adjust for inflation- which is the worst in modern day history.."

You misrepresented the permits available for drilling. There‚Äôs leases and permits both needed both of which have to be approved. However the bigger part of the problem with drilling is that they need a way to transport the oil out of the rural areas. It‚Äôs not as simple as just drilling and loading the oil onto a truck.
"There is no need for fuel to be more than 1.50 per gallon.  Supply and demand.  Just open the valve, Bedpan."
ESG is why a lot company‚Äôs are not oil futures oriented.
Hey Bedpan.  Just open the valve.  We have enough oil for 2000 years.  Your article is correct.  It is not the war.  It is our own leaders screwing us into the ground.
We need to stop mining and burning fossil fuels

The maker of this video doesn't seem to have any knowledge of inflation dynamics which drive the price higher/lower more than the supply constraints.
"11% of fuel cost is tax!? come to UK where with vat and fuel duty its more like 50-55%. Don't know how good youve got it, and it wont last either. Looking at this saudi arabia oil sale change from dollar to yuan incoming. buy yuan now and sell your usd"
"Perhaps I missed it, but one of the big factors in gas prices is the lack of refineries.  Thanks to increasingly tighter regulations over the decades, it‚Äôs cheaper to operate old refineries at capacity rather than build newer, more efficient and capable refineries.  If a refinery experiences operational problems (natural catastrophe, breakdown, etc) our fuel supply is immediately impacted.  So our ancient refineries operating at full capacity is a serious problem.  For instance, when hurricanes take out a Texas refinery, there is an immediate gas shortage since the fuel supply lacks any excess operational capacity, causing gas prices to increase. 

Even if we increase oil production, our fuel supply is limited.  This has been a limiting factor for decades."
"YES! I've been reading about the REFINING costs for years, along with the severe shortages often created by weather, planned and unplanned maintenance shutdowns, and transportation issues. Living here in Southern California where gas is highest in US, it keeps my attention on this issue. I think the only way we can stabilize gas is by doing 2 NEW THINGS. 1) Government pricing controls (like we had during WW11) 2) government ownership of refineries. OUR GOVERNMENT is supposed to be BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE and major corporations DON'T share in that doctrine. They share in Profits and Greed and Control."
ESG is why a lot company‚Äôs are not oil futures oriented.
"You conveniently forgot that the current US administration is delaying the permitting process, which explains the slow production increase much more than your baseless theory about oil companies ""giving up because of global warming"". See the video from ""walk don't run productions"" to get a far more accurate explanation of the low supply reason. Your bias makes you video's information extremely inaccurate."

"@Jeiku Anime Review Yeah, logistics. As in pipelines from Russia through former Soviet states like Ukraine. 

How do you think oil gets from Russia to Europe? It‚Äôs in the video, pipelines.

And coincidentally, Ukraine also has the 2nd largest gas reserves in Europe.

The video also said the price is driven by supply and demand. What do you think happens to the supply when the #1 and #2 gas suppliers go to war against each other? Supply goes down.

Sure, the price of oil started creeping up before Russia‚Äôs invasion. Why? Because Putin started building forces along the Ukrainian border and gave an unhinged speech about how Ukraine isn‚Äôt a real country 30 days prior.

This stuff isn‚Äôt complicated."
"Bastards are doing this on purpose to milk us with unnecessarily high prices, because they can and because they know they're on their way out. Fuck oil companies, at least they'll die at the end of this!"
we get about 2% of our total oil demand and 4% of our imports supplied by Russia U.S. imports from Russia.  So not much at all. War in Russia is NOT the reason for Expensive Gas. Its mainly Due to Oil Companies raising the prices cause they want Profit

"My country, Norway, isn't a member of Opec, and is one of the world's richest oil nations. We're self-sufficient, and sells far, far more oil/gas than we use domestically. Still, prices here have exploded just like everywhere. A year ago, average pump price of gas was around 15 NOK per litre, now it's 22 NOK. ($1 = 9.5 NOK). That's around a 50% increase, and nothing suggests prices will go down anytime soon.

A strange change started just before Christmas, at least here in Norway. Diesel have always been cheaper than gas, but now it's the other way around. Compared to a year ago, diesel have almost doubled in price."

can someone simplify this and explain pls..
"Your prospective analysis, i.e. Shift to renewables due to lack of long term profit investment in oil industry, is fundamentally flawed. Because you focus on money and ignore physics. 
You cannot replace the tremendous energy quantity that fossil fuels represent with renewables and the incredible practicality of oil, namely its energy intensity and liquid state, making it perfect for transportation. Oil made and makes everything else cheaper and available. You cannot measure it by looking at energy market prices. It's like saying your heart is not that important because it's only 1% of your body mass. 
In fact, it's impossible to predict the cost of a mostly renewable energy driven modern society because virtually any industry depend on oil for materials, energy consumption and transportation.

The most likely scenario is just a huge energy crisis, with sustained high prices that will finally make countries handle oil production investement if private investors do not (which I think they will eventually), to save the entire economy from collapse."
"Lol.

I am talking right now and for the next 20 years. There is nothing to replace oil. Nothing."

Gov. way to pay for China plague. I seen Gas go from $3.69 to $4.49 while the price for Oil remain unchanged. This is main reason Calif has a surplus of $$MONEY$$ Gas TAX.
Well we have to thank biden for that
I think you're fundamentally wrong. I don't think climate change is driving the move to renewables I think geopolitics is. I believe we've created a solution to a problem that isn't as significant as what we've made it out to be. This is primarily due to not having the ability to produces oil at a competitive price comparatively speaking. If the American/Western European standard of living was as poor as the major oil producing nation's standard of living then the world would still be happily powered by oil with no end in sight.
You forgot Russia in opec
"You say Oil is dying out -- but how do you square renewables incorporating against he disproportionate increase in Natural Gas.  I can see the argument for petroleum tapering off.  But ALL of the data we see coming out of the EU suggests that as these nations take on more wind and solar, they have been forced to increase import Natural Gas at an even faster pace."

"LOL at failed ""renewable are taking over"" @19:27

Totally not true about Germany and most of Europe in 2022 It will be decades before renewable energy comes to the forefront of world energy supplies. Even then  renewable energy will probably be more costly than we are led to imagine. Dopey renewable advocate Biden (AKA Mister Magoo) choose the wrong time to  force Russia in to invading Ukraine. It is as if he wants use all the freeze or to keep on buy fuel from Russia while he and his rich mates make big profits in the energy markets."
its the pedocrats thats why its so expensive
"So, essentially, there was objectively no need to put government mandated caps on production to ""make sure we don't run out of oil"" because the companies will artificially reduce the supply to keep prices high? Got it..."
"Policies to ensure everyone gets a piece of thr pie. It is a very slow death, oil is being replaced not just because of pollution, good in itself, but also geopolitics. If the US/West wants to contribute to lower oil prices to win elections, we should fill our reserves from our own state owned oil production company which should pay for itself, like a tiny OPEC."

They are ripping us all off and nobody is up in arms about it. Artificial scarcity is theft. Manipulating the markets in this way is theft. Oil is by no means a scarce thing in the world...they just want us to think it is so they can always charge a premium.
"Utterly bad analysis because it is predicated on the wrong argument that ALL fossil fuel companies worldwide will act in concert to keep investment and production low ""to be greedy"", showing your true colors of leftist political bias. The superior conclusion is that the fossil fuel industry is scared to invest because left wing governments from Biden to the EU have basically declared war on fossil fuels, scaring people away from making long term investments as the perception of risk has fundamentally changed. The correct answer is: Biden and the EU have caused these high gas prices by creating an environment in which fossil fuel investment is highly disincentivized."

"Come on man‚Ä¶ How do you not touch on the Green New Deal and how that has significantly handicapped current drillers, and scared any potential future US oil investors into holding onto their money.

Either it‚Äôs bad reporting by you, and leaving that out was accidental, or you omitted it on purpose because you side with radical environmentalists and couldn‚Äôt blame your own side for high gas prices"

Isn't it about time we move on from gas?
"This video is filled with a lot of fluff, while COMPLETELY ignoring the driving policy of the executive branch, that has created this situation. The US went from the world's largest exporter of oil, to a net importer almost overnight. Specifically, the night of January 20, 2021, when there was a radical shift in federal policy on oil and other fossil fuels."
the suppliers GREED
"I don't have the knowledge how the global oil market works but i do know greedy people run the world economy who are more than likely in cahoots with the governments.  Like my neighbor said "" Things are going on behind the scenes we're not being told.""  I had thought the same thing. My theory is as long as the world economy can handle [name a price per gallon], the greedy sociopaths care not some have less as long as they get theirs. They're driving up the price of everything.  Here in the USA, reg gas and diesel doesn't need to be more than 3.50 per gallon even with this war going on.  The greedy sickos are like a drug addict who has to have more and more coke to get their high.  Anyone who doesn't know this is just plain ignorant."
And they say green technology is too complicated/expensive smh
"Just think how much money they will make after they pump all the oil out of the ground. They can charge you money to pump the pollution back into the ground from the gas you bought from them and it will be subsidized by the new green deal. You will have to pay 3 times for the gas you buy. 1 You buy the gas. 2 You pay taxes and it gets squandered on this boondoggle. 3 You pay a pollution fee just like the so called transport fee for natural gas. Nobody involved has looked at natural gas storage underground. These natural basins leak all the time. Gas companies just pump more in to the basin to keep delivery pressure up. Over the years people have siphoned the leaking gas for free and sometimes they figure it out sometimes they don't. The point, Co2 will not stay in these basins like they think. The oil producers won't care because it will just give them more capacity to store the co2. Because you can just keep pumping it in a leaky balloon.Who will know and all payed for by the government! I agree we need to work on this but forcing people to drive electric cars is not going to fix it. There is a reason the United States won't exploit its lithium resources. It creates massive pollution and destroys water because you cannot get it back out of the water and it uses a shitton of it. That means you cannot drink it! The answer will not be oh just ban plastic ans stop burning oil. It needs to be a combination of things such as continue to make our use of oil more efficient and developing so called green energy. You cannot just shut off oil because most of the world cannot afford to buy 40,000 dollar batterymobiles. That is  why lots of scooters  are sold around the world. So unless you make money at it these ideas are pipe dreams."
will be fun to find a renewable that has the power of oil!
wow no mention on why it dropped! are you kidding? also renewables cant match oil! thanks you for showing what side you are on! we are game for renewables but also can see the renewables we have cant work.
soooooooooo annoying when you say Cartel!!!! America calls it cartel but when it's under it own control is a corporation on company or organization....
"this is aggravating to watch how me as a regular citizen are force to see the gas price rise for the rich 1% to make more profit. This is just like the printers and the ink business at this point, the ink(gas) is how they make continuous profits off of us."

"Sounds like a lot of horseshit, taking 2 years of data and extrapolating it over the next century, and not once mentioning that there was a global pandemic during those 2 years."
"What do people think investors will do when pipelines are shut down by executive order, when drilling in the Artic is shut down by executive order, or when a moratorium is placed on gas and oil leases.  Candidate Biden's own words were, ""We are going to get rid of fossil fuels"" and ""we will transition away from oil"", and ""no more drilling"".  It's by design."
So you‚Äôre telling me those stickers on literally every gas pump in America right now is wrong??
"My understanding is that a huge portion of fracking companies never turned a profit, so it's not surprising that they didn't start back up."
Why did you use a import from the middle east as an example for the us. We don't import much oil from overseas. Expecaly from the middle east. Our largest importer is Venezuela. But 80% of our oil is domestic. The us is basicly oil independent. Our prices shouldn't matter what OPEC or the rest of the world does. Our oil companies in the us are evil and just use any excuse to jack up the prices. You could have used your platform to call them out.

Yes you are correct there a broader geological activity that can affect the global climate like volcanism .The only problem is that the earth's volcanos aren't particularly active at least not like they were during let's say the great dieing at the end of the permion

And yes potentially we are tiny compared to geological activity but my point still stands the earth is not emitting an unusual amount of co2 at this time .So I can infer that we are the main cause of climate change .As for your point on covid yes I agree we did see a drop in air pollution in China and Italy 

For your next point I don't fully understand stand what you mean because since the dawn of the industrial revaluation we have undergone the greatest scientific revolution of all time and are understanding of the earth has never been more advanced, add to that modern  monitoring technology's and some of the best kept archives all this means that the global climate has never been better understood

For your next point yes 10,000 years ago there was a ice age this is not a poorly understood phenomenon like you make it out to be ,to be honest with you I'm tired of hearing the ice age argument because it's just a really bad one, first of all it took along time to get that cold like far longer than the 200 year it took for us the warm the earth up 2 degrees and second of all non of the geological activity that warm the earth are going on right now at the scale needed for this amount of warming unlike the ice age 

Well I honestly don't have much to say about this next one good too see your a conservationists I guess, but also renewables are at a point where there economically viable and hydro electricity is the cheapest form of electricity that we have ,I have more to say about nuclear further on 

You have such a way with words that I can barely understand you next one because we are pushing the word into a unsuitable economic death spiral trough climate change of we continue on this path the global economy will collapse here in ireland in 2018 we had and massive heat wave and drought I remember it ver clearly i was on holidays  abroad and when I came back all of a sudden all any was talking about was how all there potatoes died and all my potatoes died as well they didn't get enough water all my grass died as well for the same reason so if that isn't doesn't show you the economic damage of climate change the fact that it was able to bring a first world country to it knee's I don't know what will 

Alright I will finnaly talk about nuclear energy so the way I see it is that it is too late for us to invest in nuclear energy one nuclear power plant takes ten years to come into service wich is simply too long now don't get me wrong I think that  we should bring the decommissioned nuclear power plants back online and renovated any old power plant too make them better but building new ones will simply take too long

I already know what your gonna say for my next point ,your gonna say that you can't compare Ireland and America but I will so just bare with me for one second so in ireland in 2021 one during peak wind production in February 2022 ,53% of ireland electricity came from wind here in ireland were quickly get rid of fossil fuels without the use of nuclear 

Your next point I already basically addressed and that how arr you gonna make a back bone of nuclear when it takes 10years to make a nuclear power plant 

For your point about Obamas green energy program I personally don't know enough about it to say whether it was a waste or not

And for your last point I agree if we manage to set up a solid renewable and nuclear back bone too the United States electricity grid then we would have avoided a disaster that could have ended with are end and the collapse of the global economy"
"@Tristan Heatonüá∫üá¶ Broader solar activity and its magnitude, and I don't just mean the Milankovitch Cycles either.

Add volcanism and sea-water absorbtion/release for CO2 as well.

People forget that we are positively TINY compared to anything on the geologic scale. During the COVID lockdowns, we saw rapid reversals in air and water quality in many places considered irredeemably polluted. (Italy and China, especially)

And like so many other things we've conceited with ourselves since the dawn of the Industrial Era, we continue to grossly underestimate the magnitude of these changes vs those time scales.

To put that into perspective, 10,000 years ago, most of the world was a perpetual snowfield or wind plain. The process of thawing glaciers began thousands of years before the first stone of the first city was laid down.

I do not say this to excuse our current course of action in regards to pollution as I am a conservationist, but rather to maintain the proper physics oriented perspective that is required to address such matters in a useful way.

If we push global society into an unsustainable economic death spiral, we would probably end up using the one piece of technology that assuredly will result in immediate global ecological ruin for an alarming part of the Earth's surface. (nuclear weaponry)

Weaning ourselves off of petrol entirely is not feasible at this time because we need an alternative that actually sodding works and the only version of that which we can deploy broadly in industrialized countries is Nuclear Fission.

Once you have that in place and our manufacturing is swapping over largely to that, then we can start cranking out sensible amounts of solar and wind generation to supplement the grid. 

(and do so in ways that allow the components of these generation systems to be reusable/refurbishable instead of disposable, which is sadly, what we actually got after dumping horrific amounts of money into Obama's Green Energy policies)

With those two goals accomplished, we might have a fighting chance at preventing the annihilation of our species by our own hand in the latter half of the 21st century when most of the world's current fresh water supplies become exhausted.

But if an oil spill ruined your favorite beach; you would scream the loudest.
"I think the switch to electric vehicles will only happen in the cities.  We still need gasoline and diesel to power our trucks, buses, trains, ships and heavy equipment.  Gasoline might become scarcer.   But diesel will most likely stay far longer than expected.  As much as we hate coal, it is the cheapest way to generate electricity.  So the so called ""clean"" EVs are actually powered by coal."
"Coal hasn't been the cheapest for a long time, it's now the 2nd most expensive. Only nuclear is more expensive. Solar is the cheapest, followed by wind & then hydro."
"The ages old misconception that people keep spreading. Even with coal power EVs are cleaner than fossil fuel cars, just because of the sheer effeciency they have. Also, solar is actually cheaper than coal now and the difference keeps widening as both solar panels and batteries keep getting cheaper to produce."

Iran and Iraq are not pronounced that way
"Other than high school civics students, not sure why anyone would put much stock in this meandering, oversimplified video presentation. Producer seems to have a conclusion he wants to draw regardless of the complicated reality of the global oil business. As for oil shares being a poor investment, tell that to CVX shareholders who are up 55+% over the past year."
"This video sounds convincing until you look at the weekly WTI crude oil price per barrel. In early November 2020 prices started going up, and in late February 2022 prices surged up. 

On Feb 22, crude oil cost $92 per barrel. On March 7, oil cost $119. Are we supposed to believe this had nothing to do with the Ukraine invasion?

From June 2020 to November 2020 oil prices held steady at around $40 per barrel. Then in November 2020 prices started rising, and they kept rising for months. Are we supposed to believe this had nothing to do with the election of an anti fossil fuel administration? 

The negative prices in April 2020 probably had some effect, but they are not the only cause."
Awesome video Extremely interesting.
The world is fucked.
They are just using it as an excuse to raise prices and blame it on the war or inflation. It's utter bullshit that they are allowed to raise prices willy-nilly at their own discretion like this and it's detestable how the government allows it to happen unchecked because of lobbyists and corporations giving them money.
"financial uncertainty, regional instability, etc, all will make it more difficult to maintain the supply chains necessary to build solar and wind systems."
Everything around me is because of the war.
"""strict environmental laws"" aka the default weakest level across Europe."
"little dishonest at 17:28 . you don't just need a drilling permits to preform fracking, you need water and sanitary discharge permits and the like too,  which the government hasn't given to many of those drilling permit holders. your skewed narrative depicts something more like giving someone a car with no gas and telling them they just don't want to drive anywhere."
misinformed if you think this marks a meaningful end of oil's dominance.
"So what happens to airlines, plastics, and people who can't afford a tesla? Fuck us I guess"
We screwed over the world so badly with our attempts to moderate the pandemic. This will go down as one of the biggest blunders in human history.
"So when Domestic production increased, it took all the power away from OPEC and prices went down (as you showed in your video). Once Domestic production was decreased it gave the power back to OPEC and prices skyrocketed. If you look at the factors that led to decreased Domestic production, it all starts with the new Presidential administration and the cancellation of pipelines. Domestic companies were investing in projects, but they got cancelled by the current administration. So now that their current projects they already spent millions on are either shut down or made prohibitively expensive, they cut investment and production. Power goes back to OPEC and prices skyrocket. I'm not saying this is the only factor affecting the oil market, but its one of the biggest ones. Under the previous administration oil prices were low and oil company profits were historically low. Under the current administration oil prices are high and oil company profits are historically high. So who is really on the side of the oil companies?"
"@duit k I'm from Utah so I remember reading that. But Utah was very limited with lockdowns compared to other states. In 2020 and 2021 we were catching a lot of heat for not being as into the lockdowns and masks as other states. Our schools were mostly all open, etc. Florida caught similar heat. But according to that article our strategy was better. Although I trust these types of expert studies about as far as I can throw them. It is their hypothesis."
"@Michael Madsen there is actually official data comparing damage to economy vs covid death rate per US state, I don't recall where I saw it, all I remember was that Utah did pretty well both in little economic damage and low death rate. If I come across those charts I will link them here."
"@duit k I think the conclusion that the lockdowns saved lives is a unproven hypothesis at best. Of course we will never know, maybe a lot more people would have died, but the charts don't seem to show that lockdowns made any difference at all. But of course we will never know for sure. Just like we will never really know what gas prices would be if other decisions were made."
"@duit k I'm not saying that geopolitics is the only factor, but to claim that the oil market is not a geopolitical issue is not true either. Oil prices rise and fall with geopolitical actions. Its always been that way. I'm not saying that oil companies aren't gun shy because of their experiences over the last few years, but they were continuing to invest despite that. Projects designed to support and keep the supply growing were shut down and we became dependent on foreign sources of oil (hello OPEC). One of the main conclusions from the video is that oil prices were very low when OPEC did not hold the power. Once OPEC got the power back, prices skyrocketed. If Domestic oil companies are hesitant to produce due to recent volatility, then we should be promoting more pipelines and projects that support supply and energy independence, not cancelling them and becoming dependent on foreign sources. On a side note, the lockdowns of the pandemic destroyed the stable world we knew. That is what cut demand and made prices plummet. IMO, we shot ourselves in the foot with our (not just America, but the whole world) response to COVID."
"If one wants to make a lot of money, find or create something all people need. Supply it then cut back on production, point to another cause and cash will fill your pocket."

"Gas isnt expensive in USA, look at us in Sweden and you will cry. We have the highest price in the world."
TLDR?
This is your best video yet
"Did you just make a 22:23 minute video *ignoring the cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline...* hmm...
""Persuasive essay"" sounds like double speak for *agenda* as a result. Renewables are nice but they don't enjoy the same advantages as oil and unless you know of a massive world wide construction project for *nuclear energy* you are quite misinformed if you think this marks a meaningful end of oil's dominance."
‚Ä¶because Keystone XL wasn‚Äôt even 10% completed and had been in legal limbo for years so how exactly is it‚Äôs cancellation a contributor to the global price of gas?
"Fantastic video. Absolutely love this channel. Am I correct in understanding that since the oil industry no longer wants to invest in infrastructure, they are able to cut production to boost price without needing large revenues like they did in the past to pay back their investments in capex? Lower production means lower sales, but revenue is boosted since price is boosted and operating costs are lower than ever with less investment and less heads to pay?"
"Oil prices have to be sustainably high to make it worthwhile risking investment. Just because the price is high enough to be profitable today does not mean the investment will be made, since it can take years for production to begin. If they invest today, and prices later drop to subeconomic levels, they will take a loss. Producers take the long view, not the short term view, when making investment decisions due to these risks."
"Supplies become the ""enemy.""   Oh well, capitalism doesn't exist anymore if that enemy is attacked.  People, either be capitalist or fascist/monopolist.  You can't have it both ways."
This isn‚Äôt the end of oil.  The delusional will soon come to realize that transitioning to electrified transportation isn‚Äôt a realistic goal in the near future.
You seem to be leaving out one of the main reasons that oil companies aren‚Äôt investing in more production. We have a government that is extremely hostile to oil development and use. And is pushing the unrealistic goals of electrifying most transportation in the next ten years. We didn‚Äôt have this problem pre 2020.

Petition to invent a car that runs on the corpses of CEOs.
Gorgeous. Clearly and simply narrated.
It is not just a monopoly cartel fixing price and floating supply.  It is the spot price system too.  It is a system designed for speculation (rentiers).  If buyers agreed to long term contracts with oil producers it would eliminate the speculators. When energy production turns mainly to renewables there will be the same problem if governments continue to allow their energy importers to buy at the spot price.
Or we could just switch to Nuclear but there is no profit for them in that.
The current price of a barrel of oil is the same today as it was in Sept. 2013.  Less if you account for inflation.  The price of gas is currently  67% higher than it was in 2013.  Clearly the gasoline market has become detached from the cude market.  Price gouging is being labelled as inflation.
So it's extortion and no one in power does anything about it. Need a law requiring a certain level of production in the US and cap the prices with a SMALL allowance for inflation.
One word...greed!
"OPEC =>  (no USA) => cartel
IMF => Normal organization (controlled by USA)"
"So they are choosing to kill themselves rather than renewables keeping them out meaning people or countries not wanting to change to renewable will suffer at hand of the people such countries support, woah how stupid and sad."

"Your conclusions are complete trash, epicly shortsighted and ignorant. ""Renewables"" are neither renewable, nor carbon neutral, and they are definitely NOT cheaper than oil. The fact is that the oil industry is using their control over the market to milk everyone in the world for money. The instant that their profits start to decline because people are unwilling to pay, they will drop the price, and increase production, and the market will resume its expansion. Someday we will rip down the worthless wind turbines, and toss solar panels in the garbage because they cost more to recycle than mak brand new, and we will switch to the one true environmentally friendly energy, nuclear. Until that happens, Oil will dominate the market. You, sir, are a total dipshit."
"And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.

"The scarcity is real. The Caspian oil field is called Kashagan. It produces 400,000 barrels a day. The biggest oil field Ghawar produced 5 million barrels a day for approximately 60 years. Kashagan won't come close. It's also a highly acidic oil. Mankind consumes 100 million barrels a day. Kashagan's 400,000 barrels a day is not half of 1%. We are in the end game of affordable oil. 
You will believe that when you see the signs at petrol stations ESSENTIAL SERVICES ONLY."
"Private companies arent regulated and set whatever the heck price they want. Biggest reason: to make record profits and to hell with any of us. They are keeping it high to get ridiculous profits from filling up army tanks, warships, army equipmemt on both sides of the war. Governments will pay whatever the price is reguardless. Private greedy oil leaders to blame...these are the ones that need held 'accountable' to put it in a 'nice' way. (Russ. Only supplies 3% to us, so thats not enough reason to blame that situation over there, total bs)"

"Another factor is the decline in refining capacity. For example a number of refineries have been shut down in the last 20 years in the Eastern USA and the Caribbean due to long term financial planning, obsolescence, too expensive to make less environmental upgrades or replacement."
"Can confirm. Here on Cura√ßao, a Dutch Caribbean Island our refinery has been shut down in 2018. Highly skilled workers with diplomas are suffering and unable to find stable jobs till today."
"I'm confused, I was watching this video thinking it was RealLifeLore channel"
"High fuel prices are good for oil and gas companies and their investor‚Äôs trying to make the money back that they lost. 

The last couple of years has not been the greatest for them. So they‚Äôd  like to see some returns on their investments. Before they start spending more money. 

A lot of U.S. production is getting back online and it will slowly make it‚Äôs way to the market it‚Äôs not an overnight process it takes months to happen!  

Biden has no control over Oil prices if he did he would fix the problem to shut down all of his detractors. Negative oil prices didn‚Äôt look good for Trump either and if he could have fixed it he would have. Taking Oil Wells offline and shutting down Frac crews like mine is what helped bring the price of oil out of the negative range."
"This was a pretty good analysis and history of oil volatility, but I'd be cautious about the final conclusion and more than cautious about prediction drawn from that conclusion. Two factors not mentioned in this video or anywhere I've seen in the comment section are:

1. The oil industry, like everyone else, has been affected by general supply chain issues and inflation, which has driven up the price of tapping new wells. Effectively this makes supply expansion at the moment more costly than it otherwise would be.

2. Oil companies also took on a ton of debt in the last two years, so increasing profits to both pay that down and pay shareholders is a higher priority for them at the moment, rather than expansion.

Neither of those factors are small, and they both point to the current situation being a temporary recovery from the pandemic. I'm not saying this video is wrong and we will definitely go back to the old way, but trying to predict the future of the oil market is risky business. Nobody knows what's going to happen, and the incentives guiding today's market can change in unexpected ways tomorrow."
"I also see a lot of optimism for renewables, but renewables are also wasteful and just as if not more brittle to disruptions due to their intermittent nature."
"I hope western don't use their imperial power like 600 years ago in asia, america, and africe. Western can invade another planet instead."

"Did Klaus Schwab himself pay you to make this video? Seriously a ridiculous take on the oil industry. ""the end of oil is near. the momentum is already too strong."" How do you think all the plastics that go in to a Tesla are made? Where is all the lithium for the batteries mined from? Those questions provide a much better context for where we are with ""renewables."" This persuasive essay read more like World Economic Forum commercial for fake meat than an informative argument.

"One interesting  thing i have head is that some of the big oil companies in Houston have been buying up leases and old depleted wells off the Houston coast, like 20-30 miles offshore.  Most likely not to drill again, but to use the already in place pipelines and pump CO2 back in to the ground from the refiners and power plants in that area, Im sure in the coming years there will be a higher CO2 tax that will be in place and incentives companies to do this."
Why you copying other people‚Äôs comments?
"One thing to note: there's always been ""fracking"" (short for ""fracturing"") in the oil industry, long before shale oil was possible. It's just back then they used explosives (often nitroglycerin) instead of water. It would be more correct to use ""hydrofracking"" when talking about shale oil.



I know it's a minor point, but saying that fracking was what made shale oil extraction possible is a bit misleading. Fracking makes all oil extraction possible, it's just hydrofracking that works on shale."

"Sam, your videos are consistently amazing. I'd just like to request that you simplify your script for listeners by reducing the number of clauses.

7:58 ""In a year when West Texas Intermediate crude prices plummeted below $40, a mark so low that OPEC broke convention by welcoming Russia into OPEC+, and vowing to make explicit production cuts, producing a barrel in OPEC's 3 largest producers, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, cost at most, in the case of Iraq, a paltry $10.57.""

The sentence makes perfect grammatical sense of course, but for a listener it's tough to follow because I keep having to divert my attention to the clause and then come back to what you were saying before. Please consider splitting it into separate sentences."

California is the seventh largest oil producing state.  130 million barrels last year.
I think there may be a misrepresentation of the wells with fracking. The companies may have permits for the wells but with the advances in fracking technology you can use one wellhead and bore out in multiple directions both horizontally and vertically making multiple wellheads redundant.
"Not really for onshore. That's more of an offshore thing. I have never seen a single SHL/BOP/Wellhead for multiple laterals, and I've been working unconventionals for 5 years. Even on a ten well megapad with tight spacing you still would have the actual wellheads separated by 25-30' and you'd zipper frack them."

"One interesting  thing i have head is that some of the big oil companies in Houston have been buying up leases and old depleted wells off the Houston coast, like 20-30 miles offshore.  Most likely not to drill again, but to use the already in place pipelines and pump CO2 back in to the ground from the refiners and power plants in that area, Im sure in the coming years there will be a higher CO2 tax that will be in place and incentives companies to do this."
This video is so informative
"I see how the scarcity strategy makes sense collectively for the industry, but the industry isn‚Äôt a collective. Isn‚Äôt there enough non-OPEC competition that each individual producer would have incentive to produce now and take advantage of high prices until the collective effect of those actions bring the price back down?"

"As a young pilot training for a career in the airlines, I find this a bit scary. There are no good alternatives to kerosene for large aircraft. Hydrogen may become a possibility, but it‚Äôs at least 10 years out. Higher fuel prices probably means less demand for flights and fewer jobs for pilots. Not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, just potentially a bad thing for me."
Gas prices are high because big oil is a GOP venture!
You are brave.
"I am not political in nature, but the main reason was because of the Keystone Pipeline being closed down by Biden. We already knew gas prices were up way before the war. Duh."

Oh so we in the Fallout universe now is that you're saying
Speculators
Is the price of gas / oil regulated by the government like other utilities are? If not then why not since it's an energy source?
"The rise of gas prices is from pure greed.  Any excuse to raise the price.  ""Look!  The sun is shining.  Let's raise gas prices."""
"So still Putin's fault, got it"
How much did the Biden Administration pay you to make this?
"Nothing, he‚Äôs just speaking facts lmfao"
"That's bullshit! Thousands of those 9000 leases are already in court being disputed! 2nd you can't just start drilling and magically transport to the refineries, and the Biden administration has banned all pipelines from the new oil drilling. The Biden administration had beed intentionally hostile to the oil industry! They're still building new gas stations so investors are still there. You are just wrong!"

Basically they control price. We the consumer can only control consumption.  The profits for the rest of the world's economy are dependent on whether old producers are willing to share their profits with  the world's economy. If a worker can not afford a vehicle or transportation in a reasonable ratio wages or business expenses in relation to monopolies that over profit then that causes a bust for us all. What if there really is a zero point energy source?

"From the point onwards where he says people have lost faith (in oil) I am no longer with him. Any company that is directly or indirectly involved with the production of oil (and natural gas) had been thinking for a long time of possibilities to transition to (broader) activities as well as alternatives in the field of energy; production, distribution, storage, conversion - both chemically and otherwise..! I personally hope that worldwide awareness will come with a willingness to turn to alternatives to (the) production and usage of plastics (with as a consequence the seemingly unavoidable spill-over into the world's waterways (rivers and streams and ultimately seas) and nature otherwise) and will bring about that so badly needed (push for) the introduction of environmentally friendly alternatives, in other words materials that are biodegradable (and thus when they break down only release substances that other life forms, mainly the plant world, can LIVE on and from, instead of it, mainly the animal world, getting suffocated and poisoned. A lot progress has been made and a lot of progress and research still must be made, but it absolutely is a possibility. It can only hope that countries - and their representatives and politicians - worldwide finally will step up their efforts to put pressure onto an industry that is sluggish and basically does not WANT to change be cause plastics are easy profits readily made (and as a result we can see them going on turning a blind eye to the irreparable damage we do to nature, to animals everywhere, to our seas, fish that got little bits of it inside of them, birds that in 2018 got on average seven pieces of plastic in their gut at any given time, which now likely has risen to eight or nine). Countries and their governments can do SO much, can do SO much more than they have been doing! They can start offering rewards for novel initiatives, for novel inventions - given that they ACTUALLY WORK and ACTUALLY ARE REAL; they can summon complete congresses, can start up expert groups arrived at development, they can hire scientists, experts in the field; they can stimulate expertise developing by putting out grants! The number of possibilities are sheer endless 'when you are' a State, an actual Country ~ and it is time we start to realise (it) ! In case that (any of) you STILL got ANY doubt, just take one little moments to have a look at some photos of what plastic waste, mainly packaging materials, a lot of it food packages and plastic bags, but just as well clothing made from polyester, nylon etc, ... just look at some footage of what sewer, completely plugged with the stuff, one of the once upon a time proudest rivers of Indonesia looks like today."

Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him]. 

This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned

. But whoever practices truth [and does what is right‚Äîmorally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are‚Äîaccomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God‚Äôs help, in dependence on Him].‚Äù‚Äù

"And what happened in March/April of 2020 that caused oil demand to plummet and oil prices to go negative?

Governments worldwide shut down *everything,* and literally locked people in their homes.  No one buys gasoline when they can't drive anywhere.

Simultaneously, those same governments started printing money as if it was going out of style.  Thus causing the inflation we're seeing now.  Making investment in oil production even MORE costly.

Thank you, big government for FUCKING US ALL OVER YET AGAIN!

Why the hell do you people VOTE for these IDIOTIC politicians that continually GROW government?!!"
Hungarian people cannot pay for too high prices so if the fuel soars more then my home country economically collapses.
"This is all because weak governments. Rich have been buying politicians from civilization down, but never in such quantity as today."
"So basically they are just going to gauge as much as they can out of those that won't transition right now. People need to realize that they are playing the now game, so we need to play the investment game."
"The idea that the climate is in danger from fossil fuel is silly. This chicken Little argument has gone on for 4 decades...and nary a sign of it yet. And the idea this is the end of oil is another premature obituary. The fuel of the future will be liquid or gas - not bird chopping ecocrucifixes nor Chinese solar panels. Where is the lithium going to come from?  And plastics make up much of the oil business. Oil will still be around 100 years from now. Autos and personal transportation ditto. Otherwise, we deevolve back into the 15th century. And we have no idea what the next great energy idea will bring...but isn't going to be a wind generator and solar panels on top of your car."

I just left work and someone drilled three holes in my gas tank.
One hole on the very bottom and two holes on the sides
"Thats fantastic and all... But if you had say ONE gas company and they had ONE customer...and both sides had no ability to alter  that in the short to medium term, and could not afford to do so anyway. Both sides can screw over prices. Cause a problem and both stay as far from that as they can.

 Enter into this argument one European Union, and Russian Federation. An EU that is now more determined than ever to race to the renewable finish line like a dreadnaught, and a country that cannot afford them to do so without finding its population living in caves banging rocks together to make fire!

Now, lets look at what that means for the EU, because lets face it, the Russian Gas station is screwed and that's all we can say. Well renewables take lots of energy to get going. You have to manufacture things, and transport them and design them and all sorts of energy intensive tasks, and where will you get that energy from, on a continent wide project, without gas and oil?

Well for that you will need new raw materials for renewables. That's lithium, and cesium and uranium, and special silicates and all sorts of things. You need factories to make the things and they need power, you need a plan on where to put them, and battery technology and wind turbine technology and countless engineers to keep all that running... and unemployed oil workers won't cut it! And now you are told you have 24 months to do all that or you'll fall into an economic depression.

Welcome, to the European Union!"

TLDR
OPEC cut production in 2020 to protect profits. American firms are afraid to build capital on their land because they are worried that high prices won't let long enough for them to turn a profit.
Forcing a slow down and clean air. There is zero reason to have fuel so high priced. Dump fuel is the way to freedom.

"No they are 100% playing both sides. They are using these profits to invest in renewables, biofuels, and the like. They are securing their futures right now by screwing people over at the pump. You really think they'd just willingly accept their fate? If someone was to ramp up oil production like in 2015 again, the prices still wouldn't change, they'd just collect even MORE profit. The war in eastern europe is just being used, once again, as a coverup for actual changes in global politics and economy, covering up the fact these gas prices are artificial and have nothing to do with the war."
"Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt believe that oil will go anywhere anytime soon. As a polymer researcher and engineer, most of the commodity chemicals we depend on for almost everything we come into contact with is derived from oil in some form. Sure, the transportation and energy sectors may find alternatives to oil, but commodity chemicals and manufacturing (and air travel) will surely be oil dependent for the foreseeable future. Additionally, we will continue to see political instability and war as a result of oil control (as well as other resources like water)."
"@Jeff Hopefully in the future these initiatives can be adequately implemented! I do enjoy discussing future prospects of implementation of new (or under utilized) technologies and chemistries, as every researcher has their own thoughts on that matter."
"@CTay 1707 oh, there certainly are many different hydrocarbon based products involved in all maner of chemical productions, both of polymers and hundreds of other things. However, there are very few hydrocarbons left that we can't easily synthesize. The main problem at the moment is cost, and the fact that electricity for it  currently mostly comes from fossile sources, so why bother with the extra steps.
As for electricity and heating requirements, a lot can be done both directly and indirectly with renewables to combat that in the comming years and decades.
Basides diversifying generation, there is of course storage to combat outages. And not just storage of electricity, but heat as well. It is pretty simple and cheap to make various solar thermal heat collectors, that then store heat energy directly for later use. Much, much cheaper in fsct to generate the ehat energy and store it directly than to convert it to electricity first, though you might still need electrcity for the final burst of heatin.
And besides storage, an already established, but sadly so fsr under-utilised solution for intermittend renewable energy generation is high volate dc power lines over long distances. While it represents a hughe initial investment of course, HVDC lines have ridiculously lower transmission loss with e.g. a recently build chinese project has below 1.5% transmission loss per 1 thousand kilometres. You can easily (as in, all established technology already in commercial use) build massive long distance HVDC lines spanning significant parts of the globe to move eneryga round. And there is always wind/sun/water movement somewhere you can use."
"@Jeff Yes, you're totally correct, however, the yields from these plant-derived sources are only really one part of the complicated process at synthesizing polymers (especially on a commercial-scale). You also have to consider the large quantities of solvents used in several different applications (e.g., toluene, octane, benzene, etc.) that are needed for research and commercial purposes. Additionally, many polymer productions require an immense amount of heat and energy, which needs to be consistently provided (at night and on windless days). So, the base-load of electricity is fossil-fuel sources. I'm not against going 100% renewable and leaving fossil-fuels in the past (in fact I'm rooting for this reality!)., however, there are certain limitations that we must be realistic with. One day fossil-fuels will not be used for electricity, heating, transport, etc. but it's still a crucial resource that provides us with bounties of potential. I highly recommend you to look up zero-carbon coal cracking for commodity chemical production. There's no such thing as 100% impact-free resource extraction and manufacturing (everything has consequences)."
"Except as a polymer researcher you should know there is a very, very important core part you missnomed:
The polymer (and other chemicals) production depend on Hydrocarbons for production. Those mostly com from fossile gas/oil/coal soruces right now, but there is no reason why they can't derrive from plant or chemicaly synthesized hydrocarbons instead. Currently fossile sources are just cheaper, but if prices keep rising, and technology for the other options improves, that will change."

"When speaking about the total carbon footprint of ethanol vs gasoline, it is actually more carbon intensive than gasoline. This has been proven and you can find more information online. So, saying it is cleaner is relative. They did say ""burns cleaner"" so I assume that means that it doesn't pollute the local environment where it use consumed as much as gasoline does. Maybe....prolly..."
"@Jeff whoa, bro! Lmfao I don't know who out there is saying Ukraine is the aggressor and Russia was retaliating against them. That's ridiculous!!! I will say that the Ukraine situation is more nuanced than most people have cared to learn and the Ukrainian government, along with the EU/NATO, were definitely doing things that Russia considered a threat and explicitly against their stated demands. Zelensky even had the audacity to say that he wanted to join NATO on February 14th, which was likely the final straw for Russia. The fact that Ukraine passed legislation that oppressed Russian speaking Ukrainians by not allowing them to conduct their official business in their native language when it came to interacting with the government, along with the fact that Ukraine had killed around 14,000 Ukrainian citizens in the Donbass region for the past 8 years while the western world wasn't even covering it in the news, let alone actually doing something about it, are definitely reasons that Russia felt that something needed to be done; but don't get me wrong, I do not agree with the way Russia decided to address the situation, but anyone who tries to act like Ukraine was totally innocent is a fucking moron. We (the US) and the EU should've done something to address that situation, instead of turning a blind eye to the human rights violations and their crimes against their own citizens.

As for the climate change discussion, I will do a bit of searching around and get back to you with more specific information; but to say that you believe that humans contribute 90% to the climate situation I feel is not based in reality. I say this because the climate has changed throughout history and there is quite a bit of evidence (from what I remember) showing that the sun has a significant impact because it became more active...being as the sun fluctuates and has cycles, and I don't just mean the 11 year solar cycle...there are many different cycles it goes through concurrently. Also, just a bit of information, according to NASA, the earth is 5% greener (more foliage) than it was 20 years ago, but I do understand that forest clearing, like in the Amazon, released carbon that had been sequestered. But that's to be expected because CO¬≤ will drive plant growth, and will continue to, and the earth will continue to become more green as colder climates become more hospitable to plants and as CO¬≤ continue to rise. That is another thing, it is taken without question that higher CO¬≤ levels is a totally bad thing. I'm not sure I agree with the premise that higher temperatures and elevated CO¬≤ is a catastrophic problem, and at what point would it be undeniable that it would be a major concern...obviously if the earth doubled in temperature that would be a bad thing but I would need to review the ""science"" about predictions if their speculations on humanity's contribution were accurate (hypothetically) and what the would expect to see with no intervention. 

K I didn't mean for this to be so long because I wanted to look into what you have said and then get back to you with more information, but I wanted to address some things to give you something to ponder in the meantime."
"@d3g3n3r4t3 I'll s√ºlit my reply into a few parts:

1)Actually the carbon footprint of various renewables is a known and throighly researched entity, and it's ludicrously low compared to fossile fuels. As in, lowest single digit percentages at the highest for long-lived renewables like proper solar, wind etc. Installations compared to fossiles. The only main renewable that is kind of bad in most cases is synthgas made of biological feedstock (animal waste products, plant feedstock etc).

2) can't remeber the exact details, but there are various studies by the US government showing that the US could use a couple kinds of sugar beets instead of corn that all grow in the same soil types/qualities and climate the US currently grows corn in. Other studies for bioethanol production from Europe showed sugar beets to be significantly more productive per area and per resource input than corn, some even going to more than a 50% improvement if remeber it right. Also hemp is not usefull for it, as you want plant based sugars for ethanol production, not cellulose. Cellulose is more relevant to make clothing/building materials/paper alternatives, and for certain synthgas production methods.

3) On cheap energy, espeialy for de eloping nations, fossile fuel are utter trash for them for any case except when you absolutely need constant high energy output. If you look at projects in the US and europe for wind and solar energy from the last 2+ years, there are many that are profitable when selling energy at 4-5 cents/kWH. Meanwhile the fossile fuels, especialy oil and coal, sit somehwere between 15-25 cents/kWH to make a profit. And if you bring electricity somewhere that didn't intialy have it, you can do a lot with intermittend energy. E.g. a lot is used for water pumping and filtration. But that doesn't need to run all the time, you can set it up with tanks to produce fresh water while electricity is beeing generated, and empty out slowly even when there is none. 
Add to that the fact yoo have a lot less infrastructure requirements and thus lower set up costs as well, as you don't need to constantly supply fuel, and you got a far better option to fossile fuels there that is far cheaper.

4) I don't want to go into discussions about the exact impacts of climate change, but the simple fact that it is nearly entirely human made is really throoughly proven. Yes, there is natural temperature  changes on earth. Thanks to various geological, ar heological and other makers we have a very good idea of average temperature ranges for every decade for the last 50 thousand+ years. For the last 50+ years we had more temperature change per year on average than in the highest fluctuating decade in the entire history before that. As in, tempeeature is changing more than 10 times faster than EVER BEFORE.
It is also proven that the main cause of it are changes in CO2, methane, and average albedo levels (albedo is the heat reflection rate of any given peice of earth, e.g. snow reflects more sun heat back to space). Thanks to ice core analysis we also know that human CO2 production is directly reponsible for changing CO2 levels more than a hundeed times faster, and to much higher total levels than in thousands of years before. It ismalso easily proven thanks to geolocial and archeological markers that a couple hudnred years ago the albedo levels were much ebtter, be ause we had more forests around the glob, far less concrete/asphalt surfaces et , which have massively pulled down albedo levels, meaning the ground absorbs more heat. And I don't think there is any dispute what species is responsible for cutting down/burning down enormous forest areas around the globe, putting up a building and street network spanning an enormous total area etc.
Any denying of the fact that humans are the direct cause of the majority (not all, but 90%+) of climate change is just flat out malicious lying. That's on the same level of obvious bullshit or informedness saying Ukraine is the agressor and invaded russia to start the war."
"‚Äã@Jeff Nice! Thanks for the info; and I'd be interested in more information about the carbon footprint of better feedstocks like switchgrass combined with land that was already in use and renewable energy; but, that last one (renewables) has the same problems in determining the true carbon footprint as does ethanol and I would insist on that being figured in by the researchers.

I wonder if there is much information on how good hemp is for making ethanol. Likely one of the best considered how quickly it grows and it's high cellulose content.

I do not share the enthusiasm that most people around the world, especially Europeans, have for reducing carbon emissions. Partially explainable because not only am I American, I'm a Texan. üëãü§†I will say that I am not against reducing emissions, but not at the cost of efficiency. I feel there is still so many people in the world that need to be helped and lifted out of poverty that we should utilize that lower cost energy, at least until the point where we have addressed the needs of food, water, shelter and medical care for everyone. I would just see paying more for energy when cheaper fossil fuels could've been used as wasted funds that could've gone towards addressing that problem, if that makes any sense. Also, I am not nearly as convinced of the seriousness of the problem of climate change, let alone the extent of mankind's contribution to ""global warming"". The fact that the climate is changing is undeniable; however, it is impossible to say with any certainty how big of an impact we are actually having. Is it 100% because of us, is it .000001% because of us? We don't know and there is no proof of any percentage given, and never will be.

More important, in my opinion, would be working towards energy independence. That is a much more noble aspiration than reducing carbon emissions, and we can see that there are interests that support one over the other...FOR OBVIOUS REASONS! We already have the technology for safe and effective cheap energy in nuclear. This could meet everyone's energy needs easily and abundantly, while also meeting target carbon emission reduction goals. But because it would pretty much mean that energy was free, we don't see governments moving to this solution.

Sorry for my rant. I hope this information will be useful to someone. Thanks again for your response. 8)"
"To expand and slightly relevate that, 2 things:

1) 'Burn cleaner' might mainly refer to reductions in non-CO2 missions. the usual 10% Ethanol mix many countries have now for exampel produces less Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and in lower tech also reduce soot particulates because it helps to mroe fully burn the fuel.

2) Whiel yes, Adding Ethanol to gasolien in total isn't to great, it depends on various fluctuating factors, liek here the energy for mrefinement comes from (renewables/fossile), if you use new or existing land for it, and very importantly what fuel crop you use. The US is one of the worst in the world for example, because they create hughe amoutns of extra farmlands for it which releases CO2, got a mostly fossile energy grid for production/refining, and use corn as feedcrop, which is one of the worst options around in terms of CO2 and land efficiency."
It's the communists. End of story.
Oil companies are ramping up as quickly as they can. They are having supply chain and labor shortage issues just like the rest of the world. It was just a few months ago that politicians were claiming to shut down the industry and now they are saying the industry isn‚Äôt drilling enough. It‚Äôs not as easy as turning a value. The industry is much more fragmented than most understand as well. The gross oversupply in the 2010‚Äôs that led to the price crash is evidence of that.
"No, oil execs said very clearly that they are not planning to ramp up production."

"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."
"So after decades of over-investing and over-supply, oil is reaching its normal price if total global capital allocation is efficient. You see the same in mining - poor industry performance in returns because every bright spark executive and gold rush get rich idiot sacrifices profit for market share, then squeezes production costs and cuts corners when that turns out to be a terrible idea for the collective industry. So prices are now fair."
I‚Äôm okay with expensive oil. It‚Äôs only a tax on our frontline workers that can‚Äôt buy a Tesla.
"Great. So when oil is finally completely gone what is most of the worlds poor supposed to do. Here in Canada people are putting less food on the table because gas has gotten so expensive. Renewables are the future they say, but electric cars are completely unfeasible here. To start with an electric car costs anywhere from 4 to 50 times what the average citizen can afford for a car. But this is Canada, and we don‚Äôt have a choice. The only way from point a to b is a car. A large portion of homes are heated with natural gas, so are we supposed to just freeze to death when winter rolls around? How is this anything but a bleak dystopian world that wants us all dead? Gas prices rise and rise and yet they demand we start commuting to work again. This is the end. There will be no economy left after we starve as we can no longer make a profit through our labours."

"Umm, I call bullshit on all of this because just a couple years ago, the united states was 100% energy independent and now all of the sudden that is gone? Its all a scam. We have more oil than the middle east and oil prices should not be this bad for us at all. Welcome to the scam people!"
Wait till they find out how much baby oil is worth. They will be chrushing and squeezing it out of the infants in no time.
Economic power is linked to education and a cooperative mindset. Both of that is at least partially genetic...
"Lol, in Europe tax on gas is like 55-65% of the price per liter"
"Please correct me if I'm wrong but over 12 years ago they made the biggest oil discovery of all time in the Gulf of Mexico but said it would take 10 years to build the infrastructure to bring it on line. So where is this oil? The ""shortage"" is controlled."

fundimentally missing. how's that poop taste?
Jokes on you my country doesn't have oil now.
"California is a dumpster fire, and has been for some time.  It's why more people are moving away from the state and their population is dropping.  Unfortunately the nutjobs moving out are bringing the same horrible political views to places like Texas, Colorado, Washington... if you are going to do that you are going to ruin those states too."
"""Oil is expensive now because they have to ship and process it"" ... what a joke.  Did not have this problem when Trump was President!  The US was energy independent ($3 a gallon) under Trump, now we are begging for oil at $7 a gallon from OPEC.  Biden killed our energy independence with obama era red tape.  When our enemies decide what the price of oil is, they tend to go HIGH.  When (not if) Trump becomes President again, all of the nay sayers who do not believe what I just said will see the price of oil go back to $3 a gallon in real time, validating what I have just said.  Our country will return to energy independence and likely stay there for good unless a mass group of people have a major lapse in judgement again.  FYI: the coal needed to produce electricity for electric cars puts out more CO2 into the atmosphere than what you would get from oil used in a car for the same amount of energy.  Almost no CO2 is released in drilling for oil, the same cannot be said for coal mining (massive machinery and trucks to dig up and haul the coal)!"
Great video.  Lost all credibility though.  Not one word on how Biden shut down energy independence thereby causing the highest inflation since Jimmy Carter was president
"Demand for oil and gas will never dissipate it is way too valuable as a feedstock for the plastic, chemical, and industrial enterprises that use it, we just need to stop burning it"
"The immense harm this ‚Äòrenewables‚Äô push will create upon the working class people, will be catastrophic. From fertilizer, to medicine, to life saving heat, to shipping goods, to development and growth. It will devestate all but the richest (the ones who are creating this mess).."
"@Aditya Chavarkar you need petrol to produce fertilizers on the industrial scale, which is needed for the industrial scale we have in agriculture.

The electricity you get is from 1 or several of these sources-> nuclear/ fossil fuels/ coal/ renewables-> depending upon where your local area gets the electricity to feed the electrical grid.

Yes, those are cheaper because of the additional taxes added by the states (which varies) & federal taxes per gallon of fossil fuels. Natural gas isn‚Äôt all that much more (those been noticing higher taxes rates being added recently-> which will effect charging an electric car since natural gas is the primary source for the electrical grid in my area, supplemented w/ nuclear).

Renewables aren‚Äôt all the clean. Wind turbines are mass scaring endangered birds and bats, which will greatly effect crops since many turbines are in agriculture areas, and birds/ bats helps reduce pests that destroy crops since it is a main food supply."
"Okay and??
Who is saying we need to stop using fertilizers??
And in many parts of the world renewable electricity is cheaper than....coal and gas fired plants"
"And as always, it is the average Joe that has to suffer and watch their life stagnate as the richest play around with ""green"" energy."
"‚ÄòRenewables‚Äô can NOT overtake the need for oil & natural gas, in actual life. Nor are most renewables environmentally friendly.

Solar, electric, wind are worthless in much of the populated world- cold temps, overcast, shortened sunlight winters.. It also doesn‚Äôt have any good infrastructure system to handle the inconsistency of generated energy.

Electric doesn‚Äôt have the torque needed for trucks..

However, policies being pushed and the insecurities of bldg a pipeline only to have some globalist Pres elected that halts use- robbing billions in investments.. well, it makes the risk far to high."

"Here in the United States we should persuade Oil Producers by limiting the land leases to a year and if Pumping haven't started with a minimum amount of a realistic limit then they lose the lease and down-payment on that land which opens it up to another Producer to bid on it and start Producing Oil from it. 
That gives the Oil Company incentive to Produce and not just hoard land. 
These Oil Companies Understand they make far more money when Gas Prices goes up while they continue to Produce the same amount of oil or in some cases less."
i see you have failed Emc 101
Good job Demorats. At least your feelings arent hurt by twitter. Oh wait...
america is just too dependent on oil lmao
"there was a lot of bad information in this video, from not knowing fracing has been a process in then oil industry since the 50s, frac rigs (lol, they are just called frac sites), to not even explaining why oil went negative. These kind of poorly created videos is what tricks the public into believing false info and strongly believing it is correct."
"The adoption of Electric Vehicles powered by Electricity generated from renewable sources (And stored for 24/7 use via ever improving battery technology), can't accelerate soon enough!"
"Most of us know it as Petrol or Refined Petroleum Distillate. Gasoline originates from a brand name for Petroleum Distillate in America, but it's grammatical short form: 'Gas'... no wonder Yankees get so confused about some things! But anyway, American terminology applied to global context aside, interesting video."
"Who cares? YouTube is, wait for it... AMERICAN!"
US prices are up because it's a product sold by its owners. The current administration publicly said them limit new oil leases and that they will phase out oil. If you're selling something obviously you want to continue profiting and by saying this to oil companies they will of course charge more as they are met with more restrictions. Doesn't require a twenty minute video. Bad policy and the rich wanting to get paid for their product.
"13:53 ""ignoring the countless 'externalities' "" = environmental damage. possibly permanent, the oil companies aren't being held accountable for."
"This video has it wrong. Environmentalists have been using donations to short oil stocks and have put political pressure on lenders who for the better part of 5 years became more hesitant to finance exploration, capex. Most of the onshore oil has been discovered and being pumped so exploration has been off shore for years. Offshore exploration can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, no one does that without financing after coming out of a period of low oil prices and therefore, low cash on hand. If you dont think oil is scarce, call OPEC up and ask why they don't increase production? Their last 400k /BD increase they could only handle meeting 15% of the number, as both Nigeria and Libya are a complete mess. The whispers are that Saudi and UAE dont want the world to know they only have capacity for a slight increase, but now it is showing through the cracks."
Biden is the reason
"Renewables are a scam.
Grownups are taking advice from unqualified Scandinavian children with self-admitted mental health issues."
"Here in austria, taxes are around 50% of the gas price, depending on the total price (since most of the taxes is a fixed price per litre)!"
"1) oil refining didn't just recently become an expensive and difficult process, so using that to justify current pricing isn't true.
2) importing oil is something based on politics and business interests and is why the price skyrocketed. Biden, in his short time in office, has actually aided in making domestic oil harder to get and more expensive by blocking the keystone oil pipeline. it costs more energy and produces more green house gasses to import oil than to produce it here ourselves as well. 
3) the second big spike in oil pricing was also because of our new found inability to import russian oil under the same circumstances as before. Again, oil importation. 
4) the lack of investment back into domestic oil is in no doubt aided by their uncertainty that we wont enter back in to another wave of lock downs and another stark drop in demand. This isn't an issue out politician's hands, lockdown measures are a consequence of politics, not a pandemic. lack of clarity, consistency, and order among the first wave in 2020 likely left a bad taste in many investors mouths and they're not going to be convinced to reinvest until their worries can be alleviated through clarity and reassurance by those in charge. 
5) It is politician's jobs, local and federal, to seek out solutions to problems like these and to seek guidance on how to move foreword. Lack of investment in oil futures doesn't mean ""oh well, i guess oil will never recover and the price is just going to be higher from now on"", it means you allocate more subsidies to support oil when turbulence comes along. If people are skeptical of oil's place in the future energy grid (of which i am of like mind), that means it needs to go under managed decline. What we're seeing isn't managed decline, its just decline."
@dknowles60 it's public info
@psilocybe wrong #2 is right
"Number 2 is incorrect, the Keystone pipeline was, and still is operational. There are 4 phases to it's development, 3 have already been completed long before even the last admin came into office.

 Last admin greenlit the final phase, which was *exporting* US oil into Canada and other regions. This would reduce domestic oil supply, that's what export means. This must be why the Exxon CEO was made Sec of State in the last admin.

This final phase wasn't even set be be completed until 2026, stopping a pipeline section for exporting domestic oil did not contribute to raising prices."
@Aditya Chavarkar  The Pandemic was a very wimpy one. it only had a 1.5% death rate. now we have many ways to treat it. hint my red state never lock down in 96% of the state   and there was never a mask mandate i mean face diapers  and have hillbilly health care and had a lower death rare per 100k then 80% of the Blue states

Why can't they take the money that was once used for oil rigs and reinvestment and do what Amazon does? Use the profits to break into other businesses. Use it to get into renewables.

Fuel tax taking up 11% of prices....*cries in british*
This video‚Äôs quality is unreal amazing!! Great job üëèüèª‚Ä¶. My takeaway is that we are screwed
The problem is that oil is a commodity. Commodity markets are glorified auctions. Auctions only benefit the buyer when demand for the item being sold is poor. Renewable energy may not solve all our problems but it will save our wallets from being raped by those selling fuel in a marketplace with little to no competition.
Let's not forget the hunter biden's laptop and all the fraudulent evidence between oil companies and the biden's
"It simpler then your 22 min. mini doc. the USA was self proficient in it's oil supply and demand, biden stopped it dead in it's tracks. You effectively gave away your own supply chain and went back onto the world market for your supply. You went from being self sufficient in your production and supply to importing oil from outside the USA. Just because you wanted to go green. That's the simple reality, biden was stupid enough to for broke on the green bs agenda. Duh, you went for a dumb plan and now you pay the price for it literally...Do you see any other country in the world being that stupid to believe in the green agenda so much they are willing to sacrifice their own economy and their people's wellbeing. fossil fuels even though bad for the environment, is the only reall way to fuel the world's economy. renewables are nowhere near replacing it anytime soon...

The USA was just stupid enough to listen to a bs agenda...Let's go Brandon..."
This story is complete b******* has nothing to do with today's high gas prices. Today's high gas prices has everything to do with Joe biden and Democrats policies. We were energy independent now we are forced to import oil because Democrats do not like Americans being self-sufficient
Love your God so that you may enter Paradise. Believe that Jesus is the Son of God. Ask Jesus to enter your life by praying for the salvation of the soul. Be baptized as a sign of your devotion to Christ. Say the prayer for the salvation of the soul when you are ready to dedicate your life to Christ. Repent of your sins and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Vow to follow Jesus for the rest of your life.

@dantes inferno purgatory you do realize Mobil one and a petroleum agency are going to use oil right? Do look beyond oil companies. Why would they promote something that could replace oil?
"@Gardian X Group III synthetic oil (the majority of synthetic oils sold in the U.S. Market) require a process of refining base crude oil called Hydrocracking - which removes impurities.  

API (American Petroleum Institute) defines group III as ""base stocks contain greater than or equal to 90 percent saturates and less than or equal to 0.03 percent sulfur and have a viscosity index greater than or equal to 120"".

Most oils that are not 0-weight (0w20, 0w30, 0w40) sold in the U.S. are Group III.   Oil as a whole will be around for quite some time (albeit in a lesser extent as a primary fuel source).   Might as well get used to that."
"@Ushio01 They don't burn oil productts on the road.  They burn it at the power plants.  At some point, there will be a crossover where power plant capacity won't be enough for the EVs on the road.  I don't think renewables will keep up either."
"90% of yearly oil extraction is for fuel whether for vehicles or burned for heating/electricity in industry.

The remaining 10% is for everything else.

OPEC and the current big oil companies if they don't diversify will become irrelevant sooner rather than later.

Look at vehicle sales globally 10% of new sales are already BEV's and it's rate of increase is accelerating."

Prices would go down if more drilling was encouraged and invested in by governments (in particualar USA). They are instead forcing renewables too quickly and it ends up hurting poor people the most.

"I don't know how the hell i'm meant to buy an ev when i can barely afford my normal car.

I think that government and leftest think that consumers like in video games have unlimited money. we don't, i can't just go out and buy a new car today because i still have 2 and half years of car payments to go till this car is payed off, then i need to make sure that i get my moneys worth out of my car rather then wasting it and going to electric, so after my 5 year plan on my car is up i'll more then likely go for another 5 years or so on this car. i bought it for 10,500$ or half a years pay for the car. i'm not just going to throw it away.

hybrids are a good start however they cost way to much for me to afford and i assume that tens of thousands of others are thinking the same way as me.
there's also the fact that were on a cliff's edge for a battery break thru. So i don't know if it's going to be better to wait for solid state tech to fully come out or if i should buy in while were still on the lithium.

theres also the 3rd fact that it will take over a decade just for me to break even in the gas savings, and on top of that i would need to keep the car for almost 20 years for it to be worth buying. I don't think that i'm gonna get 20 years out of a tesla considering i don't even get 5 out of most phones with the same battery tech.

We need to bring the cost of electric cars down to the cost of gas powered cars not bring the cost of gas to the cost of an electric car. that only makes it impossible for me to afford to go electric."

"Americans are lucky... in South Africa at least 40% of our fuel price is taxes/levies.

Its great for the 1st World to look at oil as an evil energy source, but for the developing world oil, coal and other fossil fuels represent a cheaper and more readily available energy source. The price of a Tesla Model 3 ($48,900) is far more than many people in South Africa will see in 5 years of working. But one can buy a cheap petrol burning car for $2000 and up. Now the person who is able to buy that $2000 car will be better off than a large portion of our population, but would be considered in dire poverty by anyone in the US. And its important to remember that the person buying that $2000 petrol car will likely not have running water at home, or even electricity. And our electrical supply is so bad that there is a chance that even if they do have electricity wired to their dwelling it could be off for a good chunk of the day.

So the West might be ready and eager to move to electric cars and renewable sources, but those of us living in the developing world know that we do not have the money to afford such luxuries, and frankly we need to grow our economies as quickly as possible for the betterment of our populations. The West grew its economy on the back of fossil fuels, its only fair that the 3rd world gets to do the same."
"I don't think anyone's saying the entire world has to transition at the same time; and if they are, they're being very unrealistic. This is how everything goes with technology, the most advanced economies adopt it first, and eventually it will spread to less developed places"

Data please"
"@dknowles60 
The data I've seen says we are in the end game. 
The discovery of oil peaked in 1964. It has declined ever since. Rystad Energy reported that only 4.7 billion barrels were discovered in 2021. Mankind consumes 36 billion barrels PA, so 4.7 is 31.3 billion short of what's needed. 
Mankind cannot pump undiscovered oil. 
So what data can you share please. Cheers Gray"
wrong. there is a lot more Affordable to be found
I get it now! It was all Biden's fault!
The only real crisis is that we are literally killing the planet at an ever accelerating rate.
Fracking was also made possible by the perfection of precise directional drilling techniques in the 1970s-1980s.

I'm sure you never let the facts get in the way of your sincerely held opinion. The guy who lost the election would be dealing the same problems.
The fact that this video needed to be made for people to understand the truth just pissed me off. Main stream news outlets are currently worse than than chinas ccp sponsored ones. And the fact that most of humans are stupid enough to not be able to see through the American lies. The fact that there are people still supporting Biden just proves how insanely moronic we as a species are.

Thanks Joe üí∞
19:53 Dude you gotta simplify your language
I blame the democrats and biden 100% for inflation and high gasoline
In lovelock nv is the same the price
Nationalize and use that French thingamajig they invented for the rich.
One of the best explainers I‚Äôve seen on the current oil markets! Keep up the great work!
"TLDR; It's Biden, because of his baseless canceling of the KXL Pipeline. Also hurting our own economy and national security.
THe environmentalists are making it worse because of their misunderstanding of the actual factors."
The Keystone pipeline probably was never going to be economic. This way the investors can sue the government and try to get their money back out of it that way.
Before I even watch the video I just have to comment. Of course it's not the war it was happening before the war. Every time I hear someone say it's because of the war the first thing that pops in my head is where have you been for the last decade.
It's called corporate greed ..
It still is. Why does it say ‚Äúwas‚Äù??
too long not gonna watchüñï
"I never understood the war explanation, so little oil comes from Russia."
We shouldnt have to depend on oil and gas. We shouldnt be building our cities requiring you to drive a car. I kinda want gasoline to be expensive so we can change our lifestyle
I'm glad to see this video. Lots of people around with their bumper stickers are convinced that Biden controls gas prices. They are convinced dollar-plus a gallon will return when Trumps gets back in office next term
Of course it's the war.
The oil cartel
BULLSHIT! KEEP GOING ON WITH YOUR WEF BS.
"This'll be an interesting ride. Because longer term higher fuel costs will push the electric (and hydrogen) vehicle fleet to become massive, demad for oil will drop steadily (or maybe quickly). I guess the producers will drop production in line with that, but perhaps a supply glut will happen as fewer cars need oil? And so the price might drop? It may end up that by 2035 the major user of oil is the airline industry. Even though I'm in Australia, where electric cars are almost a rude word, my next car is very likely electric."
"Biden and his policies better be mentioned. 

After watching I‚Äôm a little shocked at the stupidity of this video. Your reasoning is essentially that Oil execs aren‚Äôt interested in making money thru producing oil. And when you look at it without a liberally brainwashed mindset‚Ä¶ that statement makes no sense. Those 9k permits either aren‚Äôt in areas where oil is located or don‚Äôt extend to building rights which the oil execs need. This is a war on oil that Biden started the day he got in office. And saying anything else is the main cause of our high prices is ridiculous."
You can't be serious.
Could have honestly summarised this into a 5 min video really
"mmm, in europe we concluded in the 2010s that opec STRATEGICLY kept supply up to get to $40 dollar a barrel, since all opec member could still make a profit at that price, while fracking couldn't, trying to bleed the fracking supply to dead.. in witch it WAS in fact quite succesfull!
17min : graph clearly shows a shale production that halves between 2014 and 2016!"
This dude acts like the same companies that are downstream oil are running upstream e&p
Most of the major players are vertically integrated? They do exploration all the way to gas stations and everything in between. So why is this video wrong?
"the notion that oil will become untenable commercially is hard to believe.  Do people actually think renewables will be able to replace the power density of oil?  Do you know that a wind turbine will only have a service life of about 20 years before it needs to be replaced?  The blades are made of carbon fiber and cannot be recycled so they are buried.  Perhaps oil will become too expensive comparative to renewables but that is not on the horizon.  Geothermal is likely a good substitute for heating requirements but not propulsion energy.  EV work but the battery chemistry is currently lower performance and service life in cold climates.  Can you get enough electrical generation in northern climates from solar?  No.  How much mining of silver, nickle, copper and so on would be needed to build that many solar panels?  How will they be recycled? They're not.  Renewable unfornately are just a utopian dream that is why they weren't implemented on a grand scale since they were invented in the 1960s - 60 years ago!"
"""Do people actually think renewables will be able to replace the power density of oil?""

It's either that or nuclear. And both solutions come with their own particular problems.

But in either case, sooner or later such a replacement must be found. Once the last drop of oil has been sucked out of the ground, that's it."
BIDEN
It's called corporate greed ..
"It's not the lies the news media say it is because of Inflation. The real reason is because of Greed.

The show doesn't stop, until the last money drops."
"I hate what this video had to say, though I believe it, about our future gas prices.  Luckily, I drive far, far less than I used to."
"If u look at old pics, the coast was covered with oil wells. Add environmentalists killing off drilling as one of the reasons why cali imports oil."
"If even possible, I'd love to see something on the logistics of the Secret Service."
@Charles Blanton Oh brother... The crazies are here.
Yes! I have a friend in the Secret Service and he tells me (to an extent) about the logistics of their trips and stuff and it is very interesting. I could talk to him forever about that stuff

"FYI: the war doesn't affect prices because Russia is still producing and selling their oil.  Instead of selling to EU, they sell to China & India { literally half the worlds population}.  The Chinese and Indians buy less from everyone else, the EU buy from the non Russian suppliers.  Global prices thus don't increase deom the war.  Local prices in the EU increase dramatically because now they have to ship all their oil instead of pipelines."
Is this what the movie Syriana was about?
This video is nothing but a fake news from Russian endeavor for sympathy.
Lol
1994 try 1964 revisions history this a lie
"oil producers are starting to look at wind farms & solar.  Major oil companies are shifting into ""energy"" companies."
"This is very well done, but it doesn't mention how practically on Day 1 of Biden's presidency, he ended all of Trump's policies that allowed the US to be oil independent and did incredible damage to our economy in the process.  The damage is purely political in origin.  Who is Biden loyal to?  The American people or foreign factions?

ETA:  I don't buy this, sorry.  The last great oil rally, ""the end of oil"" and other statements make me think this is someone's agenda and not reality.  What are these amazing renewables the narrator speaks of?  It's never even explained.  

The price drop and subsequent negative price situation in 2020 had everything to do with POLITICS and the massive over-reaction to a virus in order to effect a political outcome.  The rampant speculation in futures markets caused that price situation, it was not ""real"" except in the sense that demand dropped through the floor due to an artificial shutdown of the world economy.  All of that, purely political in nature.  Is it any surprise that the people who lost in 2020 are now attempting to recover their profits?

Lastly, I recall high oil prices under the Obama Admin, and now we see the same from the illegally installed Biden regime.  That's the correlation--don't elect/install idiot Democrats."
Wrong. It was the presidents fault...
Did you watch the video
"This was a pretty good analysis and history of oil volatility, but I'd be cautious about the final conclusion and more than cautious about prediction drawn from that conclusion. Two factors not mentioned in this video or anywhere I've seen in the comment section are:

1. The oil industry, like everyone else, has been affected by general supply chain issues and inflation, which has driven up the price of tapping new wells. Effectively this makes supply expansion at the moment more costly than it otherwise would be.

2. Oil companies also took on a ton of debt in the last two years, so increasing profits to both pay that down and pay shareholders is a higher priority for them at the moment, rather than expansion.

Neither of those factors are small, and they both point to the current situation being a temporary recovery from the pandemic. I'm not saying this video is wrong and we will definitely go back to the old way, but trying to predict the future of the oil market is risky business. Nobody knows what's going to happen, and the incentives guiding today's market can change in unexpected ways tomorrow."
22 min video to say the gas companies are price gouging the US.
"we reached peak oil in like 2005 according to one geologist. regardless, Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) which is the key number which represents what is really important (energy) and not $, has been consistently going down from an insane 100:1 to now about 13:1, which is why hydrofracked shale oil suddenly became worth it. if we get down to below 7:1 on our primary energy source (totally possible by late 21s C) civilization basically ceases to function. On the other hand, we need to degrowth and decarbonize as fast as possible, so even the 13:1 oil must STAY IN THE GROUND."
@0NoFreeWill0 no your fed gov deot of energy says lots of oil to be found lots of oil in us in places that are off limits to oil companys. hint lots of coal in the Us . oil and nat gas can be made from coal
should we maybe shift away from a source of energy that not only generates huge health harms but is also on the decline and has a bleak future? or stick to our guns and play violin while we follow this titanic down
"@dknowles60 Here's it in plain speak:
""In conclusion, the EROI for the world's most important fuels, oil and gas, has declined over the past one to two decades for all nations examined. It remains possible that the relatively high EROI values for the natural gas extracted during, and often used for, the production of oil may mask a much steeper decline in the EROI of oil alone. Declining EROI is probably already having a large impact on the world economy (Murphy and Hall, 2010, Tverberg, 2012). As oil and gas provide roughly 60‚Äì65% of the world's energy, this will likely have enormous economic consequences for many national economies. """
this article has like 80 graphs and they're all from independently published papers by scientists all over the world lmfao
The sniffer...........durrr
"Btw, who got the crude oil when it was negative?"
"If gas prices stay so high for a long time more and more people will switch to electricity. Now it‚Äôs the short term and it‚Äôs working, but long term they will cause the market to shrink. they will make more per barrel but they will sell far less of them. It would come to a point where big oil will have great margins but their bottom line will be smaller. It‚Äôs a losing game they get themselves into"
BIDEN SINGLE HANDEDLY is why they stopped investing. He vowed to put them out of business so they stopped investing.
"I wonder about the France model now
our taxes on fuel are extremely high"
so basically corporations are really greedy.
"I really wish Americans would stop saying gas (gasoline), it‚Äôs so jarring."

"16:22 yup the ole sickness scare that changed the whole world,  money wise that is, the old bait and switch to put everyone in their place."
"As a trained geologist with more than 25 years in the oil, gas and chemicals industries, I find this report to be greatly generalized and totally lacking in understanding specifics.

It ignores the forcing of gas prices upward by the Biden Administration to achieve what they call a Green New Deal, which in reality is a very bad deal for everyone in the US.

It also ignores the fact that 90% of the materials we use daily are petrochemical based.

The only item that is clear in the report is that the Ukraine Was is not the total reason gas prices are up."
"The airlines are the real reason we have fuel, they use a dramatic amount as do ships."
Congrats on getting on trending!! Awesome video as always

"thank you for this video,

my only negative comment is your framing of the cost of the pipeline ($5.5 billion) from Azerbaijan to Turkey being ""stratospheric"" when oil companies like Exxon reported more than $6 billion in profit in just one year. It's less than helpful to convey this as an astronomical price when describing oil companies who make ""stratospheric"" profit"
"@no body 1) no, $5,000,000,000 is not larger than a hundred countries GDP. More like 30.

2) oil companies are seeing record profit to the tune of trillions"
"Considering the combined GDP of over a hundred countries is less than that pricetag, it's still ""stratospheric""."
Unfortunately the only we we will ever ween ourselves off our addiction to fossil fuels is for the price to go up
The price is linked to the spot market price of oil? So oil companies are going to charge more if they can.

"You can't blame them, if you're being told you're old world over and over again each year and you're bad for the world you'd probably say ""FINE, I am..now try moving onto this clean future right now then good luck!"" instead of just roll over and do what society wants you to do in the short term to ultimately replace you in the long term. That's like saying you're going to break up with your old significant other as soon as your hot new replacement is ready, oh but be there for me unconditionally, till then yes?
You do you always applies...boo."
"I‚Äôm gonna choose to blame them. They could change with the times and at least slowly change their industry focus. 

It sounds like moralizing and I get why it leaves a bad taste in peoples mouths but we‚Äôre talking about adapting industry to natural factors and perhaps control global warming and they‚Äôre basically throwing, an entire industry mind you, a hissy fit."
"Hopefully the prices go down, I work for a small construction company, and we're spending so much on diesel. Renewables are completely infeasible for our trucks for at least 20 years. Find a cheap F550 sized truck that doesn't run on diesel. Oh wait, you can't. Renewables are good, but many many years away for a lot of uses, especially for small businesses that can't afford brand new tech. Hopefully the prices will go down so we can start hauling stuff without so much pain in the wallet."
hydrogen has 3x the energy density of fuel. I'm sure they will figure out how to leverage that for heavy machinery.
"Except the only place the hard switch to renewables is really happening is Western countries, where people in the grip of religious hysteria who've been predicting an impending apocalypse in the next ten years for the past thirty years are prone you shortsighted, counter-productive decisions based on their doomsday prophesies. Meanwhile, ascendant powers such as China are only too happy to bang out hundreds of new coal power plants and ramp up gas vehicle production, as they race to gobble up manufacturing capacity (war-making capability) amidst the self-inflicted decline of Western economies."

"Re: California oil production
California has a fairly large supply of oil.  As late as the early 70s there were thousands of wells off of Huntington Beach. In Carbon Canyon there were thousands of wells.  We even had 2 pump jacks in our backyard. But by the mid 70s the land prices soared and became more valuable for housing.  Today, if you look closely, there are still wells hidden behind block walls throughout the housing tracts."

Not an excuse for spilling more though, of course!"
"@‚úø SoCal Gal ‚úø Santa Barbara has one of the highest rates of natural oil seepage in the world. So was it spilled oil, or was it natural? Without careful chemical and isotopic analysis, it can be hard to tell! There are entire communities of ‚Äúchemosynthetic‚Äù organisms that live off natural oil seeps.

"As someone who actually is pretty well versed in energy economics, I'm a little disappointed in the lack of touching on the war and the misleading title of the video.

In short: the war in Ukraine pumped up prices due to a Russia fueling a demand/supply mismatch in Europe. We (the US) are feeling the price hikes because we are export LNG over to Europe at high prices (compared to the US market). You would have to be very disconnected from the industry to believe the war DOESNT have anything to do with the high prices right now. However, this doesn't mean prices will plummet once the war ends either. Instability and supply shortages always push prices up.

The rest of video is spot on though I am just worried that people are going to get the wrong takeaway from this. It is just a bit silly to ignore one of the big reason why prices are so unstable right now."
Let's go Brandon
"Most of the price increases are due to speculation in the futures market due to the war.  Thus, you are correct. By proxy, the war in Ukraine caused the prices to increase, but the video also is correct that the war is not the proximate cause.  Confused?  The war caused people to speculate that supply in oil will be constrained and so the price was bid higher.  Both greedy speculators and industries that rely on oil bought future contracts to avoid paying higher prices down the road.  To avoid losing money, the oil producers cut production to maintain those high prices.

If I sell you 200 barrels at $50 or 100 barrels at $100 the money I make is the same. The cost savings in producing 50% less means I make more money by delivering less product.  More confusion?  Welcome to the financialized market of 2022. (Note: the math example is overly simplified to make a point and not an actual representation of real production numbers or prices.)"
"@simply Incorrigible While this is partially true in theory you are forgetting that:

A. Russia choked supplies to Europe already leading up to the war and in the war. This is why the US got involved so heavily.

B. Russian exports to China have been increasing quite a bit.

Gas is a finite resource choked by production and pipeline capacity. In addition, war by itself brings instability to the day to day and futures market. You can actually pull up a gas price chart and see how fast it spikes on days where Russia choked supply off (a literal supply/demand mismatch) and also ultimately invaded. Same exact reactions on the futures market which is also a huge clue.

I'm basically saying gas was destined to go up but these spikes from November 2021 onwards are absolutely related to the Russia/the war."
"The war doesn't affect prices unless Russia actually stopped production.  If they stop selling to the EU and sell to China instead, global supply largely remains the same."
Joe Biden happened.
Exactly
Great video

"In short, FJB."
"Biden initiated 3 executive orders for Climate Change in week one of his Presidency, all aimed at the Fossil Fuel industry. Gas prices reacted accordingly, to say Biden had no hand in gas prices going up is absolutely idiotic. According to the Department of Energy Oil Production is down 2 million barrels a day since Biden took office, spin the fairy tale somewhere else."
Where the hell was gas above 5$ in America? I swear the highest I saw was like mid to low 4s.
Probably most of cali

Prices are high for gas bcs of greed.

"While the video is mostly well presented, I disagree with the conclusion in the final minute. Big Oil not investing in tapping new wells does not mean that they believe oil to be on the way out. Aside from some contributing factors like logistical constraints and rampant inflation which increases the cost for tapping new wells there is one fundamental issue: Big companies lack faith in the economy. They have seen negative prices due to massive overproduction and dont want this to happen again. With the economy being as unstable as ever there is a very good chance we will have a crisis like 2008 all over again which includes decreased demand.
Why pay for a new well while still suffering from inflation now when there is a good chance the well will not make you money/cost you money in the next few years? Big Oil can just weather the storm ahead and increase production in the mid 2020s when the worldwide economy picks back up."

"Mr. W, I am great admirirer of your work for years since I discovered your channel in recommended, and I have to take my hat of for your extensive coverage of almost everything I would like to know more and more than often I agree with you.
However, this particular video looks and sounds like promotion video for oil companies in most.... IDK sympathetic kind of way (english is my second language).

(Note for readers: I'm not american, far from it, so you can take my opinion with a grain of some war and political instability)

For as long as I can remember (I'm 40yo) there was some sort of fuel crisis, man made (war) or ""man made"" (stock market) and prices never truly (inflation included) gone back even just for a cent.
Oil shortage is a thing that I read from 1970's  magazines (thats apart from Suez and Israeli-Egyptian war) but, as I said, in 40 years there was never shortage beside artificial shortage.

What I meant to say is: when will anyone describe OPEC or similar organizations as monopolites rather than (quite benign) ""cartel""."
"Get to the point, ffs"
High gas prices üò¢
"Haven't yet watched but if the conclusion is anything else than classical profit making with War as an excuse, it's horseshit. The oil industry announced record profits for last quarter after the price hikes. I wonder why."

"You touch on everything except the actual reason oil is expensive, and that is over-regulation by the left-wing politicians. You gloss over how the US held oil at $45 a barrel throughout the Trump admin, via correcting the absurd regulations imposed by Obama, even with Canadian oil being decimated by over-regulation by its ultra left-wing government. OPEC was on the ropes and lost a lot of power on the world stage as being the default swing-provider. Of course the politicians on the left and right are heavily invested in the 'alternatives' to oil and will make billions using regulation to force adoption of their investments, regardless of how counter-intuitive and damaging it is to everyone. Now that the left is back in charge, oil is still being produced, in far dirtier ways than domestically. OPEC and the middle east are rising out of the ashes and hold an absurd amount of power over the global energy economy again. Russia could afford to invade the Ukraine, all while being condemned by NATO but also being paid billions for energy by NATO. The power grid has been damaged by the forced implementation of 'green... yea right...' solutions from China to the point you cant even run AC in the summer. Child slaves in Africa are now mining rare earth minerals for China at maximum capacity to create lithium batteries for cars that cant even be charged when the electrical grid is down. Why? So some boomer politicians can see 'change' in their lifetimes?... lol no its so they can exploit their positions for as much money as possible via insider trading. PS: don't take me seriously, I already died from acid rain back in the 80's, and the ice-age in the 90's, and global warming and rising sea levels in 2010, i saw the total extension of polar bears, California is under water, the ice caps are gone, and all of it. I cant wait to see what i die from 10 years from now."
Am I the only one? This video was all over the place.

"As a young pilot training for a career in the airlines, I find this a bit scary. There are no good alternatives to kerosene for large aircraft. Hydrogen may become a possibility, but it‚Äôs at least 10 years out. Higher fuel prices probably means less demand for flights and fewer jobs for pilots. Not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, just potentially a bad thing for me."
Look into the impact of ESG funds on market conditions in various sectors. ESGs are at best a scam for fund managers to charge fees and at worst a backdoor way for political activists to manipulate the market without a public hearing.
"You've missed a few big things.  One is oil went negative because of covid lockdowns and the lack of use of fuels in planes and automobiles.  It went negative because they were out of places to put what they bought.  Refineries had to drop low rates they've never run before just to keep units running and not hurt them.  And change the makeup of what they were making to maximize for what was being used.  Afterwards they're ramping back up.  Plus, there are maint turnarounds required by federal law for inspections that still are shutting plants down now, 3 in Texas tripped offline in a power mishap and one of them was the largest in the U.S.  So, there are a lot more factors affecting what we're dealing with now.  The war is one, as a refusal to use Russian oil limits supply.  States that are implementing clean energy within 10 years at powerplants mean drilling a new well might not pay off.  Killing the permits for the pipeline means even if Canada and the Dakotas make huge oil production, they can't get it to the gulf to sell.  The 9000 permits for drilling are actually low.  Their used to be over 30,000 permits open to drill regularly."
Stupidity is the real pandemic.
greed.... there i saved you 22.23 minutes.
Some mf is getting billion at cost of poor people. In UK a 77 years old lady stays on the bus all day because gas and electricity are very expensive if she stays at home. This crisis is ridiculous prices are going up tremendous and minimal wages is a joke. UK is no longer the place to live like it was back in 90's
"There is no natural problem with oil supply anytime soon. We humans are doing all of this to ourselves. We could have cheap oil in the U.S. if we just changed the laws to give domestic oil production the priority in our society that is commensurate with its actual importance. The reason nobody wants to invest in oil or use all those bogus permits is because they saw what happened to the Keystone XL pipeline. Most of the money to build it was already spent and THEN our brilliant leaders stopped it because they are deeply stupid and want to kill themselves. This shows that investment in oil and gas will be actively, maliciously punished by the U.S. government and no one in their right mind is going to believe the U.S. government's promises to help domestic oil production grow without a complete regime change in Washington to clear out literally everyone who was even tangentially involved with cancelling the Keystone pipeline. If we had wall to wall solid pro-oil officials with irrevocable guarantees that this stupid self-destructive crap will never happen again, then we might see those permits starting to get used. Until them, short term profits are the only thing they can realistically do. That's what's going on with gas prices in the U.S. and the rest of this is just running propaganda for the Biden administration."
ditto that. you know most People on You Tube cant handle that turth

"Yeah it's not the war, it just happened out of blue to exactly coincide with it, sure dude. The price spikes that were with every war since 1950 was too not because of war, isn't it? Every time the price went down be it the 1970 crises or a few years ago when russia told the world that the barrel price will be over 200, then the arabas had enough and it went under 60. So yeah, you talked 22 minute like you really know something, it is for the views."

The existing  electric grid has not even been converted to renewables, yet that is  small portion of the overall energy pie.  And what about plastics and synthetic material?  That's right- fossil fuels baby!  I would recommend the work of geologist Art Berman to further evaluate the future of fossil fuels."
You should notice that the current government is forcing a lot more environmental requirements and planning before they will let you actually operate an oil well. In some cases they require the well operator to have a carbon capture plan for all the CO2 produced from the oil they would dig up. So they can‚Äôt take the leases. The government promised to stop new oil production and that is exactly what has happened. They just did it in a way that they can blame the oil companies for the consequences.
Time to nationalize oil.
"Just like sharing an apartment or phone plan with friends or family, they always f*** you. No different than this mess of oil cartels.

"You sayoil is dying.  I agree that there will be less use of oil/gas by vehicles.  However, what fuel is going to generate enough electricity to charge all of the electric vehicles.  Wind and a solar are many decades away from being able to replace traditional power plants.   Also, revenue at Exxon Mobil was up over $100 billion for year ended 12/31/21 vs 12/31/20.   There are roughly1.2 billion gasoline powered vehicles in the world currently and electric cars are still relatively expensive.  When do you think the majority of cars being replaced by electric vehicles will happen.    So, oil still has a daily long life ahead.   Now, they get to gouge us and cause inflation due to increased transportation costs.  So, a few companies benefit at the expense of tens of millions of people.  That is a monopoly and it should not b3 allowed.  The destruction of our anti trust laws started under Reagan and the teeth of those laws were extracted.  The end result is consumers suffering the effects of inflation."
"Real answer: the prices are artificial and THEY just want to stop transportation by lower classes won't be able to afford travel.

Among them the fact that refineries are costly to opperate energy wise, so if oyu can get cheaper energy in a nearby country you might come out ahead.
Similar for wokrer salaries, enviromental regulations, etc.

Anotehr thing to ntoe on oil importing/exporting, is that crude oil isn't all the same. For example the US is a fairly large crude importer, even though ti also exports a lot, because of the percentages of components i nthe crude that can be refined out. There is even mixing of crude oils goign on at various refineries in the us to make a more easily refinable blend, which might also explain Austrlias import/export ratios."
@Mister Gnat Why don't they build refineries?

This is what I've been trying to tell people. Then they say Biden did or or Trump did it. This is a very comprehensive video and I will be sharing it to people instead of putting up an argument
"Ehh but the sitting president of the US ,Whomever it is DOES affect the trading costs and other costs based on his climate change policies .Thats not even factoring in things like closing pipelines meaning a district will have to look elsewhere for product .So YES a sitting president CAN (and does) have an effect on price at the pump."
Can someone explain the same in 2-3 sentences please? I am too lazy to watch the video.
"@DerNutellaBoy ""Cartels""."
Cartels controlling the price.
"I think people are too worried about things that happened during the pandemic. The lowering of demand was because the government forced everyone to stay home, thus have no reason to buy gas for their cars."
"If Americans call petrol ""gas"" what do they call gas?"
"I'm not american but calling it gasoline, which is derived from a very old brand name, makes more sense than calling it petrol, since petroleum is a name for crude oil. The word gasoline was used in England before it was in America anyway."
"Gaseous LOL

"Meh, it was geosteerable combined with two technologies now 75 years old, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.  The geosteerable drilling developed offshore Louisiana provided accuracy needed.
FTR, shale is the source rock for all previous production.  It had seeped upwards via fractures to collect in pockets which were then tapped."
"Oh they have the leases but not ALL of the permits required to drill.

Additionally, not all oil is the same with the same ease or difficulty in refining.  Much of the tight shale crude is sold far below WTI price index (it doesn't occur in nature) and is too light for most refineries unless first blended with heavy crude."
"So, greed?"
"500$ a barrel solves a lot of problems. Causes inflation but we got that already. The only way to make a better world is going to be to make that better world a profitable proposition. Profit drove us into this mess and only profit can undo it.

"Don't forget the COVID restrictions. Printing trillions of dollars drives up inflation, along with the supply chain issues."
"This was interesting until about 19:00.  At this point it verged into speculation that was some combination of willing ignorance of economic history and ""our glorious green future"" wishcasting.   Absent effective governmental intervention, increased demand and prices eventually lead to increased supply particularly where the barriers to entry are relatively low (also there is demand destruction).   The video itself indicates that fracking is a relatively inexpensive form of exploration and development so I wouldn't hold my breath on the concept of a ""permanently high plateau"" of oil and refined product prices.  BTW, the quoted language is from this quote ‚ÄúStock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau,‚Äù said Ph.D. economist, Irving Fisher, on October 17, 1929.  Good call Irv...."
"Agreed, the rest of the video is informative and well-sourced, but the last couple of minutes goes a bit off the rails with nothing to back it up. I would have appreciated seeing some concrete data on how renewables are overtaking oil and driving down investment in that industry, but for lack of time or whatever else it wasn't there. And as someone else said, the lack of supply expansion and investment could easily be due to oil companies dealing with supply chain constraints and having to pay back debt incurred during the worst of the pandemic."
You are definitely correct. Can you make the same video about Coal?

Best informative video you've put out so far. Its concise and it has amazing graphical explanations as well.

Can't afford 2+ dollars a liter for fuel? but a 40 to 80 thousand dollars vehicle peasent is all im hearing."

"Unfortunately, I doubt renewables will drive prices down because all they have to do is limit the supply of that to keep profit margins and therefore returns on investments high."
@Ser Garlan Tyrell to be fair its  more like when instead of if because there's been a constant shift to solar and wind efficiency
You're right. Oil scarcity will only drive the prices higher.
@lfrankow thats a lot of 'if's
"If solar and wind becomes more efficient, and battery tech reaches the point where it can store vast amounts in small spaces, oil will no longer be needed for home or vehicle use.  You will be able to charge your car from your home storage unit, and your home will no longer be dependent on the grid."
It's because of Joe Biden's policies and all of the idiotic decisions he's made. Also partly due to the inflation that started under Trump and has accelerated under Biden. Do what ever mental gymnastics you want to think you are smarter than you are. This is the actual reason.

"I need about another 30 years of oil industry work before I can retire, keep on drilling"
No mention of insane ESG regulations that make oil and gas investment artificially prohibitive?
This affects the third world countries a lot

"this is probably the most revelatory video I ever saw on here, I've to admit. I didn't figure all the connections myself even though I typically have a good sense for the markets. everything said in here makes total sense. and yes, one needs to account for everything to paint this whole picture. there's one uncertainty, though .. fracking isn't even allowed in many places (like Europe, for instance). will be interesting to see if this limitations will be lifted once prices hit too high a high (sounds like the stoner's conundrum, lol)."
"I love that you always give your videos a proper ending conclusion, rather than trying to transision seamlessly into the sponsorship message. Thanks for another good video!"
You forgot one thing. The US Justice Department sued and won against each of the companies for doing exactly what you just said they are trying to do. It was the way they posted record profits that got them in trouble. Now they only lost like $75million between them. But still it was the way they jacked the prices that got them in trouble. And they are currently being sued for the same thing by many US States.
why not sue them/fine them for the profit disparity and kicking the ecnomoy well its down and sending that money straight back into americans pockets.
Neat
Oil companies still making record profits.
Oil prices went negative because of strange quirks in the oil market that were exacerbated by the illegal activity of Vega Group on TAS contracts. WTI on CME is a physical delivery contract and very few players are capable of taking delivery at Cushing.

"Until power production or storage can catch up EV's are not the answer ether. Just the lithium battery alone creates huge amounts of emissions and wrecks havoc to both mining and processing areas. Utility life of EV's is less than modern car and far less to old junker that just keeps on chucking 4 decades, while new car can barely do 10 years. EV's batteries have 8 year warranty or around 160t km's meaning by warranty ends ICE car would be just ""driven in"". Further more if battery management computer goes to tilt, thats it. It might as well give message ""fuck you"" while at it since say on Telsa that is whole module even if one fitting breaks 20k‚Ç¨ thank you for new battery, then install and you cant even have the old battery to sell modules for those that tinker with them. Tinker with the battery pack your self and you can say goodbye to fast charging.
Unless passive radiation nuclear reactors are further miniaturized and optimized or some ten times better battery tech comes along EV is just a scam."

"In the Netherlands we have about 46% excise duty on Fuel above than when you pay at the fuelstation you pay an additional 21% BTW (Tax) over the intire price meaning that Our fuel is about more than 55% tax, wich means a liter of fuel cotst ‚Ç¨2,05 (But ‚Ç¨1,-  of that price is just tax). Are price is rising also due to the fact that our goverment pretty much never lowers excise duty or taxes on fuel meaning when fuel gets cheaper they increase the tax, but when it gets cheaper they don't lower it. Meaning when another price jump comes the price rices even more. Over and over again... Pretty shitty situation since mose fuel used if to go to work, or transport goods. It costs the end user so much more. But we do have the best road network in the wordt so maybe it pays for that."

From an environmental perspective this video is quite optimistic for once.
I don't think that the vid covered the political issues with this.  a lot of companies are not getting the proper permits via new rules in the current admin in the U.S.  also these prices are not sustainable in the long run without larger amounts of pay to workers to pay for the products.  also along with this ev vehicles are really higher priced than a standard gas vehicle.  all this points to a mess in the short term and this may go longer but if it does then political change will have to be the answer.  many are all for a cleaner world but a really good plan to get there would help.
This is liberal propaganda. Gas is expensive cause of Biden wont turn the gas price lever down.
"Your logic is flawed. Back in the last quarter of 2001 the price of a gallon of regular gas in LA went UNDER A BUCK - the ""excuse"" back then was the war in Iraq. Funny how when the US makes a case to go to war the price hits rock bottom. Convince me that's not manipulation when those who cannot get their way end up making the consumer pay.

And no, renewables won't be making any kind of dent because the battery technology just isn't there yet, and neither is the charging infrastructure. 9/10 independent mechanics won't even touch an EV. And on the used car market that $1000 10+ year old gas car will still find buyers versus the 5-6 year old EV that cannot even sell for $10K because it's pack won't hold a charge and costs more to replace than what the car is worth. Heavy equipment/industry will also continue to run on gas. Keep drinking your blue and white kool aid ‚ú°‚ú°‚ú°"
"That might be the case in US, but this doesn't apply for Europe, just as you mentioned in your video, there is a big difference in delivering oil by trains/ships than by delivering it directly via a pipe line, so cutting off Russia just so US can stick it's ding dong in the European market, that is what is causing the prices to rise up, even more, canceling nordstream 2 was another factor that aid the high rise of the oil."
ah ha!!
"Sometimes, your channel feel like a news‚Ä¶"
"I call bullshit on location of refineries & gasoline prices. I was in Montana. Billings, Montana is the home of the largest refineries in the USA and gasoline was less than 40 cents a gallon in 2020 & 2021. They also missed some other very large shale & oil sands oil fields. I do NOT think the makers of this video understand a great many things like the petroleum industry as a whole or how the futures markets work."
t5his is bull shit there are at least 30 Refineries in Tx and La that are way biger then the one in Billings Montana this is super bull shit. i have not seen gas in the us at 40 cents per gal since 1976
"If someone think that changing ICU car to ev will crash OPEC or humans won't need oil anymore are out of the mind.

"he forgets to mention Biden completely shutting down the US fuel industry in his second day in office via executive order ending all us oil land leases on federal lands(look it up) and then shutting down the XL pipeline to boot (also publicly known fact). of which cost the US 180k jobs. oh and that dip to -$35 refilled our strategic oil reserves and got America paid to take the oil guess who came up with that the orange man bad(good business gets the US paid). of which Biden is draining to keep fuel prices down and buffet fuel price explosion before mid terms(cause if it reaches $7-8 a gallon you know they're not getting elected), as he also just gives it away to our ""allies"" that singed up for Russian oil pipeline since we are not producing they had to get fuel somewhere else of which the Russians just shut off so they're now dependent on us again. so back to the 180k jobs, Biden re issues fuel leases but because of what he did 2nd day in office oil companies seeing that they had massive losses when leases where yanked out from under them are being immensely hesitant to drill on any federal land lease cause what stops him from doing it again?  they're just having to take there time out of fear of loosing massive amount of money. if you don't believe me look into what the oil companies have to do when a lease is closed on federal land to a well site and how much that costs. video brought to you by Ministry of Truth(disinformation)."

Persuasive essay has another name
Fresh reminder that the USA is the largest producer of oil on Earth
"Definetly not a sneaky way to force people to expensive electric cars or to force them to not drive at all. Climate change is being used to force people to buy cars that have less range, all look the same, take 40 minutes to charge, little to no chargers anywhere but a few areas in cities, and will last only for 10 to 20 years before needing a new battery that will cost almost as much as the car and considering the US is trying to mandate killswitches be installed in new cars by 2026 (if it can be fesably done), the future isnt looking too bright for cars.

Under the apple style selling of these cars (where its sometimes tied to a subscription) you can expect a car that is worse for people to actually own and repair. It will kill 3rd party repair and 3rd party car selling. Id love to wonder what the EV market would be if it wasnt held up by subsities, tax benefits, tax penalties and carbon taxes on ICE cars, straight up punitive regulation (sometimes saying a full ban of ICE cars by X date) of gas companies and car manufacturers, and straight up regulatory favor of EV's."

"Peak Oil has been predicted for a century, and the renewables have always been the energy of the future. Plus ca change. 

The current renewable energy boom and carbon based energy 'bust' is based on wishful thinking by investors inspired by a fad called ESG. 

It will collapse because renewables can't keep up with the growing demand of energy (China, internet of all things, electric cars/bikes, AI, you name it). Also the public will be more and more outraged of higher prices, and politicians can't afford this. Not to mention that all renewables are dependent on rare materials, oh and oil (polyester is made from it)

Don't kill oil off too quick. Green energy has yet to prove itself, and it's doubtful it ever will."
"@Jesse Williams yes, but here's the thing: they keep finding new oil fields or finding new ways to get the stuff out of difficult to extract fields (think fracking and the sandpit oilfields in Canada). 

Also, we're pushing too quickly for an energy source that isn't ready to replace an entire infrastructure that has taken a century to perfect. They want renewables to be the prime energy source in 10-20 years. That's far too optimistic."
"Oil will run out though. It is a finite resource. Even before it runs out, prices will continually rise. So why do we want to continue basing our economies around oil? I agree renewables are not the solution, in many cases oil is the economical choice, but burning through our limited supply seems like an unwise choice."

And for pulling Humanity from horses to spacecraft, the Industry and Investors have been lambasted with endless lawsuits from Law Offices claiming to be ""Environmentalist Groups.""
In reality, those ""Environmentalists"" do NOTHING to help the environment. Instead they are some of the WORST polluters of the Earth.

"I'm an environmentalist where is my private jet snd vacation home?

They get so much shit because they lobbied heavily to keep American cities carcentric and because of it, less livable and practical. They get so much shit because they employ shady business practices. 

During the Oil crisis in the late 70's it was really clear how vulnerable the West reliance was to the politicis of oil, it was already becoming clear that oil needed to be phased out wherever it could be. So the oil companies doubled down on those obvious conclusions because it hurt their profits.

Large vehicles like for long-haul trucking are unlikely to ditch diesel any time soon which sucks because their fuel costs are built into the prices of all physical goods
"‚Äã@_ Asphobelle Trains can help but it's not gonna be a silver bullet. Trains still use diesel. Converting to electric would be expensive (not ""easy"") and likely wouldn't happen without government prodding and funding, taking ages to happen, if ever."
"@TheTayz Yes, of course, but using trucks only for ""the last mile"" or for the few things that can't go on trains would lower the need of diesel and thus, the cost. Not to mention, better for the environment, less wear and tear on the roads, less traffic, and maybe less sh*tty work conditions for the remaining truck drivers that could be at home each night."
@_ Asphobelle Many things would still need trucks and trucks would always get it to and from the trainyard
"But trains can be electrified easily, so if/when diesel prices go too high long-haul freight could go back on rails..."

"A few notes:

1. Land owner does not equal mineral right holder. Many thousands of acres of mineral rights were sold, or kept when the land was sold, before 2010, back when wildcatting and vertical wells were the norm, in other words: you had to be very lucky to get a well back them, even luckier to get a well that hit oil. So for many, it made sense to sell the probably worthless rights for a quick buck.

2. There is no such thing as a ""Fracking rig"". Fracking operation yes, but there isn't anything that makes the land based drilling rig a ""fracking rig"" as the rig is long gone by the time the well is to be fracked.

3. I wouldn't really call the ""small independent American oil companies"" small, when most aren't. Chevron, Exxon-Mobile, Amerada-Hess, Shell, to name a few. Independent contactors to make the wells, yes, but the companies that own the wells, no.

4. Federal lands. Ok they have a permit to drill. Do they have a permit to build a road? Power lines to the proposed well? Pipelines? All has to have an environmental impact study done, and as the Dakota Access Pipeline goes under its 4th review(for whatever stupid reason, oh yeah administration change), no one really wants to deal with that with the current administration, as the answer is obvious(NO).  

4A. All private lands were held under some type of lease for drilling before the Bakken boom. Does that mean a well? No. It means your competitor can't have it though.

5. Technology is pushing for the 'Three Forks"" layer, but its not there, just like horizontal drilling for the Bakken wasn't.

6. The driving force behind the switch to so called ""renewable"": the Government. Carbonless will never happen. Oil will never completely go away.

7. The 1970s wants their fear mongering back. Push prices high enough, see number 5.

8. ""Oil companies have ceded and are ushering in renewables"" lol.

What you can expect in the future:

Coal comes back.

Oil comes back.

Electricity price soars.

Administrations change,

People go along with the false ""ethanol is stealing our food"" narrative.

The government keeps pushing something that the technology is not there for."
Pure hogwash. You really think OPEC & independent shale producers slowed the release of barrels because they have little faith in oils future? Are you sure it‚Äôs not a strategic move for max profit?
I feel like people forgot that gasoline is not a renewable resource. We are going to run out. Soon.
I wonder if when renewables become a substitute they will lessen the demand inelasticity of gasoline and drive prices down again.
"Interesting point, the oil companies need to invest in green to survive best financially. Government should appease them by researching green synthetic oils that will use their distribution network, perhaps more viable than electric cars outside of CA and Hawaii because of high gas prices."

I think there may be a misrepresentation of the wells with fracking. The companies may have permits for the wells but with the advances in fracking technology you can use one wellhead and bore out in multiple directions both horizontally and vertically making multiple wellheads redundant.

Also EV and Solar stuff isn't convincing enough yet as the more I research the more I realize EV is another way companies will swiftly make ""ownership"" of a product like a phone, laptop, or car become more of a lease. Meaning companies will take away our right to repairability and could limit what we could do on our product or vehicle. A great example would be the Mercedes EQS hood lock, Apple not allowing certain self repairs. Just my 2 cents, please don't be mad, its just my opinion and I respect yours! :)"
Well there's alot for me to say here I love cars so I to hope classic cars can stay around but we can run those of e petrol for the vast majority of people electric cars will be great and with solid state batteries now in market I'm expecting range to double when it comes to solar and other renewables there prices under cut nonrenewables in most markets and are continuing to go down in price oil companies lobbying in the us garentise low prices but in texas despite there massive oil reserves ever since they deregulated there energy sector wind has been growing rapidly as for your point about leasing I to am very concerned but the best way around that problem is a ban on ev's but regulation banning the practice I would say the same ting about right to repair

"One thing to note: there's always been ""fracking"" (short for ""fracturing"") in the oil industry, long before shale oil was possible. It's just back then they used explosives (often nitroglycerin) instead of water. It would be more correct to use ""hydrofracking"" when talking about shale oil.

I know it's a minor point, but saying that fracking was what made shale oil extraction possible is a bit misleading. Fracking makes all oil extraction possible, it's just hydrofracking that works on shale."

I ran the numbers on my 55mpg Ford Galaxy, where we do two tanks a month V's the cost of running an electric vehicle (even at the new high KWH) and its nearly 1/4 the cost per month. Basically, the saving would pay the majority on monthly lease on a brand new EV (lower band). So yeh, they have just accelerated their own demise but have done it on their own terms for maximum short-medium term profit."
"5.5 billion is not exactly ""stratospheric"" for a project of that magnitude.  The Alaska Oil Pipeline System cost over 8 billion to build.  And requires constant monitoring and maintenance."
Take Trudeau Trans Mountain pipeline. The costs ballooned 70% from $7B to $22B and still hasn't been built.

1. I don't see how the size of the country makes any difference. Also Texas is only 20% bigger than France.
2. Nuclear waste is mostly a made up problem. There are many ways to handle it safely, plus there's like a million times less of it than fossil fuel waste.
3. It's not enough to build a gas station, it also need a lot of maintenance, it has a staff, and it needs frequent resupplies. EV chargers only need maintenance, and way much less of it. This means long term it's cheaper to replace gas stations with EV chargers. EV chargers are also a lot cheaper to build, so they pay for themselves pretty fast. Tesla is building it's own global charger network, and it barely makes a dent in their profit.
4. The grid also needs a lot of maintenance and upgrades anyway. This is not the first time that electricity consumption increased significantly. Fridges and air conditioning are big power hogs, and they weren't around when the grid was built. Originally electricity was used for lighting only. Early electric appliances had to be screwed into a light socket, because there were no wall connectors.
5. The oil industry is also extremely expensive, scrapping that will save far more money than what expanding the grid will cost.
6. Also home solar and batteries will take off a lot of load from the grid, so it will likely actually shrink in the future.
7. Already replacing gas peaker plants with battery farms is saving us huge amount of money. Renewables are also much cheaper than fossil fuel plants. That's why the majority of new energy projects are already renewable.
8. Electric cars are obviously green, especially when charged with clean energy. And getting cleaner all the time, as their efficiency increases, their manufacturing gets cleaner, and the grid gets cleaner. YouTube doesn't allow links, but you can look for studies easily. Try to look for the newest ones, because the underlying data changes fast.
9. Solar is absolutely economical, in most of the world. Even with battery it still often cheaper then the grid, but you don't need a battery most of the time, as most grids use net metering, which means you can use the grid as your battery. But having a battery has the added benefit of protecting you from blackouts. Given recent events in California and Texas, that's a big plus in the US. Europe doesn't have that problem. Keep in mind that the cost of solar is dropping fast, so prices from years ago are irrelevant.
10. Solar panels and batteries have 30+ year lifetimes, and can be recycled. Wind turbines don't last that long, but can be recycled too.
11. It's called renewable energy because you don't have to mine and burn stuff to make it work. A single gas car over it's lifetime can burn like 20 tons of oil. Compare that to a 0.5 ton battery and a few solar panels. Not to mention both are recyclable. Batteries are almost all metal, very easy to recycle.
12. Plus an EV lasts much longer. A typical gas car lasts 200k miles, a new Tesla should last a million miles or more. On the same battery. The Standard Range with the LFP chemistry last even longer. This means not just that they save several times more oil, but also you only have to manufacture and recycle one Tesla for every 5 gas car.
13. Soon keeping your gas car will be more expensive than buying a new EV. Fuel and maintenance are very expensive, and just getting more expensive over time. Actually, if you include resale price, you might already save money by replacing your ICE car with an EV. If you drive an expensive car, it's definitely the case already.
14. Lithium is abundant, we have far more than necessary, the only issue right now is demand grew much faster than supply could. It takes years to open a new mine, and the industry didn't foresee the EV revolution. Also lithium is fully recyclable, unlike oil. We can keep making batteries indefinitely.
15. Fossil fuels are very simple molecules, it's trivial to synthesize them, or anything we make from them. They are just convenient sources. Once we'll have abundant and cheap renewable energy, we can easily use the practically free excess power from sunny days to make plastics, fertilizers and all other petrochemical products. Watch Tony Seeba's YouTube channel to learn how much and how cheap energy it's going to be."

I figured it wasn't a result of the war because I had read that oil companies' profits are higher this year than they've been for the past decade. But this video gives some meaningful context to that data point!
"19:00 you summarise the situation perfectly. Turning profits now via scarcity and encouraging the switching to cheap (by comparison) renewables is the strategy. The funny part is, many of the Oil & Gas companies are now investigating in renewables as well. They are playing both sides."
I wonder if when renewables become a substitute they will lessen the demand inelasticity of gasoline and drive prices down again.
"This video has reinforced my hatred for the Americanism of calling petrol, gas"
"This is wrong. There is a DIRECT correlation between when Biden shut down that pipeline Trump got going to when the prices of gas started going up. This is BIDENS fault and has nothing to do with a very short and practically nonexistent stock drop and correction. You actually prove this in your video @16:17 except you say they ""cut back"" but in reality they were forced to stop by Biden's executive order. Same reason they haven't touched all these ""permits"" you and the left keep trying to bring up. The reason there is no ""appetite"" is because they would not make any money because of all the red tape involved. Wendover seems like a leftwing propaganda tool. This isn't the first video they've done trying to spread misinformation on things the left is fucking up. Trying to say it's ""something else"". The end of oil is FAR from ""near"". Until there is a better technology that is affordable then oil will remain. The planet isn't going anywhere anytime soon either unless an asteroid takes us out. Quit trying to scare people this this bogus climate change nonsense. YES the climate is changing. NO it's not going to end the world in ten years. If anyone remembers 4th grade science you would know that deserts used to be rain forest. Why you ask? Because the climate ALWAYS CHANGES. Wendover is FAKE NEWS! He don't argue well and he's only able to persuade people into things. WHICH DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE TRUE. It means the people he persuades are just stupid. They fall for it. Same trick the left has been using to brainwash all these ""woke"" people into looking like the fools they are."
"people blame biden for the gas price even trump, but it was trump that cut supply by a huge amount which later affected prices when everyone went back out."
@dknowles60 if thats the case than neither trump nor biden can be blamed for prices. People keep blaming biden all over the net without any reason.

"Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money. When it comes to the world of investing,most people don't know where to start.fortunately,great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance"
"So we're going to sunlight and wind to produce asphalt, plastics and synthetic rubber then? Even if we remove fossil fuels from the entire transport sector, that's only about 70% of fossil fuel usage. These oil companies will still be around pumping oil long after we figure out how made battery powered jumbo jets precisely  because of the chart on 9:16, we use crude oil to make a lot of other materials. Great video nonetheless."
"@Brandon m A fitting analogy, because it would take over a century and dozens of revolutionary discoveries in material science, chemical engineering, thermodynamics, and industrial manufacturing before internal combustion engines were small enough, light enough, and powerful enough to make an automobile a practical alternative to horse-drawn carts.

You're seriously underestimating the disparity when it comes to energy densities, and it gets geometrically worse as you go larger, and longer distances. It's only been in the last few decades that we made kerosene jet engines reliable enough for 2-engine aircraft to safely carry passengers on transoceanic flights. It's going to take a long time, and several hypothetical discoveries we have no way of knowing will even happen, before we have battery powered jets."
"@Watch maker like I said in my previous comment, battery advancements are inevitable and it's like going back in time and telling 1800s westerners your all going be driving cars but they say nothing can replace are horses."
"@Brandon m It's not. Battery technology is bumping against some pretty hard limits when it comes to energy density, particularly where safety and stability is concerned. There isn't really a way to make a reversible electrochemical reaction that has the same energy density as kerosene.

Fuel cells, or just a hydrogen-burning jet, would be a far better alternative, but we need a better way of storing large amounts of hydrogen than as either a low density gas, or an unreasonably cold liquid."
"We just aren‚Äôt ready to make the transition to solar and wind, no matter how hard they want to push it."
@Watch maker batteries will eventually reach a point were they can power large aircraft and this is inevitable as battery technology gets better every year and new more energy dense lithium cells are created and it could be 20 to 30 years away before this is possible.

Consistently great argument/explanation about an important aspect of life. Thanks.
"17:16 I would argue that one legitimate reason that industrial investment is so low, is that ""regulatory headwinds"" in most developed nations lead financial minds to believe severe restriction of the market, if not an outright ban, is likely in the medium term. After all, if you were a bar owner who had reason to believe Prohibition was 5 years out...would you renovate the place; put in a second bar upstairs, and buy the bar down the street? Probably not!

So, the argument that ""global warming hawks"" are behind the increase in prices is not (entirely) without merit."
So bye bye all those gas guzzling suv era of 2010s. All those big suvs used car market will crash if this is what is intension of oil companies.
"I just don't buy the ""renewable"" transition propaganda. If you look at the numbers, nothing adds up. And not mentioning inflation and taxation as a huge increaser of gas prices seems highly suspect."
"Last I checked, gas prices are still 15% cheaper than they were in 2008 (inflation adjusted).  Whining about gas prices is so typical of the sociopath Baby Boomer own-my-home-outright culture that dominates the media and political establishment."

"Lots of information but I may not be convinced by the conclusion.

@bobbybrown Are you german?
"Apparently you haven't bothered to read the news over the last year. EVs and plugin hybrids are now 20% of new European and Chinese auto sales. Battery production for electrified vehicles (EVs, plugin hybrids and hybrids) grew 102.3% in 2021 to 296.8 GWh, according to SNE Research. Tesla plans to build 20 million EVs and 1.5 GWh of battery storage per year by 2030. Renewable energy accounted for 90% of new electricity generating capacity added globally in 2020, according to the IEA. We are seeing the accelerating S-curve of new tech adoption in EVs, wind, solar and battery storage."
@tomfrost02 I'm sure that's news to Germans. You are just proving the guys point. Americans have been told things about Europe and green energy that just isn't true
"@ricky sanchez It was a role within petroleum engineering, not a career but a posting that the company i was working in (an early adopter) was looking to progress technology into actual use from test wells. The job was petroleum engineering. I would HIGHLY recommend NOT studying Petroleum engineering as a Single Discipline - Petro Eng is HIGHLY cyclical e.g. I spent 3 yrs out of work at one point (went into being a pro photographer instead when there was no work - pay very low there) BUT I'd recommend doing an Engineering Degree in Mechanical (i.e. mechanics not nuts and bolts i.e. applied physics) or Chemical Engineering THEN do ""With"" Petro Eng modules if you want to get into oilfield. While cyclical if you can get into the right cycle there is a shortage of new guys coming in now but a glut ahead of you, but by the time you would be done there'd be a gap. But ALWAYS like acting ensure you have other gigs you can do / develop other experience e.g. in engineering or even waiting tables to do between work. Best of luck. Engineering has been and is an interesting 25 yrs, although I've moved more into regulatory / HSE (OSH) type work now."
"As a young pilot training for a career in the airlines, I find this a bit scary. There are no good alternatives to kerosene for large aircraft.

Not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, just potentially a bad thing for me."
So‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre fucked‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre telling me?
"One interesting  thing i have head is that some of the big oil companies in Houston have been buying up leases and old depleted wells off the Houston coast, like 20-30 miles offshore.  Most likely not to drill again, but to use the already in place pipelines and pump CO2 back in to the ground from the refiners and power plants in that area, Im sure in the coming years there will be a higher CO2 tax that will be in place and incentives companies to do this."
Just because there's 9000 permits being unused doesn't mean the land they are for has profitable amounts of oil
"TL;DW: Gas prices are high because oil producers won't make as much money to produce more now, because of renewables. AKA: They're milking us for all they can on their way out."

"""ignoring the countless externalities"" seems like a good summary of most of this"
"Why gas prices are so high? Biden stole the presidency and immediately shut down the keystone pipeline that pumped crude oil from Alaska to Texas to be processed into gas, which ensured the US had the lowest gas prices since the early 90s, made the price of gas to sky rocket."
Do people in the States realise how cheap their fuel is? In the UK fuel costs the equivalent of $11 per gallon.
Doesnt help either when someone blocks those contracts from being taken through a specific order by a specific old man.
I didn't hear in the persuasive essay about the oil producers cutting supply during covid and not being able to ramp up fast enough ...then the war.   Is that all big oil hogwash?
"Sad Story.  I hear when the price of oil went negative, Chevron had to lay off a couple of their congressmen"
politics is a dirty word
"Well...as I was saying to a few people. Why would oil companies want low oil prices. They want to make money ... They don't make money if oil prices are low. They don't care that you drive to work and you need your car. They are hoping you need your car so you are forced to pay the higher price for gas. 
It's Time to start investing in new forms of transportation as it's only going to get worst. Or reinvesting in public transportation. Especially in the US and it's car centric living. Build more walkable communities r/fuckcars."
just so you know the Process for making and sustaining hydro wind and solar requires large amounts of petrochemicals we could solve alot of the polution issues by pushing for Nuclear power than solar wind or Hydro as a nuclear plant over the course of its lifetime will output 100x less than a single Gas powerplant in a day and gasoline puts out the least Co2 of the fossil fuels

Surprise surprise the Americans stopped two possible pipelines because of political reasons instead making them make a more expensive pipeline for their own interacts
GOVT policy is the PROBLEM
"One thing to note: there's always been ""fracking"" (short for ""fracturing"") in the oil industry, long before shale oil was possible. It's just back then they used explosives (often nitroglycerin) instead of water. It would be more correct to use ""hydrofracking"" when talking about shale oil.

I know it's a minor point, but saying that fracking was what made shale oil extraction possible is a bit misleading. Fracking makes all oil extraction possible, it's just hydrofracking that works on shale."
"Correction: oil is ceding the market to electrification, not to renewables. 

The grid is in disarray around the developed world and we need to sort it out or else we will just be driving electric cars powered by dirty electricity."
"@twistershift Based on what I have read by the oblivious, yes."
"@Joxster Rotundra Oh, this is where the kooks are hanging out. Got it."
"EVs may rely a lot more on the grid than gas-powered cars, but there are so many ways to take that EV off-grid so that it's not beholden to the grid.  The number of roof-solar panels I've been seeing on people's homes has been going up like crazy.  You can charge a Tesla with a roof array.  There's also an abundance of gas-powered generators in circulation.  You can charge that Tesla with a gas generator.  They also make wood-burning generators if that's your flavor of paranoia."
"@Aloha Tigers I never said we can rely on oil indefinitely. Those are your words not mine. I also do not think its an infinite resource, I never said that. Again, your words not mine. What I did say was that the push for expensive, non sustainable electric has more to do with control than running out of oil.  Unfortunately you are not paying attention to politics on a global scale, nor have you been for 30 years. I'll give you a hint. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio De Janero. 

There are other forms of vehicular energy production. Some, completely unbelievable until you see them with your own eyes but the governments shut them down, which is a leading indication this has less to do with anything other than money and power which is control."
Thank goodness some people understand the concept of dirty electricity.
Wait so you're saying that it's not Russias fault ...!!? I trust daddy Biden. If he says it's Putin's fault then it's putins fault. Preiodittttt
I personally would like to think that with the ongoing energy uses thats because of our many different types of crude that we will have oil still yet for hopeful years ahead.
"So basically, gas prices have skyrocketed because the oil industry sees the writing on the wall and gave up on oil before consumers have."
Greatly explained
"just took my eng econ final an hour ago and came home to watch this, guess I like economics now"
"The end of oil has been predicted for a long time.  In the 1960s I was told that world oil reserves would last fir 20 years.  Of course we found more oil.
In the 1970s I was told that oil should be used for lubrication because it was a waste to use it for fuel.  
I don't belive we will run out of oil, it will just become to expensive.  When that will happen I don't know, but it will not be soon.  
Our lifestyle is supported by massive energy use.  Just looking at food, we get fresh produce year around by an amazing transportation network that includes refrigeration.   In the USA compared to the 1950s, we indirectly consume more energy by having fresh and frozen food delivered year round from far away.  In the 1950s most food in the USA came from local sources and you ate food in season.  
Of course it is very risky to predict the future."
"""I don't belive we will run out of oil, it will just become to expensive.""

We will inevitably run out of oil someday, that's a given. But you're probably correct insofar that the last few drops will be so expensive to extract that no one will bother."
"IIRC, in the 1960's, they predicted that peak oil would happen in 2021.  That was pretty accurate."
"We've only had truly low oil prices for five out of the past twenty years, while battery prices have been very consistently going down for all of those past twenty years. 

Even if prices go down again for a while, financially responsible non-boomers aren't going to take ""I need a hummer"" as a lesson from this, especially if they have an alternative that has better road performance and lets them completely forget about oil prices permanently."
"The question is not if, but how much does each cause (low production, the war, inflation) influence oil prices proportionally."

"Gas is expensive because we use too much of it. If you want cheaper gas, stop driving around in something the size of a living room. Good gas mileage starts at 60 mpg. Many EVs get over 110 mpge."
When people stop buying fuel You will see it drop dramatically Which will be very soon! Because everyone will be going out of business.
You're really something special.
"Not just Azerbaijan, another big Caspian natural gas country is Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan is so rich in natural gas, that for a long period of time, gas, electricity, and water were all free of charge. They also used that wealth from all the natural gas to build tons of marble structures in the capital city Ashgabat (they actually have a Guinness World Record for it). Under late leader Saparmurat Niyazov aka Turkmenbashi, he built a marble monument honoring the country's neutrality with a spinning golden statue of him at the top. It spun so that it would always be facing the Sun, symbolizing that his era was the golden era. Like Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan has pipelines connecting its natural gas to neighboring countries like the Trans-Afghan pipeline connecting Turkmenistan through Afghanistan and Pakistan to India and the Central Asia-China pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to Xinjiang (they also have pipelines to Iran). As part of the pipeline from Baku through Turkey at 6:00, a subsea pipeline has been proposed to connect Azerbaijan to Turkmenistan. Because of the natural gas, Western leaders aren't so keen on criticizing the Turkmen and Azerbaijani leaders when compared to criticizing me. Why? Because we're not rich in the specific resources (oil) they want

Back in the 70s when the country was still a Soviet republic, the Soviets were drilling in the northern portion of the country looking for an oil field. When they found a natural gas pocket, the drill suddenly collapsed into a crater. Because of the concern of poisonous gases being released, they decided to set it on fire....that fire is still burning to this day. And the problem of poisonous gases being released is still an issue, thus in addition to saving the environment it's been decided to seal the crater. As cool as the crater nicknamed the Door to Hell is, it's not so cool when you have health issues because of it like the locals"
"I hear you kimmy, I hear you."
And dear leader drills his own oil to supply his needs
Seems trust worthy.Right?
"Oil and gas are not going away - we will see tremendous growth over the next decade. With the current start of de-globalization, renewables won‚Äôt be performing as promised as they require far more different types of raw materials which are mostly located in conflict zones as well. Oil and gas are expensive because of underinvestment in the sector for 10+ years despite growing demand. A little too much wishful thinking included in this video, which is just not reflective of reality. Not your best video."
lol now do a video on how much the worlds being wrecked by ev car and stuff
"What a terrible video. It is the war, and it's other factors as well. Don't use such a crappy title."

as a futures trader mainly concentrating on S&P 500 futures index (/ES) this is a great video
But joe Biden said so so it must be true!
One of the best explainers I‚Äôve seen on the current oil markets! Keep up the great work!
15:29 Oil companies are capable of long term thinking???? I guess it's just empathy for future generations that they lack.

The US military: *proceeds to look at a list of OPEC countries*"
Yes. The cost of oil is even higher than what we see at the pump.
"@tinfever Yeah, Russia has been one of the reasons the gas price was low. They refused to collaborate with other producers to jack up prices.  I guess they wanted to expand their market percentage"

The answer: Adolf Newsom and Joe Bidumb. Enough said.
did you even watch the video
I'm hoping these prices pushes us towards using more and more renewable sources
Thats simple - Joe Biden and Democrats
You are far to easily political manipulated
"Great breakdown and Ive been telling people about this for a couple of months now. Basically, The high peak we saw after the first few weeks this all kicked off was the point they realised they had taken as far as they could, so the slight adjustment back to levels we have see sustained over the last few weeks will very much be the new norm. Because, we all just accept it now with little fuss. I ran the numbers on my 55mpg Ford Galaxy, where we do two tanks a month V's the cost of running an electric vehicle (even at the new high KWH) and its nearly 1/4 the cost per month. Basically, the saving would pay the majority on monthly lease on a brand new EV (lower band). So yeh, they have just accelerated their own demise but have done it on their own terms for maximum short-medium term profit."
Getting sick of these tiktok ads ....
"""The oil industry ain't going down without a fight!"" - I love how Sam points this out"
Big oil basically pumping their stocks so they can all sell high and retire. While leaving retail holding the bag.
"I think it goes counter to everything else he was saying. He describes it like the oil industry ~has~ given up fighting, and are just enjoying one last hurray before renewables finally do replace them."
"There's no evidence presented in this video that renewables ""taking over"" are the primary factor driving the petroleum sector away from long-term re-investment.  The energy demand cratering was due strictly to COVID lockdowns, which have mostly abated, and correspondingly, there is a mostly full recovery in energy demand.

Whenever you get demand spikes for long-ROI commodities, governments and societies develop ever-more confiscatory approaches.  Mineral wealth royalties go up.  ""Excess profit"" taxes are raised.  In some cases, as we saw last week with lithium in Mexico, entire sectors are nationalized overnight.  Investors are becoming spooked not by an uncertain demand curve, but by an uncertain regulatory environment.  They'll slash costs and ride out a downturn if there's no other option, but mean regulatory environments can't be endured; they have to take the money and run.  And oil, being a unique commodity in that it is both high-investment and, ironically, illiquid, as the underlying assets are stranded in unfriendly waters, is going to be the first target of reinvestment collapse if sector capital investors start to feel the social license winds changing.

What will most likely happen is that demand will shrink again for all commodities due to an upcoming QE-driven recession.  Within months or years of that recession, many of these confiscatory policies will be rolled back as governments try to encourage growth and consumption again."
"Appreciate the nuanced long explanation, not an over simplified answer like most people are giving right now for gas prices."

"But in someways it's a good thing, because the more expensive oil is the faster everyone will want to switch to renewables because they may actually be competitive."
"""ignoring the countless externalities""

Okay, but like, don't."
well the war didn't help
This is the type of video where it takes too long to come to the answer of the question in the title. The first 16 minutes may give context but if you're not clueless in the topic it's redundant
This man is OP
the war is still a factor and so is Biden cancelling the  pipeline
So Biden cancelling the gas pipeline did do something
6 months after taking office gas was up one dollar a gallon.  This was because Joe Biden signed executive orders prohibiting new oil leases on Federal land.  Overnight the USA went from being an oil exporting nation like it was under Trump to an oil importing nation.  Now Joe Biden is blaming Putin.
Price gouging by multinational oil companies
If only I could sort by controversial...
"When oil crashed to $0 and held at $20, plenty of analysts said, this will be the reason why oil will hit $100.  Since nobody will be exploring for more oil, and many people will be shutting their taps for good, when the demand returns, the market won't be ready, hence the price hike today"
"@Critical 

Ppl don't know know how to read. 

That's all. 

They see ""Obama"" and think ""oh he's blaming"" so and so again. 

I knew exactly what you meant. 

""Obama era"" doesn't mean ""Obama"" or Trump or Biden did anything to being about said higher or lower prices."
@Critical Event lol
@dan smith It was cheap because the economy was in the shitter and they couldn't jack the price on us because no one would buy it.  THERE IS NO SUPPLY ISSUE.

"I will give your lovely little consortium another $5 a month if you can briefly tell me what persuasive theory has uncovered, that rhetoric managed to miss."
Maybe it's time to nationalize oil production.
"It's hilarious that all of a sudden there's a push for renewables when all the propaganda being pushed out is it's already too late to save the world from climate change. It's also funny that electric cars were around in the 90s, check out the documentary ""Who Killed the Electric Car"". I believe the renewables market is a total scam. Even if they don't use oil for fuel, petroleum is used to make plastics & is found in nearly all products. Someone is lying about the oil production or not telling us the whole truth because there is no shortage of plastics & it's in food & pharmaceutical products if you read the ingredients. I refuse to spend $70k on a Tesla that catches on fire & has limited travel distances because it needs to be charged! It's all ridiculous & the climate cult needs to be held accountable for their disinformation campaigns about carbon, climate change nonsense, rising sea levels etc. The majority think CO2 is some killer gas when it's part of the respiration process & photosynthesis for plants & forests. You can't live in a zero carbon world, everything will literally die!"
"Does this apply to Europe as well? As Germany for example got cheap oil from Russia, and now has to get it from somewhere else?"
"Apologies to all of you who have shares in oil, pharmaceutical, gas and coal companies, but if you want a healthy world for your children, you may consider changing your focus."
Thanks Joe Biden <3  I cannot wait for $35.99/gallon prices next YAY!!!!   Guess this is the way they will tax the rich?   :/
Fossil fuels are here to stay.
Wrong it‚Äôs clearly Biden‚Äôs fault why gas is so expensive /s
I‚Äôve always said we will never go green until the oil industry has control of the green industry
"Very informative video as always. Except for the required Climate sermon that wraps up any video dealing with fuel. The End of Fossil Fuels"" is not near. It isn't even close, no matter how much some may wish it to be so. Renewables cannot, by any currently conceivable method or technology, replace or even equal fossil fuels in America's energy infrastructure. It is the simple physics of energy density. 

The ONLY non-petrol based energy source that could supplant fossil fuels is nuclear, which would be safer, cleaner and more wonderful in almost every way. Except nuclear power runs up against the same problem that keeps the Climate Catastrophe Sing-Along going strong: Scientific Illiteracy. People who fear Climate Change REALLY fear nuclear power, even though it is safer and cleaner than any fuel source past present or future."
This video is way too confusing for aussies who use the term petrol instead of gas.
"@bruh in EU we already have this. Petrol=E5, Diesel=B7. Honestly it was pain sometimes to find out that you have to pump ""senza piombio"" or whatever they name it in that particular country. I have trouble remembering these numbers but at least they are the same for every country (in EU)."
"That's made even worse by the inaccurate graphic at 9:40. Petroleum is synonymous with ""crude oil"", the raw product. Instead, they're using ""petroleum"" instead of ""gasoline or petrol"" the distilled product."
As I kid I thought petrol was a kinda butter like spread for your bread
"@SpecialKLSX wow you can count without your fingers??? Good one Americans, you are going places."
"@Korakys it's not confusing at all. US citizens can count without their fingers so we are used to ""complicated"" descriptions. We can figure out that ""Gas"" is short for gasoline, a petrol product, and Diesel is just that.  Natural gas is called just that. Or CNG/LNG if you are in the industry of dealing with such a material."
"The energy industry isn't going anywhere. The 40% of oil being refined into gasoline may shrink after 2035 forced EV mandates. Their more profitable ventures will increase, jet fuel, diesel, plastics, and etc. Planes, cargo ships, and trucks have a long way to go to get off oil. Consumers switching to EV is just more profitable for oil companies and miners of rare earths as well forcing tax payers to buy new products. It's wishful thinking to think oil industry is going to vanish. Nice documentary nonetheless. Thanks."
never switching to an EV üíÄ
"In Other words, the public are being conned and have been since oil was discovered. Pharmaceuticals, plastic and synthetic materials, which are proving to be the biggest environmental risk of and to human beings ingenuity. We have created a monster, as Oppenheimer realised."
if war is not the reason then why are the oil prices hiked only when putin started invasion on ukrain? not before that
They did. Just because you weren't aware doesn't mean it wasn't happening.

"IF Canada joined OPEC the USA would be so upset it would be insane.Can you imagine if we joined OPEC. I think we should. Fuck the US.  We could charge so much more and make bank off the EU and China. BUt still charge the US the same rate before OPEC, so we don't get invaded by the US"
The Ukraine war has been used as an excuse for the major producers to hike the prices.  Russia's effect on the global market is not significant and in some continents is totally immaterial.
Yeah I‚Äôm sure the liberal policies that punish oil have nothing to do with it üôÑ
Very well done. I'm smashing!
In b4  ‚ÄúNo it was Joe Biden‚Äù
"Damn that last part made me kinda emotional, and I don't even own a oil company or work in one. Its end is now starting, electric sure is the new future for vehicles and stuff."
I find it crazy every time I hear a news story speculating on when oil prices will come down. I‚Äôm always listening wondering ‚Äúwhy are none of them admitting that fossil fuels are on their (slow) way out?!?‚Äù
OMG oil is not going away.   Where are these renewables??   How many of us can afford a Tesla or even want one???  If anything Oil companies know we will still need oil and are knowingly screwing us over.   ONCE AGAIN OIL IS NOT GOING AWAY OR SUFFERING ANY KIND OF LOSS!   This guy wendover is clue less or out of touch with reallity what a loser

If the oil companies are posting record profits wouldn‚Äôt it entice smaller producers to create new fracking rigs to cash in on it thus eventually balancing out prices?
"@Oblivion Because they choose when to inflate the prices. Usually, it comes from a high ranking person in the company trying to make a splash, or simply because the company is trying to beat some previous profit record set by themselves or a rival. In the corporate world, the only way to prove yourself is through profits. The easiest way raise profits is to raise prices. Even this video pretty much shows it. The oil prices are high not because of a war or government laws, but because oil companies just decided to raise prices."
@Oblivion Shifting it onto the government? Are you sure corporations raising prices to beat previous years profits don't cause inflation?
"@anthony hadsell the problem is artificial inflation. Now days, if the price of something goes up, it never comes back down, regardless of any balance the market experiences. The savings are passed to the manufacturers and investors, not the consumer. This is known as corporate greed."

I used to drive a BMW that was thirsty on gas and I traded it in for a VW Golf months before gas prices went up and now I‚Äôm actually paying more to fill up the Golf with regular gas than the BMW that took premium gas.
"You still go farther? What if you had the same car, it would cost twice as much. What's your point?"
Same but instead of driving a bmw we had lada riva 2107 that as an old car consumed more gas. Now we have golf 5 1.4tsi and at first it saved some cash but after the spike.. well you said it already
Nice try but regular people know that its a scientific fact that this is Bidens fault.

So where do you think most of our electricity comes from?
"At least they're producing less oil, which is good for the planet?"
"Summary: Covid made oil go negative, oil production was dramatically reduced, then demand was higher than supply meaning oil companies were making record profit off the least amount of oil. The large Oil companies keep supply low to keep these record high profit margins. With renewable technology, and Ev‚Äôs so close the oil business will only go down so the large companies are milking everything they can from this.

A bunch of smaller companies could offset this by trying to undercut prices reintroducing supply, but the future of oil is short so investment in small companies to undercut the prices is hard to get,

There will be high oil prices until demand drops for oil ( 5-10-20 years)"
"The economy is based all around oil as plastics, clothes, car bodies and fuels, glue and much more all require some byproduct of oil. 70% of oil produced in U.S. is used on fuel. Soon everything else will have 70% less supply as they use some the byproduct of oil in fuel. This means for a time cost will be high and supply will be low regardless of demand as the products will have to be produced through other methods less developed currently suppressed under the oil system.

Example corn oil replacing normal oil for creating plastics, this would raise corn prices, and the plastic quality we are use to would be different for a time until the process is refined or the standard changed

The transition occurring now/soon will be a mess in the economy but things will be much better for the environment and innovation in the end"

"The US is so far from being able to discontinue fossil fuels its not even funny.  The entire grid would need reworked because its designed for constant power sources, not intermittent like most renewables.  CA is already having regular brown outs and we havent even seen mass EV use yet.  Spain, Germany and other European nations have attempted going green and the result has been a failure as energy prices soared and grid reliability plummeted.  Wendover touches on supply and demand, ponder for a minute what happens to the worlds supply of rare earth minerals, lithium, cobalt and copper when every car, every house, power station, solar panel, wind turbine etc are all competing for the same resources.  Where is the hundreds of billions in upgrades needed to upgrade our grid going to come from Monopoly money?

What does the world look like when China owns the majority of those resources?  What happens when oil companies decide enough and reinvest into future production and make fossil fuels much cheaper than renewables to crush their market share?  Also energy is energy.  The greens dont want fossil fuels here, but big bad fossil fuels is just going to export to China, India and other places that have less emissions controls than the US resulting in little change to impact climate models.

We are being played by big corp, big gov, and special interest to separate us from the fruits of our labor.  I hope more can see that."
"@email shared by a few people unfortunately China has been investing quite heavily into acquiring resources it needs to for its manufacturing capacity.  They own rights to significant amounts of resources across the African continent, is looking like they will be getting a chance to mine the huge lithium deposits in Afghanistan and more.  Sure they US has a lot, but we are talking about a staggering amount needed for the future green vision. In my opinion the US does not have enough to achieve that because of the timelines the US government is placing on industries like EV mandates instead of letting the free market work.  It‚Äôs going to lead to crippling costs."
I don‚Äôt see how China could end up with most of the resources required for renewables. Most of them aren‚Äôt in China
The grid already supports nuclear reactors. Swapping to the real clean energy will be easier than switching to dangerous solar/wind
"might I just point out that India doesn't have enough oil reserves to even cover 1/4th of the oil demand?

When oil was $150 a barrel it was cheaper at the Bowser than what it is now at $100 a barrel
"On Mr. Biden‚Äôs first day in office, he issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to put a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù (bureaucratese for ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù) moratorium on the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program. That program directs the Bureau of Land Management to lease certain lands in Alaska for oil and gas extraction.

A few days later, he issued another order ‚Äúpausing‚Äù oil and gas leases on all public lands and waters.


According to the Bureau, Alaska‚Äôs Coastal Plain is ‚Äúsome of the most highly prospective land on Alaska‚Äôs North Slope.‚Äù It contains billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. It is a king‚Äôs ransom of energy wealth, and the law requires that the administration make it available for extraction.

Former President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration complied, and the bureau began issuing leases to energy firms toward the end of his term. But Mr. Biden terminated the program immediately and likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act in the process. His decision to pause leases on public lands, meanwhile, violated another law that requires quarterly lease sales.

The result: Mr. Biden has unlawfully trapped much of America‚Äôs vast energy reserves behind a wall of bureaucratic red tape, leaving them unavailable now that the country needs them. Because of that, Americans will suffer at the pumps far more than they ought to.

If Mr. Biden were playing chess instead of pinball, he wouldn‚Äôt have made this mistake.

At the very least, he would have taken steps to cure other problems that are artificially inflating oil prices. He would have, for example, issued a Jones Act waiver, temporarily suspending the law while pushing Congress to repeal it permanently.

The Jones Act requires goods shipped between U.S. ports to be sent on ships made, flagged and crewed by Americans. That severely restricts shipping options and makes American shipping much more expensive than foreign shipping. So expensive that it‚Äôs often cheaper to buy foreign oil and gas and so limited that‚Äîin the case of liquefied natural gas‚Äîthere are no Jones Act compliant ships to transport it.

As a result, Americans are often stuck with expensive foreign energy rather than the cheaper energy we produce here. Only the uniquely twisted logic found in Washington could justify a law that makes it cheaper to buy foreign oil and gas over American.

>>> Biden‚Äôs Burnt Bridges Exacerbate Ukraine-Related Oil Crisis

Hawaii, for example, gets 28% of its oil imports from Russia, partly because the Jones Act makes it too expensive for Hawaiians to buy gasoline from the mainland. Hawaii will lose more than a quarter of its imported supply, and Mr. Biden has no plan to replace it with American energy.

Instead, his administration is telling people to buy electric cars. Not that it will do Hawaiians any good; petroleum-fired power plants supply more than three-fourths of the state‚Äôs electricity.

If Mr. Biden reopened the Coastal Plain and public lands and waters to exploration, it would likely lower prices somewhat simply by sending the global market a signal that American energy is open for business. But it will take time for production to ramp up and lower prices further.

If only someone had planned for this a year ago.

As with his withdrawal from Afghanistan, Mr. Biden again failed to anticipate and mitigate negative consequences. It‚Äôs high time the administration stopped playing pinball. The American people pay too high a price when he misses the ball."
"@Philitron128 Well it's important build an equitable and just society where everyone can benefit. Not everyone has the means to ""modernize"" currently nor is it reasonable to expect everyone to at the same time."
"@Chris I'm a selfish person lol, I don't give a shit about people who refuse to modernize. Why should I?"
"@Philitron128 Well it's a good thing conservatives dont control congress! Plus they would go along with several of the points I've listed and for the ones they dont like use executive orders. 

This is an issue that is disproportionately affecting millions of low income people, perpetuating the Ukraine war, and is a leading cause of inflation. 
As such, even if you aren't personally affected, there is a moral imperative to reduce suffering. Not to do so is selfish."
"@Philitron128 Okay then Biden needs to pass executive orders to: 1. Charge oil companies a premium for unused oil drilling permits, 2. Place price caps on oil and gas prices, 3. Prohibit exporting oil and gas if prices at the pump are above a certain dollar value, 4. Lease oil drilling in the U.S. to foreign companies to increase competition. 5. Incentize U.S. based companies to increase oil production, 6. Mandate the Army core of engineers to reopen oil refineries that closed during COVID. 

1-3 can be done immediately through executive orders, 3-6 would need to go through congress. The bottom line is that there is plenty Biden can do."
Oil will be around for way longer than people are wanting to realize. I think we should produce more more more
"The only thing that will be hard to switch away from oil is long range aviation. That may or may not happen until high energy density batteries are developed. Ground and water based transportation can completely be electrified because there's no weight penalty per se. Renewables + nuclear can meet this demand.

Everything else can transition out of oil including manufacturing of secondary products - plastics, organic compounds, rubber, fertilizers, whatever. And none of those things are ""time critical"" to an end user. For example, one can delay buying a TV or something else made out of something that was a byproduct of oil. Eventually substitutes will be found and the only thing that will sustain the need for oil will be aviation."

"In October, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman stated that part of the reason why energy prices are so high is that financing for fossil fuel companies is ‚Äúalmost impossible‚Äù to attain. Moreover, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also admitted that policies that restrict the ‚Äúsupply of hydrocarbons has created energy inflation‚Äù and that it is not transitory ‚Äî in fact, it may stick around for a long time. 

Additionally, Christopher Wood, Global Head of Equity Strategy at Jeffries, told CNBC that the mismatch between demand and supply for energy could get worse. Wood states that the issue is the ‚Äúoil price is gonna go higher in a fully reopened world because nobody‚Äôs investing in oil but the world still consumes fossil fuels.‚Äù Wood went so far as to say that in a ‚Äúfully reopened world, the oil price could go to $150 dollars.‚Äù

The rise in prices can be attributed to political pressure from the administration to reel back oil and gas production. Wood claims that the ‚Äúpolitical attack‚Äù on oil and gas ‚Äúhas removed the incentive for investment in the sector despite its lingering importance.‚Äù

According to Western Energy Alliance President Kathleen Sgamma, oil and gas producers are unable to access capital, because the Biden administration is ‚Äúputting so much pressure on banks not to lend to us in the name of climate change.‚Äù

State officials from across the United States are fed up with politics seeping into investment decision-making. The Federalist obtained a letter sent by 15 state financial officers threatening to remove $600 billion worth of assets under management by U.S. financial institutions if they continue to discriminate against oil and gas investments. The letter explains how the Biden administration is choking off capital to oil and gas. Specifically, the letter describes how the Treasury Department released guidance for multilateral development banks ‚Äúto end American financial support for traditional energy production projects in developing countries around the world, likely ceding future development and exploration to Chinese interests.‚Äù 

Investment discrimination against traditional energy producers could be further worsened if the Biden administration nominates individuals to head agencies opposed to the industry. Although Saule Omarova withdrew her nomination, lawmakers should remain vigilant and ensure any new nominee to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) does not share her desire to bankrupt traditional energy producers. The new comptroller of the Currency will oversee all nationally chartered banks in the United States, possess voting power on the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and could influence the direction of lending by threatening to issue cease and desist orders for actions the OCC views as ‚Äúan unsafe or unsound practice.‚Äù 

Earlier this year, Texas enacted a bill to prohibit banks and investment firms that boycott oil and gas investments from receiving state contracts or managing state investments, such as pension and retirement funds for state employees. Other states that follow this model are on the right track to removing political favoritism from finance and preserving the economic security of their municipalities. 

Keeping the power on and making sure energy is affordable for all Americans should be the primary objective. Biden and the Democrats‚Äô plan to slowly suffocate the oil and gas industry will make all Americans worse off."
But I saw a sticker on the pump that said it was Joe's fault.
"Persuasion essay is correct because you conveniently forgot to mention that there‚Äôs a lot more to owning a license to fra and prospect and there is to drilling for oil such as only 1/10 drill sites having oil to drill for and other permits that are needed besides the license to drill, why don‚Äôt you fairly presents both sides next time Sam"
"We need a video titled ""Why Wendover Productions does his titles like this (It's Not Clickbait)"""
"Because Oil Companies aren't being allowed to drill. That's why.

Now they might be but there is a lot less acreage."
"Local Chevron stations raced to $5.99.9. As other gas stations have gone down 10 cents or more recently, local Chevron stations are still $5.99.9, why do people reward this behavior? 
Because they're smooth brains who get distracted by bad bad words like ""CRT,"" or ""communism,"" or ""democracy,"" and will vote jesus before economics. Cultural conservative are the unproductive useless eater Plague Bearing minority, and are responsible for why America hasn't yet been ""made great again."""
I don't even have to watch this. Ever since Biden announced that he was cutting basically all domestic production of oil and gas in America gas has been going up higher and faster than the usual rate.
"Basically, oil companies see the writing on the wall and are trying to cash out and not make any new investments"
Mining for lithium is worse for the environment than mining for oil! Green energy is a big political lie.
How can one single YouTube video contain so much info and analysis is beyond me.
Workers in the Azberjani oil fields have been working there for over 100 years.
"Wait. 6:36 5.5 billion dollars?
You just said for a much smaller pipe it was 1B a mile"
"Wrong, gas got expensive when the Democrats allowed gas to be speculated on in the stock markets.  When Obama removed gas from the speculation markets it price dropped by over half.  The very next week two supertakers were hijacked off Somalia and the price didn't change.  Then Obama allowed oil to be speculated on and the price has risen ever since."
"The whitehouse may have the Federal land leases granted, but they‚Äôre failing to permit them beyond that. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the US domestic oil production went from the US being a net exporter for the first time in 70+ years back to the status quo of being a net importer again. Trump‚Äôs unprecedented deregulations, much as the man‚Äôs unorthodox attitude exposed corporate media for the self-cleansing lie machine it is, he also exposed how corrupt and controlled the energy industry is with the current regime far more invested and more concerned with pipelines and borders located in the former Soviet Union than they are domestically with the southern border door flung wide open during a supposed  pandemic in full swing and the first order on their agenda being to shut down the domestic US/Canada pipeline but to authorize the Nordstreme 2‚Äôs pipeline for Russia/Eastern European markets‚Ä¶ until the Ukraine invasion. An invasion provoked by the CIA backing of an extremist faction within Ukraine (when have we ever experienced blow back from doing THAT?!?) and western influence toppling the Russia-friendly government in favor of their own puppet president, stepping all over Russia‚Äôs toes in terms of Russia‚Äôs national security and of course their access to national energy resources (why else would the US waste their efforts?). In addition, Biden‚Äôs son‚Äôs corrupt Burisma involvement and direct payment from a Moscow mayor‚Äôs wife in the $millions made to Hunter and ‚Äòthe BIG guy‚Äô has this administration reeking to high heaven of corruption. Similarly, the decades of DC elites gutting the US‚Äôs middle class by making China the more advantageous place to manufacture, using every government lever of power to make the US as inhospitable to manufacturing as possible, you KNOW Hunter and his dementia-ridden father are up to their elbows in dirty Chinese ‚Äòinvestment‚Äô as well, as was proven by Hunter‚Äôs laptop abs corroborated by their former business partner, Tony Bobulinsky. Desperation hangs heavy in the air. Desperate moves, one after the other by the administrative state and the Executive branch fall flat each time they abuse their power and our god-given rights when they are botanic slapped down by the courts. These people in power are clearly JEALOUS of the Chinese Communist Party and would readily oppress the American people if they could and thank GOD for the 1st and 2nd ammo dmd t‚Äôs, both of which are under pathetic attack. The ‚Äòestablishment‚Äôs‚Äô days are numbered, not oil‚Äôs. The establishment cronies artificially making markets that are NOT in America‚Äôs best interests (including its citizens for a change) have been exposed and their media mouthpieces are gasping their last breath. Authenticity is winning. The public knows it‚Äôs being screwed and the emperor‚Äôs new clothes have exposed his tiny weenis. It‚Äôs a matter of time now and this corruption through executive order has pushed the nation to its brink with ever increasingly unbelievable audacity to lie, they‚Äôre signing their own death warrants. We‚Äôve had ENOUGH."
"This is a schizophrenic rant, not anything based in reality. Deregulation doesn't just fix things. Gas prices dropped because demand vanished overnight and supply can't easily be stopped."
"Renewables exist to greenwash natural gas.  Your explanation that renewables will replace fuels is both absurd and not what is driving anyone's decision making inside the energy industry.  In case you didn't watch your own video, energy from ff is higher than ever right now.  And high prices will just encourage more development of fossil fuels.  Quit telling people this fairy tale of renewables replacing oil.  That's like wheat replacing forks.  They are just different segments of the market.  PS this is why Germany with more renewables than anyone is so desperate for more natural gas right now.  If what you are saying was true, it would be Germany who could get off of natural gas but it isn't which is why they are so addicted to gas."
Greed and Putin accidently helped with fixing climate change. Huh.
This just makes me want to kill myself even more
Thanks Biden for killing the Keystone pipeline.
@D L How much crude per year? Do you know? Because I do. But I'd love for you to Google it and then compare that to just the US's yearly use lmao
"@Philitron128   It would have actually brought oil to refineries in the cheapest way possible to insure it turned into gasoline.  So it would certainly bring the price of gas down, people don't use crude oil to power their cars."
Lmao the Keystone pipeline would have done as much to oil prices as a fart does to global warming
I think what's most important to emphasize is that it's not because of Joe Biden. I can't tell you how many times I've heard ignorant Midwesterners blame him for it
@D L ...did...did you watch the video? It explains where the gas price hike came from
I wish I could physically force everyone to watch this video because if I hear one more person say that Biden is the magic god of gas prices I‚Äôm gonna lose it
"so when gasoline-powered consumer vehicles arent being produced, what is going to be the big example used for pretending natural climate change is man-made?"
"Take a video about this , 
the world satanic elite , you can also call them as the committee for the meeting of the Antichrist ,Trump called them the deep state, at the moment it consists of about 10,000 people , from the famous ones are Merkel, Macron, Biden, Boris Johnson, Sarcazi, Bill Gates, Zuckenberg , Sergey Bryl and Larry Page ( the owners of Google and YouTube),Pavel Durov , the Bush family, the Clinton family, the same Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Baruchs, Leibs, Coons, Schiffs,Oppenheimers, Ruperts,Waltons, Dupons, Goldmans,Morgans, Carnegies , practically all the royal and imperial families of the world (the most important of them are the Windsors), and other surnames . They are all connected to each other, and they believe that they have a much better chance of gaining eternal life for themselves and corrupting humanity than to lose.Therefore, those new people whom they accept into their community agree to be with them not only because if they refuse and they will be killed, but also because he sees that they have a better chance of winning.They are behind the world wars , they created and spread the coronavirus , now their goal is to create a single unified world and a single world government. All spiritual life will be concentrated within one church,they need it to ensure the arrival of the Antichrist (Dajjal) and prevent the second coming of Jesus and the last judgment ,thereby ensuring the end of history beneficial to Lucifer and insignificant for humanity ,such conditions are allowed by God ,when Lucifer (Iblis) disobeyed God and did not bow to Adam , God could have killed him, but Lucifer (Iblis) asked to leave his life, and for this he will experience the creation of God - man in particular and humanity in general, Lucifer(iblis) (he can not, like any demon ( jin), communicate directly with a person, but through the rites of magic there can be a connection) . For humanity there are 3 variants of the outcome , the first arrival of the Antichrist and such a fall of the spirit that it will not be awarded 2 the coming of Jesus and then the last judgment will not be and all will be erased into dust , except for approximately 190,000 people who helped the devil to defeat humanity ,and Lucifer and those will receive eternal life .to whom he distributed his marks, signs, about 190,000 people (the antichrist, aka dajjal, can command matter and resurrect the dead with the condition that they will not go to heaven), who helped the devil defeat humanity, according to their plans there will be a new Atlantis on earth (a new golden age of humanity) where they will already live foreverand the second variant of the Human spirit on the scale of the planet will be so strong that they will not be able to bring the Antichrist , but will immediately be 2 the coming of Jesus and then there will be a last judgment , and the devil and his servants , it is clear what will happen to them . Well, the last option they will achieve the coming of the Antichrist , but humanity in general will fight for itself and God will let down Jesus and we will win and there will be a last judgment .They are fighting for eternal life for themselves, and for us they want to leave the option that we will all be wiped out and not even bother with the last judgment . The outcome depends on each of you , and your life after death .This information is for you , why in fact the ""world elite"" and more precisely the satanic elite, or even more precisely the committee for the meeting of the antichrist, is engaged in all this .And our task is to stop them . And let me remind you that the world is being developed by industrialists , scientists , farmers, teachers.

"17:16 I would argue that one legitimate reason that industrial investment is so low, is that ""regulatory headwinds"" in most developed nations lead financial minds to believe severe restriction of the market, if not an outright ban, is likely in the medium term. After all, if you were a bar owner who had reason to believe Prohibition was 5 years out...would you renovate the place; put in a second bar upstairs, and buy the bar down the street? Probably not!

So, the argument that ""global warming hawks"" are behind the increase in prices is not (entirely) without merit."
@Stan Vans It's math.
@Dalton King that's a ridiculous assumption.
@Stan Vans You'd never recover the price of that in that time frame without price gauging.
"Your argument falls apart when even in countries actively protecting fossil fuels at a government level, fossil fuel projects are having trouble finding investors and insurers and are beset by public relations issues and protests. It also falls apart when you call people 'global warming hawks' as some sort of deranged derogatory. It further falls apart when you find out renewables are just cheaper and make a better return on investment.
Its just a bad investment. Free market."

@dknowles60 the oil was shipped to China
@dknowles60 why? Please tell me
@Jake Sanservino wrong.
"""Renewables are taking over"". Sorry Wendover but I am going to need to disagree with you there. I believe ones outlook on oil stems greatly from ones political views. Politicians strive and push to get away from oil and gas, but the simple fact of the matter is we have no practical replacement for it; especially in developing countries. Basically, oil use will continue for a long time to see rising demand as the world population goes up. I will continue to see overall profits from my oil investments."

Funny how Donald trump put a stop to these oil companies but as soon as Joe Biden comes in they bend him over and he takes it and so do the US citizens.
"Saying that the oil companies are focusing on the now and not the long term wouldn't be accurate. They're focusing on the medium-term. They see that renewables are destroying the oil industry eventually but if they focused in this exact moment, they'd realize that taking that leap and ramping up production they could undercut all the competitors and basically monopolize the industry. The US goverment needs to coerce our domestic companies to boost oil. Its like an inverse bell curve. It'll make them a massive amount of cash in the short term and in the long-term it will cripple OPEC and strengthen the western economies when all these CEOs move into other industries and monopolistic titans. Why weaken your own country and cattle who work for you? It's a fear-based speculation rather than an intelligent economic move with ambition and drive behind it. How CEOs and elites keep their power when they have no balls or brains, I'll never know."

"Saying we are in a shortage is a very poor answer to why oil is pricy. Afterall, just 3 yrs ago we had reasonable prices, then day 1 of brain dead man he signs an ex order to ban new drilling on federal lands and then about a year later signs another banning renewing existing leases. We in the USA are sitting on MASSIVE stockpiles of oil/gas. 
Saying that the world is running out is crazy.
And talk of pipes, lets just ask hunter biden and his buddies to make more..."
"It's really missing some key points here, base loads energy can't be provided by renewable in the near future (no wind/no sun days), many secondary byproduct of producing fuel for transportation such as asphalt  or plastic prices will explode. Not too mention a lot of green tech is actually made with loads of Chinese coal (Photovoltaics cells) or that much of the equipment used in green tech (batteries/windmill/panels) is unrecyclable at the moment. Not the mention the rising prices of mining all the metal needed for that ""green"" revolution."
"The only ethical way forward to me is produce oil like crazy to raise the standard of living of the poor and middle class and at the same time use the booming economy to invest in replacement energy like nuclear, wind and solar."
it dont work

I think the soring gas prices is a good thing. Makes people more aware of how much they use. My prediction is it will skyrocket to an average of 12 aross the nation and should settle there. Whats even more crazy is the the new high will become the new normal.
"gas is expensive because potato joe shut down the keystone pipeline, shut down coal plants, banned fracking and offshore drilling, shipped part of 
the US strategic reserves to other countries and sent resources to help russia with their pipeline."
"The California gas prices in 2019 (almost $4 a gallon) got me to switch to a used EV in 2020 when the interest price on loans and cars crashed. Everyone questioned my decision, now a gallon is about $5.50, and I'm 5 years out from saving money on fuel alone. If I factor in maintenance like oil changes I'm maybe 2 years out if that."
Good luck when its time to replace the battery in your EV.  I am guessing you probably have maybe 2 years left until its time to replace.  All depends on your charge/discharge cycles.
"@Dixie Homestead It was 1.65-1.85 here for most of the year, then Brandon ruined it. Instantly went up week after week. Today, it's 4.29."

"I got myself a hybrid car early 2021, I drive 70 miles a day so I am saving quite a lot of money, the car almost pays for itself with California gas prices, the consumer, regular people, needs to adapt I know it sucks that you can economically get those big trucks and SUVs for recreational use but your wallet must be protected. We may never see cheap oil again the way things are going even with pro oil administrations."

I own mineral rights on land in some random plots in Oklahoma; they've been in the family for 4 generations. A couple months a year I get a $200 check for nothing.
"@Diego Bert TBH the cash I had to pay in legal and court fees to prove my grandmother was dead (ordering death certificates from another state was so hard I almost drove there) and that I was the rightful heir, compounded with the initial legal firm going bankrupt during the months-long hassle (I assume they thought I was just gonna give up and let them keep them) it wasn't really worth it; it was easily a grand. She was born at the end of the roaring 20s, and Grandma always said the mineral rights paid out great until ""that goddamn Jimmy Carter ruined it in the 70s."" I'm not sure the size of the plots; I had to pay just to get a mineral rights map of rural Oklahoma. I'm in St Louis, Missouri. I just got another check to my late grandma from another plot I was previously unaware of... so looks like we're going through this again."
How much total land in your plots. I like the sound of these royalties.
Now lets figure out how to recycle the millions of tons of steel used by the oil industry
Isn't steel one of the most recycled commodities in the world?
just a reminder that a single guy just payed 8 times the cost of that pipeline for a social media site because he didn't like people not being able to be transphobic and racist.
Big facts
It's obviously because Joe Brandon pressed the increase fuel prices button because he HATES AMERICA
"TLDR: effectively due to climate change, the world wants to switch to renewable gasses - while the profit for oil, and thus petrol use to be very high, this shrunk with the revelation of the affect on climate.

While oil is not running out, if anything, its running at a much lower production then it could be, its more about the companies using the changing to renewable fuels as a way to both cut down on the amount supplied (thus increasing their profit margin) while technically contributing to helping climate change 

or in other words, its more profitable to limit the amount being release, as the transition to renewable fuels is soon upon us, and so its basically one final era of prices being high before they ultimately become more redundant"
Malicious compliance
I moved out to western North Dakota in 2012 so I got to see some of the boom's effect on the economy out here.
"20:18 ""The oil industry can shrink faster than renewables can grow"". That may not be true. After the 1970's oil shocks, negabarrels (through mileage gains on passenger vehicles) grew faster than the oil industry could restrict supply (See Lovins : Winning the Oil Endgame). So a combination of efficiency and renewable installation may be able to grow faster than the oil industry can shrink supply. The oil industry may only have another decade left."
"@that_G_EvanP Wait, I just re-read my comment you were replying to. I should expand my last sentence. The oil industry only has about a decade left where this strategy will continue to work. And even a decade might be too long."
"@Save Money Save the Planet We could also mine the roughly 40% of energy that is wasted to inefficiency, that would reduce demand faster than the oil producers can economically reduce supply."
"@that_G_EvanP I see you don't understand how supply and demand work.

fertilizer

However you seem to have missed the point of the video. The oil industry is very sensitive to small changes in supply and demand. In the 80s, passenger vehicles were become so much more efficient, so quickly, that demand was dropping faster than OPEC was reducing supply.

There is only so much reduction in volume the major oil producers can do before experiencing a Spring Uprising."
Exactly. We could definitely grow the renewable industry faster if we truly set our mind to it.
Lol! Do yourself a favor and research how many products the world uses every day are made using oil and it's byproducts. The oil industry may not be the fuel industry for much longer but it's certainly not going anywhere.
Maybe if we didnt addict ourselves to oil we wouldnt have to bend over to their price manipuation.. Its like a crack ho being up set the price of crack went up
Lol this is a great analogy my friend
I've a feeling tomorrow Tesla's stock price will rise without explanation xD

Can we go back to using nuclear energy so we aren't reliant on the oil cartel?  Somewhere in Death Valley perhaps?  It should be criminal for an entity to take advantage of consumers whether it be oil/gas or health care/medicine.
You mean to tell me I am a total moron thinking Biden was responsible for high gas prices?
"One nitpick: oil and gas isn't particularly threatened by renewable electricity generation.

What's threatening oil and gas is batteries and efficient heat pumps. Heat pumps help with space heating. Grid-tied batteries remove the need for a lot of gas power plants to handle daily peaks. And vehicle batteries let you use an electric motor to power your vehicle even with quite limited infrastructure (no need for overhead lines everywhere).

Almost no oil is used for electricity; that demand could all disappear tomorrow and the oil markets wouldn't really notice -- but petrol or diesel cars and trucks disappearing would absolutely massacre the oil demand. A fair bit of gas is used for power, but it's only a minority that's at all threatened by renewables."

"First .. refineries can alter thier final production based on the TYPE of cude oil they receive.  Most WTI is petroleum... Brent is heavy cude that has more potential for distillate of different types.
Second.  The assumed position of this video.. pipelines have been and will continue to be the safest and most economical method to move crude oil.. the price tag alone is part of the cost of doing business.."
"So what you're saying is we need to start shooting oil company CEOs in the face, in public, until they comply with the simple truth that no commodity required for civilization to function should be sold above cost? Got it, and on it."

i love this channel
"I am not happy with the explanations in this video:
1st: The growing protests against the shale oil industry (many of which are RATIONAL) have made the industry no longer (in the long run) profitable. This has discouraged big companies from being enthusiastic about setting up new shale oil wells.

2nd: Environmental commitments and agreements to reduce carbon emissions have made the oil industry a sunset industry. It is true that oil is (for now) irreplaceable in many places, but alternatives to oil are increasingly emerging. This makes the oil giants less optimistic about the future of oil consumption. So we can see that the oil giants are actually investing in new energy sectors to maintain their position as energy giants and are investing less in oil drilling.

As stated in the above two points, reducing oil extraction and keeping current oil products at high prices is a better option for the industry giants and for the environment."
Opposition to oil and natural gas drilling is evil.  Poor people freeze to death because of high oil and natural gas prices.
"Funny how you gloss over all the onerous restrictions and regulations the current ideological administration places on those permits to the point that it is legitimately financially prohibitive to consider the investments in the current environment. This doesn't even touch on the drastic reduction in available land offered for lease to the tune of 1/9th or so of what should be marketed. The millions of internal combustion engine cars and trucks aren't just going to be phased out in the next 5-10 years because some environmentalists hope real hard, and oil companies are well aware of this fact. Give it 3 more years and the investments will start flowing again. Incompetence from the highest office has real tangible effects."
"Most of the permits issued haven't been used at all, this isn't the problem."
You rolled out 5.5B like New York didn‚Äôt just announce a 10B stadium.
"This analysis is somewhat plausible for about the first 80% of the video but if wendover thinks that carbon fuel sources like oil, natgas and coal are going away anytime soon and going to be replaced by green tech, they are high. Not high, mentally brain dead and high. Also without mention of ESG mandates effect on investment the analysis is incomplete at best."
"This video conveniently misses two huge facts to paint a narrative (watch his other channel Half as Interesting, you can see pretty quick which side he leans). He failed to mention that after the demand drop in 2020 due to worldwide lockdowns, the demand curve is currently rising by the day to fit right back into the yearly increase we saw for years. Demand isn‚Äôt down forever, it was down for a life changing moment and is now back on an increasing track. The other point you missed is  the majority of the underinvestment you dwelled on is from outside investors of companies, not internally within companies. Why is this? Because political pressure and the media have beat down O&G for a decade, causing a huge drop in outside investment for a commodity that, outside of a worldwide pandemic, is still increasing in demand year over year.

‚Äì All the ""a""s in Iraq, Iran, and Azerbaijan are pronounced like that in the word _father,_ not like that in the word _apple._ Also, the ""i"" in Iraq and Iran are pronounced ""ih"", not ""ai"". ""I ran""? Where did you run? And ""iRack""? It's not an Apple product.
‚Äì _kilometres_ is pronounced just like you're pronouncing _centimetres:_ with stress on the first syllable because it's a unit of measurement, not a measuring device. A ""kilometer"" would be very useful when playing games like Call of Duty.

"This video is really good, but still ignores the fact that the USA was energy independent in 2020 and we had a long period of low oil prices, ending in shocking rises right around the election.

"Of course you were energy independent in 2020 because you weren't using much energy, what has Joe Brandon done to make you not energy independent?"
renewables are not viable in most areas. wind can't be used in high altitude and solar can't be profitable in low light areas. so it's never gana happen the way you think
What a hot load of bull. Gas is expensive due to the dems incredibly hostile policies to domestic drilling on federal lands and pipeline construction. Anytime anyone says the shortage is due caring about the environment and renewables is full of shit. If they cared about that they would be backing nuclear all dau everyday as its the only way to transition to 100% carbon free energywithin 10-15 years. You could build solar panels and wind turbines all guaranteed 100% made with coal energy in China and you wouldnt come close to ridding carbon fuels. Add to that the US and UK  could dissappear over night and globalwarming would continue due to 15 coal plants made in China and 15 more made in India every year and you should realize the environment reason is BULLSHIT.
this video has just lost wendover all of his republican base for not blaming biden for the high oil prices

This is BS propaganda crap you completely left out the fact that our glorious commander-in-thief canceled the Keystone XL pipeline‚Äòs on his first day. This single move cost to oil industry billions which is why they don‚Äôt want to invest under the current administration because they would lose more money there was a time not so long ago that we were oil independent and none of this mattered.
The pipeline wasn't even operating so how does that effect prices exactly? And what has Brandon done to make America not energy independent?

"A lot of people also believe that we don't need oil or natural gas, and that renewable will save us. As this is a lie, we're gonna either get poorer or fewer. Because if there's not enough investments in oil, there will be consequences in essentials such as heating homes and fueling cars. Not to mention the contraction of the economy and risk of long term downturns."
"@Dazura The First It doesn't matter, as they are still too expensive and there's not enough resources to produce all those batteries, wind mills and solar panels. The prices for these products will also most likely rise in the coming decades as the demand will outrun supply. That's why we still need big investments in oil and gas. To think that renewables can replaces petroleum is naive. Maybe in the next 60 years or so, but not in the near future."
"This is grossly incorrect. Renewable sources are getting cheaper and cheaper, battery storage capacity is getting larger (the major thing holding back renewables is that we cannot store all the energy we collect from it for times when there's dips, so it leads to a situation where a lot of energy gets wasted and dissipated across the energy grid.) and nuclear energy is looking more and more like the future. Not nuclear fusion per say, there are fusion reactors expected to hit net positive energy gains by 2030, but they are still expensive as hell. But nuclear fission, we've had the solution to our environmental problems for a while and we've ignored it out of fear spread by the oil industry. The same people who hid evidence of climate change for decades."
What about natural gas? The demand for natural gas for homes is sure to keep the demand up for the long term no?

The Biden administration and its energy policies are the cause of gas price skyrocketing and it happened long before the war in Ukraine started. But it's convenient for the Dems to blame others for their own mistakes.

"15:27 ""regardless of profit""
Not true. The shale boom was made possible because of the same low interest rates and expanding money supply that brought on the financial crisis. The ""big short"" got made into a movie, but a lot of the capital flows also went into drilling wells.

16:20 ""operators cut back""
Nope. Politics interfered with banks that traditionally extended loans to oil companies. So many green this, ESG that, and pressure on investment firms cut off the supply of credit to the oil drillers. Operators did not ""cut back"" investment, they were ""cut off"" from the financing sources.

What you are seeing now is payback. Drillers have no lost love with the politicians pushing EVs and badmouthing fossil. So now they are all playing the same game as OPEC, no longer competing with it.

And the impact has laid bare the lies and broken promises of ""alternative"" energies. Germany paid the most expensive electricity to shut down coal mines, nuclear plants and subsidize renewables... for what? To be held hostage to rusian gas because the renewables failed to deliver.

Higher gasoline prices are the result of a war, just NOT the rusia-ukraine war. It is the political and financial war against oil and gas investments that has brought us to this."

The conversation has shifted. I can tell you that as a Texan. We have lawmakers that are grasping at straws trying to penalize banks and other companies for not wanting to maintain substantial investments in oil and gas. Oil is not a sustainable resource. It's finite. And it's volatile. Cars companies have already shifted gears all over the world. The prices of a lot of consumer goods are built this way. It's easy to keep looking at Red and Blue foolery but we need to be looking at companies that keep gauging consumers.
Wow blame the companys and not the prez who ya has 9000 permits but that doesn't mean they can just start drilling there lot more red tape he has add and lots of cost to cut threw it. Stop spreading fake news for nwo and deep state I once liked you but man this is shallow
"Even though it hurts my wallet, I‚Äôm glad for the high prices. It gives good incentive to move away from fossils."
@Zoltan My point is timing. We need to make the best use of fuels available now rather than artificially allow high prices. We don't yet have the technology needed and high gas prices will not speed things up. We need to wait for better batteries and then spend on transitioning. Its fake to tell people we can transition now like Newsom and AOC are attempting so they can impress the younger generation. Its a lie though.
"@CAD Thunkin If we all switch to electric cars tomorrow, then sure, it would collapse. But it is very extreme, even for the most optimistic scenario:)


I only have data for US. If every single car is replaced with EV, and no more gasoline is sold whatsoever, then the country'soverall electricity consumption would go up by about 20%. This is something you can easily calculate yourself too. 20% of growth is what US had in every decade, until the 90s. So expanding the electricity supply by 20% in a decade is certainly possible, however the transition to EV more likely will take 2-3 decades, so it is even easier.

EV is also slightly more efficient, even if it is sourced 100% fossils. Using any amount of renewable just further improves. The ratio of renewable we have today certainly can, and weill be improved. 



We are not shipping pollution anywhere. We are not importing energy. (Well, except for Germany...). If you switch to EV, you create less CO2 and other pollutants. Period. If China does it too, it is even better. If they don't, that's bad, but it doesn't take away anything from what you have saved."
"@Zoltan But if we all did electric cars, our electric system would collapse. Its only because we are barely using it that we survive. Also, that system is barely renewables because people are against nuclear and things like solar are not reliable. On top of all this, China could care less about carbon emissions so all our little deeds are meaningless except for pollution. We are shipping our pollution off site by using electrics. I'm all for renewables but we need batteries at our houses that store solar for a week and can charge cars."
"As some have said I will disagree about investment. The moment they see renewables start a big push they will invest to try to say ""see fossil fuels are cheaper."""
They have the public believing that everything other than their greed is responsible for the price we pay at the pump.  It wouldn't be much of a stretch for them to put together something like a Reefer Madness charade to keep people from investing in alternatives to their product.

But no, boomers get stuck in the mindset of ""I lived off of $7.00 an hour, why can't you!"" Despite the fact that $7/hour is equal to $20/hour today counting for inflation.

"@Joel A. ??? Inflation is just an increase of prices of goods and services. Oil prices tend to cause only temporary inflation, most inflation is caused by increasing the money supply faster than economic growth. If oil was the cause we would have no inflation compared to 2012, because oil prices where the same then.

I have a degree in economics for your information.

This is more nonsense, oil comes from different sources and has different extraction prices and that does not effect price. Only supply and demand and quality does. You don't get a premium for how expensive extraction is, it just affects if it's worth to extract certain supplies. 

This is just mumbo jumbo climate bullshit, there are no economic models that can valuate this. Also this would actually open up arctic oil and gas supplies, so it goes against your argument.

What are you even arguing here? The argument is that the developed World will abandon fossil fuels which will then be bought up by developing nations."
"@BoLoYu No. This has nothing to do with inflation, in fact inflation has to do with rising oil costs. You clearly have not done enough homework into where oil is, how hard it is to extract/refine it into useful products. When you factor these things in combined with how warmer climates effects literally every other industry, it‚Äôs getting extremely expensive. What oil that is easily accessible will go to rich nations, NOT developing ones"
"@Joel A. Everything has been rising for decades, ever heard of inflation? 
Since when? Oil prices are the same no matter how they're produced, only quality affects the price.

"I am in the industry and like so many simple explanations it over simplifies the issues.  Exxon is investing billions $$ in Guyana to develop billions of bbls of oil.  They know the world will need oil for decades more.  Not a lot of battery powered planes and not a lot of expensive 'electric' cars in the 3rd world.  But onshore frac'ing is much higher risk and the key sweet spots are all under development in US or unavailable (Marcellus shale on east coast).  It was literally only a few years ago the US produced more than Russia and was potentially self-sufficient.  But political pressure (hardly mentioned) on oil industry makes the idea of long term investment in the US and Europe un-appealing.  The market reflects the political pressure and does not lead it.  
PS: I loved how you through in the 9,000 leases undrilled talking point as if every lease ever issued has the potential to make huge amounts of oil or $$$.  Of course some percentage of leases that are issued are unattractive.  So what percentage of the issued leases in the last 10 years, a common leasing term, does 9,000 leases represent. 
Also it assumes the shift to 'renewables' is inevitable.....but ignores the suffering being imposed on the poor who cannot afford to pay for high gas prices now.  You are asking the 'poors' to hope that someday electric cars will be cheap and plentiful.Their suffering is OK if they will just go hungry for the next 20-30 years instead of paying for cheap oil.  And while you are dependent on some other government to supply you oil or gas (Russia, Opec, Iran, etc) they can have a major influence on geo-politics and may elevate global war and mayhem. 

PS Your recent video on the Lithium battery problem suggests oil might still be a better option.  The poors may never be able to afford 'cheap' electric cars unless we find major supplies of the rarest mineral to reduce the costs of manufacturing, ownership, and operation.
Finally, the advance of the gasoline automobile over the last 40 years has been amazing.  Old cars do not rust, the engines run forever, transmissions are fantastic, and outside of change in fluids and tires these machines should be around for many more years.  A new 2020 car or truck should last until 2050 and be cheap to own and operate.  It will take a government purge of these cheap vehicles to force the 'poors' to pay for the expensive replacements.  And most of the 'poors' around the world won't be able to afford this. 
Oil and Gas are not going away from primary source in your lifetime.  Look, even coal fired power plants are more common now than 10 years ago."

"We aren't at the end of oil and gas. Natural gas underpins the entire electrical grid and is the only at-scale technology that can offset solar and wind when it drops out. Now with Russia offline, the USA natural gas industry is the supplier to the world now and into the future. 

And if you think that oil and gasoline is irrelevant, I encourage you to revist the instant shutdown and panic in the Mid-Atlantic states when hackers shut down the colonial pipeline. Just one pipeline out for a few day froze that region.

I'll finish with this, aside from sunlight, most of the energy inputs in our food supply are based gas and oil. Nitrogen fertilizers are made from natural gas. Nearly all farm machines run on diesel. Nearly all transportation is powered by diesel. Food processing is powered by natural gas (electricity) and refrigeration natural gas (in storage) and diesel (during transportation)."
"@Dazura The First Sure in 20-30 years it can. The point is that this video is saying that we've already reached peak oil and gas. It's not the case. And it won't be the case for a long time. Using your nuke example, there are currently zero load following, or peak load nukes, none. Nukes in their current state don't throttle, they are base load power. The technology to make a nuclear power plant cover peak load demand (exactly the types of loads that natural gas excels at) doesn't exist and will take years to devlop. 

Replacing natural gas as feedstock to nitrogen fertilizer manufacture. An electric long haul truck. A battery powered farm tractor. A train or ship that runs on sustainable fuels. None of those things are have a prayer of coming to reality in the next decade. 

Basically the only thing we have now are a couple of US states  (TX and CA) that are getting large renewable energy inputs and personal cars that are great for in-city drives but kinda suck on the highway, aren't great in cold climates, can't haul or tow over distance. And make up about 1 in 500 cars I see on the road. We have decades before we reach net 50% let alone net zero. 

Oil and gas are here to stay for quite a while."
As stated in the video (Which you seemed to forget this): This all takes time to occur. Nuclear can easily replace natural gas and is a significantly more viable resource in the long time.
"The problem with the final minutes is that the same factors that are causing issues in the oil industry are also going to cause issues with renewables. Trade disruptions, financial uncertainty, regional instability, etc, all will make it more difficult to maintain the supply chains necessary to build solar and wind systems."
"@Tanker00v2 LCOE includes total lifetime capex and opex on a per MW basis to allow for comparison across generation types, on a lifetime cost perspective it‚Äôs more expensive is what I‚Äôm saying. The profits may be huge but it‚Äôs less than if you invested in the same capacity of solar wind or natural gas. Maybe that will change with the improvements in small modular reactors, those seem promising in certain applications, and nuclear is great in scenarios where you can capture waste heat for other processes, but on a MW per MW basis it‚Äôs simply not competitive anymore (in the US)‚Ä¶"
"@PC Heinze nuclear is expensive to build, but once it's build the profits are immense. The problem with nuclear is that it's a long term investment and rich people don't think long term.
But even then, modern nuclear power plants can be build faster than ever for a smaller cost"
"@Tanker00v2 the levelized cost of a new nuclear facility in the US is way higher than a comparable wind, solar or natural gas power plant it‚Äôs simply not competitive on a cost basis. Nuclear has some advantages like consistency of power generation but in reality it has been left behind due to reductions in the cost of wind, solar an NG."
@Michael H I think that desire is about to confront a harsh and unstable reality about two months ago.
Yeah but there is a sense in the markets that renewables will have a market while fossil fuel's profitability remains uncertain due to the increasing desire for people to transition.
It's the oil cabal I tell you. They want compensation for their lost profits in 2020
"An essay on green energy might be in need, with it becoming more and more prominent, its hard to believe eco-friendly energy sources won‚Äôt (or aren‚Äôt already) in the hands of similar mafias or subjugated to problematic states or executives.

We could have had a rail based infrastructure but the US auto and oil industries stifled public transportation development for over a century. To force us to rely on cars. Car based infrastructure is beyond stupid.

Taxes on gasoline in the Czech Republic are funny. With no taxes it would cost about 12CZK/l  (1.9 USD/gal). But taxes make it 46 CZK/l (7.4 USD/gal).
Bunch of crooks.
"OK this has major omissions. Our last president showed us we don't need other countries oil. We stopped importing it that's why price dropped like a rock. Let's not relive the gas crunch of the 70s. It was the death of muscle cars. Ask your current president why we are relying on opec again. But let's just rely on wind power. Like the people that froze in Texas when the turbines iced up and power was out in the dead of winter for days. Wind can't generate enough power to run steel mills. But used as a part of ""Green Hydrogen"" it might have value. Nothing changes till you get up and do it. Crude is not needed. Natural gas gives us synthetic oils. If we use green hydrogen, gas and heating oil are gone. Then opec can sit and spin."
ditto that and great post. many peole on you Tube were not born or for got the 1973 OPEC spanking

Well done. but depressing.
Why would anyone invest in a new rig or a pipeline just to find themselves fighting a political battle and risk being shut down. Just look at keystone XL pipeline and the banning of drilling on public land. Both taking a major blow in the first days of the Biden admin.

Oil is used for a lot more than fuel. We have heard about peak oil for 40 years now. There are no other sources for basic petrochemicals that go into every consumer product and agricultural product.
Which is why we should stop burning them. Always thought burning oils was a terrible waste of plastic
"It‚Äôs alright bro, the earth is 0.05% crust, 99.95% oil inside, we‚Äôve got a billion years left of oil lol"
"We should be conserving wherever it is practical to do so. For example, require all new cars to get at least 35 MPG highway."
"Peak oil is when no matter how many holes you drill, or energy you have fired in, you cannot get enough energy out to balance out your equations.  The USA has been at peak since 1970, nothing has changed.  Fracking did not change these equations, while they get a bit of a spurt at the start it peters really quick, they cannot pump of these wells and the cost of the wells is substantial.   However, fracking has allowed us to postpone many things, as it gave us large  energy  increase in key areas, while sucking that energy from other less important areas."
Ok but the real volume and price is in using oil as fuel. Only a fraction of oil is used for anything else.
Don't forget that those 9000 permits don't mean that all of those fields are productive and it doesn't mean that the other permits actually needed to ship the oil are in place.
"in my opinion ..i think that those oil producers are risking to completely destroy oil demand ...

Many people had been protesting for renewables even when oil was WAY CHEAPER .... but now ... renewables are actually WAY CHEAPER ...so there's not much stopping goverments from shifting away from oil ...."
Thanks for reinforcing my hatred for OPEC and oil companies in general.
It's because of that RECTUM in the white house
Interesting propaganda video.  So the meteoric rise in gasoline prices that started as soon as Biden was appointed President and declared war on the energy industry was only a coincidence?  So Wendover disagrees with the Biden ministry of truth's statements that the gasoline price increase is Putin's fault?

"This has been one of my favorite channels for a long time. I think pretty much since the beginning when you started it. I don't know what bothers me more, the fact that you got this so wrong or that I know you have to know that you got it so wrong. Which makes me wonder why you would do this?
9000 leases. OK. But what you're not pointing out is the fact that there's no guarantee there's any oil to be found on those leases. This, more than anything, is why nobody wants to lease them.
But let's say that you wanted to. Well next you have to get a permit. Permits have to be applied for to drill. You can't even test without a permit. You have to get the lease in order to test.
So, yes, our government has 9000 worthless leases that nobody wants. Then an impossible permitting process where no matter what you do, no matter how many hoops you jump through, you CAN NOT get the permits necessary. And the powers that be are blaming the OIL COMPANIES for not taking making use of the existing leases. While not opening any new ones.
Actually that's not exactly accurate. Recently they did open some. Not where the oil companies asked them too. Not in the areas where extensive testing and research has been done. But in places where the chances of finding oil and gas aren't known. But it's the same problem. You can't get the permits. And again, that's just for testing. And you need another permit to drill and then more permits...... to process and transport. And they are not giving those out.
Our government, for whatever reason, wants to kill production.
Regardless of whatever is going on in the world or how we got here that's what's happening.
I don't think anybody knows why they're doing it but one thing is for certain.
Whatever they're doing, they are doing it on purpose.
How you could not know this is beyond my understanding and I'm supremely disappointed.
It's a lack of information, exactly like this, that's going to get this Administration reelected when they shouldn't be.
For whatever reason, you have made a conscious decision to help them by covering up the truth. Not with lies, mind you, but by leaving out the important parts. Things like, whose fault it really is. Because this situation can be turned around immediately. The current Administration is not going to do that. The fact that they're willing to blame it on everybody else, while it's obviously a big part of their plan, and the only way they can get away with it is with your help. And a corrupt media. And now some woman who's been appointed by the Democrats to tell us all what the truth is. And they're getting away with it. Maybe you should do a video that predicts where this is going to land us? Forget about whose fault it is. Forget about how it happened. Just tell us where we're going and what's going to happen to us.
Because it's bad. It's going to be really bad. 
And then later, maybe you can make a video apologizing for helping them do it."
Don't call it gas! It's liquid. Call it gasoline.
"Renewables Cannot fill the gap. It's not a matter of when, but if. People don't seem to realize that electrification is overextending just to accheive what it has. When people make moral choices over profit, they are making their lives harder. And batteries are physically incapable and will never be physically capable of doing many of the most impactful jobs of a fuel. High speed and high capacity aircraft, farming equipment, long distance commercial trucking, cargo ships, concrete. These are items that make 99% of our prosperity possible. And physics will not allow them to be electrified."
"@Dazura The FirstPerhaps so, but in the 1700s no one was saying that they had to reduce their dependance on horses in anticipation of a technology that had not even been invented yet.

"As a non-American, the title confused me momentarily, my gas bill is skyrocketing and by gas I mean natural gas to heat my home, I have had to cut off my gas supply as even the standing charges are killing me."
A large reason US oil companies aren't investing in the future is because there is an anti oil/gas stance from our current government.  The 9k approved permits don't matter when oil companies are worried they will get hit with heavy restrictions and regulations in the future.  Just look at how the two major oil pipeline projects were shutdown in the first days of office of Biden.  Thousands of jobs lost in an instant.  That ruins the confidence of investors in future projects.  This video missed a large part of the reason why they are investing in now over future projects.  Renewables will win in the long run but forcing them on us by regulations will leave the US in a weaker position.  The US needs to be energy independent.

"Just as relevant is the role of the petrodollar as the currency reserve in oil markets; where that story began, how it has played out, and where it will go.

The story begins in Saudi Arabia though quickly goes global. For several decades following nothing much changes. That is until the Gulf War.

The endgame of this story more or less unofficially started with an embittered and defeated Saddam Hussein in Kuwait later announcing he would stop pricing iraqi oil in US dollars. In 2003 the United States invaded Iraq. That was followed not long after with Gaddafi refusing to send Libya's gold to the NY federal reserve for ""safe keeping"" and attempting to set up of an ""african gold dinar"" as a continental currency which Libya's oil would be priced in. 

After Gaddafi was deposed the nation's ~160 tonnes of gold went missing. I can't find an even a remotely credible source where it ended up. A large stockpile of gold also went missing in Kiev shortly after Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown during the ""revolution of dignity"" in 2014; no idea where that gold ended up either.

Since then Russia and China have been planning their moment to end US petrodollar hegemony. They seemed to pick their moment about 2-3 months ago knowing the US was already facing sustained ""non-transitory"" inflation and that invading Ukraine would throw global energy markets careening.

As a response to relieve the western prices for petroleum rising Biden solicited MBS to open up the taps on Saudi oil production. MBS unapologetically refused and shortly after announced he was in talks with Beijing to denominate Saudi oil prices not longer in dollars but in renminbi AKA yuan.

And now only several days ago India started making it's official moves to jump on the dedollarization train as well. Years and years ago this was called the ""BRICS"" agenda - Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. Though it should be noted Saudi Arabia would now make this the BRICSS LOL

When it is all formalized many other non-nuclear nations that the US government has treated poorly the past 30-40 years, like Iraq, Venezuela and Syria, will almost surely jump on board knowing China, India, and Russia can back them up with nuclear protection. 

The global order we all grew up in, spearheaded by the US winning the first Cold War with the collapse of the USSR and America being the world's only super power, is rapidly coming to an end.

A new global order is beginning. One in which the US won't stand alone but will rather will be one of about 4-5 global powers none of whom will be able to directly dictate, unilaterally, the direction of the world."

"The western nations are calling for the end of oil, not because they need to save the planet, which is the excuse but rather because they can't control the supply anymore. It is certain that if they could exercise the same control they had until the last 30 years, we would not be concern with climate changes ( changes that are not related to CO2 by the way)."

"Permits for wells in the US does not mean they can actually drill.  There are multiple layers of permits and environmental reviews, and those were frozen at the beginning of the current administration because they oppose oil.  There's also the canceling of the Keystone XL pipeline which was already being built, taking away any confidence that a company can actually use the things they invest money in without it simply being taken away by fiat."
"An outstanding analysis! My personal solution: Last year, I boughtt a plug-in hybrid car, that is a car that can run on batteries for about 30 miles and after that relies on gas. Since most of my trips are shorter than 30 miles, the mileage is excellent, right now about 114 mpg. My plug-in Prius has about the same performance as an all-gas vehicle, but slightly better handling due to the lighter engine. It takes hills quite easily; anything the electric motor can't handle, the gas engine can cover. It cost me $23,000. The average price of a new car in that year was $43,000. There is a lot of consumer resistance to this new technology, but the economic advantages are obvious and in the long run will surely prevail."

im 25 years old and for last 5 years ive been dreaming about gettting drivers license and driving a some nice and cheap TDI sedan like a wolkswagen passat or skoda octavia. Does this mean that buying and driving a fossil fuel powered cars will become even more expensive than what electric cars are now?
Great news
"Not to mention gas station company owners keep their prices high long after their cost related to making gas from oil,transportation ECT in order to cover the extra cost from when oil barrel price was so high that they lost profits so in order to make up for those lost profits and to make up for present and potentially to cover for future profits they keep prices high. Price of oil barrel could go to 5 USD today and the price per gallon will still be 6+ USD for the next years to come"
nice lie and bull crap
"@dirty possum there's always people that can afford to pay more and are willing to 
I watched an expert interview and he said this. Eventually gas companies will lower their prices gradually but they keep them inflated for a while to regain profits"
how's that gonna work when the next gas station can just undercut them. There's also big store gas stations that set a low price to attract shoppers.
Lol iTs NoT tHe WaR... did you get your talking points from the White House press office like those TikTokers did? What's the next video; how inflation isn't due to giving out a trillion dollars to a bunch of people who didn't need it while we were reaching daily stock market highs?

"11% taxes on fuel is high? 
Cries in Netherlands where tax is almost 60% of the price.. the price of Petrol could never be less than ‚Ç¨1,10 per liter, because that is the base of the carbon and sales tax on it. 
The price of oil only accounts for like 30% of the fuel price.

(The extra tax has been lowerd by about ‚Ç¨0,20 temporairly because of the high prices atm)"
"Yes, same in NZ - petrol is  around NZD2.80/litre (and there is about 55% tax in that price). We do use higher octane fuels though - the lowest octane petrol in NZ is 91 Octane (which is 'standard') and the range goes through 95, 98 and up to 100 Octane for high performance cars. NZ fuel also doesn't have ethanol in it as an octane booster the way US fuel does.
NZD2.80/l equates to USD6.80/US Gal. So from our point of view US fuel prices haven't gotten expensive, they were just previously extremely low. Even now California fuel prices are only around USD4.90/gal, looking online."
"@dorian1326 About 55-60% of gas prices is taxes, thats way to much. Goverment only know how to raise taxes on everything. Taxes for salary is about 33%."
"Well, I think that's a big reason why gas is so much more expensive in Europe vs US lol... I call it ""for no reason"", although you could argue govs might do some useful stuff with that tax revenue (I just have little faith in gov work lol). Also, similarly to what he said in the video about the CA gas, which is specially made for that state with added special taxes.

Demand for oil and oil prices are near all time highs yet the oil industry is in decline? Huh? This video starts with a conclusion and works backward trying to justify it. The video essay itself is so unstructured and spaghetti like. It's all over the place but people nod along because they like renewables.
"@music playlist If it was actually declining, demand would go down. It hasn't. As long as demand is there, the oil industry isn't in decline."

"Surprises me how the richest nation in the world citizens complain about ""expensive"" petrol prices, in reality your petrol prices are still way less than what Europe has been paying for many years. UK just now is $9.53 per gallon, so stop moaning as you guys have it ridiculously cheap...."
"That's part of the problem. Because the US has historically had cheap gas, it has developed accordingly as a country built for cars. Cities have zoning laws that separate residential and commercial areas, so people living there can't even reach a grocery store without driving. Public transport exists only within the densest of cities. There's exactly one stretch of high-speed rail, and it's less than fourty miles long, because long-distance travel is almost always by plane, and shorter distances by car.

Outside of the dense cities, it's basically impossible to live without a car in most of the US. Some streets don't even have sidewalks, because it's just inconceivable that a person would leave their home by any means other than a car - there's no-where to go to within walking distance.

And there's no reason to invest in the infrastructure to change any of this, because gas is cheap.

The US may have cheap gas, but it doesn't feel cheap when every aspect of one's life depends upon pouring some more money in the tank."

So what is California's tax percentage on oil production?
"Of course, the price of fuel also ties in with the price of everything else, hence major inflation. The UK was toying with a windfall tax for energy companies which I suspect will have two outcomes - a) all UK investment will cease with businesses moving overseas to friendlier countries and b) the cost will be clawed back through higher prices at the pumps and energy bills. Boris Johnson must have figured this out because today he axed any prospect of a windfall tax on his watch. We've also had the debate on fracking with demands for a fracking boom in the UK to counteract the cost of living crisis until nuclear and renewables become a viable alternative."
"Toying with, but it's not going anywhere. The PM has already expressly ruled it out, arguing that the tax would take away money that the companies would otherwise be spending investing in expanding production for the the future.

This ignores both the environmental impact. It also ignores that both Shell and BP have already committed to using their record profits to fund share buyback programs. But, Tories... what do you expect? They hate taxation of any sort on principle."

"0:15 yes, the gas companies PAY you to fill your tank"
"I think the perspective of ""those unwilling to switch early will pay for it"" is an incredibly privileged one, considering how expensive EVs (and new vehicles, in general) are. Buying a used gasoline car or motorcycle is vastly more affordable for working class and low income individuals; even with maintenance costs. Those maintenance costs occur over time, not immediately. So while your running costs are higher with a gasoline vehicle than an EV, the buy-in is magnitudes lower. This is, of course, if you don't use financing and loans.
It's unfair to blame and punish the poor for not being able to afford clean transportation in a country built around the car by hiking up gas prices. 

Gasoline is an example of a resource with inflexible demand for many who cannot afford to buy an EV. What are we going to do when prices increase? Not buy gas and forfeit our vital mode of transportation?

THis is coming from someone who has test ridden an electric motorcycle and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd love to switch, if I could afford to do so."

@Robert M That is a fair observation. And perhaps a strong used EV market will pop up in the future and make it more accessible to low-income individuals caught under the boot of wage stagnation.

"Great breakdown and Ive been telling people about this for a couple of months now. Basically, The high peak we saw after the first few weeks this all kicked off was the point they realised they had taken as far as they could, so the slight adjustment back to levels we have see sustained over the last few weeks will very much be the new norm. Because, we all just accept it now with little fuss. I ran the numbers on my 55mpg Ford Galaxy, where we do two tanks a month V's the cost of running an electric vehicle (even at the new high KWH) and its nearly 1/4 the cost per month. Basically, the saving would pay the majority on monthly lease on a brand new EV (lower band). So yeh, they have just accelerated their own demise but have done it on their own terms for maximum short-medium term profit."

"Plus you also save money in the long term on maintenance costs which is why a lot of cities are going over to electric buses because the maintenance costs over their lifetime is a whopping 60% lower. A gasoline engine is only 20% efficient because of all the moving parts and friction points while making a 95% efficient electric motor is child's play .... A gasoline engine is like paying someone $20/hr to do $4/hr worth of work and the ""worker"" has higher healthcare costs"
"@john jennings Depends on whether you look at vehicles as 'investments' or as the operational costs they actually are. if you work out what a vehicle, new or older, actually costs during its time with you in depreciation, repairs, servicing etc, etc, then split that down as a monthly cost. As well as the fact almost all new cars (in the UK) come with 5 years warranty, you factor in leasing a new car has no costs other than tyres and servicing for period of the lease. So you can get trouble free motoring and a new car every 4 years for not much more then, or sometimes cheaper (deals) than buying something new or paying cash for an older vehicle."

"Pretty darn good video, however, you left out some very important political implications. Under the Trump administration, drilling permits on public land, and especially the Keystone XL pipeline were given the green light. This partially caused gasoline prices to dip below $2 near the end of 2019.

Hwever, once the crap show that was 2020 came about, and the Biden administration took power at the end of the year/start of 2021, they undid a lot of the petrol-positive policies of the Trump administration.

Whether or not you think that's a good thing, it cannot be overlooked. Also, the US is sitting on literally TRILLIONS of natural resources, including oil, in Alaska alone. The world is not running out of oil as fast as this and others make it out to be. Will we run out one day? Absolutely. Is it imminent? Not if we change the corporate and governmental regulations and corruption that exist."
"@Robert M while that's true, an increase in supply would, theoretically, lower prices. Especially a significant increase in supply if the Keystone pipeline could be greenlit again and completed too."

Oil is slowly transitioning from a product primarily for transportation to a product primarily for manufacturing.  I can see that by 2100 well over 50% of the oil consumption will be used to manufacture goods and only a fraction would be for fuel.  Oil companies will continue being big and important companies  but they won't be as big and they won't be energy companies anymore.
@Huzeyfe KILI√á pretty much. We already use gasoline/naphtha for much plastic.
"@Tyler Nelson I see. I stand corrected. So we can refine most of the oil, with an additional cost, to plastic?"
@Huzeyfe KILI√á you can definitely convert all the oil into polymers. PetroChemical companies and refineries have been breaking down (cracking) crude into plastic feedstocks (olefins) for decades. It just becomes very energy intensive as you get to the heavier cuts of the crude.
"@Blanco Oh yeah, forgot about electric train lines in Europe, I guess that's not really the same problem for trains then - transitioning less frequently used infrastructure is not going to happen fast. I personaly think these trains won't transition at all and will just disappear when autonomous electric trucks are a thing. Trucks haven't really started transitioning - the big problem with them is that these big diesel engines are actually quite efficient for what they are doing. The only thing that will make it worth it to transition is autonomy."
"That is not how refining oil works. You can't just refine all of the oil into plastics. Oil is like a mixture, not a raw material."

"Just vote republican. Gas at U.S. pumps was $1.85 when Bush was sworn in for his second term in January 2005 and $1.84¬†¬† Gas prices during the Obama-Biden administration were $5.49 a gallon. Trump administration was about $2.50 per gallon. North America, the average price of a gallon in the United States hit a seven-year high this month at $4.30 per gallon."
That's an almost impressive level of mental gymnastics. Lowest to highest to lowest to highest.
"OOOhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... gasoline.... not gas, like, natural gas... forgot Americans use 'gas' to mean 'gasoline', proper confused me!"
"Being from the Permian Basin maybe I can expand on a few things? One of the biggest pushes in oil companies in the US is to reduce the cost and environmental impact of Fracking, as it would drastically increase their ability to compete with foreign producers. Another is largely out of their control, as drilling wells often leads to the production of a lot of natural gas that they would of course like to sell, but because much of this gas is a very heavy mix of hydrocarbons it's an expensive process to try and sell it without separating it into things like propane and methane. The technology exists to do so on site, but because of the natural gas market there's no real way for them to do it and make anything even close to a profit so most companies flare it instead. That said we have our booms and busts every couple of years, but we're still chugging along without too much issue, and I don't expect oil to go away any time soon. 

But is fun hearing my home mentioned in a Wendover video! As well as hearing about how we're basically racing and competing with some people on the other side of the planet haha, something I don't hear many people talk about."

Are fracking companies held accountable for the ruin they cause communities around them? I mean doesn't it ruin water quality and farming land around them? E: Oh yeah the bigger companies also cause it without having to pay anything for it. Good for them.
"It definitely can. From the reading I've done, a properly built and maintained well will never contaminate the water supply. The problem is that a lot of corner cutting is done and the waste of hydraulic fracking can just be discharged back into a disposal well which might not be constructed properly and could leak into the water table. Outside of that, federal regulation is pretty strict in making sure fracking waste doesn't just get discharged into the surface water supply without treatment. One source I've seen said that 60% of all fracking waste is treated and discharged, while 30% is reused and only 10% is put in disposal wells. It's entirely possible this source is wrong too, so do take that information with a grain of salt.

I think a lot of the fear concerning hydraulic fracking is misplaced and caused by a lack of information/quality information. We certainly don't quite understand the long term geologic consequences of the practice, but afaik, the short term is relatively well understood.

As for being held accountable, I'm not sure. I'll bet that fines are a pretty big part of it, but fines can look like a slap on the wrist from the outside observer. What would you like to see happen to increase accountability?"
Scarcity of fossil fuels makes renewables more attractive economically.

"I think you over estimate the rationality of current actions.  In particular, your so-called ""renewables"" are better termed ""interruptables"" because they burn through capital just like any other form of creating energy.  We don't yet have a cost-effective solution to storage, but we continue to pivot towards electrification.  The west is attempting to cut back on coal usage, while China and India continue to increase consumption.  I have complete confidence in that the economy could collapse sufficiently to make gasoline affordable again or that government policies and strategies could cause acute energy shortages."

"2 words, Joe Biden"
Anyone who likes cars need Porsche to pull through‚Ä¶ but at the end of the day even if we are not combusting oil we will most likely still need it for certain industries as a lubricant

The US has some of the lowest taxes in the world for a modern western country
But the sticker at the gas station told me Biden did the gas prices???? What do you mean there's a very complex and in-depth reason to it??
It's so misleading that americans call refined oil gas. I was hoping to hear about the gas we use in Europe

"Implying that climate change ""will lead to the destruction of the planet"" is very alarmist and inaccurate, Sam.

Stop lying."
Maybe I should cancel that diesel truck I ordered.
"Diesel surprisingly is actually cleaner than gasoline engines, and, if i remember correctly, newer diesel engines have increased efficiency with the same amount of fuel compared to gasoline cars, while having significantly reduced carbon outputs."

"I like how he's talking about renewables as if we're anywhere near making even 10% of our transport renewable-fueled. Crucial rare earth deposits are under China's control, you think everyone's going to afford switching to electric cars?

You make good videos but that climate change you mention at the end is fake
"‚Äã@Generic Joe in the way that it's destroying the planet or harming it. Or that it even exists to the extent that's being reported by ""experts"""
How?
"Why are those 9000 permits not being used? Is it because there is no oil there?
You say there is no appetite to reinvest, when prices are very high; seems to defy logic as higher prices would increase the appetite to produce more or reinvest.
Or are you part of the ""progressive"" democratic elites gaslighting the American people with their narrative. Even doing this unknowingly is wrong, but forgivable; excluding your failure to address the elephant in the room directly, Why are those 9,000 permits unused?

How about no more new permits being issued as per Executive Orders issued out in Biden's first few months in office? How does that play a role? Why was the USA energy independent from the world during Trump, but now under Biden ""it's a global market"" is the claim made to deflect the issue as if the USA cannot effect the global market.

No one wants to invest in oil. Could it be about the new social credit score, ESG instituted by the top lenders? Burning oil goes directly against this.

Renewables are not yet here! They are 10 or so years away from being mass marketable. A 50kWh battery weighs about 400 pounds that Bosch set. It is not there yet. This is NOT viable in aviation. But what about cars? Cost is the biggest factor here, 60k vs 15k. Let alone the great increase of strain on the USA electrical grid which is already antiquated due to neglect, partly due to these renewable government initiatives forcing electric companies to spend on them rather than upkeep. (California fires)

The crash in the market was designed to bring in ""The New World Order"" by force ... from the top down. This is destructive towards a flourishing humanity which builds from the people up."
"To those who laughingly blamed Biden, don't let a little thing like FACTS here get in your way of continuing to repeat your silly disinformation.  Keep up the good fight, idiots!"
Question why do we have to buy oil from other countries? The US is one of the biggest producers of oil why can‚Äôt we use that oil to sell to citizens then sell the rest to others?
@Vyl Bird Not only that but it is also a geopolitical move. We sit on massive oil reserves and if I remember correctly the US decided after WW2 to conserve our resources in the event of another large scale war. That way we would have the resources we need to fuel our war machine.
"Oil isn't just one product. It's a chemical mix - oil from different fields is different in composition, it needs different refinery designs and provides different products. It's common for a country to be both an oil importer and exporter, because they are exporting one type of oil while importing another. That's exactly what the US does."
"Most of USA are not suitable to refine good gas. We need more low viscosity oil, but there are in fewer places as time runs"
While I what in college one of my professors actually had a PhD in renewables. Liquid fuels are not going away. Aviation and long distance transport can not go electric. There will always be liquid fueled cars just most would rent them or only use them for road trips.
WAIT!  WHAT?  It's not Biden's fault?  Idiots heads EXPLODE.   Lul.
So when are we running out of Oil? Also make a video that shows the bullshit in California that says no new cars for sale in 2030 that are gas powered when there is no equivalent alternative.

If you‚Äôve reached the pinnacle of your career and are currently struggling, you might need to find a new profession or get accustomed to working multiple jobs."
Love this channel
"LOL, oil companies are digging their own grave by pushing people into electric today, rather than making ICE vehicles the cheapest option. As was said... they care about today, not tomorrow."
What makes it worse is that Americans have no alternative but to buy this pricey gas instead of taking public transport or ride a bicycle.
"The anti-oil bunch never discusses that a barrel of oil makes more than just gasoline and diesel. Now 55% a barrel of oil produces other stuff needed in life for food, healthcare, construction, manufacturing, etc.  What do we do with the remaining 45% of a barrel of oil which is gasoline when gasoline is reduced or banned? In the old days, gasoline wasn't needed so refiners dumped the gasoline part of refining into rivers."
"Let's lube our machinery with different stuff then.

But honestly, it's more about the scale of it. We don't need to abandon production of oil, it's a good resource. Just maybe don't use it for the most common mode of transportation across the entire globe, you know."
"Literally anything other than burning it, is the idea."
WAR can only run by oil ... And so can long distance  flights... THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE.. Calling an end to it is complete bull... Who had control on oil wins the war

"I have known for years that part of the price of fuels (I've guessed was 20-35% depending on circumstance) was ""speculation"". Now I know where that speculation comes from and that OFFER IS OFTEN MANIPULATED no matter what the product is (that's why I don't believe ANY sales figures reports anymore as they're seriously manipulated).

Now I KNOW the crisis would last AT LEAST UNTIL 2030 (have heard that number before). Prepare yourselves for the LONG AND BUMPY RIDE.

Thanks, Sam, for clearing this out. You and your research people are üëÄEYE OPENERS."
@mindbr0ken it's just going to continue to get worse fren. Republican and Democrats are just 2 sides of the same coin. Could you elaborate what it was specifically that Trump did to ease prices though?
"@nacanacoo it doesn't take a scientist to look back at the start of the Obama administration. Gas prices spiked during his terms. Only when trump got into office did oil prices drop. Democrats do not like oil, gas etc. It's not hard to predict what we're gonna see in the future."
No you didn't. You're making that up
Long story short?
"There's no such thing as frac rigs.  It's such a pet peeve as someone who has worked in oil and gas for almost a decade, including several years in frac. Every rig shown in the video is drilling. Frac is a completely different process and it was not shown once in the video. Other then that great video."
"@SheLovesDeku no it's really not. They are completely different processes with different equipment and different companies. It's like going to a building under construction and talking about electrician's and what they do, but only showing carpenters and wood. They both go into making a building, but very very different."
You‚Äôre really splitting hairs here
"It's very telling how the mainstream media treated and depicted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein then, and how it portrays Neo-Bolshevik Russia's dictator Vladimir Putin now? It just tells you that Hussein and Putin belong to different camps, and that the Western plutocracies have no particular aversion for Russian Bolshevism which wants to ""deNatify"" Nationalistic Ukraine, or ""Nazi Ukraine"" for short, as they call it."
But all those stickers on them gas pumps say it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs fault! Lol
who else thought he is going to talk about actual gas? Calling liquid a 'gas' is nonsensical. But Murica
"this is true but only in the western world.

China is securing long term supply of fossil fuels, india is trying the same. renewables as we know them won't ever fuel the world biggest economies because it is practically impossible. The countries that adopt ""renewables"" energies will just lose all their industry and slowly stop to be the center of the world economy. The only renewable energy that has a future is nuclear power and the ""climate concerned world"" (the west) is just realizing that the people de most concerned about climate change are the ones who destroyed/are destroying the best (and only) solution.

As to why, i would point to shear stupidity and a big part of them are just marxists -> they think it is the way to make marx's ""capitalism crisis"" finally happend."
This is a great explanation - And I know a lot of people are annoyed at high gas prices but I see it as a fantastic change all things considered.
"Azerbaijan, not Azerbaijen"
"Another bullshit video from a leftist.   Biden cut the leases, prices went up, just like Obama.   Good grief."
11% tax? Where I live about 65% of the total price per liter is tax
IMO 2020 which requires far more refining of fuel used in all those ships backed up at the ports for the last two years also plays a big role.  Shipping industry fuel requirements became much more strict and costly just as Covid drove a huge increase in shipping demand.
"So for all these electric vehicles and such, what are we going to use for lubrication? If oil does get phased out, are we stuck with lithium and graphite based greases? Petroleum I think will be here to stay, just not as prevalent."
"It is possible to manufacture hydrocarbon lubricants from plant stock, it just costs more than refining them from oil. You can make some plastics that way too."
We know why prices are so high its nothing they say it is... Russias exports only make up 3% theirs no reason for gas to be where it is... they're trying to force another recession
"--time to buy a tesla, no gas required"
Yeah before Biden took office America was energy independent. Biden shut that down so we would have to import oil. That's the truth and can't be denied. So far he's been doing his best to destroy the economy. He's doing a great job at that. Housing market is coming up next along with car repossessions from being financed for way to long. They'll be worn out and people will still owe thousands on them. No political views here either way both sides are just as corrupt and the people are paying the price

Also consider the US is giving Ukraine 33 Billion for defense and the US collects over 4 Trillion in tax revenues.

The similar process happens where that oil that would be going through pipeline is going by train currently.

"What is gonna be interesting is the social consequences of high gas prices. Since, electric transit simply isn't viable for rural folk, and we aren't willing to take a cut in our standard of living by paying more for transportation costs without very good reason. What this means is more push politically for a political party that supports oil companies, and will trend towards either a fossil fuel friendly political system winning by election or a resolution of force to install one when politics breaks down."
"@Vyl Bird I mean, the thing is, that second candidate will enact laws and rules and add new mechanisms to laws that exist that will benefit his constituency, and there won't be a crisis from his constituency's perspective, since the crisis that was occurring or was going to occur was solved by the politician's actions. The politician they elected to solve their problems."
"Quite possible.

If one candidate says, ""There is a crisis, and the only way to solve it is at your own expense and convenience,"" and the other candidate says, ""Ignore that, trust me, everything is fine,"" then people will keep voting for the second - even as the crisis starts to overtake them."
"@James Garrard I mean, it will really only continue to sink if a reliable alternative to gasoline for long distance personal transportation can be found, since otherwise, there is always going to be political incentive for a fossil fuel friendly political party to exist; for the reason stated above. A lot of people do not like living in cities or urban environments, and rural communities live and die by the gasoline price."
But the oil market will continue to shrink anyways making the whole effort of putting politicians and monetary incentives for gasoline self-defeating. It'll continue to cost states moreand more money to maintain until the whole thing bottoms out. Many southern states are already seeing these effects which is why they are cash flow negative.
For global fuel prices this is was correct not really for the US
Why are we even still using fossil fuels
Simple OPEC are totally controlling the market more than usual because in their eyes they lost a lot of money during covid and have the right and ability to keep prices high until it suits them. Its just that the war is a great excuse for them so they say 'oh dear we cant make up the loss of Russian oil supplies'  which is a lie they are loving....
"Although the quality of the video is high partly to justify the advertisement of a new ""superthing"" at the end, this is still an amazing, amazing, video. Well done - will probably show this to my 13-year old to provide visual information of how gasoline is ""made"". By the way, I was in Baku, Azerbaijan in early 2000s for two weeks, flying AirBaltic from my capital - the first thing I noticed when I exited the plane was the smell of petrol products in the air everywhere, now I have hundreds of pictures with oil fields. Amazing country - too bad they cannot find a lasting peace regarding Nagorniy Karabakh. Greetings from Latvia."
The peace is inevitable at this points but it comes at the cost of ethnic cleansing and displacement
Joe Biden stopped American companies from drilling our own oil. This is the price of ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù policies.
Do you have a source for this?
"""persuasion theory"". This looks pretty gross"
"0:14 Ah yes. I remember that day, I filled up my car and the guy at the gas station gave me 60$."
So Wendover Productions are saying they are manipulating us?
This is absolute 100% propaganda. The cost of gas is high due to the cost of oil being high. Oil is a global commodity. The cost is up due to concerns for future ability to obtain product. Biden and the Dems ran on the promise of raising the cost of energy and the destruction of our energy companies. This all secondary to concerns about carbon in the atmosphere which is foolish.
"Heavy longer chain hydrocarbons (750 degrees F), inherently useful stuff. Shorter chain ones, fossil fuels and explosive stuff."
"Uncle Joey told me it's putins fault. You forgot to say that. Now you may get canceled by the left, and your channel may be shadow banned for misinformation üò≤"

"gasOLINE or gas?  There are price problems for both, but they're not the same."
The reason is 100% Joe Biden and the creepy tyrant democrats. They have destroyed the strongest economy the world has ever seen in a matter of one year. Government intervention is regulation is without question the reason of oil prices and inflation as a whole.
How was there no mention of airplanes?
"If the end of oil is near, everybody better start planning and planting, because renewables are a complete scam.  We'll freeze and starve to death if we rely totally on renewables.  Modern society can not continue as it is without cheap abundant energy, which renewables will never be neither.  Renewables can be a supplement of sorts, but never will be the dominant form of energy in the world."

"The West‚Äôs mistake after the 1970s‚Äô energy crisis was to allow ourselves to remain dependent on imported fossil fuels.  It didn‚Äôt have to be that way.  We could have innovated on both the production front, but also innovated on reducing demand within the West.  We should have been working to become independent, if not a fossil fuels exporter using it to wield international soft power in the name of spreading freedom and democracy.  Instead we got high on our own supply, AND imported more supply on top of that."
"@PhysicsGamer It was possible.  We didn't build every possible hydro-electric dam around the Western world.  We could have had a better debate about nuclear power.  We could have been more honest with ourselves about the geopolitical and environmental ramifications of NOT doing more hydro and more nuclear, rather than the NIMBY discussions of people who didn't nuclear, or were worried about the environmental implications of dams in specific locations (ignoring the environmental devastation from using other forms of electricity generation instead), and the geopolitical power we were ceding to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Russia, etc.  We could have switched more homes from oil and gas to electric heating (especially heat pumps).   We could have taken the billions (trillions?) spent on foreign wars in oil rich nations, and instead invested that money in interest free loans for homes and businesses to put solar on their roofs (in the low interest rate environment we've had for the last several decades, that would have been virtually cost-free to government once those loans were repaid).  We could have embraced electric cars at an earlier point, and ignored industry pushback against them.  We could have reduced the West's reliance on fossil fuels so much that, instead of fighting wars and attempting regime change in Asia, and Africa, in South America, etc., the West could have used that soft power we developed from being an exporter of fossil fuels and used that power to fight for democratic change around the world.  Not to mention the immense number of jobs we would have created through building dams, nuclear reactors, energy storage systems, and so much more."
"@Steven Hurdle Then in what world would that have been possible, especially with 1980s-2000s tech? ""The West"" consumes a ton of oil, and used to consume a far greater share of it - the only way for it to be ""collectively a net exporter"" would be to add non-""West"" countries to ""the West""."
"@PhysicsGamer And Canada and Norway (among other examples) have been fossil fuels exporters for far longer than that.  But re-read my comment, I said ""the West"", not the U.S.  The Western World is not collectively a net exporter of fossil fuels.  And the error of our ways has been laid bare by the war in Ukraine."
We've BEEN a fossil fuel exporter for years and years. Since Obama.
"GREED, that's why it's just pure greed. 
The government won't intervene as the higher the price, the more tax they get."
"The price of oil and many other commodities are all a result of the post Covid era of finding an excuse to produce less material and charge twice as much for it, reeling in record profits.  Aluminum, steel, its all the same, these companies initially were working less because of Covid, and then realized they didn't need to work more to make insane profits, and are incentivized now to make less so they can profit.  
There is a chip shortage, in theory due to slashed orders by OEMs, in practice not.  The re-orders had more than enough time to be delivered but plants are still slow, steel and aluminum are being used less because of it.  This is a pretty dangerous era of massive corporations controlling production and pricing and its only getting worse, their failures cost us, and their success lines their CEO's pockets."
Good lord  in sweden there is a 60% tax on petrolium
Someones gotta pay for those welfare programs lol.
Sounds like the best move for the typical consumer is to just step away from oil.  Solar panels and electric cars.
The upfront investment costs and delayed returns on that investment still lock most people out of those options.
"What's your source for $20 average production price of oil in the US? To my knowledge, it is higher than $50."
"Top tier shale producers EOG and Devon have cited $30 and $33 per bbl, respectively, as being able to cover their debt and CAPEX programs, so I would say mid $30's is a common breakeven for shale.  That is the break even point, so that number is composed of more than just production; it also includes paying taxes and land owners, as well as G&A, and marketing costs.  So it is probably fair to say production costs could be closer to $20/bbl."
uh what 50 dollars is what off land production costs
I figured this was the case I'm glad you confirmed my theory
'saboteurs' HMMMMMMMMMM
A $5billion pipeline?  Meanwhile Canada is blowing $20billion on one.
"most of Canada export are Oil from Alberta, the made Trillions on oil exports"
so they're milking us for money. nice.
If you bought a long back then the money you are making now is rediculous
"There are a lot of things we can do to get beyond oil.  Say you buy a $300K house.  Invest 7% ($21K) in a solar system, another $5% ($15K) to make a LEED house that uses very little or no energy.  In that $15K solar you can charge your EV (like having free gasoline), run your house electricity for electric stoves and other appliances, other electronics, and on certain days have excess electricity to sell to the grid.  So if your EV is fully charged, your house batteries are fully charged, then you can sell most of your electricity to the grid for a profit.  Also remember EVs require very little maintenance, so there is money to be saved there as while.  Your payback for the additional $36K does not take long.  Did I mention that EVs within the next few years will be cheaper to build than gasoline vehicles?

However...there will still be a need for petroleum, but at a much reduced level.  Just like the EV revolution, bioengineered plastics will replace petroleum based plastics.  Short distance aircraft (say 250 mile) can be powered by electricity.  Long distance aircraft can be powered by bio-kerosene which is a carbon neutral fuel.  Fertilizers based on petroleum will still be needed, but the U.S. is destroying aquifers which have NEVER been brought back to life once they are polluted by over fertilization.  Plants can be bioengineered to grow with less fertilizer.

As far as carbon buildup in the atmosphere, the cheapest thing a homeowner for their power bill can do is to have a roof that is a white.  There is so much savings there that the DoD has been painting roofs on buildings for years."
You don't even have to watch this video to know the answer. The answer is pure and simple it's greed.
"No this doesn't make sense, Tucker said on Fox News that this is Bidens fault. For some reason worlds increase of gas/oil price is Biden fault. He hasn't provided any evidence for the claim, but this is Fox News. Evidence isn't required."
"One alternate interpretation of the same data: over the last 3-5 years, there have been massive increases in commitments on climate change such as the gasoline car sale bans by 2030.  This could change how willing they are to invest based upon 20 year outlays...."
Let‚Äôs all be honest‚Ä¶ fjb
Ugh love the government making EVs mandatory but not establishing battery repair regulations so that EV makers don‚Äôt abuse their customers with repairs.
I am NEVER giving up my gasoline car! It‚Äôs bogus!
@Critical Event At the pump. That should have been blatantly obvious
"@Jordan Broly GS Except we aren't paying the same.  The last time oil was $110 a barrel was in 2013, when gas was 67% cheaper than it is right now.  We are being conned.  This is not inflation, it's price gouging."
Thanks for the information my parents thought oil price got high cuz of the war ;-;
Renewables are taking over but many have also gone bankrupt that are government funded. Until you get majority of people on board you are not the driving force.
$5.5b to uncouple a large portion of your economy from Russia and OPEC control sounds like a bargain.  That's less than building a handful of major sport arenas or hosting the olympics or other stupid sport things countries do.

"This was a pretty good analysis and history of oil volatility, but I'd be cautious about the final conclusion and more than cautious about prediction drawn from that conclusion. Two factors not mentioned in this video or anywhere I've seen in the comment section are:

1. The oil industry, like everyone else, has been affected by general supply chain issues and inflation, which has driven up the price of tapping new wells. Effectively this makes supply expansion at the moment more costly than it otherwise would be.

2. Oil companies also took on a ton of debt in the last two years, so increasing profits to both pay that down and pay shareholders is a higher priority for them at the moment, rather than expansion.

Neither of those factors are small, and they both point to the current situation being a temporary recovery from the pandemic. I'm not saying this video is wrong and we will definitely go back to the old way, but trying to predict the future of the oil market is risky business. Nobody knows what's going to happen, and the incentives guiding today's market can change in unexpected ways tomorrow."

Biden's war on oil is the reason prices have doubled since he came into office.  We will need oil long after your kids are dead.   Everything in the store is made out of it.
@Shane Davison That's not true at all. The only thing that would hold up the leases are either environmental studies or lawsuits by local governments. Not to mention you can't go from 0 oil demand with negative oil prices during a global pandemic back to normal demand and expect gas prices to stay the same.
"What war? There are 9,000 leases ready to go."
Did you get your talking points straight from the Biden admin? You say there's 9000 approved permits as if that's the only thing oil producers need to get started. 1) Only a fraction of those will pan out after surveys and tests are complete. 2) Environmental impacts need to be done and the alphabet soups are dragging their feet on those. 3) Why would any oil producer in the U.S. invest billions of dollars into drilling with an openly and gleefully hostile administration/legislature waiting to shut them down with any slice of GND they can manage to pass?

The pipeline Biden closed?
@logitech4873 If it had opened would it have lowered the fuel prices? answer is yes.  There was an expectation of a surplus of oil based upon the pipeline opening. We are all worse off because Biden shut the pipelines down and that is a fact.  Oil and fuel are considered to be the same thing.
"@MrLegendra The Keystone XL pipeline was never opened. There was no reduction.
Fuel prices have increased independently from oil prices."
"@logitech4873 In a long term economic trajectory, a substantial decrease in the expected supply of a good leads to an increase in price of that good. Closure of the pipeline caused a significant reduction in US oil supply from Canada leading us to source oil from OPEC, who charge higher prices for oil. The higher prices are then passed on to the consumer."
@MrLegendra Do you think the closure of the Keystone XL pipeline increased fuel prices?

Not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, just potentially a bad thing for me."

Same in the ag industry. Ag electric tractors are the worst in my personal experience with too much down time to be a reasonable fuel source.
"@noredcr That is probably the most likely long term solution. I recently read an article in Flying Magazine which noted that the price and supply gap between kerosene and synthetic aviation fuels (including bio fuels) is shrinking. While switching fuel types is difficult and expensive to certify and install, as many people have noted above, it is far more likely to actually happen than hydrogen. 

I‚Äôve done some more research since my original post, which appears to indicate that business travel is continuing to recover from pre-pandemic levels. Since business travel is less price sensitive than leisure travel, rising fuel prices should cause less of an overall impact on air travel, and therefore pilot demand. Plus right now leisure travel demand is crazy high, I just don‚Äôt know what it will look like over the next 2 years. 

Wow, I never thought I would post a comment and get over 300 replies! Thank you everyone for the great responses.

"""Renewables are taking over.""

This meme needs to die, it is a hopeless fantasy. Renewables are not taking over and the idea that they will is a theory unbacked by real world evidence. Germany for example is no less dependant on fossil than it has ever been. Fossil fuels are still 84% of our energy supply and that has not changed in decades, renewables are just a decedent fig leaf for more of the same except this time more expensive. They simply don't have the energy density to compete.

Worse, it is a distraction from the only clean energy source that has the energy density to compete, nuclear power. Nuclear is the only way to tilt the scales against the fossil fuel industry, anything else will just mean more of the same."
"You forget - many people are so stupid they actually believe the US President can wake up and say to themselves "" Hey, I think I'll mess with the voters today and raise the price of gas"".

"To summarize, holding customers hostage by intentionally shorting the supply only works because the upfront investment costs into new production capacities are extremely high. 

In most industries you'd get new players even on a sinking ship but with the amount of investment that would be needed to alter the market in the oil industry it's just not worth it currently and quite frankly it might never be again so everyone is just riding it out into the sunset. 

Which probably is a good thing, the higher the oil price is, the more investments will be diverted into alternative energy sources."
"In the medium term, governments will still support the oil industry. As much as people cry about the current US admin. They are still very pro oil and gas, just not deleriously so. I work in the industry and people who claim the government are hostile to oil and gas are smoking crack.

The drive to electrification of consumer cars is probably unstoppable now. But the governments main part in that was done under Obama with their green loans to Tesla. Now it's done and the US is the globally dominant EV player, it's basically wait ten years.

Diesel demand is probably going to be critical at least 20 more years. While it's critical, the governments of the world will make sure the oil flows, while smart ones are funding alternatives."
"A good thing if you can afford to drop 40k on an EV, bad if youre already struggling to make ends meet with rising rent and food costs. We dont have the infrastructure to shift yet and the more we force it on the short term the more we fuck over the working class, this price gouging for profit is not righteous and nuclear is the only viable alternative for fossil fuels in this decade"
"Alternative energy sources do not work. Renewables are unfortunately not the answer. The United Nations have decided to adopt zero carbon and this means oil, Gas and coal are being phased out in theory. It is the closure of oil, Gas and coal manufacturing under Biden and the European Union along with the attack on nuclear energy for example in Germany that has created shortages in energy supplies. Coupling this with the desire for cutting government debt through inflation we see the present energy crisis. None of this is accidental. Raising energy prices means raising prices throughout the economy which means debt reduction in real terms."
But oil and gas is the driving force of energy transition and reducing the oil production means delaying decarbonisation on a global scale.

Gas will go down, otherwise governments will get voted out and the new governments will change the policies. Will be interesting to see what green europe does as they have off shored hydrocarbon production to russia et al."

"Well, accidentally the minus oil price in history came at the time when Russia annexed Crimea and US started to give them with a more progressive sanctions to hurt their economy. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia want to attack Yemen and need a green light from the west. And so suddenly oil prices goes plummeting and 'accidentally' support US sanctions against Russia."
"I don't think high prices are here to stay like you said. People have said this in the 70s, 2008, 2012, etc when prices have spiked. It's a supply and demand product and supply will come back to meet demand one way or another, there's just too much money to be left on the table not to."

"""The end of oil is near"" BS. Do you have any comprehension of the ways oil is used that aren't anywhere near having a ""green"" alternative? No adults alive today are likely to see the end of oil."
"A lot of people are making grand moralizing statements about ""greed"" and ""price fixing"", but look at these decisions made by the owners of big oil as they are. 

They are making the calculated decision to move their money out of fossil fuels, and aren't investing in its future by trying to compete with OPEC. This is decreasing production, which is causing supply to drop and prices to go up. The high prices will shrink the demand for oil and of course, the size of the oil fuel industry. This will hurt ordinary people hard in the short term, but incentivize non-oil alternatives.

My family, we switched from oil heating of our home and water to electric, and are very happy that we've done so. People are right now fighting to work from home, partly because working in an office is a big waste of gas. This progress is going to happen faster now, and it's because oil is bad business."
One of the best explainers I‚Äôve seen on the current oil markets! Keep up the great work!
Gas means natural gas. Cars run on petrol.
Some cars and large vehicles (city Bus and delivery trucks)  run on CNG-compressed natural gas.   but not many
Interesting! I was about to buy a car and now I'm re considering going for an EV...
"Wendover: evidence shows high gasoline prices are the result of industry-controlled supply and demand coupled with fewer people investing in a doomed industry.
GOP: bIdEn. gOt iT."
"Big oil is shooting themselves in the foot because when the gas prices doubled or tripled, electric vehicles are looking more and more appealing. When gas was under 3 dollars a gallon, driving a big car wasn't a big deal, but now that it is 6.30 a gallon, electric cars and more efficient econoboxes are looking pretty good right now."
"@Pablo Picaro yeah, but if this pricing goes on for a year or two, many people, if they can afford, will be seriously thinking about an electric or hybrid vehichle"
"very slow transition, there are over 1 billion gasoline vehicles in the world, and only a couple million EV"
"One interesting  thing i have head is that some of the big oil companies in Houston have been buying up leases and old depleted wells off the Houston coast, like 20-30 miles offshore.  Most likely not to drill again, but to use the already in place pipelines and pump CO2 back in to the ground from the refiners and power plants in that area, Im sure in the coming years there will be a higher CO2 tax that will be in place and incentives companies to do this."
"Way smarter to build vertical farms and use the CO¬≤ as fertilizer. The amount of productivity you can get when you have perfect control over light, moisture, pests and atmosphere is insane.

"So in summary, the negative oil prices were caused by a drunk trader buying delivered futures and then having to find a place to sell his huge order before it was due to be delivered, and the petroleum price hike is caused by the negative price debacle.

Keep telling yourself that.
"Why did Schr√∂der support Russia and Gazprom instead of Ukraine? Ukraine has the huge Yuzivska shale gas deposit in the Donbas (1.09 - 4 trillion metric metres of shale gas) - the second-largest shale gas deposit in Europe. The EU was interested in buying gas from Ukraine in order to diversify its suppliers and cut dependence on Russian gas. Ukraine has extensive gas storage facilities and pipelines, close to the EU, and such an arrangement would make a large dent in Gazprom's (Putin's) profits. Similarly, Crimea has large offshore gas deposits that Putin wanted.  This war is all about Putin's Gazprom profits.  That's why they are pulling back to defend Donbas. That's why Russia was funding the ‚Äúseparatists"". It¬¥s a staggering mistake that the EU didn¬¥t buy gas from Ukraine rather than Russia. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der is to blame for this. A German politician on the board of Russian state-owned Gazprom is treason that needs to be investigated. Ukraine winning the war is a win-win. The $220 million energy payments that the EU pays to Russia every day, can be paid to Ukraine for investing in the rebuilding of the new, stronger, democratic, NATO and EU member Ukraine! Despite dark times - I¬¥m convinced the future for Europe and Ukraine is bright!!!"

"Video is good, SD is key issue. But leaves other key parts. The 9000 wells is a misnomer.  2,200 of those leases are held up in litigation and cannot proceed in any form until litigation is complete (could be years).  Second, lease does not equal enough oil for viable project. Companies often obtain leases for land which is believed to have reserves, lease utilization rate will be never be 100% or close to it. Third, you can hold a lease but if infrastructure is lacking such as a pipeline or roads, those gotta be built, those require additional investment and permits.  On the topic of permits, you much have an environmental assessment approved as well as a drilling permit. A large number of those 9,000 leases have requested associated drilling and EA permits.

Also, unless we can make a breakthrough in battery technology - renewables simply aren‚Äôt going to work on the majority of the inhabited surface of the planet.

Solar panels can make a lot of sense in sunny Colorado. But they‚Äôre not even going to save enough energy on a house in Pennsylvania to make up for the carbon cost of producing the panels.

Hydro only works in certain areas - like inhabited Canada. But not in a lot of other places.

Wind is fine in the Midwest, but pointless in much of France."
"@Ryuukei's Sci Fi Productions nuclear cost issues are more than partial due to regulations.  Regulations that made the Watts Bar plant (the most modern commercial plant in the US) retain its use of 1970s technology and equipment as opposed to update to modern items due to recertification.

The reason for the perception of solar perlifaration is high power cost in those regions its big in (CA, and New England), while in areas of cheap power there is almost no solar/wind (TVA controlled regions).  Nevermind the short lifespan of solar."
"@bowez9 Wrong, Nuclear's biggest problem is corporations and countries not wanting to spend the big upfront costs on nuclear power. Too many of todays corporations are too focused on short sighted profits over long term investments and nuclear power plants are very large, and very expensive to build. So much so that they can only be built with government assistance, and again, too may politicians, both republican and Democrat, care far more about their next reelection than a long term investment like a nuclear plant. this is despite the fact that over long term, Nuke plants are far more profitable than Fossil fuel plants. 

This is not helped by the fact that Fossil Fuel's as the establishment industry, are notoriously protectionist and are quite happy to bribe and lobby governments to keep themselves in power. Coal would already be dead by now if they didn't use their lobbying power to keep themselves alive, and they would have been killed by, Oil and Natural gas. 

Oh and guess which industries throw the biggest lobby at the government, and get the biggest government subsidies. Here is a hit, it ain't the renewables, its coal and Oil. You dont want to hear it because of your built in biases, but that doesn't change reality. Its the free market that killing fossil fuels, in spite of all the lobbying and roadblocks fossil fuels throw at renewables and nuclear.

There is also of course the secondary issue of building more nuclear power in the US anyway, there is a grand total of one Electrical contractor in the entire country with the skills and equipment necessary to construct nuclear power plants, and this is on top of the general shortage of skilled labor across the country that makes higher skill construction projects in the US difficult. 

One of the reasons solar has proliferated so fast, is that they can be built with cheap labor, and thy can be built fast. The only real skilled labor needed in a solar plant is construction of the electrical substation. Solar of course is hitting its own infrastructure limitation, the outdated US electrical grind, which of course, the country also has a shortage of skilled line workers needed to build up the grid. We barely have enough line workers in the country to keep the whole dilapidated mess from falling apart."
"@GollumsFish That's a problem that again, Generation 3 and 4 reactors solve, with most of them having two orders of magnitude less waste than that older Gen 2's. On top of that some of these newer reactor designs can quite happily eat the spent fuel of the older Gen 2 reactors. On top of that, the long term waste storage for the waste those reactors do generate is only a few centuries, rather than the thousands of years for the older designs.

Really the biggest hurtle to building new nuclear reactors is not waste management, safety, or NIMBY, its the upfront cost of building new nuke plants that today's corporations, with their single minded obsession with short term profits means they refuse to spend the money to build new nuke plants, even if over the long term, Nuclear plants are far more profitable that fossil fuel plants and even most renewable plants."

I wonder how much you spend on average per video on stock images üò¨
Wouldn‚Äôt the effect of lower consumption by people investing in renewable alternatives like for cars cut the cost of gas as well then by probably the largest amount? I wouldn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs yet safe to say the prices will stay high. Either way the producers will have control over that in how they invest and how much they produce. No guarantee the gov or competition doesn‚Äôt step in if the cost of living goes to high to buy or to what is unsustainable for the current needs of the people. Could see movements for higher minimum wages to. They can continue to drill more like mentioned but they choose not to even though they make large profits off the market of today without investing as much as before into it today. Also prices will definitely matter even more as they go up at the pump making lowering them enticing.
"@Lorenzo Laurieri Even If that is the case they would want to then lower them to avoid people getting electric vehicles which is already close to getting there and is seen as a long term cheaper due to the possibility renewables will power cars, which will reduce consumption of the specific fuel by a large amount. Though I agree with you the tech isn‚Äôt there yet to mass produce the best systems for the mass public partly because of the reliability and charge/distance ratio along with charging times. the current electric vehicles brings lower confidence of a good investment out of a large spend for the average person right now, but that also brings hope for the possible alternatives and improvements to come. But it is definitely on its way and logically will save so much long term and also make electricity generation even more safe to invest in. Currently used Public Services would also decrease in maintenance and operations because of the decreased consumption of natural gas saving government money on potential investments."
"Oil still controls most of the transport industry, other alternatives are still years away from mass production. Therefore, they are not worried yet."

What about the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline on day 1 of Biden's administration of which only about a year or so work is left to complete it?  No one word about this?    Make no mistake democrats love high oil prices from a political strategic perspective so that it can drive down demand long term to accelerate the ""green future"".

Commodities exchange market went negative briefly ...  actual street price of Gasoline dropped just below USD$1/gal in Oklahoma for instance.
"Quirks of trading future contracts for commodities like Oil. Basically, speculators buy and sell the right to some amount of oil at some price in the future, and at the end of that contract's life, delivery for the underlying good is often forced. Well, speculators had no place to put Oil, and legitimate processors and suppliers were already completely flush with Oil, so speculators had to get rid of the contract, at nearly any cost. Hence, speculators would have paid you to take the contract off their hands. The actual price wasn't negative, but the futures trading contract price went negative."
"They‚Äôre just accelerating the change to renewables, this will hurt them in the long run."
"I am not sure how much I buy the ""end is near"" for oil. Our current energy grid and consumption patterns do not support renewable sources, and oil is still abundant and efficient iirc. There is no replacement for oil at this juncture, and to switch to a renewable-based system would be not only billions (probably trillions) of dollars, but also would be much slower, easier to disrupt in wartime, susceptible to electromagnetic phenomena, and inconsistent in delivery. Renewable energy is not the ""solution"" to oil on an engineering level, but rather something to be used in tandem with oil to lengthen the supply lifetime"

"@PhysicsGamer I respectfully think you are wrong.

First of: let me give you cars. I agree that it is likely EV will dominate almost universally for cars.
But then we get to other usecases:
-Energy storage scales far better with hydrogen compared to batteries.
-large planes will never fly on batteries. Batteries are simply too heavy. Moreo er electrical thrust is harder to generate than combustion thrust.
-long haul trains were currently diesel is employed are not working on battery for a reason.
-steel mills and other types of industrial heating often does not reach high enough temperatures in a reasonable reactor for electricity.
-shipping might be enabled by not having to drag around a heavy battery and easily refueling at hydrogen production plants which can utilize wind and solar on the coast to produce hydrogen on site using sea water.
-trucking is weight limited by law in many countries. This means having a heavy battery strongly limits your cargo amounts.

And danger? What a joke.. you can easily make it safe. We have had cars running on LPG for ages.

For many larger engines and ovens we will need something else than electricity and batteries."
"@Brokken Piloot Hydrogen isn't ever going to be feasible for the vast majority of use cases. Vehicles especially - aside from the safety and passive power consumption concerns, the power density of a hydrogen tank is *awful* compared to a lithium battery. There's a couple companies that have invested a lot into trying to get it to work, and they really haven't seen all that much improvement in the last three decades."
"@Brokken Piloot Not really sure geothermal is, outside of a few areas where the crust is suitably thin. Hydro has always been super cheap but has the same problem as geothermal, few places where it's economic to exploit. That leaves solar and wind, both cheap to generate but intermittent."
@Brokken Piloot Are there storage technologies in place for when Lithium reserves run out? I don't know much about batteries at all but I have heard that Lithium extraction is very energy intensive and batteries have a limited lifespan
"I would like to disagree. I think we are, I predict within 10 years the technology is ready. it largely already is. we are only missing 2 steps:

-Electric power storage
-Affordable green hydrogen production.

The hydrogen production we already have an outlook for: between 2025 and 2030 this should be technologically feasible.

The electrical power storage is more difficult, however hydrogen production can serve as a storage vessel until this has been solved.

What we already achieved:
-Solar, wind, water and geothermal are all cheaper sources of energy than coal, nuclear, gas or oil.
-The people are willing to make the switch
-Electric vehicles are widely available
-Hydrogen vehicles are beginning to come to market
-Hydrogen-powered trains are being developed & produced
-Hydrogen-powered shipping is being developed
-Hydrogen-powered mass aerial transport is Airbus' future plans
-Electric flight is being developed for small-scale aerial transport.

I wonder if when renewables become a substitute they will lessen the demand inelasticity of gasoline and drive prices down again.
"yes.  eventually we will get to the point where oil is like vinyl in the recording industry.  it will be a niche market, but no longer a real part of most peoples lives."
We are still decades away from that happening.  That doesn‚Äôt give the U.S. oil monopoly/oligopoly the right to gouge everyone now for fear of the future declining demand.  This is where are government has failed us.
"@Michael K That may be true, but they have so much profit that they will be willing to sacrifice if they don't have the choice. They can and will lower the price from competition until they made the last cent they can."
If Renewables become less expensive than that means Refineries now have a cheap method of refining and thus lowers their cost even more.
"I think on contrary, they will reduce supply even more, to capitalise on those, who were too slow to change to renewables."
9000 unused permits lol
"So. One thing. The cost of production has nothing to do with the market price of any good or service, in any market. That's one of the most basic principles of economics. Supply and demand dictate price. The cost of production only determines whether a supplier decides to engage in that market."
"@Dont Misunderstand Although you're not wrong, I want to point out that maybe there is too much credit extension. The sentence ""Profitable transactions aren't exactly necessary to make a profit"" literally does not make logical sense despite how accurate it is in a real-world context. In an attempt to not wade too far into the weeds here, I just want to point out that those profits were extracted from somewhere even if it wasn't from the production functions of the actual business.

"@Andy Bunn Yes and no. In a world with no credit, debt, or extension of trust, you'd be absolutely correct.

"Then the companies who generate electricity will have a bigger monopoly on you. It'll cost you $60-70 to charge your car and even more to keep your house powered. 

They need to have better and cheaper ways to generate electricity first. The problem is there's no immediate benefit in profits to be the first one to do it."

"As someone who builds pipeline for a living I am calling bullshit on a 48"" pipeline costing a million dollars a mile first pipe comes in 40 foot lengths. Therefore each truck can haul 3 joints so you would need 44 truck loads of pipe shipped hundreds of miles. Next you need a crew of people and two large side boom to place the pipe on skids and line it up for the welders. next 2 specially trained welders take 8ish hours to weld it together and a xray crew comes behind them to check the welds and a coating crew follows them fallow by a preasure testing team. Then once you have a section done (up to 500m long) you dig a trench and then you get a bunch of lifting equipment because 48"" pipe wieghs about 300pound/foot and lower it into your trench and weld that to your other sections you already put in then you back fill. Now if you have cross a road or a river or another pipeline you will need a horizontal directional drilling rig which since it's a 48"" pipe means you need a big HDD drilling rig the cheapest of which will cost you 60Kish/day. And all that is before you bring in land owners payment and the literal truckloads of fuel this all takes"
"@vedant goyal even at 12"" well you would have a reduction in most of the manufacturing and transportation costs you still would reduce it down to a million dollar a million dollars a mile and you would never build a 12"" sales pipeline from your main oilfield as it would max out at 160000 barrels a day both limiting your oilfield to around 1600 wells and taking about two weeks to fill up a super tanker. 48"" pipeline would max out at 9.9 million barrel a day giving you lots of room for expansion. Understressing the pipe making it safer. since those are theoretical maximum you would probably need to reduce those by a minimum of 20% to find your actual flow rates anyway."

This video very conveniently skipped over the fact that under the Trump administration which was concerned with domestic energy security the US became energy independent and a net exporter. Suddenly, for no reason at all, when a left wing puppet became president all that changed."
"""Suddenly for no reason at all"". Lol please, that's the most ignorant thing you could have said after watching this video. We were still ""energy independent"" in 2021, and one of the reasons that we oscillated between not being independent is because, as this video explains, supply and demand. We're still recovering from 2020 supply, which if you go look at the graphs, we dropped below being ""energy independent"" in the second half because demand freaking soared, while Trump was still President.. We're still at low import levels of crude oil and have been in a slow decline since 2007, it's not all magically 'cause of Trump."
Josh Patterson you are right!
"Awesome video dude, but I would suggest changing the title.

Outside the US, gas means gas, not gasoline. It is an awesome video about why gasoline is expensive in the us. But actual GAS gas is extremely expensive in Europe at the moment, and it largely is because of the war (and botched renewable transition policies, but still largely because of the war)."
"@dstblj 52 Well, they did build a lot of renewables, but they needed the gas compensate for the intermittency. Closing the nuclear plants early just kept the coal plants running for longer."
"In my country we call it fuel or petrol lol, so yeah...I understand why some would be confused"
"Yeah, in the rest of the English speaking world we call it petrol, which means the infographic showing how crude oil is broken down into ""petroleum"", ""kerosene"", ""diesel"", etc. makes a lot more sense.  :)"
"it's because of the sanctions, Serbia and Belarus pay the same price as in 2021"

"Thank God Biden canceled the keystone XL pipeline, otherwise we might actually have had a chance of affordable fuel prices."
"@Paul S Rohrbaugh Again, the oil wouldn't have been large in volume and would have been very expensive to refine. The amount the pipeline would have transported pales in comparison to the lost production in the price crash. Best case scenario, instead of $4.50 prices where I live it would have been $4.20, compared to the norm of $2.10 for me"
"@Paul S Rohrbaugh for far future where it actually contribute to supply. Speculations aren't as impactful as supply, yes?"
"Did either of you watch the video? Small changes in supply have a huge impact on cost, as does speculation. By permanently ending the pipeline (and signaling that no future ones will be allowed), it has put a hard limit on the amount of oil we can get from one of our major non-OPEC oil suppliers. The ramifications of this are huge, especially longterm."
"Dude why the hell are you buying into right propaganda. C'mon man, I know you're smarter than that"
"The pipeline wasn't as big as most other major pipines in the US and it was going to transport Canadian oil to the US, and this oil was of extremely low quality and would have been very expensive to refine.

"@luke kuehn the Keystone XL pipeline was only like 8% complete when cancelled. I highly doubt the other 92% would take only a year, especially with all of the protests against it."
"@dmoneys36 The first few minutes of the video were about how Azerbaijan had a distribution problem and how pipelines are the cheapest distribution method.  Biden cancelled the completion of the Keystone XL pipeline on day 1 in office.  There is only about 1 year of work left to complete it.  That distribution pathway could be online about now if not cancelled.  This pipeline would connect vast oil reserves in North America via the cheapest distribution method (pipeline) directly to the oil refineries in the Houston area which make the gasoline.   This would have no effect on oil prices or give any ""confidence"" at least to the supply side of the market?   Come on man, common sense.  Wendover needs to do better to be more balanced in his argument."

"In Serbia, Tax makes about 60% of price for petrol, and 65% for LPG. Fuel so clean that it should not sell for more than 50c per L, not sells for $1.17 (3.5.2022). 

State does this by limiting tax for few years, makes money for taxes for 'conversion inspection fee' which makes fuel start to pay out in less than 5.000km. With current prices, conversion will pay out at 50.000km. After 10 years, I took out LPG system from my car because every 5 years is inspection."
"@Richard Petrol here is at 214 dinar (about $2.14) per L. Goes up every few days.

"*laughs in Swedish*

Petrol peaked at 2,64$ per litre here, currently at 2.13$"
Not a persuasive essay. Simply your opinion. Well reasoned and spoken but...   it IS the war. Once the President cuts off petroleum exports and divorces the US from global energy markets gas prices will come down. Here. Globally they'll skyrocket. Until global demographics destroys demand. Then...   we'll see. Gonna be an interesting ride. For me anyway. üôÇ
It's sad that they want to make as much profit from everyone before gas and oil is not used anymore.
"I still dont understand why you guys use the term ""cartel"", Ive never heard this term used to describe other organizations the function like Opec, why specifically opec?"
"A cartel is just a word for a group of suppliers of a commodity who coordinate their pricing and production strategies in order to make more money than would normally be allowed by a purely competitive (a.k.a. ""free"") market. It's often also applied to narcotics cartels because there are also groups of narcotics producers and traffickers who coordinate with each other to ensure that their prices and profits are artificially high."
I scrolled down and read too many comments by people that didn't watch and still think the US president sets oil/gas prices.  I need a palette cleanser.
"Is the answer ""to maximise profit""?"
This was an incredible well-timed episode - thank you - TIL

i can explain in one word:  GREED
"I work in oil and gas and this is one of the first times people haven't said nonsense about politics and actually talked about the drive to cut Capex which is destroying their production rates. What's hilarious is that this is the most accurate video on the topic I've seen, but the comments are full of ""Bias bias, what about XYZ""

Capex limits have been driving people who work on the ground nuts. It's clear the industry is insanely profitable, but there is an amazingly low drive to Increase production, which you normally do see."
"No metion of external interference of ESG?

"@Dick Riggles For the first one: No that would destroy the western economy.

"@Dick Riggles China is a direct geopolitical rival to the US and has openly challenged the US many times. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia mostly cooperated with Europe. Just because things are peaceful now doesn't mean they always will be or that there isn't hostility or aminosity.

"Great video. The problem right now with people saying it's the end of oil as we know it, is the time it will take to transition. Right now only a little over 20% of US energy production comes from the combination of nuclear and renewable resources. That leaves the remaining 80% to coal, petroleum and natural gas. While it's great that people will want to switch over to electric vehicles, the electricity that is going into them is still being produced within the same systems that are hiking gas prices. We've seen similar trends to the gas hike already with increases in energy prices. So it's still going to affect you even if you have an EV. It isn't just a transition away from gas powered vehicles. We need a transition toward Nuclear and Renewable energy production in our grids as well. Otherwise we are going to continue getting hit by their ""party at the end of the world"" as Sam put it so well"
"@j.a.cole the electric grid is 33% efficient precisely because of thermal power plants. Its basic thermodynamics that are to blame, the ""power cycle"" is heat in, work out, heat out, work in (boiler, turbine, condenser, pump to boiler) and the maximum/ideal efficiency is entirely based on operating temperatures used (how hot the steam is relative to the 95¬∞C temp minimum).

Thermal power plants include anything fossil fuel, nuclear, con solar, geothermal, ect. This makes an EV running on pure fossil fuel power equivalent to modern ICE cars. Except, a thermal power plant doesn't have to waste that rejected heat, they con become a ""Co-gen"" plant that sells the hot water for various purposes like heating hospitals in the winter, thereby double dipping on the usefulness of the oil burned. (Its like heating your house with the waste heat of your car) And big centralized facilities are the ideal location for current gen CCS, its a lot easier to suck up carbon from a smoke stack than from the atmosphere which has a much lower concentration.

And eventually we will get the grid changed over to better primary energy sources than Nat Gas (hydro is basically fully built out, nuclear has political and technical issues to work out, and weather dependent renewables need proper grid storage (not Li ions) & economies of scale to be viable.) 

Electrification is the best option but its best to do it ""as appropriate"" meaning when you are already renovating or replacing something is when its best to electrify, unless the thing being replaced is really bad."
@Jesus Gonzalez So no freedom hivemind Socialism is better? Nice try.
"@Critical Event Yep.  Actually finding the political willpower to do anything - even the simplest, cheapest and easiest solutions such as installing CCS systems - is going to be essentially impossible, never mind doing so in time to save our planet.

""I fear for my grandchildren's future!"" has been a long-standing cliche.  Its outdated.  Even fearing for our children's futures is questionable.  We're at a point in time where we should be fearing for our own futures.  The majority of people watching this video and reading this comment are going to witness at least the start of our planet's descent into uninhabitability, and it will not be pretty."
"@altrag I think in Europe and maybe even in China for different reasons, that's possible.  In the US, bought and paid for politicians are going to make sure every last dollar is squeezed out of the last lump of coal before anyone gets forced to clean up or even mitigate anything they did."
"@Critical Event Has the same problem though - it takes too long to build.  We don't have 20-50 years for enough nuclear plants to all get through approval and construction.  We need something that can be done in less than 10 years - preferably less than 5.

In-stack CCS could do that.  Its inexpensive (at least by comparison to other options), would solve as much as half the problem, would not significantly change the way industry operates in most cases (so minimal disruption to the economy, supply chains, etc), and could be started within months of regulators forcing the issue.

In-stack CCS is not a ""fix"", to be sure.  50% of emissions is still 50% too much.  But it could give us the extra 20 years needed to build those nuclear plants before hitting the tipping point beyond which it wouldn't much matter anyway."

"Sort of off topic but... Quote.... ""Pipeline ..... the SAFEST, most efficient way to transport oil"" EXACTLY!!!!! Thank you! This very statement is why the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline was SUCH a STUPID policy decision. Whether Democrat or Republican, we need to recognize that the demand for oil isn't going to tank any time soon. So, do we continue the dangerous task of transporting oil by rail and truck from Canada, or do we build a pipeline, which is far safer and more environmentally friendly? Cancelling the Keystone Pipeline, in my opinion, was one of the worst domestic policy decisions I have ever seen, and I am by NO MEANS a conservative. We, the American people, must think about the bigger picture when considering sides to take. Too many people equated the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline to this: Cancel pipeline = save animals. Cancel pipeline = we stop using oil. Cancel pipeline = not stealing land from Indians. Cancel pipeline = stop global warming. None of these arguments makes any sense. The oil is going to be consumed anyway. Let's do the smart thing and transport it the safest and most responsible way possible. Full disclosure... my father ran the Korean Pipeline for years while in the Army, and later in life ran the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which relies on thousands of miles of pipelines. I have a decent source on the safety and environmentally friendliness of pipelines."
@The Yangem I agree.... I don't believe that canceling the pipeline impacted prices. I just believe that building the pipeline would have benefited us long term and is much safer than current transportation methods of Canadian crude oil.
@Robert M This statement is 100% incorrect. The pipeline was to transport oil to refineries on the US Gulf Coast instead of being transported by truck or rail. Most of the oil from Canada is consumed in the US. Not building the pipeline may lead to an alternative pipeline to Canadian west coast to sell crude to China.
The Keystone XL pipeline was to ship canadian tar sands oil to china. that does nothing for gasoline prices in kentucky.
"The pipeline wasn't as big as most other major pipines in the US and it was going to transport Canadian oil to the US, and this oil was of extremely low quality and would have been very expensive to refine. Meaning even if it was magically completed 2 months ago, it wouldn't have impacted the market in any meaningful way."
"In a more perfect world, this would be called what it is, price fixing. And the government would go after these executives for violating antitrust laws."
"Imagine the logic... government makes it more expensive and risky to do X, so X-Corp shareholders want profits back as dividends instead of reinvesting those profits into further X production, then the very people who made it more expensive and risky for them to do X in the first place accuse them of profiteering and price-fixing! ü§£"

I know it's a minor point, but saying that fracking was what made shale oil extraction possible is a bit misleading. Fracking makes all oil extraction possible, it's just hydrofracking that works on shale."

"I've heard this argument posted in this video 20 times over my lifetime and every time it has been wrong this will be no different.
Gas prices will drop again because renewable energy isn't cost-effective rare Earth minerals such as lithium and nickel are getting more expensive every day even when compared against inflation making renewable energy impractical definitely not cost efficient."
"@Pablo Picaro For one you're wrong about the 40c/kwh. On average in the US it's 13c/kwh. And that's the average, which means most of that cost is from the construction and installation of new panels, not the maintenance and long-term usage of the panel. A modern panel can last for about 25-30 years before needing to be placed, but many can last for about 50 years as solar panels have no moving parts and are extremely low maintenance. Almost the entire long-term cost of solar is the initial installation and periodic replacement. However, you likely won't have to pay the whole initial installation fee when solar panels start to wear out, as not all will be needing replacement (again, some can last 50 years). Meaning a solar farm with an initial installation cost of $40,000 may only need to pay $1,000-$5,000 to replace panels after 20 years. 


As opposed to coal, which has an initial installation cost of $3,500 per kW, compared to Solar's $1,700 per kW. There is also the cost of coal. Coal plants by their very nature need to buy coal in order to make electricity. That combined with the maintenance of all the moving parts of a coal-fired power plant means that the maintenance cost of a coal-fired power plant far exceeds that of solar. That combined with the lower initial cost of solar means that solar is cheaper than coal, and the current higher average of 13c/kwh is as a result of more solar plants being built than coal plants, not because solar is more expensive."
"@The Yangem absolutely NOT, solar is drastically more expensive.  Solar is about 40c/kwh (over 20 years)  coal is about 3c/kwh over 20 years).  than includes all the support equipment and maintenance for large scale"

"@X P uh huh, sure you are."
"@War thunder nope, just stating facts"
@X P is that supposed to be a joke?
America complaining about prices. Look at the price in the uk
"Cool, if they keep prices intentionally raised that makes taxes on production easier to sell politically. And if they fail, it's still basically a tax on oil production, just the revenue goes to industry/shareholders to reinvest and not the government."
"@SilentFire I would consider environmental assessments and regulations as part of the genuine cost. I'm sure you could output oil less expensive if you ignored water contamination, earthquake, and methane leakage risks. But that wouldn't really save cost it just pushes them around."
"@Neolithic Transit Revolution regulatory burden increases COGS and CAPEX.  Also, half of shale wells are profitable at $40/bbl (S&P Global data)."
"@SilentFire He only banned fracking on federal land. I'm not saying its a clear outlook, I'm only saying Fracking has yet to be a profitable industry. I am okay with a regulatory environment that doesn't support it."
Half of politicians and the citizens of this country would never agree to tax oil companies.
"Gasoline prices have been creeping up since January of 2021. Interesting, eh?"
Doesn't mention the defacto federal ban on more fracking or the cancelation of pipelines or the refusal to issue drilling permits in a timely fashion or the refusal to issue new permits on oil rich land.
"@X P  it doesnt have anything to do with spoiling.. the methaphor was that the cold gross food is far from desirable.. as are many of those permits, theres not alot of oil, its hard to get to,its distant from pipeline or train loading terminals.. maybe theres just alot of uncertainty about the locations and theyre a gamble.. the point is there are much more favorable and profitable places that theyre being blocked from using.. and what happens if they did go through the argues process of using every last permit they ever applied for without new ones being approved they still simply run out in a very short term

if you applied for a permit to build a garage and were approved then changed your mind and decided you wanted to build it elsewhere instead, or maybe you wanted to build a deck first and come back to the garage later the planning department would say nah mate you build that f'ing garage first were not allowing another permit till that things done!"
"@Andrew Browner your metaphor makes literally zero sense, oil isn't old food, it doesn't spoil"
@C N be like source: jUsT tRuSt mE bRo üòÇ
@X P because of political instability and energy hostility
"@X P  youre like a parent yelling at a kid to eat 3 day old kraft dinner they didnt finish.. saying you cant have anything else until you finish that... things are constantly changing and evolving and those permits could have been taken out for alot of reasons, like persay if opec was to limit supply to NA completely or drastically theyd have some emergency permits already approved and ready to act on

we have the same issue north of the border here, trudeau is trampling any and all projects he can, if we had the energy east pipeline we could be selling LNG to europe so they could loosen their dependence on russia.. but since that was axed we have no way to get quantities to the coast and are actually buying oil and gas on the east coast at a marked up price and selling it on the west coast at a discounted price"
The Bidenists aren't gonna like this video. They fully believe the Russians are the new boogymen. They probably check under their beds for Russians before going to sleep.
The climate change scam is the reason why oil is so expensive. Joe Biden is the primary reason gas is so high.
Joe biden
"@Quandtimus nope, not at all, sorry to hurt your feelings but the facts don't care about them"
@X P wrong sadly
More like. Biden canceled oil pipelines in the US. Made the energy INDEPENDENT country become heavily dependent on foreign countries. It‚Äôs simple supply & demand‚Ä¶
I was really looking forward to the insane logistics of bricks
what about it?
"HAI already did bricks.

No, for-real."
"Sir, this is Wendover Productions. To be on brand, it has to be a video on the insane logistics of air shipping bricks."
"As mundane as that sounds, the material process of making bricks would be a pretty fascinating video if it‚Äôs very in depth"
The incredible logistics of getting myself out of bed in the morning
"And still, people will blame the Biden administration because blaming complicated inflationary and logistical economics is too much effort

""We can't throw stones at the oil market!"""
"it‚Äôs because of ME
I AM THE TRUE REASON
MWUHAHAHAHA"
But a sticker someone put on my local gas pump told me Biden did that. Are you saying that random weirdo vandalizing gas pumps lied to me?
A video on fracki?ng please
Bendover
"For anyone that wants a little more perspective. The podcast ""The Ezra Klein Show"" episode ""How the energy markets are shaping Putin's invasion - and the world"" has details about the history of fracking and the roles different nations played in supplying petrol and natural gas to others."
Interesting
Everyone knows this is the fault of John Biden
Imagine all these wasted money in constructing these pipeline and price instability due to oligopoly. Spend that money on renewal energy.
"So, the US should nationalize the shale oil fields?"
Thanks FED and ECB‚Ä¶
"So they realized the ship was sinking, and are limiting the amount of lifeboats to keep prices high and milk as much money as they can from their hostage passengers...got it."
"The earth is not going to run out of oil for a loonggg time lmao, isn‚Äôt that what they said in the 90s and early 2000s and so on"
"@Josh Patterson US government policy is literally determined by oil companies... wth are you talking about? Every administration is in bed with the oil industry, always have been. Look at who funds their campaigns, who is funding lobbyists, who is funding policy think tanks, etc. It's all over the place. The US government is merely a tool of energy corporations. The energy industry knows there is not an unlimited supply of oil in the future, the change to renewables is not policy a choice it's inevitable."
"@Martin T Yeah, we do have a lot of hydropower to be self sufficient and we have been, but there has been less rainfall and the energy prices have made the energi companies want to use alll the water reserves and not save it as they are making a killing exporting it to Europe. Theres been a lot of anger about how we export green energy to Europe while our own citizens are struggling with the energy prices some paying 2000 euro monthly energy bills in rather small apartments. And how we are importing dirty coal energy that costwise also hurt the citizens. Especially with the ""energy crises"" from the oil companies keeping production down to cash in and keep their investors happy now that the longterm oil investor's don't expect the same sort of returns in the future as there has been the last decades... We also have  some of the highest gasoline prices in Europe, even if we are a ""oil nation"". So Norwegian citizens are currently just getting screwed by the gorvnment while Norway is getting richer."
"@Adrian ? What‚Äôs your point? If it is what I think it is you‚Äôre very mistaken: Norwegian domestic energy policy (electric cars, etc) is only possible due to their international policy (selling crude oil). It‚Äôs a big domestic PR policy. Plus they have a lot of hydropower, which most nations can‚Äôt have to that degree per capita."
"@Sebastian Lucas I live here lol, can you educate me on when the last blackout was because I don‚Äôt recall any for the past two years."
"No mention about the current US administration's  hostility towards the gas industry, eh?"
Gas production in the US has remained stable (even increased)
"Watching, and learning more about oil cartels makes me love my EV even more.  I know we all use oil in our daily lives no matter what/how much we drive, but we can also use as little as possible, and do what we can do."
Just wanna point out that you can reach the Caspian sea by boat. It's just a long route where you have to go through Russian rivers and canals until you reach the Black sea
This was covered in the video.
Joe Biden is the reason.
I'm guessing you haven't watched the video
"Thank you for speaking the truth. I‚Äôm tired of seeing joe Biden admin blaming all their failures, especially gas prices, on the Russian Ukraine war."
"Lol people will never learn. Renewables are not the future. For their low energy density and lack of applicable locations, this push towards renewables will only lead towards more reliance on oil."
"5:00 $1M/mile sounds pretty cheap. Isn't it about the same cost as a two lane road? It's about one or two orders of magnitude less than rail public transit. 6:25 that is a bargain considering the terrain and obstacles: 1768 km for $5.5 billion, $3M/km. The light rail transit system in Ottawa, Canada only 12.1 km, cost well over $2 billion. 58 times the cost per kilometre, at $175M/km. The relatively small 824 MW hydro electric dam + 1600 km of transmission lines here in the province of NL is costing north of $14B. The B1M channel details some massive construction projects with breathtaking costs."
"@GyroCannon those lines simply needed maintenance, they were sagging due to deregulation allowing the power company to ignore necessary replacement of lines/poles, they didn‚Äôt need to be buried. In remote areas, where those fires started, it‚Äôs best not to bury them to impossible since you can‚Äôt clear cut a path to bring in the needed equipment."
@Kenos It's worth trying a time or two -- when it's running ;)
"I forgot we even had a rail
Never been on it"
"@Kitty V but for certain areas, it‚Äôs also done for fire safety (in an increasingly hotter world).
When I lived in CA, there were two summers in a row where people had their power shut off just to try to prevent fires, stemming from the fact that Pacific Gas and Electric decided to pay off shareholders instead of moving their transmission cables underground (which ironically screwed over shareholders anyway when they went bankrupt)"
Yes. It‚Äôs cheaper than the cost of burying residential electrical transmission lines. Yet we do that everywhere simply for aesthetics.
Renewables have not solved the storage problem. Fossil fuels are here to stay until that happens.
"They never will solve the energy storage problem. Batteries are a very long ways off in terms of cost and energy density to enable grid-scale energy storage, and pumped hydro is only viable in certain locations while also being extremely expensive to build. Nuclear is, has been, and will continue to be the solution to clean energy generation. Blame politicians and useful idiots in environmental groups for our current climate and energy issues."
Ways*
"I‚Äôd argue you pay for your trip around the sun, in many way."
"Biden, democrats, and their anti-American energy policies, enough said‚Ä¶"
"We shout and scream when these companies make profits, yet nobody rushed to their aid when oil dropped as low as $18 a barrel some 2 or 3 times since 2000, causing Shell and alike to start letting staff go due to such abysmal revenue.  They're scum, but people either don't know or forget just how little money they've made at times."
Then why not save money for a rainy day?
I wonder how this will affect electric car adoption
So its not the Putin price hike ???????   Wow I can‚Äôt believe the Whitehouse has lied ‚Ä¶.. and i thought the end of mean tweets was the beginning of a utopia
"I remember the crash well, purely because I was on a 24hour shift tracking the site on an anti-fracking camp at the time and let's just say there was one hell of a party that evening"
"@NotGamersHD I'm guessing direct action protest - sitting in the middle of some planned construction in order to obstruct it. Generally ends with the protesters being removed by force, but even in defeat they can score some points: Seeing people willing to risk so much for the cause can be an inspiration to others."
@NotGamersHD Most likely some sort of hardcore hippie movement trying to pull the world back to the dark ages. I mean look at its profile picture.
What is an anti fracking camp?
UK Andys paying $7.58 a gallon
"17:28 Those permits are for land that does not contain any oil, and the us government, specifically the Biden regime (your buddies) are refusing to issue any new permits.

But of course, we aren't going to talk about that, are we?"

"In Greece it‚Äôs about 2.1‚Ç¨ per lt or 8$ per us gal. So yeah..,us rates are cheap af compared to Europe"
@C N still more than most european countries
"@Daniel Bamberger It's always been a bit more expensive, but the fuel economy savings have traditionally been worth it. Though recent tightening of NOx emissions limits is really pushing the boundaries of economical diesel for any vehicle smaller than a van. That's what the VW scandal was really all about, they couldn't make a diesel engine within the emissions limits that didn't end up being more expensive to fuel and maintain than a petrol equivalent."
"@Ralphie Raccoon Although Diesel has been more expensive than Super recently (at least in Germany).
In any case, of course the US offers far fewer alternatives to cars than most European countries, and is more car-centric in general. There are many who commute long distances in Europe. The problem isn't so much commuters, but city design. But that's a big, and often controversial, topic."
"Always has been really. It's been mitigated by a wider adoption of diesel for large vehicles, more fuel efficient vehicles in general, and Europeans simply don't drive as far as the average American, due to shorter distances, lower rates of car ownership and better public transport."
The difference is that some of us in the USA commute 70+ miles a day to work
The price hike is hitting my community now.  Prices are 3x higher than they were before our Elites leaked that virus.

"I bet there's people who would watch this whole video and still blame ""Brandon"" instead of Putin and Oil Executives that are profiteering from the situation."
"@Wrp G Russian supply being cut off decreases supply. Even though without Russia there's enough reserves in the world to do without but getting to those reserves and processing and transporting it takes a while. So now the prices shot up because of economics short supply but same demand. It's a great time for oil/gas execs to full send into a capitalist economy rather than doing the right thing by cutting profits and keeping prices down. But it's hard to expect them to do the right thing if we want full blown capitalism this is it, even price gouging in 2020 was a capitalist economic response."
"@Wrp G Well, Russia has always been one of the world's largest oil producers, so in a way it has to do with him."
If Putin is to blame doesn't that make it have to do with war
"Yall keep saying that the future is renewable but we don't have half the stuff we need in place for that yet, not to mention you tried in cali and caused brown-outs. That's WITHOUT bringing heavy industry into the mix. We aren't even close to being post oil and I'm sick to death of hearing about how ""ReNeWaBlE EnErGy Is NoW"". It aint and even Musk is calling your damn bullshit."
"""(it's not the war)"" THANK YOU"
"Remember when all the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù said that oil would never recover from the Covid price slump and that demand would never return to pre-Covid levels?!?! ü§£

@cloudkitt You're right. I was just talking about the connection Justin had a bit of an issue with. Capiche?
"@Megan Egan It still makes for a single point of 'failure' (from an emissions standpoint) to solve - a power plant - instead of hundreds of thousands - every car. So even if your claim about relative emissions is true for now, it is a simpler fix in the long-term."
"@Justin Rockholt Depending on the state, EVs like Teslas or Chevy Volts are powered in large part by coal fire power plants. Some places are better, like CA or HI, which have high RPS standards, but there are places like WV where you're gonna be having a greater amount of emissions in a Tesla than a Ford."
"@Taco monkey222
Yes, that much I knew already.
And the lack of storage was due to a decrease in demand.
But printing money would stimulate demand, not decrease it."
"@MrNicoJac well you see prices went negative because there wasn‚Äôt enough storage, similar to how trash has negative value"
Let‚Äôs not forget gas taxes in states like Washington and california that easily add $1.25 a gallon
Gasoline tax in CA is 75c/gallon.  WA is 67.8c/gal .....  they have very strict regulations and corruption that push prices up.
'I did that'
"Stop calling gas expensive. The US has some of the cheapest gas prices in the world, most of Europe is double that."
"@Forgotten Places on the contrary

It's because 2/3 of all oil sold in European nations is taxed to incentivise people to drive less. Even in nations where it's not feasible to take public transport like in my country where we have one rail network spanning just half of the country."
"@cetriya's Art n Comics Channel more usage or more demand should increase the price, so its *even* cheaper than it seams and medical or school prices have nothing to do with the gas prices in a country, just a stupid ""whataboutism"" straw man argument lol"
"@cetriya's Art n Comics Channel There is no such thing as ""good"" public transport in scale. Yes, it's fancy when there are 300 people travelling less than 4 miles, but not on scale. Just look at Japan's overcrowded system."
this gotta be one of the worst takes in this comment section
"Wow, gas really is extremely expensive in the US if you have to pay 5,73$ per litre. That‚Äòs more than double the price in Germany."
no its dirt cheap compared to our european prices

This video is bullshit always takes away the credit from the work of our great president Donald Trump we all know who was responsible for those low gas prices put Trump back in office watch gas dip below 2$ you can make up the most complex story you want the people know the truth you can't continue spreading false information and think yall can get away with it yall are evil

I'll gladly trade my current truck for the aforementioned Silverado, but what sense does it make to destroy a working vehicle and replace it with another one? I'm still a little surprised no one has come out with a retrofit kit for current vehicles, which would mean less cost for consumer, and less overall waste. I don't doubt there is a good solution, but I doubt that we've found it yet."

The problem is that the degrees are utterly ridiculous, and the primary beneficiaries are an increasingly wealthier and more exclusive global elite.

As someone else said in a comment section elsewhere, it's not enough anymore just to earn a profit.  You need to consistently earn the biggest, craziest, most explosive profit margins possible in order to attract/appease investors so they don't start selling off and dropping your share value.  And in this case we're talking about a vital resource that we currently need for society to function."
