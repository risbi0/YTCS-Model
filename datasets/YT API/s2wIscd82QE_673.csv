Ugyw8Xb3eCRn_W9POON4AaABAg.9hWidCWA7jb9hX0qBPP2I3,"@Banana Bunch! Can't wish for better explanation. You already know that i prefer bake's version, but i easily can be biased just like you, because i'm not an often visitor of Bae's channel"
Ugyw8Xb3eCRn_W9POON4AaABAg.9hWidCWA7jb9hWqZ3plOLj,"Never heard of bakedeath before but I went ahead and watched it and at first I was put off by her tone of voice because I thought it didn't match the song but then she started fluctuating her voice, and that's when I started liking it. 

On top of that, when the small growls came in, it was over for me from there. Head bops needed to be delivered pronto. She also incorperated a lot of the noisiness from the original song which was definitely well-edited and added more creepiness to the cover in contrast to Bae's cleaner version where pure vocals were the main focus of the cover.

I still prefer Bae's version but that's purely based on bias because I liked Bae's stylistic choice of adding the breathiness and vocal frys to her singing(which makes her sound like a zombie) but in terms of quality, I think bakedeath got it in the bag, it sounded super professional."

UgzXWIR9-bYgY2cXhpd4AaABAg,"Nice cover. well done.

There is an error with the english subtitles. They are the same as the japanese subtitles."
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg,Bae using her deep voice is like Rock Lee taking off his training weights. Great work!
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hYHwjswp0H,@Akaryusan it would be amazing
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hYGulANl0E,@Grego Val i pray someone in hololive covers some of their songs
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hYB4vzSalm,"It's honestly a cheat code, it's so good."
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hXL5YEcIVk,You should hear some arrangement of stacks or 暁records (Akatsuki records)
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hX0dCrIrqb,Bruh
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hWNrWcQ8la,Perfectly phrased.
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hWC_tkWQvY,"More like Madara obliterating everyone on the 4th war after his resurrection, but I agree with the Lee reference too."
Ugyh8B-7TGnGQ9l3NPJ4AaABAg.9hW3OpzTYGn9hW7TmbNCvc,Could honestly use this as the OST in the background of him speed blitzing around Gara and it would still fit
Ugy4Cibp7NQTrOYDtCF4AaABAg,"Oh yeah, I forgot we are in October."
UgysNRZXrzlXhUWBnpp4AaABAg,"She looks like something out of the mind of Alice Cooper… I love it. Thank you, Bae for this amazing cover. "
Ugwi0FbhjEfXeepcg314AaABAg,"Description says 'she's just a little bit strange...'
But I see nothing strange here, just a banger.
❤‍🔥"
UgwVX2QpdR9Ax24q19l4AaABAg,So the english subs seem to be Japanese for some reason.
UgxSd5xq-osazEXTAg54AaABAg,"Bae's vocal performance is terrific.  FYI: At the moment, the English subtitles are Japanese subtitles."
UgxSd5xq-osazEXTAg54AaABAg.9hW3ImLebmR9hW4V0Cm1g2,glad to know it's not just me
UgypK9UCdPOwsJodQ7p4AaABAg,I like the dark aesthetic of it all. MV and the song itself. Nice job! 
Ugw6atpWc7OXsaMhv5R4AaABAg,Bae living up to her name.
Ugy-1q9zIykGOMJ6oFN4AaABAg,I don't know what's making me vibe more with this song the fact that we have a very very cool looking chaotic version of Bae or the fact that she's dropping beats along with a very good Japanese sort of tone within the song.  This song is so good in terms of a cover and again I love the imagery of a crazy looking Bae which makes sense because she is the embodiment of chaos.  The song of course definitely fits the mood of it and all and all another fantastic cover Bae!
UgwzMA5HRTyv4gHZdLd4AaABAg,Daaaaaaaaaammmmnnnn baaeeee 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Ugz4GK8jH5ATclHmhqd4AaABAg,"That was seriously amazing. I can never get enough of Bae's voice, and on top of singing incredibly well she captured the song's feeling of derangement perfectly with her delivery. Her performance at the ending along with the masterful editing for the MV gave me chills. This rat is insanely talented and hard working, and I admire her so much for it. She's truly an idol "
UgxqEH93PIfv7ZQfAtJ4AaABAg,"I'm conflicted. On the one hand, I'm absolutely mesmerized by Bae's vocals. On the other hand, ¿?'s production style and the visuals instill equal parts curiosity and fear in me. Which leaves me paralyzed in the space between by this hauntingly good banger, unable to turn away.

Strange."
UgxtYuTZUhBwD6FfOsh4AaABAg,"The aggressive, growling vocals Bae puts into songs such as this are so damn sexy."
Ugz8iQuVIy_FlFm-WeB4AaABAg,"Ara Ara Bae voice is...well as Kiwawa would say, ""Ok but, This is just Divine, Exquisite!!!"""
