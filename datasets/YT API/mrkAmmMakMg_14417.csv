WOW THE PHONE WITH TRANSPARENT COVER!!! WOW VERYYYYY ORIGINAL AND NEW..WOW....  BULLSHIT :D
It looks very very similar to an iPhone? Like I get all top notch phones look similar but this one is basically an iPhone. Surprised Apple is not suing them for this.
"Conclusion: The nothing phone is utter trash that can't even stand up to other phones in benchmarks. Can be absoluteluy trashed by a budget flagship killer at half the price. The chipset is old,slow and obsolete. Buy a xiaomi,poco,vivo,realme or oppo instead. Carl pei is essentialy operating a chinese phone company but wasted all the budget on marketing and useless back leds. Shame on carl pei."
the ringtone/led combo giving me mad alien isolation vibes

"It’s actually quite cool. I saw this on my O2 app when I was looking to upgrade yesterday (what brought me here searching the phone). I already knew what phone I wanted, and nothing was changing that (iPhone 13 Pro Max. I know the iPhone in and out. And that’s very important as I use it so much for work and normal life, I need to know the functionality, which has been learnt over many of year. Furthermore, the size of perfect, design etc). I rang to upgrade, but as I went to check for accessories after, earbuds. I saw this. Seeifn this video. This phone does look really cool. Definitely a good move to the future. The design, and snd the cool, and very useful features (if they actually end up working as suggested here. Even if they don’t, in use the bugs will get reported and it will get developed and fixed). Having colours on the back of the phone to light up, and go with the ringtone, and what you expect. Looks very “Cyberpunk 2077”. Very futuristic, but futuristic with a very useful purpose, and not just for the sake of it!"
I loved this futuristic phone in white color ! I wonder why other manufacturers don't make such an example ?
Make a Bluetooth case with LEDs and an app that provides the same functionality... TaDa your unique idea has gone.
"Kanye meets Daft Punk in a phone.. 

Wow.."
Why don't you show the interface? Like the operating system? Thats what really matters
"At the end.. was that a sly at OnePlus? Pixel? iPhone? Honestly, feels that applies to everything"
"It looks ugly though. If you put a phone cover, all the features are gone. So basically, customers should look at the back side instead of the phone face. hahahahaha"
"Omg, that bit at the end. OnePlus 😂"
"Looks cool, but I am not going to buy it."
"Нифига не понял, но было интересно"
Well I guess someone had to come up with the idea of putting a neon sign on a phone.
Time will tell if this will catch on.
I wouldn't switch from my s22 to that but I'd get it and have it as a second phone cause it looks really vool
the charging thingy is pretty cool man
Disruptive Technology … not
How about battery life if led lights on back?
LED flashing goes to battery drain
"That's not a new technology, it's just a upgraded version of Nokia 3220 which was launched on 2004 😂😂"

"Ok they really nailed the design especially the light feature, now the things that they need to do in order to make this phone a worthy competitor to other big brand is to give it serious software support up to like minimal 3 years and maximum of 4-5 years, good UI optimization with less bugs, consistent software updates and good camera quality"

That light feature is garbage. Remember when iphone came up with that bullshit idea of activating the flashlight on calls 😂😂😂 biggest crap ive seen so far when we were in the cinema this iphone guy totally shit in with that flashes. Then when we sit outside in my garden it allways flash bombs. I totally dislike that funktion and he couldnt even turn that of even tho he wanted.

"Some really cool and ingenuitive design choices! I love the whole back LED thing but I have a hard time seeing it really take off. I imagine it may not be as stable and reliable of a platform as some the big name brands. I have enough bugs and issues with my Google Pixel 5, and the Pixel lineup is known for being supported and updated well after the launch of the phone."
"""I love that people are paying something to buy nothing"""
I use iPhone 13 pro max and I’d definitely buy that as my second phone to replace my Samsung
"All notifications u need are visible on the display lol…this phone is nothing that great, the entire video is about leds…sincerely i m not that lazy to buy a phone like this only because of led notifications…i need a good phone not a Christmas tree lights"
He never showed the screen of the phone.
"Bruh. I imagined if Nokia was still around, this would be a fone they'd be designing! Looooooooove this!"
Demn this is super cool.....🔥💯
Cool but meh
"i dont know why, but i had assumed the nothing phone would be more like the light phone..."
"Hi, pls help with below queries?

Q1: Does it support face unlock?
Q2: Does it have any IP rating?
Q3: Is there dual OIS on both camera's?"
wtf with this review..... $$$$
Anyone has pre order pass and donot want to buy. Kindly contact can buy the pass.
looks sick but I already buyed an iphone and I don’t think I will switch to a new phone atleast until a decade now
"Iphone users are 5% in india 
3% are too rich to buy android 💸

"To make a Seinfeld analogy, this is a phone about nothing."
"a combination of apple and samsung in one phone! this will answer most users who is torn on which one to go to, IOS or android? how 'about combining 'em both! Nothing is great!"
Broadly appealing like OnePlus 😁
the slugs at the end lol great vid as always
Apple is watching this and probably will make something similar
"One must congratulate Nothing for removing charger/adapter from the Box. 
Its silly of company's like Xioami, Vivo, Oneplus still persisting with inbox chargers. 
It needs to be sold separately, human ignorance (& stupidity) can destroy the very planet that sustains life. No More inbox chargers please."
"0:14, it looks the same as everybody else, hole punch screen yuck..."
Yeah they make phone fun again
Indha punda oopan
Where is the full review???
"Hey Marques, are you gonna do a full review? I am waiting for it for days now 😅"
This phone has a sci-fi and futuristic to it. Looks like came out of Aliens movie
Anyone else noticed that the lighting in the back spells CGi.
This is so trashhhh
If the camera is good like iphones well people will gonna buy it  bcoz of it and the prices points ...
It's a stock Android in an iPhone body
Biggest question! Is it a RGB?
Where is the full review???
Dumb people telling nothing is great what the f .. who wants put their phone screen  facing  down. What if I put a case on the bsck.. it become normal phone. So what's the special .. why is this much of hype..
When I first I saw this I thought it a modded iPhone 12 cause of the camera placement
Its LED doing nothing when u play music?? 😞😞
Most of the light ringtones are annoying on this
Imagine someone modifies it and syncs the led lights with a rickroll
The design of the lights on the back feels unintentional and disjoint and doesn’t look cohesive
"Yeah the iPhone and pixel do look the same. You are right. 

""They have screen on front and cameras on the back"" yes that is a smartphone... You realise that a car can have seats, 4 wheels and an engine and not be derivative? Fucking hell."
It already looks broken lol lol
cool comments and thoughts as always Marques!
6:30 is very familiar
That is dope
The battery level indicator is dope😀
Where is the full review?
6:24 Sounds like OnePlus 🥲
Already Bought it 😁
HAHA this phone is manufactured in India tamilnadu state but non of the tamil or south indian youtubers not received for review the phone. So no to nothing will be nothing...
It’s totally different seriously 😳
Cost
That subtle beef with the company who settled...
"If Apple ""steal"" this cool feature... What happen with Nothing ?"
"6:10 yes, sounds familiar"
familiar to what ?
"I will buy this phone just for the lack of bloatware...or so, i hope.."
Would have been really useful if the LED were on the side than the back .. just for LED to work i need to keep the phone facing down...
"Mostly we get Whatsapp calls, still led works for whatsapp or Teams or Instagram or etc?"
"It will, i think... Because system Ringtone and WhatsApp ringtones are connected"
do ppl really keep their phone screen down most of the time? unless in meeting or movie theatre..
At one point i thought mu dude's on marijuana
"Hate android, love this phone. LOVE!!"
beautiful ! miss notification led so much. It used to be a deal breaker before until it became a norm.
TOTAL USELESS!!
Did Marcques just trolled Apple?
"No racist, but I first thought ""wow, really bright LED's"" after that I quickly realized his palms are supposed to be brighter anyway"
Waiting for the review marques
I am more curious about battery life with all this light
How much you got bribed from that shity company
"@jawed nadeemi cause the company that made this phone is the ex founder of  oneplus,and oneplus had good run until it merged with oppo and he left after oneplus 9"
@Recruit why you asking lol
Why you so mad
Comparison between Nothing Phone 1 and Mi 11 Lite NE has the same kind of processor.
Iphone that runs Android
alternate title: iphone for deaf people.
يعني حلقة كاملة كلها تحجي علمود ال led الي بظهر الجهاز؟؟!
Would include this on my Christmas lights list
"its an iPhone for android users, you have a iPhone but runs on android :D"
Tnx
"Can someone guide me on how to turn on all the led on this glyph interface , been playing with this phone for a day and still can't figure it out"
"Can someone guide me on how to turn on all the led on this glyph interface , been playing with this phone for a day and still can't figure it out"
Intro music?
The lights are the best part of the phone!
Dang the one plus dig was crazy
The way he @s OnePlus is kinda brutal but funny
"Next: apple light up the apple on the iPhone and call ir a ""new feature"""
Hi bro full review video ?
Andy Rubin's phone one
"No other features... only led light in back  ...not good business..try something New ,unique ,.. focusing on only LED."
the world is falling. How much bullshit
"Oooooh noo, why are the cameras sticking out
I was like Yes Yes Yes for 5 minutes throughout this video and went to NO when I saw that....."
100k phone good luck getting customers that have money like that. People can’t afford gas right now
Okay
"I've bought little-known Chinese phones before and one thing that they seem to fall down on is the GPS signal strength.  Have you tested this or, if not, noticed what the performance and accuracy is like in regards to GPS?"
"Dear Nothing,Samsung A52 @30K same features , Nothing has samsung ultrawide camera .Nothing has Nothing except Buildquality and aluminium frame.South Indians want to Boycott NOTHING"
We don't buy nothing  phone in India. Bro
"They should be able to change the LEDs colors, blue and orange, would be awesome for TRON fans"
also more expensive
Perfect name...nothing phone. Looks like a child toy with lights... so immature. Just a big hype and marketing.
Rs. 37999 INR but not available to buy yet
Can I get the same phone but without all those LEDs?
you could just not use them
The climax of 'Appealing' is sick 😂😂
"But I always use casing and phone holder on the back of the phone, so the back led is useless for me"
clear case or case with ridges cut out for the leds
Looks like a big Iphone 4 with funky casing
6:20 -6+7= +1 (yup i get it)
@Filthy Frank 6:07 about oneplus
where?
Mentioned 1+ ......that was smooth !!
"The phone is to use the actual front screen or to play with back LEDs ? I don't understand this design concept , personally i don't like if my phone blink for every notification or phone call. I feel it is such a useless concept kind of phone."
Looks like a useless gimmick to me
"I don't know how many people put their screens-side down, the design is cool, yah🙃"
Whitout charger and 3.5mm no way to buy this shit.
Nothing phone was given to other country first whereas Indian channels have more subscribers than these tech times
PKMKBHD
Please tell me you've got your hands on this for a full review!
Nothing phone looks Nothing 💦💦
Trash.
Looks like iPhone 4(?) with back glass peeled
"i can't be the only one noticing that the large centered LED with the angled one above it makes out the shape of a simplified apple with a leaf or stalk... the cut on the big LED would make the ""apple"" shape look like it has a bite taken out of it."
Always on Display be like: am I a joke to you?
It's a total trash like your recent tone & content
Unbox nothing ph plz
The light & sound pattern reminds me of R2d2 & lightsaber having a baby 🤰
meaningless phone ..Tesla phone is what m waiting for...
Talking About OnePlus In The END 😅
"What they primarily need to focus on their Nothing Phone is change the phone design completly. For a person who doesn;t kno of Nothing Phone, if those people see this phone from a distance in daytime they gonna see a apple iphone x with a custom cover...nothing else and flashy lights which "" looks cool "".  Standing out in this market doesnt necessarily means to put cool ringtones with flashy lights designs and a "" good "" camera."
That’s nice👍
seems paid.... all he is talking about is the LED and all time showing the back side of the phone... may be he is directed to brag only about the back side of the phone.... with a suit case full of money
iPhone 12 limited
That last bit at the end would hit differently if you said that the Nothing phone comes to us by the original producers of the One Plus phones.
your video is 23 days runing views 7 million views but india prasad tech 16 hours just 9 million views .. actually nothing company sending the phone your place.. and worrest situation in india south side not sending the phone my palaces
"Nothing mobile 1 don't have charger in box , i can charge this 65w charger ?"
"Iwas going to buy this phone but the
moment they decided to not to put
charger in the box, they lost me... How
can they expect that will have the
charger of phone who is launching for
the first time... Logic o"
"where is the video on nothing Phone 1 after launch. 
waiting for your video so that i get an assurance to buy it . :)"
It so dope!
"Since it only comes in two colors, it's a tough decision.

II normally go for the black version, I might get the white, but at the same time, I would like the lights to stand out, so maybe the black.

But if they launch in other colors, I might go for those as well."
Nice powerbook (?) at the back.
"""Sounds familiar"" lol carl would have laughed on that one"
"Who buys a phone for lights. The back looks very bad, the lights make no sense and add no value"
YouTubers should stand up against embargo game indirectly they are fooling their viewers who brought them where they are. But they work for these greedy companies.
"Nothing is more interesting than Apple. Haha, get the joke?"
I guarantee you if someone take the time to put together a phone with a different camera setup on the back it is going to outsell these flagships
No us band support so revewing it is pointless
sound familiar with the selling strategy.. hmmm..
"I see N O T H I N G 😐
sorry I'll see myself out 🚪🚶‍♂️"
Dream come true…  Apple become Android
Sony Xperia Neo L had this notification light
And it's pretty useful tho.
"It's different, sure, but I always keep the phone up to see notifications and to avoid scratching the screen, as I see most people do too. Still waiting to see the software part, but coming from former oneplus, I'm sure it will be fine. I switched from OP to Realme, but my mind could be changed in the future. Who knows... Nothing?"
Trash. Another glass sandwich without an audiojack.
"Nahh this is just cringy. Simple coloured LED would be enough for back notifications.

Edit: or maybe a simple back screen panel like the Samsung flip is fine too."
How about inifinix phones
"it just seems as gimmick though, most people put their phone face up, not to mention that ppl also use cases, which makes the whole selling point of the phone kinda useless"
why NOT review NOTHING !
",,😅🤤👍,,"
Who is again here after launch event..???🤣🤣
Why do anyone need 900LED's  behind a smart phone😂
What the shit i just watched its nothing. I do not say its a phone actually its a stupid model. Does not make any sense
2:53 the screen...
"""Its coming on july 12th"" *looks at calendar* */JULY 12/* Oh shit this is a simulation isn't it I'm about to die they're coming..."
Nothing is better than oneplus
Waiting for your review man …..
"The phone looks so premium... But at the same time we also can't deny the fact that it's a beginner in the market so according to that they should have included the charging adaptor to make it work in the market , therwise now people will have to think 10 times before buying this.. I mean why would someone pay so much in a fresh product that we know nothing about.. even though I don't know about the price but I'm much pretty sure they gonna set it quit high..."
"It’s actually around $499, depending on the storage"
I'm stuck with my OnePlus 6t and since OnePlus now costs the same price as an iPhone for a not so nice of a phone I was thinking about buying an iPhone. Now I want a nothing phone (1); it feels like a OnePlus resurrection
"Nothing is a whole marketing bullshit. The damn thing is another Android phone as the rest and „Nothing“ more, ha … ha … ha ….
And I find the pre order methods of this company ridiculous and too complicated. They make the phone special fictitious. But it’s not special, have you seen the specs of this phone? They are not special.
And then they claim to deliver „the extra nothing feel to this“.
This is a perfect example how to manipulate the dumb mass and how to make money out of it, only with marketing and not a good over the average line product.
Don’t be so silly and buy this thing only based of the marketing they make. They are laughing at the consumers."
huge bummer this wont work with US carriers
Still nothing to change my mind. If they could figure out how to work in iMessage. iPhone is done.
"Add dialog diode inthe background,  mosiac nah!"
"It launched today only nah, how you got it to review"
"Now, I want Google to acquire Nothing and slap Pixel software and camera on this design."
The lights r stupid
Price?
Nothing is permanent in this World and Nothing is perfect..
That looks like iphone 12
"Meh, another COMMUNIST phone .. No thank you ~ 🔥🔥🔥"
"At first look, it look cool. But in long term, I don’t think people will buy. Who going to put your screen downward? So troublesome ! Every time when you need to read a message, you have to turn around ! After reading it, need to turn to back again ! You also could accidentally scratch the screen if your table got some tiny sand, especially having lunch or dinner outside with friends. Look Cool but not practical to use."
"i personally would never buy anything from this company again after their shitty earbud experience. my 30 dollar amazon bt earbud has better connectivity. horrible QC.  buyers be aware!  this company doesnt sell reliable electronics, all their product selling point is the ""design"" or the external appeal.   is all frills no sustenance."
When he said Sounds familiar= One plus 😂
One plus familiar?
"""Jockey or Nothing"""
It's nothing ☹️
to me ... IPHONE  or OTHERS
"The last part was mocking 1+
Glad that you addressed it Markus"
I bought the Pixel 6 on release in October and now I'm tempted with the nothing...
phone looks like a product of the aperture science from portal series
Tesla smartphone
Rog 6 far better
"How bout the price tag says Nothing!
Definitely something different 📱👌🏼👌🏼"
I definitely have to come buy it
Right now it's only for Indian markit 😔
Can you let me know if this phone asks for pin/password while switching off the phone like we have in Samsung phones
Nope. Its for kids
It is produced today!!
@Tec with rk Yeah!! It wil reach us on otherside from August (i hope)
In indian markit only
"Performance is matter, no use of these LED s"
"It's pretty interesting how companies are slowly bringing back the concept of ""fun/cool"" cellphones design. Like the flip phones back on the 00s-10s."
"yeah I really like the flip phones. Those have always been popular in Japan and Korea though, so that probably was the driving factor behind Samsung’s decision to create those."
Just like the Nokia 3220! It was a fun phone lol
phone when the reviews start coming out.
This is amazing 🤩
I really impressed front camara not in centre on top on screen that look like vulgar now I love this phone 😍 but need more powerful prosessor in this phone 😭 but looks very awesome
My crush on NOTHING❤❤❤
Is that nothing phone has an official IP rating?
"Obviously, since it is an midrange affordable phone, you can't expect so much about the cameras here. I'm sure that it cameras will far behind those apple samsung or pixel phone."
I am just waiting for camera comparison between nothing vs iPhone vs Samsung vs Vivo
Who invented LED should look at this stuff  🙃🙃
"3:45. If I buy this phone, I'd rather look at the back to know who's calling me rather that the front."
"this is really amazing I buy it or not, love it 😘😘"
"Omg what if they took this concept a step further: RGB lit up with a clear back that shows the phone ""motherboard"" that would be AMAZING! Just like the clear case PC builds"
"Ive never really been an ecosystem guy, i like samsung but ive never stuck to them completely but nothing really interests me, i just got their headphones and they are awesome, im really considering getting the phone now."

Sounds familiar. Yes.
It’s another Chinese company trying to sell their products to gullible Indians while the Chinese soldiers kill Indians
@Rahul  Pei was London born yea and clearly does not look Chinese? And I checked their official location which has nothing to do with London. Cheers mate
@Rahul devesh gndu hai 😅
"Nothing is London based company and it will be made in India.
So it good for Indian economy and Market."
Mistake not being available in the US as I know it will appeal to a lot of people.
This is just always on display but in the back
I am just waiting for camera comparison between nothing vs iPhone vs Samsung vs Vivo
One plus became popular brand because of Charl pie... definitely nothing gona rock and set the own place in market
I was not planning to watch the launch event. Well now I'm gonna watch it on the 12 the
That's the power of Carl Pei💪💪
I would have love colorful lights
Looks way too much like iphone
Copy iPhone 12
Nothing perfectly describes what this phone is offering.  The LED backplate is just a gimmick and of little utility.
"If you think phone are basically glass, simple colour etc etc then give me one cause I'm normal"
"The 'Sounds Familiar? ', hits hard for OnePlus users"
"I don’t know why, but I want it so bad."
But it's only for Indian markit 😔

"This might be a hit provided if it comes with a Stock ROM. The reason which I switched to iOS from Android is lots of shitty apps and bloatwares in Chinese phones and their custom ROMs. India is full of Chinese smartphone shits, Nokia and Motorola might have Stock ROM but their camera is not good and for brands like Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Realme they may come off with pretty decent cameras but lots of bloatwares and unnecessary apps. On the flip side even though Oneplus features are top notch when it comes to camera and UI but I didn’t like the fact they put some Custom UI skin u might get a feel for Stock ROM but being a Motorola Moto G2 User once I feel something is lacking in these Chinese phones they don’t have Google roll outs for new versions and the look and feel for stock androids are way higher. I genuinely miss my Motorola Moto G2 which was a 3G phone and it is obsolete now. Any phone that can give me pretty good camera like iPhone or one plus and UI like Moto G 2nd, 3rd Gen and Moto X play I am gonna replace my iPhone then and there"
I have one doubt back side led will not get damage or like get off when we will use it continuously
YES 👍

Doesnt that mean you’ll have to open it up to replace the broken LED?🤭🤭🤭
"If I hadn’t just invested in the apple eco system, I’d totally buy it. I think it looks more futuristic than most phones."
@Nayan Punekar it mean you have every apple product which are linked together like a apple watch airpods mac iphone or even the ipad so they cant move from it as it is expensive

Can nothing phone have a headphone jack?
How’s the camera
Highest views in recent videos 📹 👌
How about just having on small screen on the back with proper text rather than this light show?
Just created hype by showing backlight and its features (of light )..  Seriously NOTHING.
"Well after using a smartphone for the last 3 years, what I think is that all the cool features that any company brings to the table, or any modifications/customizations they do, don't grab the same attention after a certain period of time. We always tend to fall back to the basic usage of the phone ( although the term basic can vary from person to person ) the point here is, all we want is a phone with good hardware and software quality but in cheaper cost, only if OEM's try to reduce the profit per phone ratio and actually build phones for users maybe it can help both the customer as well as the company. 
So instead of doing something fancy stick to the basics and people will definitely support you."
I whold go in
Useless phone gets so much hypes for such bs YouTubers.
Please 1 phone gift me I am indian

THIS IS SO COOL
Looking at the price and specs; mediocre and massively overpriced. The only thing nothing is good at is hype.
Asus putting a fucking screen on the back of their phone: Look at what they have to do to imitate a fraction of our power
That Oneplus shade in the end. 👌😂
haaye mera kaalu haye mera kaalu 😂😂😂
Iphone x Android = nothing
Looks like  android + iphone.
Adding RGB lights to it would be the next step
I’m still waiting for the time when we will have a nerve gare like sort art online
It basically looks like an iPhone with USB C and android launcher
Fun Fact : The universe begain from nothing
I would've bought this phone if LED stuff on the back has MP3 support so I can watch Nokia 3220 ringtone
"I want specs and a price, all that I ask for"
"I believe this much of whole LED gimmick wasn't necessary. Anyway aesthetics and boxy design is good enough for people to buy, only single bar (charging light) would be more than sufficient to give fresh look.
The plain white back with nothing logo would have given more subtle look."
"I mean... Even if they only grab a small sliver of the market, it'll be a success! It's an Iphone Parody the runs on Google?"
I like that a lot. it feels like a long time coming with the progress of the LED indicator. RGB would be 🔥🔥🔥
I like the look of the front but the back to me is not so good. It'll appeal to some I guess. I like the flat screen though.
"What do I want for Christmas?
Nothing"
That last part made me think of Oneplus
"Won't buy this for the name alone. It's just so stupid. ""What is that? Its nothing? No, the phone? Yes, it's nothing!"" I just don't want to have this conversation 😂
Chinese are horrible with names... This, OnePlus, the ridiculous naming convention of Xiaomi..."
Please don't give this device Jerry rig everything
Imagine if we could make those lights blink in Morse code!!  It would be so cool!!
Why this phone is so ugly ?
same question. I don't get it why a lot of people like it
I'm wondering how much extra battery consumption those led goonna take
"People has been talking a lot about its unique design, UNIQUE? Which one? It’s copy cat design from iPhone 12 combined with the design taken from Xiaomi 8 Transparent edition which was released way back in 2019. Plus its backlight notifications is going to drain its battery fast, not to mention the lack of Charger."
I guess many have same question like mine. How to turn back LEDs completely
Looks like an iPhone with better specs running Android. Might consider it
Love from INDIA 🇮🇳
"What phone do you have?
Me- Oh, it's nothing."
Like your veiled attack on Oneplus :)
"from the front of the phone, this is what iphone lokes like when they starded to manufacture punch hole display. 😸"
is this phone under apple? i saw an apple icon
asus rog the rgb is better and have all colors asus rog is the best phone ever
If this is not a budget segment phone then I will throw this phone into dustbin.......simply

I don't see it as replacing my current phone for now... In terms of specs they're quite behind. I honestly like to try a samsung but their battery charging speed is pathetic and i hear it heats up. I considered oneplus again but their new OS sucks. I considered xiaomi again their OS is bad. I don't want iphone i don't have that kind of money.

I was evaluating myself and If I need a premium phone. The answer is no. I don't take many photos and I don't play a lot of heavy games.  So there is honestly no need for a premium phone. All I do is watch YouTube, scroll IG and typical text and call. I will say I may get the second version if anything. I'm still using my old ass S10+ (RIP: Headphone jack)."

why would I want to keep my phone with screen facing down? Doesn't that make it prone to scratch?
No traditional flash means no flash light function.

We know mobile starts to lag / hang/ slow down after certain period of use, so is it a good Idea to use old chipset 778?"

Bakwas phone
Seii
Remember the stickers that used to be there in early 2010's that used to light up while calling and getting calls and messages 🔥✨🌟
"Yeah, this is just like those earbuds. I.e. an over hyped semi-generic, though well founded best-of-two-worlds iPhone/Android splice. This is Carl Pie's message.. Hey, here's an even more iPhoney, iPhone that looks like the iPhone 10-12, but it runs Android! And with an even more pretentious, artistic, minimalistically-intricate, transparent, plaster of paris/milky-white look!"
"and another ""breaking new"" Iphone clone...................
same marketing tricks, same stupid greedy customers....
here we go again...."
Imagine if the notification lights at the back of the phone is rgb it would look much cooler
Not attracted with back no one wants to know what within
All the oneplus fan base is rooting for this.
Waiting for full review 😀😀😀
6:33 burn
"4:47 - 5:06  THIS! This is exactly their thought process behind their marketing here! Because.. yeah.. that's an iPhone 12/13/14 with an even more pretentious, artistic, minimalistically-intricate, transparent, plaster of paris-white look, right there, if I ever saw one!"
I am going to buy this
"Super cool concept but I do have a few fears..


1. It's LED all over the back of the phone, is tht not gonna be hot?

2. The LED arrangement is although cool, isn't as slick/nice as you'd think

3. Has pretty good potential to pioneer a new phone look/new era of phones for sure! But they're gonna have some competition if so.. cause the giants would defo try to create a cooler looking phone with similar concept and better technology due to the higher budget..


I hope this catches on, though.. I've always loved  the seethrough/clear acryllic/clear resin look.. something about it is just so nice.. i hope they'll launch more cool phones soon"
I read that it's not being sold in US    but God do I hope they do
I see their notification light has some what inspired by the apple's magsafe battery pack
Kalu.....chup
Model name?
Nokia 3220 had a similar lighting feature ages ago.. it was ahead in its time
"Samsung c100 that was released in 2003 has the that led ring tones rhythm sync, so they're right it is (nothing)"

"Why would you keep your phone screen facing down all the time just to check on the lights, the screen does that for you"

Yup that sounds familiar - OnePlus
Gareebo ka iPhone 😅😂
Copy design of iphone
op ran almost 6-7 years with og fans so lets see how much this lasts
cool but i never put my phone screen side down. Kinda pointless.
"""Sounds familiar""  ??"
"Let's be real and not compare it with iPhone. This is just another fancy phone and FYI majority of the people like simple phone like iPhone which looks simple and still does all the work whereas this phone looks way more fancy, and it's not that good I think. LED light on the back seems cool, but I find it boring, and it will irritate you in time, plus you can't putt transparent case because transparent cover get dirty very fast. You will have to replace your case in two months."
Love from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
"Still a Chinese company, popular in India for money laundering like VIVO phones"

im hyped for this
What was the intro song? Neeeeed it
Only the look's different other wise Nothing is different 👍
"MKBHD: ""I can only show the back of the phone""
Also MKBHD: 0:12"
"MKBHD:- The glyph lights are dope , a pretty cool feature to see
Also MKBHD in Android vs apple:- But how many people are actually going to use these features.

Hehe guys chill , i love this guy for his content , but just to remind what he said is a fact that such features don't appeal to much people or even if they do they soon lose their charm"
Cool idea for there case case will not be transparent only where the light is will me frosted transparent rest will not be so from far it will be sleek looking really
Even more--- Even more---Even more... Even more..no superlative ?oh wait.. Even most..
"They'll be out of business  in 3...2...  I don't know how things are going in the USA (doesn't matter for this phone anyway), but here in Ontario Canada, Apple is on the way to an unbeatable marketshare. If you go today to a concert or event that skews to a younger crowd, let's say 1000 people, chances are you won't see a single Android phone at the venue. As manufacturers continue to omit North America from their plans, that's only going to help Apple eat the entire pie."
DAMN!!!!!!
They grabbed an iPhone and basically modified it to their liking.

Oh dbrand will have a hard time making  a skin for this phone...
Is that water resist?
Pretty cool. The processor is a problem for me so not for me but it looks nice.
This phone is.  Boom
The views in 2 weeks😳
Is it android or iOS
Are you members of iluminati
How is pictures quality and display and how much price
Maybe it will be father of electronics gadget
The lights will consume all bettery backup.
This guy roasted One Plus in less than 15 secs😂
Would've been better if those lights were on the edges on the front side.
the back look like an iphone
It doesn’t matter that the phone looks slightly different than the iPhone 12; it is meant to be mistaken for it from a passing perspective or just from people that don’t know phones well.
"toy phone 😂 😂, kids or teenager like"
This will be a massive flop phone !
Really? You’re posting a video of just the back of a phone? Fuck outta here

"in general, it is like the thing to sell me the phone instantly. Alongside that interesting industrial design at the back"
OMG I love this phone 📱😻
How on earth you got the phone 🙄
Now I can say someone beat me in Apex mobile because they had the better RGB lighting.
... Great value... For nothing... 😅. Just joking
Am I the only one who thinks the leds will be useless as I will be keeping my phone screen facing up????? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
a side mounte fingerprint sensor! hmmm...
Exclusive video to show nothing. Let's hope it can run gcam or its uselss
... Ok😮just get a clear glass back on your.. Iphone... Done.
... OK with clear back...
It has become very enjoyable phone through that led bars
Back led is crazy
You are so gentle... How can someone Dislike your video...
mkbhd is clearly not enjoying this video
"Lights for sure are important in any aspect of life which can add really cool esthetic, and this is a good example.

Hope that from the software side it will also be clean and nice to use. Anyways, this is impressive clean design.

The led lights
Can u tell How much battery it consumes?
I'd consider getting it. If it ran on a legit Linux OS I would be sold 100%.
"Thanks, Marques! I appreciate your thoughtful, low-hype reviews."
"Cool concept, however, this WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO NORTH AMERICA!!  Go figure."
"i still do not get why the hype is about ?? yeah why not have some LED's on the back , but no one puts their phones this way, and ringtones are made so u can hear that someone is calling you, you do not need to look at your phone flashing ... i guess it will have the same reviews as the nothing earbuds.... but good strategy from their end..."
Looks likes a toy
"MKBHD: ""The Nothing Phone LOOKS Different""

Me: Because It's Nothing Like Anything"
"Does anyone know if this has a proximity sensor and also double tap to wake option? I don't really dig the design at all, my phone screen always faces up, but I'm after a decent performing phone with a larger OLED screen with a proximity sensor and double tap to wake, it seems impossible to find currently."
Cool but it looks like its not going to be widely available in the near future
"Elon Musk: Son what do you want for dinner? 

X AE A-Xii: 4:03"
"Would be better if they added RGB...but as it is now,it seems like trash to me"
"Yeah, it's all a huge gimmick. I have a OnePlus 8 Pro & the hard notification slider on the side of the phone is something I use every day. It's so much more efficient & easier to keep my phone's screen facing up to see what phone calls/emails I'm getting throughout the day and have the phone instantly be put on silent via the notification slider if I'm in meetings. These LED lights on the back are distracting at best.

Overall very disappointed, they could've made a product superior to OnePlus's appeal to the masses. Oh well, I'll hold out hope for a competent phone with a notification slider for now."
@Cinema Diaries Yeah like those app notifications that trigger the camera's flash
just  a fancy phone for kids. That's all.
Lol
I don't why but the design is not looking good the LEDs looks incomplete
Which chipset inside?
Snapdragon 778 5g plus

does it have a normal flash??? i mean while taking a picture?
They could partner or get bought out buy Apple to make the coolest looking iPhone 15
nothing phone iPhone copy🤔

Is it just me or the audio in this video feels weird

"Nothing puts a recording indicator on the back of the phone!
Me : *""NO Sh🙂t!""*"
Why would you put your phone upside down in the first place? To have scratches on the screen?
that last statement before the closing line is just everything. LOL
Utterly underwhelming. Like sticking find and chrome on a Fifties car.
"pro tip to mkb: something can't be ""very unique"". it's either unique or it isn't."
Does it run graphene or does it embed the closed source google android spyware that every other android does?
Looks more hyped. I'm the one who has all the notifications disabled except calls. Is this phone any useful for someone like me?
"Hey @Marques, will the phone be usable on US carriers like ATT or TMobile? I'm planning on getting it from India. I see that you _are_ getting some bars but on roaming."
"first impression, It looks ugly and led can be annoying"
"I brought 1+ phone as a Apple killer. Now 1+ sold to Oppo performance and user experience is disappointing. 

What is the guarantee that today's Nothing will be moved to Company like Oppo and come up with Something or Everything. 

Better stick to Apple who don't change and focus on improvement, consumer satisfaction and quality."
Anybody seen windows 11 on the mac at 1:01 ? (Easter egg)
"It cool but I think colored LEDs would be better. On my old galaxy s8 there was a small led on the front of the phone and it would light up certain colors depending on which app I got notifications from (Snapchat-Yellow, messages- blue,etc) and I loved it. I like the LEDs being on the back but I find the glyphs kinda tacky and I'd prefer just simpler multi colored LEDs and that nice charging LED."
i hope they have black version

Going an extra mile in this industry seems to fail People tend to use the standard flat option and high Spec’s inside

You roasted OnePlus royally 😘
Just keep your whatever phone you have facing upwards and all those features are useless
"Nothing impressive in NOTHING. joke of a smartphone. Looks like chinese product with such led consoles. Nowhere near apple. What a joke🤣🤣🤣. Do you guys think a sober, a tycoon will use such a phone with such down market lights. It wont attract mid age mobile users ... yaa youngsters mi8 be attracted bt seriously a this one is a joke🤣🤣🤣🤣"

"It aches me how you guys get so turned on by these knock-off (outside iPhone, inside Android) non-sense phones with primitive LED tricks but nothing original that matters both in software and hardware.
I don't see this excitement when Sony, LG (used to), Vivo, Motorola try to bring some real change and technological advances (variable aperture, moving lenses, wing, folding screen, cool software features). Your lack of excitement for those features and nitpicking and highlighting on some negative features instead, calling them niche (didn't hear for this knock-off tho!), and not recommending them for people led to the death of LG phones (👏). What's wrong with you guys?"

Different step than other big companys😀❤

People have to buy this phone for these kind of features... Seriously.. wasted... Nothing has nothing in it

"If it didn't have a pinhole camera, and just had it underscreen, or a pop up one, i would be all over it. My OnePlus 7T pro hasnt been beat for aesthetics for me yet, but if something comes out the same as the 7T pro but with new hardware, I'd have it in a heartbeat"
"Exactly the major reason why I didn't upgrade my 7 Pro
It's beauty is just unmatched"
What is the use of LEDs of the back. Most of people uses their phones with back cover on it  🤔🤔🤔
I prefer my rog 5 backlight
If they are not providing Snapdragon 800 series chipset then how cld they even compete with oneplus series. Who wld like a downgrade.
Most people use covers for their phones like I do. Therefore i don't see a point in these back led lights.
Gift me i give you quick unboxing 😂

Thanks for showing
They can offer an AOSP update subscription for it.
I am very excited but I can't afford it...
Got the OnePlus rant...it was dope 😅😅
"throwing some fancy LED lights don't make it a cool phone. please show androids user experience and the camera experience. Explain something other than lights ,we are not kids playing with toys in light, what you are telling is the first impression of a company new flagship phone and you have not shown us how the boot up screen or home screen looks like. not cool man"
Dude he is not allowed to he will get sued
മലയാളി  ഉണ്ടോ?
I cant wait until this phone demolishes apple like Samsung did
Price ?
NOTHING LOOKS DIFFERENT THAN A SLAB
'no waifus' 'robot characters' RESPEK GUNDAM
"Nice , but maybe if we se more apart from ringtone and some nice back light effect... could be something more maybe."
Looks cool I guess but I'd never buy it over another phone just due to the lights lol
"Wow, this is just stupid. All of this gimmicky LED stuff... For what? Who puts their phone screen down? Wiggle the phone to see how much battery% you have? Yeah, AOD has been a thing for way too long for this to be any useful. Seeing who calls you even without sound? Yeah, that's called having a screen, geniuses. Lastly... The LEDs light up when reverse charging? Why????? To waste even more power? Holy shit. I don't hate mkbhd or anything but this is beyond ridiculous"
That sarcasm was really good tho.. tbh!
Honestly miss the LED notification. I love visual notifications. Maybe I should give AOD a try again and see if there's any good custom apps for it
What's the price of this phone
fill light looks very useful
Shots fired to One Plus!
Nothing phones looking good
"1. sell a costly phone 
2. sell a costly transparent cover separately
strategy somehow seems like those of apple"
xperia sp led was way cooler than this
Does it have in display fingerprint scanner or not?
"poneglyph?
that's that!
take my money already!"
This will consume lot of battery 🙄
it's a replica of iphone 12 but can't compete apple
Woooooow I want the naruto phone..also your video its cool and practical and what not however you are missing the most important puece of info ?$$$$hiw much does it cost brudah
Would look dope in black tho🔥
"Its a toy, would be fun for a few days. The real deal is what's inside. If that's good and reliable. It is worth it. Let's not forget the software and updates"
make it RGB!
Thanks a lot. Was looking for more info on the looks of this phone from 10 days 😬😬
wao i loved it
Did he meant OnePlus at the end? Or iPhone 😂
"Hi Bro Hope you're rocking at your work

The cases of this phone 😮‍💨
Thank you
my nikka had me at naruto phone..
wow you can  see who's calling by blinking leds. Or maybe just turn the phone around and look at the screen lol.
This phone looks childish kids phone with that lights and all. Not a professional classic look. Over hype definitely suckzz
VERY BAD DESIGNS
This is somthing different but Nokia 3220 had something similar in 2004.
Really amaing phone 😘😘😘
Sooo....... other colour than white??
Kuch samajh me nhi aya ...Phir bhi video pura dekh liya 🙂
designs so hopefully their later ones move away from that shape as they establish themselves
How can i pre order on this phone
I love the name and the design is 😲
6:31 😏it does 1+ people know 🤌
this is orginal phone or phone cover
Focus on the success what 1 is gonna make rather than building an empire of customisation on the future one 🙂
"Офигенный ,жду выхода"
To be honest it looks kinda unattractive. The clear back is cool but the light layout seems pretty random. Don't even know what is supposed to be
kids should buy this
Price
Seems like a gimmick
I like the design of the back. Nice phone. Wish it was here in the states.
Pretty sure some small iPhone accessory company will come out with an LED Notification case if Nothing phone is successful.
The LED ringtones reminds me of the Nokia 3220

It's harsh that all those cool features goes to one side of the phone on which majority of people put a case or they just keep the phone on a table with that side facing the table . Either way it blocks everything and all the cool feature you paid for goes down the drain

"I don't think this Nothing phone [1] will be able to beat Apple iPhones but I have a feeling that this phone will stand on par with the Pixel phones.
For some people like me, Nothing phone [1] has beaten iPhones in one aspect: Design.🦜"
Just an overhyped piece of average crap.
So basically this phone is a better notification device; at least till the time new review videos come up
Nothing is very good products
"weve gone backwards as a society
next we will see touchtone phones again and them being hailed as 'simplification'"
Cool design 🤩
not enough to buy ... but enough to trigger some ideas with android and apple for their future products.
4:03-4:06 the sound look like some kind of dinosaur
Phone price?
It looks cool
it looks like TRON!
bhaiya camera bhi dikhao na
It’s nothing above average.
6:25 no oneplus was harmed 😅
waah
Yea it will
"MKBHD : sounds familiar ? 
Viewers : samaj rahe ho ? oneplus ki baat hi hai ! 
lol wish oneplus is still the same as it was before !"
Been waiting for a new phone
"All remains to see is the UI, camera, battery"
"What phone do you have?
Me: Noting"
Looks Like iPhone 👍👍👍
Since pixel is going backwards on aesthetics this looks interesting
"I hope they keep in mind if they want to make big bucks, they provide functional cases that work with the gylph LEDs.

Because the masses will want to slap a case on it. Otherwise they're only marketing to influencers, so it might end up being prohibitively expensive for the common user"
like how it ties into that transparent aesthetic.
Lmao the dig at OnePlus at the end.
r2d2 the phone
I hope that this phone is successful enough that they can make a flagship processor version in the next iteration
This phone gonna flop.....100% sure😂😂😂
this phone is nothing like an iphone
I would maybe buy the nothing phone....but....I just bought a S22
If you want to know who’s calling or texting… put your phone screen up… done.
Wveryone keeps a case in phone. That glow is a fail.
"Is the see through back thing a one trick gimmick? Good to get new customers, but how do you repeat the same trick years down the line?"
those ringtones would drive me crazy
"You mean the ""nothing original"" phone"
I'd buy it if they put a thicker battery in it eliminating the camera bump!
How much price
400$ around
Well nokia done this type of light features 15 years ago.
definitely not buying it.
"2:47 ehh.. yea I actually do want that to stay lit up all the time. Just like the guy in your podcast said, it's much easier to just glimpse over and see it, instead to having to wiggle or pickup your phone just to see the charge indication."
"And if you are not an idiot and always put your phone screen up so the screen doesn't get scratched, this is completely useless."
"Apple: takes one feature from android.
People: oMg ApOl Is StEaL!1!1
The nothing phone: takes the design from an iPhone 12, slaps on some lights.
People: yees I always like these original designs!"
Oppo without pants..
"Thanks, Marques! I appreciate your thoughtful, low-hype reviews."
Nothing copy iPhone
Nothing Phone 1 Replace Oppoplus 😆
"HMM 

WHAT ABOUT A PROTECTIVE CASE FOR IT ? hmmm"
Nothing should provide it
I like
IP reting ?
Please ad spanish language subtitles un your videos. Thanks.
"That's all good 
But I'm curious how the phone works in every day use"
"Looks like an Iphone version. All these LEDs could end up losing more battery, so keep charging constantly."
"If I’m gonna be honest it looks like they ripped off Apple design and trying to rip off android, As much as they’re trying to pill to the masses I’d rather buy a Samsung or an iPhone… What Nothing has actually done is made nothing it looks exactly the same as an iPhone trying to rip off android"
You think it’s ironic that their lights look more like a simplistic apple logo than their actual logo
Battery will be crap
sounds familiar sounds like oneplus
i wanna see it with RGB instead of white
"reminds me of, how old Nokia phones were.... A slight punch of Nostalgia.... ❤✌🤯"
poor Design 😁
"Can someone please explain me, if this is how the front of the phone going to be?"
Patrick
Is there any charger in the box🤔
At first look think lame but actually it's very cool
Imagine getting a back cover with transparent parts where the phone's lights are
"Past copy iPhone 11, phatetic.  😞"
A white iPhone
The last 20 secs were dope.....he perfectly explained One Plus in 20 secs and guessed the future of NOTHING phone at the same time......
"Wow, all those ltpo save up batteries wasted in a light show lol"
Loved that little dig on 1+  😁
So im gonna play a game and mid game im gonna get vibrations?
So you need to use clear phone cases only for this phone to take advantage of those  led notifications
Looks like the alert slider is on the back of the phone
The ringtones sucked balls. Make it sound more Futurama-ish
This is epic
"I dont care about lights, what is performance and battery?"
Like a iPhone 12 🤙
mad phone 🔥🔥
there nothing to see anything invideo
"Would definitely buy it , but I'm broke😥"
"To be honest, its design look great"
New OP in the making
"Playing the Ringtones in sequence in this video made me think it'd be nice to sync up New Orders Blue Monday as a ringtone and the lights beat out to it, also the sounds that were there gave me cause to think Kraftwerk's Pocket Calculator would also make a good ringtone and led display combination."
I think the music from Tron:Legacy would suit it the best - the phone even looks like it could be a prop in the movie. Now imagine playing Derezzed on it! I currently have an 8-bit version of Derezzed as my ringtone and its great.
"device, but it sure piqued my interest. I see you Nothing!"
BATTERY WILL DIED VERY QUICKLY 🤭🤭🤭🤭
Really work
"Respected sir

  

     Here I am recieved your invitation code it is not working in Flipkart. It's not showing in coupon box and also am called many time to Flipkart supporters they are told me to a contact nothing supporters. Plz if you help me to buy your product I need this phone in any cost. 

      Plz reply me soon am waiting for your reply."
"You're talking about one plus in the end, aren't you? 😂"
Cemera test
please tell me it has got dual firing stereo speakers of good quality 🙏
"Gonna buy it , it's lit"
Super hyped what a beautiful design
Can't wait for debs to break this open and install aosp again XDDD
No 3.5 mm jack
I can confirm the lights just makes the phone overheat 😅
If it was rgb lit I would buy it🤣
"For a phone that’s called nothing, that sure is something"
This is all very interesting....but I never leave my phone face down
"They keep giving people doing android pos OS.
They want to change the game? Make their own OS, HTC atleast put a fking theme on top of android and it changes the game for a bit."
Can't wait to see Jimmy rigs everything to rigs Nothing
"It will eventually turn out like OnePlus. Hopefully not, though."
At first i thought its is iphone 11 like mine lol
The skins are really sick. Naruto and all.
"i usually put my phone facing up to see what the notification is on the screen. if im with somebody or want to be focus with phone nearby, i put my phone facing down, the light seems to be tempting me to grab my phone. but maybe just me"
"Why don't you start your own phone brand? 
Ever thought of that? 
You know almost everything about what phones should look like/contain/have/avoid.
Imagine an MKB SE 1 Pro Max Plus Ultra Phone 😂"
-Neo 😂 . Add that also
"Is this feature really required?
Like you need to keep your phone upside down. 
And then again rotate that phone to operate the screen.
Practically someone would keep their phones display side up to avoid all this hassle.
Just check the display whose calling.."
Am sorry but black screen borders/ bezels are too thick which I really don't like
Can you install ios on it tough?
If Tron made a smart phone….
Totally got the last refrence haha....  1+ for MKBHD ...

I need to keep the phone upside down everytime to see this lights which would be a task...This type of lighting effect can easily be copied especially with an upgraded Always On technology... And many would be sceptical to use the phone without a cover... Unless this phone comes cheap with competitive specs...
"just a gimmicky phone .. adds nothing to the perfotmance .. if its priced above the se 3 , then very few people will buy it.. the hard truth is .. ppl will buy the phone with the most powerful soc , does not matter if its form vivo or iqoo"
Damn wish I could get those ringtones on my iPhone 13 mini!  Those are dope!
The modern phones desingns are BOORING! Thats why we copied iPhone design and put some fancy useless leds on the back
🚨I expect RGB in near future ⚠️
😄😄 not nice  looking not nice.   Look  baby toys                       I phone best
not similar every mother fokin company is trying to copy iphone design ..and nothing is now in no1
"I wonder if it will have an alert slider 🤔
I mean iphone and OnePlus have it so why not, I love that function.

Just need to make another OnePlus 6 (red) for 2022/2022 🤗"
I know that the embargo hasn't been lifted yet but can you already say something about whether it's worth to spend the 20 bucks to pre-order it?
Cool Handy
"Its actually some cool stuff, if I stop using iphones, Then Its definitely the next choice. Cheers"
"I really hope the OS for this is something better than Android, but different from iOS"
"Me hace acordar al nokia ese que venía con las luces a los costados. No le veo mucho la magia, más allá de ser divertido un poco de luz."
"También me acuerdo cuando en el black berry te titilaba la luz de las notificaciones y me volvía loco. Ya ver que esa luz titilaba ya me amargaba. Hoy mientras menos notificaciones haga el teléfono, mejor."
another sub-brand from BBK?
SOLD
Where is fingerprint are available
"Smart and groundbreaking features Carl - add a bunch of lights to drain your already small battery more quickly, especially while wirelessly charging!  Gosh if only the front side of the phone could light up when charging your phone and an exact charge percentage or light up to show the actual notification. So convenient to add an extra step for notifications - see the notification light on the back, flip it over to interact and then flip it over again...cool"
"In your hand it looks like a small 6 inch screen phone. But from what i hear and see, this phone is predicted to have a 6.55 inch screen, right? could you confirm the screen size?"
"In my opinion, it is awesome and unique but it should have other colors too."
Under display Fingerprint sensor?
This one has fire in the market
"What about ui software camera? Phone is in your hand why not interested in showing those stufs
Showing Back design is useless and will get bore easly within a week most show the real stufs bro"
Ugly Phone
Guy Just Roasted Oneplus Like A Charm😂
"""Sound familiar?"" *cough* OnePlus *cough*"
"4:03 so what about haptic feedback! Is its there? If yes,
Honestly shut up and take my money."
Imagine looking at the back of your phone as much as you look at screen
What processor does it pack though....?
Cool phone…maybe i’ll get one for myself
"I thought you were only supposed to show us the back.. 
wiggle the phone to scratch your screen …? No thanks."
I really like it. looks cool. only thing to check is how smoothly phone itself works.
900 LEDs but only 1 color for them?
Nothing will make me believe in Nothing..
"I like it, I lIke it A LOT (Jim Carey Voice) ...looks like a phone a storm trooper would carry!"
"""So what phone do you own?""
*Nothing*"
Its just look like an apple iphone 11 to me. I know chinese are masters at reverse engineering..
These lights will look much better on the black colour phone
Nothing much here
Is it just me or this phone's design is like iPhone. Even the back led ressembles an apple
Now its very challenging to back cover companies which makes back covers for Nothing phone 1 😹
Wow
This is so cool i'm sold.
I'm not getting  the notifications from your channel bro
If apple made Android
"Like another dude say: phones are like the new stander of what used to be cool cars, millennials just want to pull it off and show it to their friends"
"wait, so it doesn't have a fingerprint scanner?"
Amazing
Looks more like a National permit lorry lights 😂
...a more broadly appealing phone until you've abandoned your original fan base.  Sound familiar? ---- which brand/company is he/are you talking about?
It will cost around $400 for 8GB Ram Variant And $450 for 12GB RAM Variant. Its Confirmed
What matters is the software experience. Everything else dissapears after the initial excitement
And more!!!!
it's like some cyber punk phone. love it
That subtle hint towards oneplus was epic 😂😂
Does it has a micro SD card slot or are they going the apple rout and I'm I going to be force to use a cloud storage solution wish would suck by the way even if the phone has large internal storage.
"A few adjustments makes it killer and futuristic 
1. black in colour
2. RGB customisable lights at the back"
"Glass back with function
Glass breaks
Good luck finding glass for the brand just starting up
No back cover except transparent one to show up the light... 
Nice new shiny thingy..."
LED notification is not really enough. Fans loved one plus for it's software and good hardware. So it depends on how smooth the performance is
chinese phone with undercabinet LED strip for $699
The founder is swedish and the companys headquarters are in London 😂
Such an expensive Lamp 😅😅
Bro come on it looks like iPhone 11 and 12 everyone just copied apple
"Yes sound familiar, it's the story of OnePlus 😌"
This is actually really cool
I hope we can change the colour of some of the LEDs got notifications
to me its an gimick but to people who are into this niche they might find this pretty cool
It should have RGB strips instead white LEDs. Asus ROGs had this already but limited area.
But looks very similar to apple?
"Man, I remember waiting for a invite for the One Plus One. Such a wild time!"
"The presentation clearly shows that it is not at all the phone you yourself would go for, and if it is true, the who would find any fault to that when the phone is really of the type  - 'much ado about nothing'. 

To be frank, I think, after few days of use, most consumers (if not too young - teen / teen+) would, without much cry (if not too expensive), get over such 'slick', glitzy (!), razzmatazz  hardware (if just seen the back portion). Additionally, sometimes these lighting options may not be proper for users needing the much needed battery charge when one is outside and / or with minimal chances of finding a charging outlet. 

Also, the jiggling action to check how much is charged could easily give the much needed scratches (pun intended) on the screen (as it may not always be possible to charge over a smooth surface)."
"To be fair they could create their own cases, that have a transparent back where the light is. Maybe also, so the light can be in the color of the case."
I spy a PowerBook Wallstreet in the background. 👀
"It's a risk definitely. Think LG Wing, which I'm using now. It stole me from Samsung totally. So yeah, you are right, it chisels away a small group of customers. Sadly, for LG, the Wing is also their swansong. Plus yes, I am looking at getting this Nothing"
Take my money!
This gives me one plus vibes when they launched
Waiting for the camera results
"I’d be interested in learning the specs of the phone. It looks super dope imo, but function before form for me"
iPhone 11 and S22. Wow so cool!
Over hyped not exactly exciting
"they definitely hyped it, and the lights are cool... beautiful future / cyberpunk aesthetic..  but I thought they were really going to innovate with the core design... to give us something new, not just surface.  people would embrace something truly creative... truly different.  

unfortunately they're just riding apple's wake like everyone else.. and apple has been dead for years.  
something will take them down, but this is just new clothes.  when what we need is a new everything."
Mk definitely don't like the iphone 😂

"They want my money ? Make a phone with :
A headphone jack
A SD card reader
A user swapable battery
Spare part for years
And top display, battery life and spec with a clean interface and no bloatware
And even if it's 2000 $, i'll get your phone...

Right now i'm running a farephone, less sexy, but more usable
(also please IR blaster, QI charging and NFC would be cool :° )"

Iphone 12 transparent mod
👆👆 HiT ME UP congratulations you are among my Lucky winners....
"It’s probably a safe bet that the phone will be great with software. But the camera probably isn’t going to strike fear in any of the big oems. Oneplus, after all these years, still hasn’t quite reached the huawei,Apple or Samsung level."
👆👆 HiT ME UP congratulations you are among my Lucky winners....
"I dont really get the led lights lighting up on the back....I mean...everytime I put my phone down....its with the back down so to me ,it just seems wierd and is of no use at all."

"Bmlehhh who cares. The phone today is outstanding. A few lights here or there to say, ""look at me""... No"
👆👆 HiT ME UP congratulations you are among my Lucky winners....
First time we see so much attention on the back of the phone in a world where people are slapping the back cover.
👆👆 HiT ME UP congratulations you are among my Lucky winners....
That was remembered me to Sony Xperia SP along ago
👆👆 HiT ME UP congratulations you are among my Lucky winners....
"Wow, flashing lights to catch the attention of customers. That's very dope. I wonder who was he first to do it, Tron in the 80s? Neon lights of the 70s? the fishermen who use a torch light to catch fish..?"
is the led white only or it has multiple choice of colors?
This phone is sick
I'm an investor and they have made special back cover  for it ! You will see the phone once it's available. The phone was created with that in mind and ex Dyson Head of designs made sure it looks great
"@Some Random Gamer Why would you need the entire back of the phone covered? The point of phone cases is to prevent fall damage, which is caused by impacts to the corners of the phone. Also, I don't know if you know this or not, but there are such things as clear cases.

I personally don't use cases on any of my phones though."
@xlar54 why?
You're an investor? I'm so sorry for your loss. :(
"Dyson? The vacuum cleaner company?.. whatever back cover you put on this thing is either going to be Swiss cheese, almost useless, or defeat the entire point of the phone and render it another shitty, overpriced midranger from a company only good at hype."
"Torch light how to turn on in this phone
What about service centers"
My sympathy for back cover manufacturers
They took us from staring at screens to staring at the back of devices
nothing
Whats the screen size of this phone 6.1'
Can it fit in a iphone 12 case?
“When you look at the light pattern you will be able to see who calling even when the phone is muted” yea because looking at the screen and seeing who is calling is not as good 😂
"@Jonas or maybe when people are resting near you and you're expecting a call on silent mode, or maybe just a notification"
@Subbyツ  yea if your phone is 100+ meters away from you in the dark then blinking light will be and advantage.
​@Jonas yes it will. It's already been used as a source of information before.
"@Subbyツ having a smart watch can be a advantage in many situations, having blinking light as a information source will never be."
This phone looks like Star Wars Production Design and I dig it a lot 👀🌞
Whatever you think people I don't know I am Android user I love this one Nothing phone Definitely I should try and by buy this..❤😂😂
"If they bring it in the colour of blue,red and black that will look bomb"
Till 3:31 mkbhd was talking about lights only 😌
"Yooo, this is amazing! The deaf community can finally experience the custom sound ringtones for contacts/apps/etc, but with light! I really  hope the OS on it is great too because this really more inclusive to the differently-abled."
@Enuma Elish In the deaf community we don’t see it as missing a part.
"@O’Reagano Are you part of the ""hearing community""? Is there a ""blind community""? I don't know how it is for actual deaf people but I wouldn't want to be lumped into a "" community"" because I have or lack a certain physical trait. Imagine being automatically classified as a member of a community because of a trait beyond your control, maybe I'm overthinking it but if some people I didn't know showed up in my space and started acting overly familiar because we're both part of the ""people with bad eyesight community"" it would feel like some sort of pandering."
@Enuma Elish Bro… the deaf community is real thing and has been for a while. What does social media have to do with anything?
“Finally”? Have you been living under a rock lol
Ladys if your man wanted to buy this phone he is cheating 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cheenja Fon

"Since it is a new company, i feel like NOTHING had to do something creative. And i think the back LEDs are their way of standing out from all regular phones out there. Honestly, i think they did a pretty good job at that, but let's see how the people react to it when it is released 🤷🏼‍♂"

Keep making more broadly appealing phones till you leave the company for nothing.
"🅗🅘🅣 🅜🅔 🅤🅟 👆,,,,,"
But we still are gonna put a case over it so the gimmicky lights wont be that cool
"🅗🅘🅣 🅜🅔 🅤🅟 👆,,,,,"
"Thanks for the video but unfortunately it's not very informative apart from those (pretty useless gimmicks). 
Fact is, that we know nothing about this phone yet (afaik). It could be terrible and this is what I would like to find out."
"🅗🅘🅣 🅜🅔 🅤🅟 👆,,,,,"
"What type ur phone?
Me : nothing"
"🅗🅘🅣 🅜🅔 🅤🅟 👆,,,,,"
How can this be legal. The design is 100 % an iPhone. 😂And would you show the front of the phone to. The phone has two sides you know. 😂
"🅗🅘🅣 🅜🅔 🅤🅟 👆,,"
"So using notification led's on the back of the phone..., because it's a more complicated and more expensive feature instead of using the screen to do exact the same ?
The general design is as boring as any iPhone.

When someone designs a phone that is like a stick, could be like a nVidia Shield Pro remote..., and you unfold it to get to the bigger screen, but has notifications and stuff on the sides of the folded phone, then we start taking about something new.

Until then, this is just a gimick of blinking LED's."

"It’s beautiful, I wish the iPhones looked like this"
"@Brickandmorty The people who realise that it is a gimmick which causes even more problems like repairibility, cases, battery. Also this phone is just not good design in general, it looks like a cheap toy knockoff of an iPhone which would never pass the Apple Design Team.

One of the most beautiful phones I've ever seen has to be the Note 20 Ultra, other good designs are the iPhone 13 Mini or Google Pixel 6XL and especially the S22 Ultra."

"Why does this feel so much like a paid promotion. You showcased and talked about exactly what they asked you to, without being able to talk about the specs, screen quality, gaming performance, battery life (which will be abysmal for a phone full of lights), what exactly was the point of this video other than to create hype for the brand. Totally unnecessary video without any information on what actually matters which is what is inside the phone.

the fact that they obviously didn't want you to talk about the rest of the phone suggests that just like their headphones, this is another form over function product that will be similarly overpriced and over hyped."
"@Nothing As I made clear in my original post and in my reply, I know what an embargoi is. Also In my original post was the point I made that this video was completely pointless other than to do the marketing and create hype for the company. I understand the company, what I said was that making a video on behalf of the company while missing out any information that might actually be of value was pointless and that still stands. Your replies have been equally as pointless as I already addressed everything you've brought up in my original comment."
@Beep_Boop_Beep Lmao my account was created before the company in case you didn't realise and also this is industry standard embargo and obviously a company will want to market something as amazing even if it is pointless?
"@Nothing lmao bro, why is your account a Nothing fanboi account 💀 dead.
Also, read my comment again, i already said all that, I work in Tech, i know how the industry works. What I said was this video did nothing (get it) to tell me about the things that matter hence it was completely pointless and just playing into the companies hands. The phone will be mid range trash like the earphones but here it is getting all this hype for some RGB that only has one colour lol"
"Because he legally can't talk about the specs or OS without being sued or such. Companies like Samsung, Xiaomi, Google and Nothing places ""embargo""s or reviewers which state they cannot reveal or say certain things about a device before the specific date of reveal.

Mrwhosetheboss made a video on embargo's which you should check out."
"Also the phone doesn't look 'different'. It looks EXACTLY like an iPhone. Another chinese iPhone clone to add to the pile.
There are companies who are pushing the envelope on mobile device design, Nothing is not one of them."
I would buy one because its different its refreshing and its futuristic like sum out of marvel or star wars but I really think they shouldn't make it look like an iPhone like try to be more original with the design add some curve edges on the screen etc

This crap is doom to fail from the beggning the phones are so crisp and crambly  99.9% use hard cases which are never transparent, and those that are will yellow in a week or so. Especially if they'll ask 1k$ for it. There's nothing wrong with a 400$ Xiaomi, nothing it can't run and or run well."

"This is like slapping a cheap blinking toy from the dollar store on the back of your phone and calling it ""innovation"". On top of an iPhone ripoff no less. And who the hell leaves their phone facing down on a typical basis? I guess that red blinking light is great to announce to EVERYONE that you are filming them. Also great for getting people's attention during a lockdown in China when the government hijacks your phone and uses it as a PA system to remind the public to resist their soul's desire for freedom."

Can't wait to see how it's going to be priced :)

It'll be launch in 25k to 30k INR in India
"why isn't it a multi color LED ? Nokia 3220 was the dopest phone with stunning notification LED during my college days and the last i had was Xperia SP , why are current phone missing them ?"
Cries in OnePlus :D
3:20 finally i found something that makes this video not so perfect! warpwarp
It is basically a light show
Compromising recording led
"""so you know who is calling just by looking at it when it's muted"" yeah, but if you turn it around it just says the name on mine for the past 10 years at least 😂. The thing with different sounds was, that you know who calls when it's in your pocket."
He's definitely talking about OnePlus on the sounds familiar part
Felt like subliminals for one plus 😂😂
Sounds familiar 😂

"@Marques Brownlee  Hi Friend i have couple of doubts regarding recent news or roamers not sure but heard that tesla is into mobile industry . my questions are

2. If that is true with the use of star link he can provide uninterrupted  network and fast internet  through star link is that possible?
3. Also heard that he is trying to control mobile through mind (Neuralink) whether this is possible to make something which can be controlled through mind ?

Thank you for your videos it is really helpful for me. Also i am not sure whether you are going to answer my question here but , when you find time kindly respond to my comment . Thank you much ."

This phone will be fun but not a high tech
"''oh it ooks like an iphone 12 with a transparant back but also that's pretty cool'' 
are you kidding me ?
it's one of THE BEST designs ever !!!"

10 years later it will be available on iphone
225k likes and 0 dislikes.....how is this even possible 😯😯
with this phone your dad will always catch up to you using your phone at 3am
whats more fascinating is the design of it being similar to iphones we can finally be able to experience a bit of ios with lower price maybe
Upload more videos of this mobile
nice
it's full of gimmicky features that you don't need
Is there nothing else in the phone except the lights? Want to know more about the rest of the device.
These are gonna become collectors items once the phone goes through their life cycle..pretty genius
This company lacks ideas for practice real time usage
Bro ur telling about the phone or just its LED
Only over hype
it looks very ugly for me
I liked nathing phone
The work of a stupid businessman with a lot of bluffs.  Is the innovation he is talking about making the front like the Galaxy and the back like the iPhone?  Comparing him to Jobs is like saying the Nazis and America are the same.
I think that lights used for reels
What about the software?
kinda like oneplus which had cynagen
"Phone looks cool but hopefully it comes with a flagship SoC not average midranger. Also good camera, display, battery & 3.5 mm Jack 🚀"
Good
That coded ringtone is dope....
holy shit !!!! no dislike in the video
im not going to lie its definetly caught my attention and ive become very interested in it I just wish I heard more on the software and what makes it different in there as well because it does look a lot like an iphone I just wonder what they are going to do to stand out from the rest (other than the back of the phone having flashing lights for notifacations)
"Yes put your phone face down to scratch the shit out of it, because you don't care about money"
"haha, ""can't show the front of the phone."" *proceeds to show us the front of the phone glyph interface etc.."
The phone looks like something out of a Star Wars set.
"You haven't talked about the nothing phone specifications deeply, although holding it handy"
Does it come in black..
Launching date and price in india
Wow I really want one 😮❤❤
It's Carl Pei reinventing OnePlus all over again.
Camera system looks like my iphone 11 😂
"I like this Stil, of simply nothing. And the light with the clean transparent back looks futuristic"
"It's pretty interesting how companies are slowly bringing back the concept of ""fun/cool"" cellphones design. Like the flip phones back on the 00s-10s."
@M. Milo Its about the cool thing .
@Harry Matrix I have no idea how your comment relates to mine.
"@M. Milo Actually you are right , i have an iphone and i never you use it. I go outside have fun come home do everything on pc , watch everything on pc and i use whatsapp on desktop so yeah you could say that about everyphone."
"It looks like an iPhone with a couple of flashing lights. I’ve got no idea what’s “cool” about this beyond the first five minutes, until you realize this is irrelevant and you’re never going to actually use any of this because your phone is generally IN YOUR POCKET OR PURSE."
The notification and light sound style is very toy ish. Crazy that its the default choices...
Why would anybody look at the back of the phone when front have so much details?🤔 Just keep your phone upside up! 😁
Not for me. I don't watch the back of my phone
actually the notification LEDs was there in Nokia's era
"...and even more generally appealing, and then you become OnePlus by releasing a bland offering that offers nothing unique.

Coming from a long time OP user, I really hope this brings back some of what made OP great when Carl was a part of it."
Imagine being marques and having the chance to try every single new piece of tech .. just imagine
"No UWB, no buy"

OverHype 😒😑
So it's an Android phone with a lot of lights. Got it
I was highly expecting and saving money for the phone but after seeing u r video i would say this lighting kinda thing is nt so important and it's looking weird.... Mainly the red light when u r doing videos🙄🥴 means we can't do prank with our frnds also🙄... And after using BackCover what is the use of the Back lights.... And the body to screen ratio is also nt satisfactory
is realy intresting
"This phone must have a solid battery life , the lighting is just too much."
Looks Crazy… that’s called something actually innovative… thumbs up to Nothing! 🤩♥️👌🏻
So are we gonna ignore the fact that no one keeps their phone with the screen facing down 🙂
Nothing will turn out to be Nothing at all…
SWEET!
wait you can't show the front of the phone or you can? or i lost track of things 2:24
want this!
"Apple: Nothing can beat the apple!
Nothing: Ladies & Gentlemen that’s right!here we are NOTHING!"
I kinda like this design. The main reason why I haven't upgraded from my s9 was because it is fine the way it is. The led let's me know If I missed something and is a reminder of what I forgot. Not many new phones have this and they don't have the headphone jack and that is a major reason why I can't upgrade.
Waiting for this phone 📱 thanks for showing 😊 love from India
"But where's the headphone jack, tho?"
"Ouch, nice Jab at OnePlus! 😂"
"So instead of an AOD that has perfectly readable notifications, Nothing is expecting people to keep their phones screen-side down and decipher Morse code light flashes when someone calls or messages them? What happens when those LEDs start burning out? Stupid gimmick made to impress techtubers and redditors. At this point a removable battery would be far more innovative than whatever this shit is supposed to be."
Because most of them knows that making enthusiast devices doesn't make money....
Review Solana phone
I hope battery doesn't die too early
I'd buy it
"Looks nice and lovely, but at the end of the day i am putting a case on it. So it becomes pointless to me. Unless they make it in different colors, RGB leds and a very nice clear case that doesnt yellow after a few months."
"It looks neat. But I have the notifications in my settings locked down so much that I just don't need another avenue to see them. They're few and far between so I know an app based off of the sound. The software is what I am interested in, especially since the company is a startup by one of the former OnePlus creators. But I will always be disappointed by yet another phone launching without a headphone jack."
Cool
can't believe i wasn't subscribed yet
niice
Lol. This is the story of 1+😎
"When you can see all the notifications, reminders, incoming calls, alerts, etc on always on amoled screen on the front, a simple single led notification light is enough...  Rather can appreciate only for the unique back design..."
My nubia z11....The notification ring still makes me keep it. 5.5 years on  6/64gb sd820. Works like a charm still. I see Nothing serves my purpose of standing out 👍🏼
Hope future versions will have RGB lights for customisation 😅
The phone looks like how people would've imagined smartphones before they were invented
Bro we have gone through the RGB phase with PC and laptops. Didn't like it. What's the point of making an average phone and sticking some LED in it.
from afar thoguh it looks like an iphone with its glass back broken and didnt want to go for repairs
"Pitch this story. Some random person presents a phone to the other random person who bought the phone of nothingness. They decide to show the phone's backs, where some random person's back of the phone is full on glass similar to iPhones, but then the other random person who has the phone of nothingness strikes back by showing it's back of the phone and saying ""The phone you're showing me is NOTHING like mine!"". The person who owns the regular phone is like ""Oh really? You wanna durability test it?"", and in the process they durability test their phones at head high. The story ends with the regular phone valiantly surviving the durability test with the phone of nothingness showing (insert random word here) results. 
Fact - The phone of nothingness presented here is Nothing Phone 1 in case if you are confused."
It's quite unique concept ..will definitely consider it after some reviews... because at the end all you interact with is software
May be consider keeping phone display upside
The matte case will look very cool and there will be no handprints on it
"yes! I contributed to kickstart one plus, investing $50 to make sure they'll keep the price down and kill the ultra high price smart phone market. Then they turn on us, I get it Marques, i see what you did there. Had to be said."
"Yes they copied from iPhone 12 , but its an android so it will be cheaper"
"so nice device
thanks for sharing"
impressive
Not better than Sony xperia.
so how did you get it
Is the back glass or plastic?
Reminds me of old sony xperia u. It had a lot better lighting system but the problem was it drained a lot of battery
i love apple designed phones but i hate the company and the software so this is perfect for me
Lmfaoooo what the hell is that ☠️
Woah
Looks cool but if the camera system sucks no one will buy it as most care about cameras these days
"What name your phone !!!, i have Nothing 😅😅😅"

So long ago One plus and nothing mobile company CEOs partner's.
🤙
Tamilan
"as far as design goes, it't not all that unique. Looks like an iPhone and that's what most people will see.
Some might think it's just a debrand skin so back to your point, yeah, they all look pretty much the same, this one included,

That glyph also looks like a G for google somewhat merged with apple's logo with some extra bits like the charging line and camera ""ring"""
One Plus LOL
This is pretty cool ngl
loved it
it would be looking dope with black panel and red LED's ❤❤
India 🇮🇳
Looks cool... But I will pass on this.. I love my Vivo X70 Pro.. 👍👍
this looks like kids mobile...with leds and those childish ringtones...this was only a overhype up product
He broke down how one plus betrayed their fan base  neatly so.
"nothing company made a good start on this. i believe they will be a big threat to apple. i hope they won't end up like huawei. apple is a jealous company. very, very jealous"
is must buy thing for sure
This nothing is something 🙃
I Don't like
only 2 cameras?! no thank you
"Gotta say, IMO this is the coolest phone in 2022, i always love the shape of the new iPhone form factor (12 and 13) but I'm not a big fan of iOS (i prefer andro 😁) don't like big ass notch either, and also lightning connector (usbc ftw 🙌) so this phone is like a crossover I've always wanted"
"i am definetly going to buy this phone,"

Mkbhd Only back! why bro?
"This is literally useless, no one looks at the back of their phone for notifications or ringtones. Always on displays are a thing. It even has a handicap of showing if you're recording. The only thing this phone would do is flash in public and attract attention."
Will Buy Definitely❤️
"Was that a 1+ reference by the end of the video??!! Opss!! I didn't say it. You saw ""NOTHING""."

I wish we would have been able to see more of the interface. How smooth it is.
Nothing really impresses me about this phone to be honest..
"As someone who doesn't use screen protectors, this phone makes me anxious."
When you come to phone
"Does look and sound sick😺....I just wonder if their battery quality  will be good with all those lights. And the software of course, what's it gonna be?😅"
Nice video
Amazing advice
the bottom led strip and the dot are a good use case for morse code. Not that everyone uses it but still will have great time playing with it haha.
why tf would you put notification LEDs on the BACK of a phone?
And the feature.... All we needed was something that drains battery more.
Just wow ⚡️🔥
That straight up looks like an iPhone 12 with a dbrand sun on the back
"Cool lights, what are they useful for? Nothing."
Gimmick phone.
"Its bullshit that you are making video to show back of the phone, this is literally nothing and whole idea of that guy is to exploit people by building nothing and selling nothing but crap"
Well they aspire to stand out from the rest of the android market and so far i think they are. Now all of it boils down how the hardware performs and what price it will be offered at
It looks quite promising from an android user’s perspective however for an iPhone user it doesn’t give much… why would an apple user switch to this? Back LED? Apple can make a case and call it Lightning Case…
I think its hyping too much.. it doesn't look unique to me just becuz it has some LED lights on the back
Looks like a child of iphone 11 and pixel 5 🙂
"Nothing looks like iPhone 4.  Nothing is Android base and the ringtone function already played for many years.  So, Nothing is ""Nothing"", nice name."
Is anybody else concerned about how he got the phone
In the early 2000 where those Nokia modded feature phone with transparent casing and RGB LEDs? This feels like exactly that. Much nostalgia lol.
That's led lights are sick 🔥
"Depending on price, I definitely would switch. I love the custom lights on back. Can't wait to find out the price. I would definitely rock it."
"GSMArena lists it as around 470 Euro, so this thing is *disgustingly* overpriced."
Looking at blinking lights on the back when you have more and better information on the front seems stupid to me.
Do you by any chance work with Morse coding ? 😂 or do you have any other reason to feel blinking white lights give you better information then a screen? 😂
350-400$ they will probably sell for a slight loss or very small profits like the oneplus 1
I converted the India price to USA and it's Abt 350$
what's this name 💀💀💀
What's wrong with using the screen to see such notifications? NOTHING 😂
Can't cover with a case😆😆😆😆😆
"People in 2122:what the heck is different 
Save NOKIA! NOKIA forever 🔪🔪"
why do black people have white palms?
Intro: 20syl - Five Laps to Go
how did he miss the obvious. its a star wars Inspired phone and even has the lightSaber in the back..
"""Unique looking phone?"" White iPhone 12 called, wanted its design back"
Samsung released that glowing notification function way back 😂
Phones are already same. I'd go for one which has gimmicks like this
I just watched another 7-minute video about Nothing. 😂
i really do be thinking that the phone LITERALLY had NO hardware judging by the name
"I see nothing in particular...

Phillipines."
This phone is a gimmick.
"If the LEDs was RGB, and customised.... crazy!"
meh
"What's your phone?
*It's Nothing"
To be Frank i didn't like the design of it
Dami fon
reminds me of the game limbo with the neon light mission
Just image it in Matt black  and the white light glows up 😌
This is future
Please do a video on vivo x80 pro
It seems like Os is bare Aosp with some modifications and additional features i guess
"Yo what about the camera?
Is nothing 1 is iphone killer???"
Not impressive 😣
Truly big fan of nothing phone design 😍 dope
We need that Solana Mobile Phone review
So they’ve made an iPhone replica that looks unfinished. And an AirPods Pro replica that looks unfinished. Innovative.
A different design??? It looks like an unfinished iPhone. These companies always come around. You can’t reinvent the wheel. It’s done.
that's cool but i will stick with a phone that will have a  made there mark already but will wait for full review
❤️❤️❤️ Love it
Imagone your phone get electric short but you think it is a notification
WTF video u make man😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬
"This is a novelty & this is a company mocking the iPhone, et al. This is what apple should do to make each contact have a different ring tone, et cetera.👍"
It looks like an iPhone
Finally something different nothing is trying. Reminds me of nokia 3220 disco lights phone
"This video has >5m views, you got your answer there already..."
"Thank you for trying your best to introduce it, but it’s nothing special though."
Am I the only one who noticed the LTT mouse pad? Haha
i would buy it some day over my ONE PLUS 8T
Gives that cyberpunk look for being transparent
It will be amazing if they give RGB LED's.
Put two gaming triggers on it and I am sold.
Always use BACK COVER
Gimmick
I don't need that stuff
BEHN
"I will definitely order one! I prefer the box design over the current rounded shape every single phone has! Love the huge dig at oneplus, correct to call them out! They have lost their identity completely."
SUCH A WASTE. IT ONLY WORKS IF THIS COMPANY USES APPLE CHIPS IN A LOWEST PRICES..
"Looks futuristic. .other than that, NOTHING special.
*just like others feature less ""smart"" phone."
Indian * what ever it backside of phone we use backcovers 😁
"The shape of the phone really appeals to me personally, and the LED's look really cool, i really miss those. However, my one question is..who the hell keeps their phone screen down on the table at all times? Kind of loses all its magic. And i assume the price will be at least $800, which for me personally seems too steep for a gimmick. After switching from flagships to multiple budget (up to $400) phones, i concluded that its not worth spending that much for a phone, no matter magic it offers"
The Ending note😂🔥
The new startup of launching phone 🚫 is look perfect for design also screen is primium but the chin of the border look some bulky & awkward I'm not to much satisfy by the chin  as there commitment the chin is not so slim anymore
SHIT phone)))))
Those ringtones sound...annoying.
"One of the few companies to actualy produce thing before it was sold, looks amazing and it's functional too.
propably gonna buy 2nd gen"
"Nothing is basically average delivery with a gimmick,thats it ."
Overhyped!!
This will be expensive af!
Nothing Phone back glowing logo look similar with Apple logo!
Is the back flush?!
"And more and more and more
Until



Everyone is left with Nothing"
Great Innovation! But I guess it won't trigger the market.
the ringtones made me sick! 🤮
Patti show ennokke parajal eth ann 😹🤣
Thats iphone 12
"That ""One"" 😉 shot you took! 😏"
when we got the full review?
With nice light show.
I loved your last comment of losing the actual Fan Base and the brand philosophy while trying appeal more and more and more people and end up making a phone which doesn't stand out amidst the crowd. Which actually happened with OnePlus so I hope Carl Pie this time try make their philosophy more broadly accepting and appealing rather than losing their own image trying to be more mainstream. Like Apple which makes things popular the way they want rather than trying to replicate what Samsung does. In the End it's Samsung who ends up copying iPhone again.
How much is this bad boy
"If Nothing is free, i will get it. Maybe, nothing is free 😅"
First look is absolutely futuristic 🔥🔥
Fancy phone!
Wish you could think of talking about dimensions comparison between iPhone 12 and nothing 1...
I will surely gonna buy it .... Its DOPE
Beautifully explained... Nice phone specially built quality. Keep it up.
"U can't use back case for protection, what when back display breaks"
"Give this phone to an average iPhone user and telling them that this is iPhone 14
They would believe"
inspired by cheap Chinese baby toys
Please bro can you give a phone for me ☺️
what? thats it? there are lights in the back? lmao. not enough to sell.
they've done it again 👏
4:23 u can actually see the screen of the phone
Yall saw it before
06:09 One plus feels attacked.
"Yea it looks different, try looking at tech other than Apple"
It looks like nothing
Does it have indisplay fingerprint???
It all depends on the price
How much money
Bearded look kills me cool 🆒
Ohhhhh⚡️
I liked the ringtones
Please subscribe
He killed it at 6:07 😂😂
The thing is will there be phone cases and screen protectors for it? OnePlus barely has some third party accessories for it even though the brand has been out for quite awhile.
"The original fanbase referred is of OnePlus and not iPhone. This company CEO has quit OnePlus. Actual OnePlus was really cool when started and went down the hill (fans, not masses) becoming a twin of Realme later."
that phone should come with cyberpunk 2077 addition
"All this is cool, but ""WHY?"". I can look at my screen and it's pretty much what I do whole day."
This is just dope! Feels awesome... Can't wait for what they bring out next!
To me that light doesn't add up anything! I'll be using backcover anyway! -_-
Sick burn bruh!!!! 😂😂😂😂
What's unique in nothing?
Wonder if it could fit in an iphone case
"""what I am allowed to show you is the back""  - feels like mkbhd being used by nothing team for nothing in payment.

If it's any thing like the buds. I feel you should just hold off and next review should be post launch and post 2 weeks usage.  And talk about service, support, software and upgrades , parts availability.


If you do 3+ videos of nothing phone, you are putting your channels viewers to garbage and losing respect.

I have put mrwhosetheboss there

It is the OnePlus strategy i hate."
Those ringtones are giving me some serious Ridley Scott Alien vibes…the sounds all the machines and computers made aboard the Nostromo? So cool. I’d buy this phone just for the back LED and those ringtones 🤓
"Congratulations you've been shortlisted for a prize!!! Send a text to acknowledge your prize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^🎁"
This phone looks hideous to me
"Let’s respect the effort made not to show the frontside of the phone 

Update: only at the beginning 🙃"
"@Fayez Eloraby 
Legit man"
Is that a scam ?
"Congratulations you've been shortlisted for a prize!!! Send a text to acknowledge your prize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^🎁"
so cool
Awesome video
"Beautiful device. This beats all the other ""Me Too's""."
"theres literally a working decent folding phone out there already, and they even working on slide, roll, translucent, prependiculer phone and shit. and this phone come up with a gimmicky led light and call them self ""different"". nahh"
It is only the phone that everyone uses without back cover .
Is this phone expensive? Is it android?
Hopefully it has a notification slider when it comes to North America.
Absolutely an iphone copy in design..no one is bothered about those led lights and ringtone lights.. no revolutionary feature at all.. We can say this will be a similar phone in the range of google pixel 4a or below that.
Looks like an alien communicator lol
RIP Back covers
Phone gives of a nothing iPhone vibes
Then throws a back case on
"for me, a phone should be minimalist, functional and up to date software over time. rest of the things are gimmicks for me over a long period of time they don't matter at all."
If they priced it early OnePlus-ish I'll just get one period
How to gid rid of ads in ur channel? its annoying
Thank you so much bro. My life saver.
Worst ringtones I've heard in a while and you can download apps to give you that notification LED and change the colors/patterns/size/location.... you get the idea. I have that set up on my S21 Ultra. Super nice
"If it has same hardware and software experience as my current Samsung and the price being fairly the same, I would probably give it a go."
LED phone🤕
Gimmick
"Nice Design 👌
I love this look 🥀"
"Transparent? Really...?
What's the point of that???
You can't succeed by being different just for the purpose of being different....
Samsung, Apple and cheap Chinese phones ... they're going to rule ...
That's it ..."
Nothing will become something.
How about cameras processor memory
"2 years from now they would be saying ""it was nothing"""
"Marques at 1:10 , I am only allowed to shwo the back of the phone. 
Also Marques at 2:25 , here’s the display 😂"
Yeah I don't love that the only part you're able to showcase is the physical device. Feels like the Microsoft Surface Duo all over again.
How much price in India? Expected
yaha pe nhi milne wala bhai...
"Nice idea but this idea is only for people that love to impress the next person, which is kind of sad in itself, so you will purposely place your handset screen down everytime your out? I would like to know the percentage of ppl that place there handsets on a table upside down, I bet it won't be much. So given this will appeal to only that love to brag.., and not that I care much but others might that the SOC is dated so it won't be competitive for flagship status so mid tier pricing will be essential.
We have edge lighting on android for the front I can see some company's incorporate this but with just a line of led on the back. It's a new idea that will catch on that's all.."
Looked like a Starwars smartphone to me!
"6:32 exists:
They already knew:
They don't wanna to do anything about that:"
"I really like the ""what people thought the future would look like"" style, but indeed I'd not stick to the brand if the following iterations degenerated into a generic mid/high-range."
The lights syncing and stuff is pretty gimmicky tbh. No one has time to remember a bunch of different glyphs. Great for disabled people though.
That means I can't use backcover
"So much shilling going on the comment section. Prolly the people hired by “nothing”
And brownlee to meet their targets"
for me its a cool phone + it looks like an iphone 🔥
It’s just another normal phone with some childish led features. Influencers like brownlee and other people hyping it get paid in millions.
That “sounds familiar?” revealed Apple’s strategy in the best way possible! Great job! Totally agree!✅✅
phone case company going to adjust for those led lights. imagine having a light indicator that can do morse code... cute.
"July 12th is my birthday, might be interesting to see"
Toy like features.... 👍
It’s an alien phone with built in alien robotic worm that enters your brain through your ears
I’m waiting on the specs and pricing. The transparent back cover and the new features have me super interested.  I’m a Samsung/Android nut btw.
about $500
Good business using 10cents led lights🤣🤣🤣
"Nothing- apple can I copy your homework 
apple - yes why not but please don't copy completely 😆"
"Damn I want something like that but with color leds , that seems so futuristic"
How is parsh
"a case defeats much of the purpose unless it is a clear case. but even then, a clear case does not provide much protection from drops."
Damn I miss my led indicator like I have different color for different people son I know who writes or call me… now I can use diferente tones but I don’t like to have my phone with the sound on
"It’s looks just like every other phone two camera, all screen one side etc. if they wanted stand out they needed to do something along lines of what Tesla did with cyber truck breaking into the competitive truck market."
"I most DEFINATELY will be switching to nothing phone!!
I believe in Pete's vision too... so theres that as well...
But I LOVE this phone!!"
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏👏👏🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Carl Pei's ultimate - HOW TO CREATE HYPE EVEN BEFORE LAUNCH !!
Nothin' 😉
I liked ringtones
so RGB phone is coming
"All anyone really wants is a durable phone with a decent camera that holds a charge... Start there and other fancy stuff means nothing if the screen cracks on cotton and is dead before your lunch break... Nokia strength screen, hard rubber/plastic case then add features"
"It looks like an iPhone with a transparent mod… Sooo original. The lights on the back are just a gimmick, it won’t add to anything and will just kill your battery."
"6:32 You're not talking about Oneplus, no?"
"Very important detail, the founder of this company Carl pei, is the same guy that co founded oneplus,  Oneplus has settled but this guy has not ❤"
most of the people use their phones with case.
Feels like an ad
Phone looks like something from the Star Wars universe
So basically it’s a full on gimmick phone.  I mean to each there own. But I personally keep my phone on silent 90 percent of time. And I either hear it vibrate or my Apple Watch vibrates. Honestly at 30 I stop caring about the look of a phone.
Dude what about os - camera clarity
"تذكّر، اعظم فشل هو أن لا تحاول..
‎Remember, the greatest failure 
is not to try."
naw
is carl pei still under bbk?
Fucking OnePlus...
How often do people drop their phone with the screen facing down ...
"Impressive. However, how many people are actually going to be keeping their phones upside down that often rather than keeping the screen up and getting the same notifications if not more clearly differentiable than one another, cool idea but not enough for anyone to actually switch."
But why? You will check the phone amyway so why all these lights?
Indefinitely buying it just for those lights in the back 🤩🤩 plus the square locking it looks great
"@angel medina Or what about a matte black Tron: Legacy CLU's Orange in his helmet! 💪🏾.
Bru what about Close Encounters of the Third Kind  when the mothership landed and the strobe lights effects !🔥🔥🔥😂"
@Malik Allen  oh hell yeah definitely
black with a  sith lights would look dope!
I for one look forward to this new OnePlus brand.
Gives me watch dogs vibes
"shame for the US market that nothing seems to be focusing on EU and India, if it's reasonably priced it may be my next phone since I do need an upgrade, looking forward to launch"
"Useless gimmick shit, who would put the screen down on the table? who would look at the phone's back while holding? And snapdragon 778g holy shit!"
"it's a cyberpunk phone.... 






I LOVE IT !"
"I think what it would really take me to switch would be an alternative OS based on it’s own development; like some kind of fresh take on a smooth interface with an underlying UNIX/Linux based phone or very different take on the interface and app offering. Basically, something to rival iOS that isn’t just another repackaged Android setup. 

Android seems sad, generic, and really stale most of the time. The best execution of it I’ve seen is actually from Google, in the Pixel phones. All other implementations seem broken or not unified enough in the experience their design offers. 

At the end of the day, hardware features are interesting, but it’s the actual system that most users gravitate towards, and that’s the most compelling thing for me.

Something entirely new like this would be very risky and take a lot of work, which is probably why we wont see anything like it anytime soon."
Nice of you to talk about and show a phone that the company has no intention on launching here in the US.
"Ah yeah, leds on the back panel... very useful! /s"
Oneplus were broadly appealing once
"Can I have the pastel rubiks cube?
I've looked everywhere, cant seem to find it anywhere 😞"
Really wonder what price it will be...really hope for something around $600 or less
how's the battery affected by the leds? (genuine q)
"Hope, the Nothing 2 will hagve a different design and not look like an iphone. If they dont bring out a cool one I have really no idea what phone  should buy anymore...oneplus becomes shit sadly"
I got Mrwhosetheboss's ad on this vid
Someone needs to innovate. It still looks average. Someone needs to make a glass phone with micro chipping inside the glass . A battery that’s has nuclear energy without the radiation so it could power it for long time . I dk something great. Those phones are so boring now
This reminds me of Teenage Engineering's design code and features quirks.
I believe it will sell a lot... If the price is good... Other than that.... Not the leds.
"people today know about tech and they want solid build, ois on camera, amoled screen big battery and more than 500000 in antutu, there are dozens of 300-400$ priced phones that offer those and nothing phone has a light ring with no ois"
Yayyyyy... My phone glow🙂
so it's an iphone....just with android now lol...
Sorry this is only the back of the phone and i am already in love with it 😍😍😍 can't imagine how the os and the other features will look like..must be also dope!!!
good video and thnaks for the subtitles ;)
"Hold up, what's the point of this phone? It looks ... just like an iPhone...? LED lights on the back but it's not really transparent -- just looks like a skin...huh?"
How will dbrand handle this?
Is there something up with Marques's teeth?
I’m going with the rattttaaaaattaaaa ringtone
Can't wait to buy the second or third gen
Putting a case on that phone is not impossible. It just have to be transparent.
Should I complain If I order and get nothing?
Wow that ring tone would be….as Cartman would say…..hella annoying
"Maybe I’m missing the point, these looks like party tricks. *Yawn*"
Oh man I really love those ringtones
"the chinese , already has it in the market  -  talk is cheap man - tell the nothing guys to wakeup"
That phone looks dope might switch to it when it drops 🤔
"I can imagine the case has holes that it will not cover the LED lighting, I can imagine how creative will be this phone in the future in terms of design and personalization."
Hope the Transparent back cover is strong enough else we wont be using that for sure. No one wants their phone to break and become worthless.
TAKE MY MONEEEEEY....
"The Nothing phone has no reason to exist. It looks and functions exactly like every other smartphone. There, I said it."
"looks beautiful, it’s too bad it has android software"
At what price it will come...?
I won't it now!
"NAAAAAH shudup. if they make the back lights rgb imma buy it immediately 
!!!! or maybe like a different model with rgb lights and a different model with white lights. but anyway....  imma wait for the review and if i have money , im buying it. BEST PHONE DESIGN I HAVE SEEN IN MA LIFE !!!!!"
"Novel idea, one which a bigger company worh more $ will no doubt want to take up. It has potential I suppose, but I can't see it taking 9ff  when teaching about it, I imagine coloured LED lights  I also wonder what protection the front screen has given this 9ne is designed to lie upside down."
"Marques: I am only allowed to show you the back of the phone.
Also Marques: Proceed to show you the front of the phone.

And those LEDs! Wonder what the battery life is like?🤔"
Phone looks great but unless it have some sort of protection bezel(like we have on classic watches) on the front side I have no idea how to use the phone which intended to be carried caseless because I believe screen is far from sapphire on Mohs scale so it makes it extremely easy to scratch
"About time , phones get leds agains....but wtf is that shape ....why the side is not light up ??? Wtf is that 3/4 circle"
"Here's what we need. Unlockable bootloader, not voiding warranty for flashing a custom ROM, and them releasing the software that runs the LEDs (and all software they develop, ideally) as open source.


If they do that, and it's a decent phone, they'll have my money."
worst phone no practicle use
"That ""...... make a good really good phone and abandon the original fanbase"" definitely sounds familiar and hits hard while holding a one plus 7 in hand . RIP 1+"
Nothing special about this phone lol nobody with a brain will leave their iPhone or Samsung phone for this 😂 lights might stop working in a few months
Looks like an iPhone
…. Or just turn around your existing phone and see the damn info on the freaking screen !
I'm in love 😍
It is definitely a good strategy 🤣🤣
"Definitely sounded familiar bruh, literally speaking am getting bored of these new upcoming mobiles"
മലയാളീസ്
I would give it a try
"Nice, really nice"
😍😍😍 bonkers
That final reference to OnePlus... 😂
Paid
So this is the new trend
That OnePlus reference at the end😂
always on display do the same shit
I got a new
Waiting for RGB light!!!
"The back looks cool, but that reminds me of the rog phone，At the same time, it should be noted that the hardware is not excellent, and the software support is not sure good or not.The gimmick is bigger than the reality"
"6:10 Sounds familiar? Oneplus fans - Uh, is he talking about us? Nah, not us. Oh boy, definitely us!"
Peace!
I think I was shown the back of the phone only.
Wtf is wrong with those ringtones 😐
what pricing does it have when it comes to INDIA?????......i wish it will be around 20-25k......if so i will definitely buy it
"Even If I prefer Iphone since very long, this phone is pretty tempting"
This pattern light for each ring tone reminds me of the predators before they go kaboom
6:27 my man spitting facts 🔥
Give us a gaming review?
"What about software, camera , prosessor ."
I saw design even better than iPhone
MKBHD summarized the loss of OnePlus fanbase very aptly
i really wonder how rugged cases will work on this
Sure gonna be interesting to see the battery performance
No use of back cover.
Dayum now that's something unique
Can't use with a phone case
Heyyy what's up it's mkbhd here
How tf u can say something eco friendly when u have to buy 3 extra more packets 😷
I am still not convinced 🤪
"i want these ideas but less corny version of this phone, some of these features are kinda cool"
I see nothing interesting here. Its literally just an android Iphone with a transparent back and led lights on it.
And finally the last sentence indicates whom it is referring to 😅…oneplus↘️
"iPhone without apple logo
:>"
here we go agaib
"There is nothing new, dont justify its a shit phone"
It's look foolish to me
What will be price for this phone ?
It’s all nice but it’s a biggg battery 🪫 drain!
that reminded me a lot of the Sony Xperia U/P/S series with the transparent lighted bar with the navigation buttons. I would like back these cool details that make a phone stand out
Super new feature
that rainbow colour logo on shirt tho..
Looks ugly af
"Now my wait is over, I will definitely buy it with earphones"
Oneplus got its ass kicked by MKBHD. 😂😂
"Sounds very familiar 👀
Seems like what apple is doing in the ios16"
Actually with a clear hard case it will look even closer to their design language of the buds.
Ur camera every youtuber need
Add extra lights that is not a revolution or not a new feature
"When you get confused between ""nothing"" and ""Nothing""..."
Remember Nokia flip….same lighting features…

"The main question will be which US carriers will support it. It's just a paperweight if none of the main US carriers support it (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint). This might just end up being another cool phone that no US customers can use like Huawei and Oppo. I'd give it a try....I've always liked the iPhone look and footprint minus the notch. I especially dislike IOS and the whole Apple ecosystem."

"Looks good but just feels gimmicky.

Like the display / notification is way better when it’s facing up.

When you are charging wirelessly, it will be facing up.

In reality, you’ll rarely use a phone facing down."

"This is look like same to iPhone 11 😂
Not like iPhone 13"
I see a white iPhone 😂😂
How many people put their phone screen on the surface? Coz otherwise there's no point of this phone.
2:10 what if the LED color are RGB?
"What company was he talking about by the way, when he cited abandoning the original fanbase by making more appealing phones?"
"Yea, so it's going to come down to the sensors, expandibility and software. 
People are not going to want to spend hundreds after ALREADY spending thousands to buy a phone to be a daily driver that gets to the edge of the cliff but doesn't commit.
You can put all the candy eye you want on a device, if it doesn't perform it doesn't perform.
It looks like they lost us already with the lack of a headphone jack."
sound familiar? yeah...oneplus
5M
"Tha ringtone was screeching through my ears, ngl."
We know Nothing about this phone
🤩👏
Who lays their phone face down anyways? Chasing those display scratches for some cool LED effects...
"I'm curious about the system specs, and also who is this, or who are they working with? Thanks"
"You'd legit have to be nuts, bat shit crazy, to buy a phone from these clowns. It's been a year and my ear (1) STILL don't work 80% of the time. Right earbud rarely connects. Gotta put it back in the case and take it out multiple times before it will. Heaven forbid your bud start slipping (which happens with wearing masks) and have to push it back in your ear during a phone call, cause it'll end the call 50% of the time. Your settings in the APP lose sync with the earbuds saying ANC is on when it clearly isn't. ANC seemed alright when I got them but many updates later the ANC really impacts the audio in a negative way. Zero response from multiple support requests on their website. They 'sound' fine, when they work. But worst buds I've used from a usability standpoint. You really think their phone is gonna be better? Good luck with that."
"Friend 1: I have Apple
Friend 2: I have Samsung
Friend 3: I have Nothing 
[Everybody feels so sad thinking he doesn't have a phone] 😥"
If this phone was coming to North America I would be interested. As it is now I am not interested.
"POV: This video has no tags!
Viewers: [Now you're thinking how this guy knows this]
Creators: Which software did you use, vidIQ?"
That's sssooo dope. I want one!
The back looks freaking dope
No one puts his phone on its face.
Impressive....Very nice.....Now let's see it in Black.
Looks shocking.
"*Odd light pattern*

Girlfriend: 🤨"
കാണാൻ അടി പൊളി
Best phone ever🔥
I am never gonna use this but its cool.
How the shit does that look different? Its literally an iphone with some lights...
Honestly i doesn’t like such a product from nothing!
"3:48 – Every Sony Ericsson owner knew this feature before, if you are using IMY or EMY ringtone files. These files contain, besides of the actual ringtone, light effects and vibration patterns."
"Yes, and the earlier Xperia series (S, P, U, SP) have a clear strip of notification lights at the bottom of the screen which is dope, the SP even changes color and brightness according to the song and media shown on screen!"
the phone looks futuristic 🤩
Remove selfy camera on the front. Place a small screen on back to utilize the large pixel camera lens on back. Also the flash can be used to fill. And need a dedicated shutter button.
Nothing is gonna take the android space by storm!!!!!
Finally a phone with 2 useful cameras instead of haing 4 just for the trend
damn i want that one so dope....
05:38 How did you come up with this ?
It does not look unique. It’s an iPhone with a transparent back.
I can't show you the front of the phone.........skip to 2:33 for the front of the phone lol
It it me or I thought it was an iPhone
What's the point of the back if it's just gonna be covered by a case?
Must have!
"I feel like the camera inevitably won’t compete with the best phones out there sadly, but man I want this if it can."
"I have nothing ear buds, they are absolute shit"
"He makes a good point. It looks different for gen 1, then years later they will the company will make their phones just like any other company."
OnePlus?😂
എവടെ നോക്കിയാലും nothing 😄😄
I really like the design and the ringtone/light thing that they're doing. If it was loaded with features I'd probably get one but it's gotta meet something like the s22u for me to change devices
"@The Ancients Ancients This company's future is an early, overhyped grave for shitty cheap to midrange products sold at a vast mark-up."
@The Ancients Ancients ur an investor lmao no one should trust your opinion
"This company is the future, with ex Dyson Head of designs on board"
Guess the big thing is what's the camera and video like. It's hard to beat Apple on camera quality. Even Samsung can still fall short in areas.
"love the new see through iPhone 12 ^^

jokes aside the LED feature is super sweet"
I don't like the idea of more notification LEDs. I want to be able to put my phone frontside down in order to not be distracted during a conversation. So really just a bad gimmick for me.
I mean it's a really nice looking phone
😅 the one plus dig
6:10 🤣🤣🤣🤣 you got us Marq. Hope they don't follow their legacy of ditching software & loyal customer base
"I think, to won the market one needs to be vvery different than the existing product. Something like how tesla did. They enter the car market and the features that they provide is so unique that no one has!"
I'll buy any phone that fixes the notification delay on Android phones (doze)
main camera 50 mp 12 mp ultra wide 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 no telephoto lens . snapdragon 778+ 👎🏻 2 main part missing telephoto lens processor nothing is nothing only hype creat
It looks like a broken iPhone 12
This phone will not work with any US carrier. :( Only being mainly released in the UK and AU.
bueno todo bien calidad!!
Wao i just impressive nothing Mobile
Imagine engineering all that design and LED stuff just to put back cover on it.
"@Gigachad never had a single crack in a phone since the invention of smartphones.... although I've never owned an iPhone so that's probably the reason, horrendously cheaply made phones never met a person with an iPhone that isn't cracked...case or no case"
@FlemoEFC1878 Imagine cracking you phone
"@FlemoEFC1878 true... This applies for all Phones, not only nothing... This is the reason most brands provides clear case"
"@FlemoEFC1878 true... This applies for all Phones, not only nothing... This is the reason most brands provides clear cwse"
"@Just some guy with a spectacle no I said correct imagine putting a case on your phone in general, buying all these coloured phones then hiding it and making it look ugly, what's the point you may aswell buy a cheap £50 phone that looks nasty in the first place. Never used a case on a phone and never will they cost to much money not to ever see what you payed for"
But why?
Now we review the back of the phone and come back later to see the front lol
Hi
This ad is too long......
Then just skip it xd
OnePlus abandoned it's fans
Shots at One Plus at the end 😂
"4.13... bip bip din din... hahahaha, what is this sh***t???"
"It's Android based so don't expect much changes in the system, I think only some extra customization will be there. The back side lighting is awesome, I hope camera and performance is good"
"Android, as opposed to what?! What other good phone operating system is there, that's still around, aside from iOS?"
And I thought that Michael Scott is crazy for paying 400$ for a phone because he liked a ringtone.
"That- looks refreshing like someone actually wanted to- uhm make something ""new"" or should I say make ""nothing"" ;) bad joke-"
"How much is the phone? Since you got yours free?
Are you going to switch to it for a while?"
very interesting phone
I JUST LOVE IT.
What's the specifications of the phone?
"Nothing Looks Like Incomplete! Hmm Btw,........Very Unique"
iPhone from multiverse 😉
Wow i might just buy nothing
"Loved the ""Sounds Familiar..<CUT SCENE>"" @ 6:32  Reference to ONEPLUS !!"
"Nothing looks like something 





Iphone cough cough ..... 🌬️"
I will not rest until I have this phone🤩
It’s gonna suck. Just like their earbuds
This phone is nothing.
"1+1 = Two
1-1  = Nothing"
Really nice back.
Looks crap!
What will happen to Dbrand now!!
It is more of a feature which u will be excited for a few weeks. No big diff after that. The LED is cool but make no big diff to how we use a phone...
Apple logo led?
This Nothing Phone is something! 😛😎
I don't know if it would be a hit or a flop  but certainly it feels very different as compared to others phones
what's gonna be the OS on the phone? if it's Android then it would be useless to go to a different brand just to enjoy their infinite LED options
Haven't seen the UI yet but I am already Hyped for it
I'd LED could change the color I'd be immediately sold
"Had pasted a sticker on my old Nokia 1100 and it lit multicolour LEDs for every calls and texts for any ringtone, or even without a ringtone.  😜😂"
"I think it's main custom base will be OnePlus users who like me, refuse to pay nearly £1000 for a phone. 
I bought 2 OnePlus 5t's in December 2017 for less than £1000. My wife's phone still works like it did on day one.
I use mine as a work tool so I charge it more. I've had to swap the battery. I have to check it when charging because sometimes it won't fully charge.
 I use Google maps all day. I've got screen burn but it still works well enough for me not to need a new phone yet.
If the price is reasonable. I could be a nothing customer."
MIGHT COP ONE
if they collabed with apple and made this an iphone with all the special lights on the back i'd 100% buy it
Is it eligible for to play the game
The OnePlus killer 🤔
Let’s hear the price first 😏
06:32 OnePlus !?
"WHEN ITS A NOT NAME BRAND, ITS NOTHING!"
Nothing phone father of something 1+ 😜
"So, in order to launch something different from the competition, they launch a phone that the only noticeable thing compared to an Android are those back lights that are useless? 🤔 All right."
I want black phone with white led light
I will cover the phone with the case regardless. Hmmm. It will be interesting to see a case made for this phone. If it covers the chassis then it will be useless and if it doesn't...well then what's the point of calling it a case.
why are you testing out camera wtih this back cover lights
Apple promoter MKBHD 😂😂😂😂
"Until now, I'm still using the Oneplus One phone which I acquired thru invite system dated August 2014... Almost 8 years now and it's still working well. 

Let's see what this Nothing phone has to offer! Can't  wait July 12!"
Was kind of hyped till I heard the ringtones 🤢
It is really Cool 😎💥
Finally a phone that's worth my kidney
I love the design of the phone all round. But I think the light is a bit much for notifications. Those lights is only good for night photography
THE ANSWER IS HIIDDEN BEHIND THE PRICE
Looks like an essential phone had a baby with an iPhone XS Max
"I could actually see myself using that phone, the big issue for me is the price per performance. I would not buy a new phone with old hardware just for the look."
This mobile remaind me 'next bit robin'
Nothing is going to make me buy this phone.
"So i used to know that there was a phone call with my ears, now i have to use my eyes and ears?"
"When you cannot come up with something new that is useful, you design something that is not :)"
I liked the white LED bit.. reminded me of my Nokia 3610
"Imagine building a brand twice and trashing out your original fanbase yet again. IF nothing actually turns out like that, which i hope it doesnt, then that would be sad. But nothing has not even given any indication towards the type of customers that they are after. Which very well means that it may not looking to be the hero of flagship killer. They might actually be planning to make expensive phones from the get go.. Or i may be wrong"
How much battery does this exhaust??
The camera is definitely nothing hahaha
is it just me or it just looks too much like an iphone
Looks like an iphone 13 for me
Imagine focusing on the important things in life instead of a freaking new phone
Charge Indicator led Copied from JBL portable speaker's 😆😅
"They will have the fate of LG, mark my words !"
what is the price the nothing phone 1 ?
If worth for price then we can buy🙏
Just hope they include adapter and cable in the box😜
"As someone who became a OnePlus fanatic when my Galaxy S6 broke and I was convinced by the value prospect of moving to the OP 5 and just fell in love with Oxygen OS, the alert slider, customization options, and just making the right choices on where to skimp to make a cheaper flagship that didn't feel like you were missing out on a single thing... I am SO excited to see where Nothing goes with this. Still rocking the OP 7 Pro, the only downside of which is the lack of 5G compatibility, but it was also the first phone I ever bought because I was just so excited about the generational leap that it represented with higher refresh rates, that curved screen glass pebble feel, incredible haptic feedback improvements, etc., rather than buying one because my last had broken in some way. Still holding on to my old OP 5 as a backup in case of whatever... But since being swallowed by Oppo, OP has lost its individuality and become just another flagship phone with little to differentiate itself from Samsung, Google, LG, whoever. Sure they're good phones, and the 10 Pro certainly is top of the line and offers just about anything you could want in a flagship, while still trying to make use of that Hasselblad colab to catch up in the camera/photo processing sphere. However, OxygenOS is quickly morphing into the Oppo ColorOS, the price tag no longer gives it the ultra-competitive appeal it once had, and there's even been word of them moving away from the alert slider, which would be one of the dumber moves a phone maker could make. More phones should be trying to adopt that, not less. 

While Nothing will need more than one attempt to really hit the nail on the head, I'm desperately hoping Carl Pei gets a real chance to break into the market for a second time. And the super customizable backlighting, with actual functionality rather than just being purely a gimmick, is the first big shakeup the smartphone market has seen in some time, which may just give Nothing the solid footing it needs to build into something great, and special, and a place for the enthusiasts to look beyond the handful of options geared towards the masses. Of course details on the specs, pricing, and availability are still needed to really imagine it's path forward, but it took OnePlus a number of phones to really find it's niche in the market and become something special as well. I think I was lucky to happen to become in need of a new phone right as the OP 5 came out to be able to experience what may be one of the only true flagship killers in the smartphone market since it's inception. The OnePlus 7 Pro I believe still fell into that category, though the price gap had become less noticeable, and it was only a generation away from falling into line and grasping a generating more mass appeal by emulating competitor stylings, giving into the IP rating certification demands, and emulating competitor camera software while trying to ride on the shoulders of known camera makers rather than finding it's own new path for innovation going forward. Anyways, rant over. Fingers crossed. Hoping shopping for a new phone will become truly exciting once again in the near future. 

As it stands, I honestly may end up being swayed over to the iOS ecosystem which would be a first for me, and unthinkable until maybe the introduction of the M1 across devices. Still would like an iPad Pro with an M1 whether I end up deciding to make the big change in ecosystems fully or not. Please Android, even if you can never truly compete in that specific tablet market, please save me from being pulled all the way into the dark side."
@Emmanuel Egwere Oh... I get it. I recommend Hooked on Phonics. Multiple sentences won't seem as big and scary eventually. Good luck!
@Brenden O'Sullivan more paragraphs. You have time for real.
"@M. Milo Yes, because I added an original comment to a YouTube video unprompted. Unlike... every other original comment. There's something hilarious about replying ""TL:DR"" and then immediately replacing it with a complaint about not having enough content. 🤣

So far this comment that takes maybe 60 seconds to read has garnered 10 thumbs up and several responses about how it shouldn't exist by folks who didn't have to recognize it's existence in the first place, but instead invested more time into complaining about the time they spent reading it. The Internet is a hell of a place."
"@Brenden O'Sullivan he was commenting because you posted a massively long diatribe via a medium that is DEFINITELY not meant for that (YouTube comments), unprompted, with very little actual content. You’re far too long-winded for YouTube comments, and all your replies come across as out-of-touch and slightly pretentious. So chill out."
Nothing will also follow the same story as 1+ just wait few years
wawooo this is unique... thanks nothing
Reminds me of my Xperia SP days. Gosh i love those LEDs coming back in action.
OnePlus shade 🤣🤣🤣 but I have been looking for something like what used to be 😩
imagine you’re drunk and these notifications just start to go off😂😭
What is the price
Oneplus
"The lighting thing is great!
But the product design is not great.... especially the back.....The product looks unfinished."
The LED lights customisation has took it to whole new level.
@Jonas I can relate to ur opinion. I this LED thing is a fancy gimmick. I understand it is no innovation but the creativity they have thought of it is what  makes this phone amazing. I would love to play around with those lights and are actually something to be flexed.
"@Devwardhan Kothari With nothing's track record, it'll be absolute dogwater that's overhyped to the moon."
"@Jonas well you may be right or wrong, Carl Pei's hype garnering marketing inhibits us from knowing the actual performance of the phone and the cameras, they could be great. But probably wont be anything groundbreaking."
"@Devwardhan Kothari it was a joke, why anyone want to get information from blinking light in 2020 is just beyond my imagination."
"@Devwardhan Kothari if this phone really had something new to offer we would not be watching a video about blinking led, it’s a scam."
Anyone else wish the Essential PH-1 didn't die? 😭🫂😔
Wondering if the vintage black Apple PowerBook is signalling something here.. :)
They inspired by black shark 2.
Or you could just put your phone down facing up. 🤷🏻‍♂
My next phone will b the tesla pi
Lawsuit from apple pending regarding the design theft. But judge we did nothing
"""Sounds familiar?""
Bro I watched the OnePlus vid just a week ago looool. I'm really guessing that that kind of shift is ultimately inevitable, unless for the astronomically rare event of some crazy executives that doesn't care about profiting too much and sincerely just wants to appeal and be different"
It's like a Dream Great Phone ❤️😀
Now imagine if the lights could change corresponding to an app notification like Snapchat would be yellow or YouTube would be red etc
What is this price
The dig at oneplus at the end😂
‘Nothing’ is minimalist challenge to iPhone. I get a sense that Chinese are hellbent in challenging American in brand making.
It wouldn't be long shen we see back of the phones with RGB as normal i guess.
"Oneplus sounds familiar 
😅"
this is oneplus all over again
I would love for a smaller lower reso screen on the back of a phone for selfies and get rid of the camera on the screen.  not sure if it would work out but would be different.
6:30 Samsung for sure
Design definitely iPhone inspired 👀🤷
are you gay ?
looks like an s10e mixed with an iphone 12 with a clear back
Oops I put a case on the back. Just do an always on display. Bam notifications overload lol
"Hello.  Tell me please, is the phone slippery without a case?  Is the back cover plastic?  Thank you."
06:08 corny. blah blah blah.
"My question is does this back glass has any protection and can this back glass will get yellowish tint after few days of use.... 
Does this phone comes with any kind of protection glass from front also ? Coz using a mobile case for this device is not fair."
To be honest. This is an ugly looking device.
Great work
"Software clunkyness and the design on the iPhone is why i dont have an iPhone, IF Nothing changes design i will get this! LineageOS and this phone would be awesome."
"""We live in an age"""
It is compact as iphone ?
android sucks
I hope they will have a midnight black color upon release so the features will really stand out
Should be able to choose different colors for the back of phone notifications.
A black edition would be dope!
"This is hilariously, Nothing dudes are straight clowns lol"
hi
"I always put my phone down on a surface with the screen facing up. And an average screen of an average smartphone along with speakers can ALREADY DO EVERYTHING the back of this phone does. While the LED light bars may be ""neat"" to some: For me and I am sure for the majority, it's nothing but a playful gimmick. There is simply not enough innovation here to peak interest."
"So, now I'm waiting for asus to put their display on the back, instead of LEDs like their laptop"
Does anybody remember the aftermarket antennas you used to be able to buy to customize your cellphones? I think we should bring cellphone customization back. What a huge market not being utilized.
After using Nothing Ear 1 buds. I've become their fan. I've got a notification to buy the same here in India. Can't wait. I've huge expectations from Nothing.
RIP LG
"Blackberry.  Custom tones , custom rbg lights, etc.   ."
Well looks like nothing is coming.. I mean Nothing will not be coming to the U.S. I guess there’s nothing else to say about Nothing.
How good is the camera?
I kind of was wishing it had support for multiple color LED notifications for different apps!
"Samsung didnt kill apple
Nothing phone: Fine I will do it myself"
It’s like what a lot of people wanted the iphone to be.
It’s like what a lot of people wanted the iphone to be.
"In our language we call this kind of phone as ""Jatraa Phone"""
Price of the phone is  199.99
"Ayeeee, I want that Naruto phone😀"
“ dude its nothing “
Though you give me nothing 1 for free I can't use other than samsung
Everybody slaps a protecting case over it anyways. What is the point?
ohhhhh
THE STARWARS PHONE
"the video is deadly boring.All that, to talk about the back of a phone"
"Okay, so those lights are awesome, BUT, who the heck has their phone face down?? I do know it's kinda common. I've never understood it though, I mean do you actually WANT to scratch your screen? I never in any moment ever have my screen down at the surface its laying on. Cause I sure as hell don't wanna scratch it. Point is, I'll never ever see those lights haha. Which is why notification lights are only useful (for me) when on the front (like on old Samsung Galaxy phones), which is difficult with an all screen trend."
"I watched Carl pei before I bought my first OnePlus phone, I just got my OnePlus 9 pro and updated it to Android 12 which reflects the oppo merger and I can't stand it! I want Nothing!!"
The designers who worked on this must’ve had a lot of fun
Sold! Gotta have one
Are we seeing another Oneplus startup again or will they prevail and be the midrange hero of these hard times?? We will be watching you with great interest Nothing.
Gives me Essential Ph-1 vibes.
I don’t care how good the phone is it’s David against Goliath.
cool look but iphone edges look bad
"i think i will ditch my iPhone 13 pro max i get this phone just for these LEDs, i mean this will take my interaction and productivity with this phone to the next level!!! 😆
alternative names for this phone should be „Bullshit-Phone"" or „Crap-Phone"""
I wanna see what the case solutions will be. I love the LED effects but I'll never go caseless. Also I'll probably wait a few iterations before I jump the shark. Not a big fan of iPhone designs so hopefully their later ones move away from that shape as they establish themselves
"@Tacitus Kilgore I've never put a case on any of my phones. Nor have I ever traded in any phone. I cracked a screen once, but it still worked so I didn't bother replacing it. Constant repairs?

Here's an idea: don't spend $700+ on a fucking cell phone."
"BTW that's not what 'jump the shark' means. It's not about someone taking a massive step (a leap of faith) from one thing to another drastically different thing. It's about something, usually a TV series, resorting to a desperate and fanciful plotline in order to try to remain interesting, and typically regarded as the point at which such shows began their inevitable decline. The term originates from the TV series Happy Days where one of the characters literally jumped over a shark on his motorcycle 😀"
"@GoGoErrek If you hate cases that's fine. I'd honestly love to go caseless too but just can't be bothered to deal with constant repairs or replacements due to dropping it. Scuffing messes up trade in value, but that's honestly the least of my worries. I'm more worried about cracked/ broken screens and components being damaged. Phones nowadays are far too expensive for them not to be protected imo. But hats off to you for going commando with your phones."
"@Professor X I think it'd  be cool if the case had clear material only over the outline of the glyph with the rest of the back being (colored) rubber or plastic, or whatever the hell these cases are made out of these days lol"
"Meanwhile I hate cases. Phones are meant to be used, so what if it gets a little scuffed?"
Is the NoPhone a good alternative/
Looks like an iPhone!
"Another piece of glass to break. LED's are a Gimmick and not a very good one. It will need a case to protect the glass and unless it accommodates the LED's , they become useless. My Motorola phone lights up when I look at it and I can see my notifications. It also has the actually useful Moto Actions on a very thinly skinned Android."
Looks just like a fuckin iPhone? 🤦‍♂️
"if this phone is like the nothing earbuds, Nothing will make 500 phones and do 5 ""limited releases"" with only 20 phones sold in each release.
Nothing is the dumbest company.
And to be clear, I was sold on the company when they ""released"" the earbuds.
Until I couldn't buy them 3 ""releases"" in a row.
I am still amazed the amount of credibility Nothing still has after how crappy they have decided to be regarding availability."
Specs?
Looks like an iPhone. Lol. Doesn’t “look different”. 🤣🤣🤣
"Nothing x Apple, Nice collab!"
Not really impressed about this really. Funny how Carl Pei thinks other android phones are boring?? Even if Nothing phone's not going be sold in Us right away it's no big deal.
I don't think people will want it still
"Nothing's Blinking Notification Lights are inspired from Nokia, Nokia did with thier 2004s - 3220 Feature Phone, lol seems like blast from the past tech in new form in 2022."
4:06 short circuit 2 Easter egg
Cool 😎 but which the led could change color
"Hype is what pushes me off of It, seems way too gimmicky to be practical. Just a way to push off the current norm with android and apple"
I want that DBZ phone!
It's OnePlus all over again starts out amazing and ends up being a disappointment...I still use the 7 pro 5g 🤣🤣🤣
Shoutout to OnePlus at the end there
That OnePlus shot was crazy lol
"Up until this video, I wasn't sure if this was just the phone that was... literally just a brick of plastic to make ppl use their phone less. Rarely ever felt that confused about a phone xD"
Cool
Apple the multiverse of madness
The Nothing ear was a terrible overhyped and buggy product. Never again for me. Even as back up ear buds (Thats why i bought them) They are not good enough.
A Tron (Legacy) Phone
Buen video
The back looks so nice till I put on a phone cover and I can’t see it anymore
"Naming a Brand 101, Don't name a brand ""NOTHING"" 
seriously? 
What a huge BLUNDER. 

Hmm...Even BLUNDER would work BETTER than nothing."
I hardly turn my phone face down… It always face up… trying to figure it’s use  to me
Is that a MacBook G3 on your desk?
Looks something out of the movie Tron Legacy.
Looks dead 💀
"It really is a ""Nothing"" phone. I cant wait to buy one because it flashes! FLOP"
"Damn that last subtle plugin for ''one plus"" And it's fan base Was damn smoooooth!!"
"If the specs are similar to that of the top phones + has features such as NFC + On-Screen Fingerprint Sensor
I would definitely switch over"
Android or IOS? SIM or CDMA?
SD card slot?
Nothing like OnePlus.
This looks sick not gonna lie!
"Sanji: What happened?
Zorro: Nothing happened.."
Do you have anything to do with it? The style and vibe is certainly reminds to your website ;)
just need apple skin or logo then you call nothing phone to iphone ✌
Is it true that it won’t be for sale in the US?
"no use, it should have been put around the phone, this is just waste of development time."
DOA
"Definitely interested in seeing how it works and what the user interface looks like, compared to the iPhones. Just the back of it makes me interested, and if they're tryna keep to a similar style like the iPhone UI/UX, I would be considering switching, 'cause that's a hella unique phone to have."
"This is nice, a strong vibe of 1999 with poly ringtones and phones with leds on the sides xD"
I'm not a fan of putting my phone face down
the lights are as gimmicky as the solid radar in the pixel 4
Cool features....lovly
"just looks like early 2000 mobile phone, those phone modify stuffs like clear phone case, all different color case, back mobile phone all looks black, then you see more and more phone brand have different factory stock color choice, i think ericsson 768 one of phone model offer different color, then later on nokia totally change the game, those changeable phone case/panel model, maybe called panel ..? front and back panel, create a huge phone accessories market, now looks back to early 2000 playing with clear case again, very nostalgic."
Loving the OnePlus wink wink nudge nudge at the end 😁
Oblivion vibes
Why does it shape like an iPhone the back design is kool
"Bye, my iphone."
"That’s the iPhone , can’t prove me wrong"
1st time watching. idk why but i like to see bigger channels editing in fcp
I will own Nothing and i will be happy!
Probably this is only phkne on the planet that you do not want to use any colourful cover except the transparent.
What about the real specs? Does it support all the current LTE bands and the 5G bands coming in the next 3 years? MIMO and carrier aggregation amount? etc.
those might be the most annoying ringtones I've ever heard. it's whatever though...I always keep on vibrate anyways
Bro I want nothing phone 📱 📲 please send me 🇮🇳  how much cost  I pay 😭 😤 😫 🙃 😩 😅 😭
Bro how to buy Ian from India 🇮🇳
Not targeted toward professional consumer 🙄
"When you say it looks different,what you mean is it looks exactly the same as another phone that's already on the market 🤦"
What version of iOS will it run?
It looks like an iPhone
"Give me that naruto phone 😆
You don't use it anywyas.👻"
"Honestly, the LED notification at the back could put into a phone case rather than integrating it at the back oh the phone. Then the case would automatically charge once you put it on your phone. Anyways, I appreciate the innovation about trying to look different but I dont belive it will be a success just by looking different. But it is a great start!"
This reminds me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind when they communicate with the ship.
The Phone is Android or how the apps working?
was that a dig at oneplus at the end lol
.
"I think it’s great but I know it may become annoying having lights for notifications, and if you decide to deactivate this feature, then it becomes a regular phone. Either way I’m still Interested to see the full review."
"The reason I loved the Oneplus One was that it delivered such great hardware for a very low price. They did this for marketing, making little to no profit on their first phone made people buy it because of the great value and love it for that reason, and they went in with the same mentality on newer phones even if they didnt follow the same strategy. So for me, that is the key thing that will flip me into buying this phone or not. Do i get a great phone for a great value, or not. Price will be the deciding faction for Nothing phone (1)"
@Sonal Kashyap f3 : am i ajoke to you?
@Sonal Kashyap i didn't even changed Battery my phone working like gold.
"@Sonal Kashyap I still have One Plus 5. Still so fast or faster than new ones throught this 5 years. And I Switched just for whim. I think One Plus one could still rock nowadays.
Nothing is pretty amazing, but just medium one. I prefer to pay 200€ more and get a flagship killer.
So I must still wait for ... One Plus 10 T, Samsung 2023 or iPhone 15 (cos 14 its the same than 13...)
I think that my One Plus 5 must stay 1 year more when the Phones really Will made a difference. New era."
@Alessandro Zanardi Still using F1. No other phone in poco series came close. Still enjoy the camera quality and 845. Just changed batteries two times..
"@Alessandro Zanardi poco is owned by xiaomi, they got resources and r&d from their parent company."
Wow I like it
When is this coming up and how much
"*Whatever this man does, he only does his work, does not give credit to himself, he remains the party polit of his lovely audience.lots off love and respect for you🎤🎧📲📱❤️✍️*"
Nothing means nothing without any specs.
I'm always willing to give a new toy a try. I like to see the specs first before making the switch though. I wonder if the phone has good success. Would they put color LEDs in a future release?
mi8
Just a gimmick
"Sounds familiar?
Yes, OnePlus"
I really like the phone but im not switching from IOS
I need a new phone; I'm sold!
be interested to see what case you could put on this phone
An then there’s me: mute switch always on. DND always on. A huge notification light is the last thing I want on a phone
Says only can show the back then shows the whole thing
Abe camera 📸 bhi dikha detha
Is that not the front of the phone at 2:24 time stamp? lol
Trending video in india ❤️🔥
As I saw nothing phone 1 will not take over a market of India because of the specifications if it's price over than 25k
This Nothing seems rather cooler than I thought.
It loks like a modefited iphone 12
one plus all over
Sounds familiar part - offcourse OnePlus :)
"Oh well. First question is, why would I even want to put the phone face down, when I can perfectly see every notifications on the actual screen? This 'feature' is uselessly-cool to any practical user."
Feels like a phone from the Akira world
This guy poked OnePlus in the most innovative way lol 🤣
Meh
"For the segment of the market that this is for, it's probably pretty hype."
I love this phone more more than iphones ❤️❤️😘
hmm nah
That ending was hilarious! Gotcha Oneplus
"It's a good idea in concept, but the novelty of this design will wear off pretty quickly."
This reminds me of Tron Legacy
"I have a question first of all mobile looks awesome! Everytime when an Led's ligts glow it will drain the battery right? Is thats a challange right, then how the nothing mobile makers would overcome????"
"In everyday use, I don't think the leds on the back are useful when you have a big screen and maybe always on display feature too. And you will need a transparent case to protect the phone and to still see the leds. Idk, but for me, this phone is just a test subject, to see what people think about it, so they can come with more improvements."
It has to be a gimmick. The old bedazzle trick. The front screen can very well do what the back lights can except lighting up the room.
This look exactly like iphone.. 😅
"This reminds me of the physical computer interface that you'd see in the original alien movie. Pretty cool, but kinda gimmicky."
this phone looks like iphone 12
"Well, if they manage to make a system like Samsung and Apple and make it smooth, functional and integrated with our life stuff, for sure its going to work.. UI and system experience is something all companies can do, but just a few can make it good."
"Aren't all of these lights kinda pointless if it's sitting on a wireless charger? Nice for charging headphones etc but when it's charging screen-up, the whole reason it stands out is completely unusable."
This phone is cool but I dunno if It is cool enough to get me away from my iPhone and the Apple ecosystem.
It really looks different
Side punch hole = fail
"missed title opportunity: ""Nothing looks like this"" lol"
That selfie hole is a deal breaker for me. I'll keep my sony xperia 1 III.
Amazing
Yeah not so different it’s more a gimmick than anything. It just looks like a modded iPhone really.
Like shirt 😎
😂
Honestly why do we need those features?
It somehow reminds me thinking about Nokia 3220🤣. What's new about it again?
"well, its not gimmick if they have functionality. really looking forward for this one, hope the specs wont let me down."
Nothing is going to make me buy their phone.
"Also Carl Pei is from OnePlus so I feel like the name Nothing is a pun on the "" 1 + nothing is still 1+ "" , there's got to be something or nothing there ? haha"
"I disagree with the making a new phone that appeals to a broader market, I feel nothing's road to success would be to become the giant in the niche markets (camera, hi-fi, gaming, etc) ."
I am eagerly waiting for this phone in India ...16 July 😍
ineed it
The back light is too much. Is a fair smartphone on the outside but we need to see the specs and a real case use. Then it will be classified as it should
Design 🥴
"What accessories do they have for the phone?

Nothing."
it looks like playstation 1
I would love if they release a Transparent back Phone with an good old Green Mainboard usw. and do not paint everything.
Can the led change colour or is it only going to be the white colour
Oh OnePlus what have you become?
Will they go the Oneplus way or the Essential phone way...?
"Expandable storage, headphone jack, removable battery, repairable parts, software updates, decent camera, infrared emitter, fast charging, water resistance, good screen, a charger in the box, earbuds in the box... Those things will sell phones, not lights and colors. (Unless you're part of the apple cult). Not impressed by this at all."
Am I the only one who was searching for an apple logo in the phone😜😜
Meh. I won't fall for that.
not going to be available/useable in NA???
It looks too much like a iphone 12 with a different a backplate
"2030 and we will be discussing under this comment about how Nothing become the next OnePlus.
Only a matter of time."
"One of the best things about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when hi achieves . something . He always respect us , the audience and his team , and he is always polite in all of his videos . We congratulate ourselves on this achievement . More to come and everything to come "" "" "" "" ♥...."
Review please
1+
"If Tron had a phone, it’d be this."
I REALLY LIKE THE DESIGN OF THE PHONE
So much annoyance from the LED.
"yeah yeah lights, whatever. Can you replace the battery? Can you replace the screen? Yourself? Without having to buy expensive tools? If not, I'm not interested."
I’m sure China is already making coloured cases for it
This phone has a personality of its own
am i the only one that thinks it’s a remade iphone 12
I'm very curious about the price and specs of the phone. And the long term experience
"I think you showed the front of the phone , you weren't allowed to show."
"I like the idea of the revival of notification lights, but seriously all the hype because of lights and sounds like a cheap kid's toy of the 90s? Nothing but marketing..."
rip oneplus.... I still have a 1+1 lying around here somewhere
iPhone
Shots fired.
To get an invisible phone for free all you have to do is hold out your hand and now you are holding your new phone!
"L'ultimo commento, dopo il minuto 6.00, è una chiara frecciatina all'attuale OnePlus.. Sound familiar? :)"
Cellphone tech has hit a ceiling.
The price will be 1000 $ will be a sucks
That’s sick
Idk why you didn't mention this is from the same guy that started the One+ company then left it later and made this one!
"""I am allowed to show the back of the phone...""  proceeds to show the front of the phone...
Classic Brownlee.."
still shitty os
"So, you put the phone face down on the screen so you can see patterns of light on the back... Why would you not just have the patterns on the main screen?"
"I want this to like it. But it just doesn't vibe with me. I am more like a straight forward things person, powerful processor, good camera, good screen, simple and discrete design, nothing else. Leds on this one... is kinda the thing to identify and differentiate from other phones. I prefer simple/minimalist ringtones and be able to disconnect sometimes without any visual interruptions. It is hard to not depend from your phone on these times, but I appreciate the time to be disconnected."
I Feel it similar look like IPhone 12 designs
no camera jack who cares. your want to challenge the phone market put a headphone jack
"imagine this been made by apple and secretly selling it as another company for cheaper. Imagine this, or is it true???"
I wish more phones were more adventurous with their design like this phone
"Sound familiar? Yeah, OnePlus sucked me in with the 7 Pro because it was that or have a notch. Couldn't transfer anything from my previous phone for over a year, so went back to Samsung"
6:32 OnePlus **coff coff** what?
Watch dog vibe phone 😁
overhyped.
"Yes, familiar with the OnePlus story....  :)"
wow this phone the best give me one bro ....../
the ringtones sounds and looks goofy ahh
"yooooo reminds me of my Sony Experia SP, it has cool LED lights on the bottom which turns on everytime you have notifications. I would buy this if they put serious work on this stuff"
I would buy this.
wow this is cool like its definitely not gonna stop me from using an iphone
3:55 Watchdogs PTSD
This is straight up stupid. Sorry not sorry.
"I'm an iPhone user since 2010 and this is probably the 2nd android phone after the Essential Phone PH-1 that appeals to me design wise and could make me switch to android
Great Job"
"So, both would be overhyped pieces of junk? Lol"
"is tHis moBile comPetitive to iphOne and oNePlus mobil€'s..., ??? 
And 
Is th€re any ExTra s€cur!t¥ OS[NOTHING (N)OS]????"
"Mark is getting heavy pay from Nothing.
To not criticise them. The light is shit. Just gimit and cheap copy or Iphone"
I'm pretty sure zack (jerryrig) would love to get his hands on the Nothing phone....
Nice iPhone
"If camera is great I'll buy, cause I don't do heavy task with smartphones just for calls and ig etc but I do like to click photos when ever I go out for enjoyment, that lighting and all Sony mobiles use to do this kinda stuffs ."
Can I buy This nothing phone for a nothing useless feature
6:11 is the following description about one plus?
cool upgrades
"Wow, this is a cool idea, I will definitely have to think about it before changing to it, but to be honest, I have a Pixel 6, it is still in the case, I have not use much of the Camera cool features, and if I can have something that stands out like that nothing phone hmm definitely something would like to check out in person.  Thank you Marques!"
Who remembers Xperia U ?? That was some glowing starship phone I had in the days!!
This may not look too impressive for now.. but this could be future
"Why since realme using same 8 mp ultra wide camera and then no one will ready to talk this issue even their flagship mobiles no morethan 8 mp only 8 mp camera and when all brands will remove weird useless and irritating 2mp cameras I've been using realme 7 pro since 2 years and i didnt move up to 2 mp camera i tried to hide with those camera to use some stickers 😵

When mobile brands will remove notch and punch hole and weird displays because I need atleast 6.7 inch with full view flat screen display mobile and why still apple hanging with their notch because they can change the hole display industry but why still they didn't and they moved to mini or micro led displays

Why suddenly disappeared pop up up camera mobiles in mobile industry and why need rollable or foldable or whatever folding technology will comes to mobile but no one look the werid punch hole displays any way ...
I request please make video about this issues"
"this looks the closest to what I call ""a futuristic look"" 
when I think about future tech, I think about neons, rgb and stuff"
imagine adjusting all of your phone contacts to ring differently and then still get no calls just like before
"for ""cool"" kids maybe... waiting for full review in july. interesting to see what this thing brings in mobile market in terms of client oriented pratices."
Nice🔥
One thing I don't understand is who keeps the phone down with its the display facing down. They should put the notification LED's on the front.
A biggest mistake in making this phone is AlertSlider is missing.............
i would want fortnite and markass brownie
That's definitely a flex phone.
"This is such a cool phone, i hope the camera(s) will be good!"
"it's look like an iPhone 11
but better"
U. Awsme💯💖
"at the end of the day, we will buy case for our phone"
Nothing looks to be following how Mi ventured into. Quirky designs with competitive features and prices. Would this strategy flow to drain into nothing is only future can decide.
This phone is a the future
Wheres the RGB!? haha
"I'm just gonna fall for the hype and just take the ride tbh. If this phones ends up being trash oh well, but hopefully not."
They better have transparent cases
There's nothing in that hole in the screen
sound familiar . oh u mean oneplus?
That phone is gorgeous i hope it'll be affordable and have decent specs
sounds like 1+
i would want fortnite and markass brownie
MKBHD be like I have got the phone but I can only show led lights.
"Yes, what you said is verrryyy Familiar. 

Ehem, One....+"
Aha punch on the OnePlus 😂😂😂😂
"Fun fact: the founder of this startup company was actually one of the original holders of OnePlus, and you can definitely feel some OnePlus vibes in this phone."
Too much gimmicky …just give us a good value phone
Seems like a one-trick pony to me.
So...will it cost nothing as well ⁉️
Creativity = seeing the same thing but thinking differently
So Is It Android ?
What’s the PowerBook doing in the background?
if those ringtones didnt hurt my ears that would be a really cool function
"I am you tuber 
mera tech channel hai
mere channel se Aaka helo"
"It's hard for newbie companies to create their own components, they get them from everywhere like china"
"I just want a device for apps, no phone, no cams, so you cannot control my phone calls to my wife, so only I fuck with my wife and not the whole world."
I hope Nothing happens every year 😁
This guy radiates so much positive energy that he has tendency to uplift everyone's mood!!
Now wait for Xiaomi to copy the design LEDs etc in their own phone.
"If you remove the phone and cameras, what you get ? An electronic device for apps, its stupid invention you could own very easily an old Nokia from 2002 just to do phone calls 😂 and Sony DSLR pro cam for photos maybe videos and action cams if you're an adventurous person smartphone is a distraction from reality, they could make an electronic device just for apps,😄 or to microchip you to control everywhere where you go. Nintendo that small pocket crap is a good for playing games underway even Sony PS had that small version just for games so why do you need smartphone if you have smartphone your stupid 100%."
"""so, we live in an age"""
Last reference to OnePlus was quite true and sad at the same time.
Thanks
Somehow this reminds me of OnePlusOne very much.
Not coming to the US tho 🧐
Could they just make it a dot matrix instead...?
How much ?
Finally a android phone that looks exciting
If it's price less i buy this for my second phone definitely
Wow it killed iPhone 💀
ugly back led
"Maybe they should have just created an interesting flagship with a headphone jack, IR remote, expandable storage and removable battery.

All the Nothing Phone has is some fancy LEDs in an iPhone body."
"@Joby Sam Jacob Hotswappable batteries are still 1000 times quicker than charging, no matter how fast the charging. Also, removable batteries mean that you can be sure the phone is actually off as well, not a bad feature for privacy in an age where we essentially have none."
"Headphone jack? YES!
What’s the point of removable batteries when you have power banks that can charge the phone 2 to 3 times?"
7th gen 1 or 780 soc ?
Nextttt
I am buying this........ depends on the price though
I'm sure there's a clear case coming from *Nothing!*
"Great Review MKBHD..love the shots fired at the end...hehe definitely sounds familiar, and hope they can break the loop and give back to the community wht was promised to Never Settle. Seems like Carl left cos of how the company was becoming mainstream, forgetting that they became huge cos of how they ""Never Settle""d. Hope Carl can do this with Nothing and More. Kudos to him and the Team and you for the honest review. What im really looking forward to is the operating system, and if its similar to the revolutionising oxygenos of ye old days. wht u think?"
"Marques (Ending): Sound Familiar??
Me: I felt that for the One Plus people"
This reminds me a Nokia phone from many years back where it lights up to the ringtones. Good to see this feature again in smartphone generation.
"Damn, that’s cool. I want those ringtones!! 😎"
Sounds familiar?? That's def one plus!
"that led light on the back in kinda cool idea, but that one kinda look ugly i'm sorry"
Hmm I don't think anyone would really mind that subtle differentiating design. It doesn't hurt mainstream appeal and might even help.
"le me: bro i will give nothing to you on your birthday
le friend on birthday: bro where is my phone
le me: i said nothing"
i woulde 100 percent buy this but i dont wanna lose OneUI
Never been so curious to use a phone like the Nothing phone
*Atleast something fresh* for sure i m up for this one
That chassis is literally of an iPhone 12 it seems lmao 😂
So they rigged apple…
Indirectly pointing out to OnePlus was the best part of this video😂😂
so their unique thing is different looking outside plastic?
The worst part is when you buy  this phone and put back cover😑
"While a nice phone, that LED notification system is a danger to those with epilepsy and could cause Nothing some major challenges."
"It does look cool, but will it really be cool?"
"This phone makes me really sad that I can't go back from a foldable. If I did, I can't imagine buying a different phone than this, I'm just exactly that kind of sucker."
"All Android fanboys jumping around, know this deep down but will never accept that this is indeed a reverse engineered iPhone. Just like they used to do with OnePlus. **coughs in China**
Cool back design though!"
"If talk about design and unique, I think Sony Xperia had the design that always unique and different and not follow a trend like other brand in any generation. 😂 This Nothing phone I think if not a see-though on back it very familiar."
finally we got a phone that is distracting from both the sides 😀😀😀
This a nothing advertisement
"That not work,,,"
"Who designed this??? 👉 ""Graduates from prestigiuos Design school"" 

nobody has time for the LIGHTSHOW , 
and people aren't going to put Case ,Cover on the back?

Yeah Designed by ~ ""Designers from Prestigious design School""

yeah, the gatekeepers."
Ya.. iPhone 12
I see iPhone 12 first when I first see it not able to see it that different but its like iPhone 12 ultra modern version
This looks so sick!!!! When the lights on the first second on the back I was blown away
I qm a caseless guy and it look really cool definitely looks like a iphone but still pretty cool with new unique ideas
if its under 400 bucks its a must buy
Yeah... OnePlus vibes. The new 1+. And also iPhone.
if they put ir blaster then for sure they'll take my money.
"When there are so much of features on the back side of the phone, how can a person use a backcover to protect the phone from breaking because of a fall or multiple falls...? Or should I just keep the phone naked and keep using it until breaks off?"
so RGB on phones :D
Poor battery
So disappointed to see a mega youtuber put out a whole video just showing some lights in the back of a silly phone that dances to a rythm or some sort of weird pattern. HELLO my 1 dollar christmas light can do the same but better. Should i scream about that from the top of my terrace to the entire world now. MKBHD you can do better man. Don't put out such trash content. If you can't make proper content just don't waste our time with this videos.
but it will not be available in U.S or Canada
"ugh why would you want a phone that lights up to notify you, i have mine on Do Not Disturb 100% of the time because it's super distracting. i'm so surprised so many people still like notifications"
"Im going to try and get this phone 100% , Im starting to get bored of iPhones so 🤷‍♂️"
25k
"That look is way futuristic, in my opinion ❤️ love it"
Beautiful  video
Love from India 🇮🇳
ringtones sound kinda cool but I expected a cooler design from them tbh
The initiative was great..! Its 2022 right!Wants to know how many people use without the case for just back light😵‍💫
Trending on India..🤯 #44
"Thanks for watching congrats
You just won a prize telegram 👆👆^^to get"
6:33 “sound familiar”.. OnePlus.. isn’t it?
Would be overpriced as usual
Those ringtones are the most annoying ringtones I’ve ever heard! 🤢 📞 🤮
ma next phone.
"Except the useless ringtone so called ""feature"", rest phone looks interesting and worth exploring"
It will always comes with the retail price. Like seriously it should be good price or it's going to fail
"This is an embarrassing phone to carry around, Nothing more Nothing less."
2022 even phones are getting DRLs
"The light patterns are cool, but completely redundant.  All of this information is on the screen..."
If it didn't look like a wannabe iPhone then I'd sat it's good but with its form now. No
"Wow this is something new. looks cool but they could have used RGB leds for more customisation
Hope they have used a better camera in their phone"
it highly depends on the UI and the ROM
MKBHD with the gay logo... c'mon man...
"Punch out hole camera whyyyyy, I thought these guys learned from the OP7P but I guess not. Gonna pass on this one even though I got the earbuds and they are nice, probably gonna go for an xperia when it's time."
That predator sounding ringtone is dope
Thts definitely a dope
"I think the back light is a nice add on to the smart phone.

During the 6 months of using 1+7t as my daily phone a few years ago, I discovered a bunch of software bugs that impacted regular usage.

I am more interested in Nothing’s software strategy / design."
If Nothing wants to be successful it should focus on Indian market .  Pricing is very important if they launch this phone under (35000-30000) range it would be huge success. .
That OnePlus dig. I felt that.
I phone  fan baby
This phone is quite interesting but ....I'm so looking forward to a Tesla Pi review. hopefully you'll get your hands on one pretty soon.
i don't like it. may be kids would like it so much
Not worth i.e nothing.
No apple. camera apple. Everything apple. Then why are reviewing android phone. Wtf isbthat🔥
it's funny how other youtube channels talk about this phone like they own one while in fact they're just basing it on teasers. And here is Marques holding the phone. The King of tech reviews and others are just copycats.
I’m getting r2-d2 vibes from this phone
"Take an iPhone , make it transparent for some light show and sell the phone that's it - nothing phone looks like just nothing to buy for"
Still a phone with privacy concern but now with some gimmicks.
Huge Cyberpunk 2077 Vibes ! Amazing tech I would definitely like that ‼️
How about adding RGB on flagship model😁
4:04 I love the machine gun ring tone
My phone if wiggle wiggle... it glows.
"After the presentation with Carl Pei on stage with these mystically Weird symbols, we now finally know what it means. It's the back and its LED relay lights, but I never would have guessed"
6:13 who he talking about lol?
"Back in time we had a phone with lights all around.. NOKIA 3220..!! It was pretty cool though, the lights danced as with the nokia default ringtones, and phone call or message notifications had a breathing light defined to them.. and this phone was almost 20 years back.."
They should have put front camera in the center!
"The housing: iphone 12
The display: samsung s10"
1K people will buy it
"Gimmicks everywhere, lol"
This will be a failure.
the only issue I can think of is who looks at the back of their phone?... I never even put it face down to notice or stare at the back of it. the lights look cool & all but not unless there was another screen on the back I wouldn't even care to turn it around.
Very cool! 👍
"""Sounds familiar?"".. (1+)"
Yawn...
monopoly doesn't give better phones unlike if there's competition - so good news. I bought the nothing earphones which's damn nice but this one's much way sick better!! :)
Moching one plus😂
These ring tones are cursed.
"Maybe I'm missing the point but don't you get all that stuff by just leaving your phone screen side up? Battery life? Check. See who's calling? Check. See notifications? Check.
So the only point of this feature is that you can leave your phone upside down and still have some of it's normal functionality. IDK if that's enough of a selling point for most people. Does look neat though, if it compares well with others in its price range the glyph stuff could tip the balance."
"The nothing phone is nothing , cool , sweet , dope,  no changes,  go make something beneficial"
I thought it was an iPhone with a new housing
I wasnt expecting a 6 minutes and 49 seconds ad in this channel.
Yeah cause none of his other reviews are ads huh
"and then a more appealing phone, and then a more appealing..... sound familiar ?
*one plus owner, hits too hard here*"
So why did they give you a phone if it won’t be sold in the US? How are you going to try it?
Pointless to review this phone it isn’t even coming to North America 😭
"Looks interesting.
Price is?"
Do people actually leave their phones facing down on a table?
Come on MKBHD this phone is not at all super different... Its just the same shit with a couple of leds on the back wow.. non-sense
Am I the only one who cringes when I see putting the phone face down? I would NEVA do that! 😂😬😬
This phone looks so cool and I’ve genuinely never considered switch from an iPhone till now
Imagine in black with Tron: Legacy with Clu's orange lights would be sick!
Please do casing with variables color with the LED cutout. Must be so cool
Major Star Wars vibes...
"when he says ... Ecosystem """" xD"
iPhone users : contacts - edit - ringtone. Your welcome
"OK, so just a thought, since the iPhones are now OLED - why isn’t it possible to just light up a certain area of the screen as a notification of some sort and keep the rest of the screen off/black? Am I way out of hand for suggesting this?"
Shots fired at OnePlus at the end ;)
"Assymetric led, i just cant."
"And so the oligopoly can now only be challenged by gimmicks marketed as style.

This is fine!"
This is absolutely amazing. I want it
The shade towards OnePlus in the last minute lol
"Rip OnePlus, nice burn lol"
That one plus hint at the end!
"Ok listen. It's been a week that I'm collecting information about that phone... You can't just hold that phone and tell me storys I already know. Give me some information about specs, I beg you."
In the 1990s there was these clear house phones. Yeah this phone are like those
"even if it's gonna suck in performance, it would still do the things a normal phone should, so take my money, i want this! I'm all about the originality"
I like it..
Nothing has made me want to try out a new phone but this this might be the one
"I think Nothing has great potential....they can build up on the mistakes that Oneplus did, and actual be a real threat to the status quo"
"People aren't little kids anymore, and it is 2022.
People care about performance, battery, Cameras, charging, screens, and price. 
You know, actual specs you live with and use, rather than bells and whistles that grab your attention for 5 minutes then get bored of it, like the whole custom notification sound era.
What a weird phone to exist."
true
Man really called out OnePlus at the end like that
"Yes, Pity Dope!!
Maybe normally No one charge their phone or put their device upsidedown."
Sir phon gave me
"That USB-C  is a game changer, I'm interested"
"White is my fav color for gadgets and cars, lots of potential on the Nothing Phone."
Side punchhole camera most disgusting looks why nothing do this😐
Reminds me of my favorite phone ever. The essential phone
"It's the Oneplus!  He's talking about Oneplus, right?"
Miss notification lights. Isn't coming to the US either. Well not yet. Idk switch and throw a clear case like I have on my moto. I like to be different tho
"i would definitely buy this phone, look pretty cool and unique..lets wait for the specs to come out 👍👍"
another iphone clone (without ios)  lol
I saw the thumbnail and I thought it was just an iPhone 12 with a metal case 💀
Can you also review Nokia phones
"Hi Marques, can you do an updated video on the Motorla Droid? I think it'd be interesting to see your perspective on it now since you made one about it in 2009. Love the videos!"
I finally found you from Facebook 👍😁😁
Cool
oh the shaaaade 😂
Awesome design guys … Loved the colour and Brand they developed will be number 1 in the world jus wait and watch
I’m buying this cause it has LEDS? just a cool gimmic I guess not really that usefull
Lame
It's my birthday can you gift me iPhone
"I know it wouldn't be as cool, but surely just having an always on display that can light up with the same kinds of patterns would be equally as good, maybe even better because it'll be more customisable?"
@Krrish Lots of people leave their phone face up too. If you have a case the camera bump is irrelevant. And the screen gets dirty enough without putting it face down on everything. I always put it face up unless I'm having a conversation with someone and it feels rude
@Krrish What world do you live in? Everyone leaves their phone screen up.
"@?????? always on displays (from Samsung, not sure about the other brands), never have the image in the same position all the time to prevent the burn in. It always shifts around."
Well you can’t be able to have those cool lights while using the phone. It could also lead to display burn in if you have concentrated light strips on a display that’s always on. You also can’t use it as a soft light for macros or when you just need a softer light than the flash. Also looks cooler imo
"@Krrish Yes, yhat makes semse too, but most people slap a case on it anyway and have it screen side up, from what I've seen in my country."
So if you want to waste your goddamn time looking at the back of a phone for 10 f****** minutes watch this dude video now I'm going to go waste five more minutes of my time and search on YouTube actually see what the goddamn UI looks like in find someone who talks about the f****** UI
"This has such 2000s vibes, everyone would have been obsessed if this was released then"
"So a year long hype into oblivion, only to say 3 weeks before launch it's not coming to the US. They had one shot at this and blew it."
It’s more like Tron phone 🫴
The feels when no US availability
I will buy it. and there is already a video on YouTube with review
Muito legal
aint no way bro said FYI irl LMAOOOO
I’m guessing he was talking about One Plus? 😂
"Looks cool, not coming to North America (doesn't even have the bands if you want to import it) no need to review it anymore"
OnePlus lol
"Finally premium flat screened phone 
Love the notification light 
Software looks clean and minimal of what little has been shown

Design looks great 

If specs and camera are flagship could be a hit"
@Max Trewhitt correction* my bad it is a 778g+ and I got this from GSM arena where they found geekbench scores of it
@Lmao Ded Source?
it has a snapdragon 778g+ which according to benchmarks is not a great chipset
Damn those AirPods looking thing look ugly af
Tremendous.... I hope it will come in affordable for all midle class people at least...🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥
two d's in middle my dude
the ending was good lol
what was he explainin about ??? cuz I can clearly see ''nothing''✨
Back cover
"Okay, now this phone? I love. It looks cool, it is actually using a lot of small cool things that I would like to have
I'm not even saying about squared edges that is my favourite thing in general, it is like the thing to sell me the phone instantly. Alongside that interesting industrial design at the back"
Nokia 3220 keypad mobiles
Nothing phone processor is old and low his Workeblity is going to down
I really hope their slogan will be: There goes Nothing!
"For me, I never put my phone facing the ground because I have to flip the phone to read any message or see any notification. When it comes to led notification when recording is a good feature because on the other phones you will be not be able to know that someone is secretly recording you. I believe that,only good thing about this device will be the camera and user interface if they execute correctly."
He taunted the oneplus
"Hey MKB I bought Oneplus 1 by watching your review, remember how you through the phone into the grass during rain, i was impressed, who knows this time once again😁"
Hello
It's a collection. Simple
If I talk about the backside this is really unique  but the thing is not awesome. It can be attached in a phone case the lightning stuff.
"This could be a hit phone now all they need is to hit the ""sweet spot"" meaning the phone has to have good enough hardware to compete in the current market, working software and the most important is reasonable pricing. If it's going to be way more expensive and less capable than the current generation high end phones the design and uniqueness will not suffice sadly. 
I love the design and the led effects for notifications and all. If they can release a flagship and mid range version of these then I think they can be very successful!"
@Joseph S it will cost around $400 for 8GB Ram Variant And $450 for 12GB RAM Variant
It's confirmed now that this phone will come with a mid ranger snap 778g processor.. 'nothing' much to be excited about it I guess!
"@The Man i would definitely take a good 16mp 4bin camera (from 64) but with a decent sensor and a nice camera app. let me have manual control on the cameras on both video and photo. let me see a real time light approximation in the viewfinder before i adjust the exposure and iso etc.
6-6.5 inch would be fine in hand, i dont need no curved screen business so this is appealing.
dual speakers for sure!
aaand the price range is kinda impossible to be that low haha, maybe 799?"
@The Man yip one more feagure customize led colours

Finally a new useful feature in a smartphone. Wow.
The Nothing Phone will become unaffordable soon.

"Did they just pay you to put up such kinda review.. I guess they did.. I will charge a lot of money just to put up such kinda review.. the phone is just... @&$)(;:/-.,?!',I don't know...."
"TouchID please, physical TouchID"
It should be RGB led
"Non-screen indicators is something I miss from old phones. This makes me want to switch to Android... maybe. It looks/feels like what people in the 1980s imagined future phones would look like.  I feel like people will want to program the lights to do something more than just flash... like respond to music, indicate a direction to go, etc. Sometimes we can't have our full attention on a phone so having a simple elegant indicator that is easy to interpret just by glancing rather than reading carefully declutters a lot of our visual space."
@Super knullisch you just made me rethink my life choices
"@Tsuppi desu! Please continue practise your English, punctuation and grammar, because it's barely readable.."
"No offence, but it sounds like you got way too much projects, work, and responsibility on your hands, to be honest. And may I add.. if your everyday default position is.. ""Sometimes we can't have our full attention on a phone"" - Then you seriously need to stop for a minute and consider what kind of life, you're currently living, imho. I might be wrong here, but it sure sounds more like you're living inside of your phone, rather than in real life, using a phone when needed. And only briefly, once in a while, during a normal day, manage to get distracted enough, to actually forget about that damn thing for a min or two. Nothing in your life, other than a newly born baby, should have that kind of attention occupation. So, with that said, it really should, rather be.. ""Most of the time I don't devote my full attention to my phone. In fact. I almost forget that I have one, sometimes. And thus.. I need to have a good indicator, if possible, preferably an elegant discrete one, which brings my attention to it, from whatever, much more important aspect of life, I'm currently devoting myself too"". 

Because that's how it used to be, remember? You know, before smartphones, and arguably before GSM and NMT network cellphones, too! How often did you find yourself actively ogle at a landline phone while not using it and actually doing something else, completely non-related to the phone? Maybe, once in a while, when expecting an important call, or perhaps when noticing that a friend didn't call for a week or two, which either usually called more or less every other day, or at least once or twice a week. But yeah, I know.. you can do a thousand things or more on a smartphone, since it's a small handheld computer with a call (and text) function as a well, essentially. Not that I need to enlighten you, nor anyone else reading this, about that probably, but you know, just for the record and arguments sake. Anyway.. since that's what a smart phone is, more time will naturally be spent on it. And that I'm neither against, nor am I telling you, or anyone else, that they need to drop everything, and especially not their phone right now and just walk off into the nearest wilderness, lol no! 

My point however, is this.. Instead of having a device that calls on our attention, because someone is trying to reach us, be it a company though an app, via notifications, or a direct call or a friend. We now let the phone/communicator/computer, aka the smartphone, dictate if any time and attention, can be devoted to something else too. Because it has now become the default beacon for almost our whole attention, when it comes to quite a lot of people, especially in the young generations. The only clear disrupter to this phenomena and addiction, now sadly, only seems to be, going to work. Sorry for the lecture.. But this phone addictions is a true plague and one of our times most serious societal hazards. And I just wanted to give you and others that presumably are younger than myself, a heads up, since I'd argue that I have a pretty honest and clear view of what's going on and what we are transitioning to. That's all. 

Oh and am.. if you want to call me a boomer, feel free to do so! Even though I was born in 1984.. ; )"
"Was a huge fan of notification led until I got my Galaxy S7. Turns out always on display is way way better. Tells you clearly from which app you got a notification, can display several of them, also gives you time, date, and battery percentage. All that in a less intrusive / obnoxious way."
@Jonas 🤓🤓
"So the first generation of this phone will be invite only, just like the OnePlus 1

I have a feeling that Nothing will just be OnePlus Version 2, eventually becoming a mainstream plain glass sandwich"
"I think most people have been used to rest their phone on their backs since the phones having a big display at the front. If people hold on to their habit, which is very much likely, the back led panels of nothing phone will be useless. I think nothing should have come up with a more different design to lure loyal customers from Apple. I think led lights at the sides would be more preferable than at the back. By the way amoled displays offer notification lights a comeback with some help of apps, since it works pixel by pixel. Notifiation leds won't make much difference to my opinion. Asus  has already sold anime matrix at their laptops. Honestly that thing will easily put out these leds on the nothing phone. If nothing makes anime matrix like customisable led arrey, i would consider the brand. 
   And the ringtones are aweful. Sounds like the phone is about to get sick or it is showing some warning before it goes off."
"Design is great new features and android, definitely buying this one💪😁"
Sounds familiar? Oneplus
Front looks no notch IPhone... Back looks Repaired iPhone.
Lets pray 1 mins for the fancy non transparent back cases..
Essential Phone pt 2
"If they had RGB tied into the LEDs as well, this would be awesome."
yeah give it more flashing lights..... 🐑
🦜🤖
Awesome phone decided. But i think perhaps the company should make a phone case with App instead. Because as i can see their selling pitch is just the back of the phone. 🤔
what's with all the notification lights on the back who puts their phone face down
Where & when can buy it❓❓🤘🏻
Good look but software and security is important to
i miss the front multi color led that you were able to configure based on the notification
My Nextel walkie talkie flip phone had a battery pack that obnoxiously lit up when someone called me.
An Android after all....right?
"I prefer to keep my phone face up! 🙂
Red LED recording indicator was cool."
"Now, as you are showing the back so much: when owning a phone, how much do you look at thw back? I am always looking at the screen. Thats why its there."
"Cool features but ""Nothing"" to make me switch from my beautiful S22 Ultra. I'm kinda past the ""iPhone Tron"" type theme. 
I do love their ear bud's.."
The OnePlus reference at the end was so clean.
🤞
"Says that he can show only the back of the phone...
Goes on to show the screen at 2:27
Great job though"
it is a nice video man
"Nothing realy bothered me to watch bcs english is my second language.
If you know, you know. Lol"
That long OnePlus reference. 😂😂
Who lays thare phone with the screen down do?
The Review I’ve been waiting for!!!!
No bottom bezel like iPhone
Sounds familiar with OnePlus
Appreciate it
"Friend: what phone do you have 

Me : nothing 😂"
"Thay should make all sizes As 
S , L , XL , XXL"
What is the brand at 6:20?
Too bad its not coming to the US.
I don't know who need this feature 😶
I love innovation. So i am going to keep my eye on this product. But... at this point there is nothing compelling enough shown to pull me away from what i use now. It works. Im happy. I keep my phone face up. No LEDs needed tbh. I know who is calling me because my phone says it on the screen lol
The millions of tiny LEDs in the front of my phone is certainly way more than enough for notifications and I don’t need to have it facing down while charging which means having to flip the phone when you need to use it :P
"It's almost like every other phone on the market has this giant, customizable LED panel on the front, huh?"
"""there is _nothing_ compelling enough shown to pull me away from what i use now""
So you'll switch ? xD"
With all this features I’m sorry for the battery
"Basically, it's a fancy phone. Mobile ecosystems are really saturated now. No new innovations as such."
sd 778g 🥴
I don't like red LED light indication while taking videos.
I think he said about OnePlus at the last
جامد 🔥
"I just switched from an s9 to s21.
Forget the loss of the micro SD or headphone jack....the loss of the notification LED has turned out to be the most annoying thing.

I didn't realise how often i used it"
too bad it’s not coming to the us.
"Lighting like Nokia 3220
Design look like iPhone"
"I just wanna remind people that Nothing is a startup company. We're witnessing their first steps into a huge market with extreme competition. What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
"Nothing Special, literally.
I mean, what's the selling point of this phone? Definitely it is going to rely on Android eco system and OS, and uniqueness wise, it has nothing."
This is by far the stupidest video I've watched on this channel.
Awesome
Pun intended 😁
Nothing took Cyberpunk 2077 way too seriously.
I thought this phone isn't supported in NA? It's listed on their website it isn't fully supported in NA and no NA carriers are listed on the supported carrier page...
This iphone 13 look strange
It does sound familiar. I'm certain Carl knows exactly what you're talking about 🤣
My ass. Asus ROG's implementation of rgb logo is better for stuff like this
Sucks it's not being released in the USA.
6:32 1+ lol.. 🥴
Last comment was a real stabbing to some visionary people a few years ago.
"Nothing faces 2 challenges;
1. Succeeding within the phone market
2. Succeeding without betraying their early fans, like OnePlus."
I M Waiting 12 Or 18 July
I Want This Phone Soon
More broadly smartphone descriptions fit perfectly with OnePlus.
This is 💩
It looks cool... But usually my phone screen facing up.

I think it's cool with those LED's bc we are tired to see all the the same thing almost so this is different now it would be good they had RGB LED's
778G+...? IS REAL...?
"Yeah 778G+, hype goes to nothing..."
Ugly phone.
Back part is inspired from Tiktok ring light... 😁

"VERY soon, we'll see a plethora of ringtone apps that capture that cool spacey/electronic sci-fi vibe in sound and look applied to the front face, with lots of movie themes to choose from: 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien, Blade Runner, The Matrix, Star Wars, Marvel, on, and On, and ON. (Just the representative abstracted light flickers and sound blips, ma'am; not the imagery or actual sounds.)

The phone will capture a few, but the software renditions will come fairly cheap and capture many for the same thrill, without trading from their favorite phone."

His tee matches the nothing style
I never expected this crunchy voice
I personally think that this look with transparent look with everything covered with neat clean white layer IS the best. like not too much over the top design and not  same like other. I don't know MKBHD compares it to Naruto phone.
"To be fair they could create their own cases, that have a transparent back where the light is. Maybe also, so the light can be in the color of the case."
To be fairrrrrrrrrr
@john doe (diy) Not a color filter it is a film protector which I've been using on my old phones for more than 2 years!🧐
They already make it
If manufacturers can make case for z flip they can definitely do that
I'm an investor and they have made special back cover  for it ! You will see the phone once it's available. The phone was created with that in mind and ex Dyson Head of designs made sure it looks great
Everything is cool except those annoying ringtones
"I really really like the front. I mean, it's just symmetrical like the iphone is. You never get that in an Android before (except maybe the pixel 5)"
Nothing Phn = Something from iphone back + something from op front
"It may be a new feature in smartphones, but Nokia did the LED lights atop the phone (in a pattern that perfectly match the ringtone) way back in 2004. Look up Nokia 3220."
The marketing is sooo cringe and i don't like how they have so many influencers on as investors - it makes me question every review.
May cenal se kuc milega shikne milega shikne milega 😭😭😭😭 i
This may be better than iPhone
No.. Its Chipset ruined it all
What some call a ‘feature’ I call a gimmick.
Google had their chance.  They done $@?!#% up.  Oneplus went oneNEGATIVE.  Even the remnants of essential didn’t get the memo.
Why would any1 give a $&!? about nothing in 2022.  If you’re not Samsung or Apple don’t waste my time.
That is literally an iPhone. 😂
"Try to use ""LED backcase"" in samsung S20 series onwards. Far more sophisticated and practical."
I love this
I thought you said you are only allowed show the back of the phone at 1:11. But a few minutes later at 2:26 you showed the front of the phone. Lol
3:20 Ahh that classic wrap stablizer f-up
"It looks cool , does it have In-display fingerprint?"
What if it was a case instead of a whole phone?
cute
कुछ भी नहीं फोन
Too bad it's not launching in the US
this phone is very deaf-friendly phone.
"I had bought I phone & sold it after 2 weeks due to UI & Customisation but I was in love with that mobile design. Now the same design with android, this is gona be something cool"
I wasted my time waiting to get this phone and today I find out Nothing Phone is not coming to USA market 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
"Is it only me or does anyone else thinks the lights on the back say ""CGI!"""
why would i look at my phones back when i have front?
Surely it has a R2D2 ringtone right? I mean thats a given right?
is that glass or plastic on the back? I wanna this phone 6 months after purchase and how it stacks up with scratches...will it still look transparent or just be riddled with scratches? Jerry-RigEveything video is going to be very interesting.
"かっこいい！！！
欲しい！！！"
Looks different but look exactly like an iPhone
"Then we find out that it won't be coming to North America, and if you try to import it, it might not be compatible with any carriers, cool..."
"Honestly, I don't understand the mostly positive comments here under the video. This phone just looks like another unfinished, over-hyped scam. Design is iPhone 12 (which isn't necessary a bad thing, when done correctly). Most of the features presented in the video are useless gimmicks - those ringtones sound just like static noise, terrible. Weird led strips on the back - who the hell needs notification leds on the back? The only time I turn my phone display down is when muting a call/alarm. Besides that there is absolutely no need to turn the phone - so some notification led on the back is just plain dumb. And the gimmick showing charge percentage when charging - freaking stupidity - why should I charge the phone display-down and wobble the phone display down, to see the charging percentage? Most useless feature of the year. 
With no word on display quality, camera sensors nor battery capacity, only these useless gimmicks have the main marketing focus. It's just stupid and unnecessary. 
And those promises of ecosystem? Well they could build an ecosystem on OnePlus phones, instead they just crippled the brand and now we should trust them to do it differently? Besides, creating an ecosystem isn't done overnight, we can observe that Huawei makes some progress in this regard, but it's still far away from Apple - difference is using opensource or proprietary systems. So no  enthusiasm in this regard either. 
The last thing will be price. Should it be priced near 700-800eur, there is virtually no reason to stick with Nothing phone, when we just have flagship alternatives in this price range - iPhone 12/13, Samsung Galaxy s22. And I don't believe Nothing can cut the price down, in todays situation when electronics components are just too expensive."
looks like oblivion phone 🔥🔥🔥
"is this a phone review or a lights review ? 
this used to be a very good review channel, but now I dont know what MKBHD has turned into nowadays"
Anyone else get Tron vibes from the LED lights?
Chaiya chaiya 🤓🤓phone
wowowowow
Because putting a small text display in the back would have been soo uncool?
Not calling out OnePlus there at all are ya?... Haha
He was talking about one plus in the end right?
"Oh cmon, they call that innovation? Other brands made a screen at the back..... So you can put anything on the screen..."
"Stupid back design idea. Nothing more than a marketing gimmick, I mean how many people actually put their phone screen facing downwards."
"People gonna think it's a white transparent iphone 13 pro. When you tell them that it's actually Nothing, that subtle polite disappointment in their voice when they say ""oh... but it's cool""... So nope from me. Just a marketing trick. Gimmick if you will. And I have basically zero trust in them and everything they do."
"I remember you said the earbuds suck, so how much they pay you to buy that stupid led phone?"
After a long time I have seen seriously different phone.
I am not buying this phone for those led gimmicks
What is the camera and pictures quality of this phone??
What about nothing's first charger 😂
6:23 until they go down the One Plus way and turn it into Oppo phone 😂
Need Invite to get one !
The ringtone reminded me of those toy phones of my childhood here in India😅
"Great Looking phone. Is it better than an Iphone SE? Because the price range is really similar. 
Also, android phone with a custom ROM, how many years of updates will it support? This is important, since people don't like to spend money only to realise that in two years time you'll end up with an unsecured brick in your pocket."
Is it Broken?
"The hardware piece does look quite nice, now I'll need to see the software in action."
Probably near Stock Android + nifty exclusive features just like Moto and older Oxygen OS.
It would be great if nothing will stick with Android!
"you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
"LMAO, that last bit hit so hard  🔥 I had such a massive crush on my OPO and I left the OP dream as soon as the OP2 launched (and without Cyanogen). Carl Pei should take notes!"
They left CN mod for a reason
It's just a iphone 11 without the back plate
I might get this if the battery life is pretty decent and there's a black color.
This is so cool

Hi
"I actually really like the idea behind this device, tho 1 small addition could be like 2 more camera sensors because a strong macro lens can really use those lights well. And maybe the LEDs in the back could be RGB set from the software.
It could also make telling different notifications apart from each other based on the color (Like the Galaxy S5 did) and the LEDs could also provide some more finetuning for closeup photos with different fill light colors and color temperatures for white led.
I hope they'll also support custom Android development and provide the neccessary drivers needed to build something custom to it cause imo, this already pretty different looking phone is awesome and is a breath of fresh air compared to the 20000000000000000000000000000000000000 almost exactly the same looking device we have nowadays."

"If they were actually smart, they would design a case which does these things via bluetooth, powered either by a very small rechargeable battery or directly powered from wireless charging of a phone.
Costs a lot less to do, is more modifiable/customizable and can take different shapes and formed, controlled by an app.
There, i gave you the idea for free, now someone go do this already. :P"
"Мне больше понравились ровные грани и прямой экран (без ущербного водопада). Ещё бы перископную камеру и 8gen1, взял бы не раздумывая"
Transparent plastic parts tend to acquire a yellowish hue over time which looks pretty nasty. Hopefully they got this figured out :)

what a bummer! big L! afterall the hype they build! would have been better if they use SD 7 Gen 1.
i f love that intro
what a disappointment using an old chip instead of the newest one. 🤦🤷
35k-40k ? In that range already there are many established phones ... We can't trust a newly organized and completely unknown OS 🤔
What chipset is in it and which US carrier will it work best on?
I love that phone!  Finally something different
Whats the name of the phone?
Nothing Phone 1
"Hey guys, Marques here. I’ve been living with NOTHING for about a month now and…"
"Nice nod to how ""One+"" progressed at the end of the clip and agreed, this feels familiar in that way... and who is making this phone (production partners)?"
cant say I hate the transparent concept. could be nice on an iphone.
"I don't care what the phone on the back looks like, I use it by looking at the front.. so I don't buy it"
"interesting phone, wouldn’t switch to it…"
Wow. Looks like u are sold to Nothg
How can you not call these features a gimic!!!
Neat
40-50k price india 🇮🇳😢
"Not any more flagship or flagshipkiller, I need this one!"
aliya baki specifics paraa .... alathey ichiri ichiri ... 😅😹⚓
Who asked for this? Like really
Colors will be interesting 🔥🔥🔥 black
"🔥🔥 I am YouTuber 🔥 🔥
🔥🔥Me YouTuber hu 🔥🔥
🔥🔥Mera channel se apka help ho sakta hai 🔥🔥
😘🥰Nice video😘🥰"
its mostly a gimmick and does nothing!!!
Nothing did something
It should be mentioned that this phone will not be available in the US.
The iPhone of android world 🌎
in will smith voice: TAKE MY FUC KIN MONEY
Looks like an iPhone 12
Look's fresh and clean
I think your facing your phone the wrong way 😂
The ringtone LED sync is a throwback to the old Nokia days......
Revolutionary LED patterns already shown by Nokia 20 years ago (3220 anyone? It even had air messages using a custom cover).
"I see a cat on the back 😅... Or is it just me 😁.
Well for the phone, it would depend on the initial release price.... 👍"
Phone look very think 🤔
the battery runs out quickly. led lights are used
No puns to OnePlus.
From Never Settle......looks like I would be settling to Nothing!
"For people who are interested in this phone, it is confirmed that it is not gonna be fully supported in US, maybe not working at all."
I still think that the LG Wing or the Fairphone had more... substance?
Just showi back what the fu*k. How much nothing paying to you ?
"why tf is there so much talk about this stupid phone when it literallly just has fucking stupid blinking lights on it and everything else is shit, fucking npcs"
"Reason to switch, no software bugs and quick OS updates. Not complicated."
Someone is trying to 3d print your fingerprints I bet
nothing+nothing=something
"The side by side of the front and back of the camera showing the ring tones, I appreciated that."
Hi
That ending though 🤣🤣
Noone show front of a phone😁
"Everything this *GIMMICK* provides can be done *BETTER* by just slapping a screen on the back, it would cost just 30-40$ 

Who has the time and effort to decipher notifications in *morse code*"
Nothing is Settle.
The Nothing iPhone
I like how he spoke about OnePlus without saying OnePlus 😂
Nothing phone 1 is going to kill each and every smartphone brand even iphone also
"honestly I'm not impressed, I find it useless as a novelty and it's still something that can break down and that will surely play into the repair cost.  it will never be on my wishlist, maybe one of their future models, one day...."
been telling people for years iphone needs a design that changes everything with LEDS Everywhere & finally someone did it pretty dope phone coming from a big fan of LED products.
"4:01 that ringtone sound like gunshots. I think having that kind of ringtone going off on anyone's phone would freak anyone out, whether it's loud enough or not. I dunno."
"It looks different but a bit gimmicky and I'm not sure I want a lit back to my phone - when I put it face down, I want to ignore it. Once the new foldables become more available and less expensive I think the mobile phone market will see a change design-wise. I'm surprised that phone manufacturers aren't more adventurous with the look of the phones that are being produced though and give us something that could set it apart from the others - they could be fashion accessories as well as running our daily lives! I liked the Marshall phone & style that came with it, but the specs meant that it soon became outdated."
OneMinus feeling abandoned!!😉
Will wait for the Black Edition
Why aren't Europeans developing smartphones? It's all Asians and Americans.
"Sound Familiar?
OnePlus of course, he was their CEO before so it only makes sense @MKBHD"
6:33 hurts
Why not use the front OLED panel to do that? Then the phone can be left the right way up.
Performance ??
please upload latest what's on my phone 2022 edition..
What is price
Does anyone know if a giveaway scam is going on on this channel?
Above is MKBHD video on this subject
"trust me,people like me will hate too much light on phone..🤣🤣"
"Yes Marques it does sound familiar, oneplus doing it all over"
"Nice description of how oneplus started, and that too by the same person 😂"
Make it run iOS and I'd buy it.
No
"Nothing has something like iPhone 12😂
Another Copy Cat china Brand🙄"
Why tho
Finally an android phone company that actually understands aesthetics - buying this thing on launch upgrading from my iphone xs max
Damn... Interesting.
Bán rẻ xíu thì mới mua đc
Another one plus but with more emphasis on looks 🙃🤣
"""""I respect everyone who were involve in this serisel the best peace that I""be ever seen on YouTube, HATS OFF TO WELL ALL! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!😔🥰👍😔👍😔"

"5 seconds in i was like ""what is this Iphone looking device?"" then i saw the LEDs and i was like WAAAAAANT! 

it would be dope if you could change the LED colours at the back though."
It feels like an iPhone but features Android XD
"Honestly.. I like it 👍 I’m just so deep into the Apple ecosystem that I can’t switch from my HomePod to my watch (apples plan successfully worked on me lol) but if it wasn’t for the ecosystem, I would def cop just the design itself with the led sold me"
THEY STOLE IT FROM FAIRPHONE.   IT'S TOO MAST
I don't think it'll work.
I don't think it'll work.
"Phone looks different n impressive!!!
But the screws on back isn't looking good!!!
Screws to my eyes looks like the back panel is removed for repairing lol"
lets say all together - gimmick
I like how the bottom LEDs look like an exclamation mark!
Colour me intrigued. Reminds me of the Watchdogs game aesthetic.
"imagine waiting all week for a video, then MKBHD makes one about nothing."
6:08 I see what you did there
Good start
"„Copy my Homework, but don’t make it obvious“"
Wanna download its ringtones. Some one please share a link.
"Lol, the OnePlus rant was awesome... That is exactly they have done!!! 🤣🤣🤣"
"I always love the “naked” concept phone or whatsoever gadget, just like xiaomi explorer edition or the the redmagic with its rgb intergrated cooling fan. Although nothing really wants to stand out from the stereotype of transparent back concept phone, i wish it shows more contrast with the back of the phone, maybe the black application will shoot out the taste like nothing ear buds. 
Btw the red dot recording notifications seems to be a lil bit off, because you know, sometimes you want to record without alert, whatever the usage 🤗"
"@Zeedo like, up their clothes?? That's crazy"
"@acdeeiprrt I live in Denmark, you’d be surprised over the amount of ppl recording and taking pictures of other ppl and women in busses and trains."
"@Zeedo where do you live? there's absolutely no expectation of privacy in public anywhere I've heard of

edit: besides upskirt photos and shit like that obviously"
"@Zeedo yeah, OP is freaking creepy"
"And its exactly so you dont record people in public without them noticing, because its literally illegal"
(MKBHD ) AS AN INDIAN I GUESS SOMETHING UNUSUAL ......................
Those 10 ringtones with LED lights is so cool
"My question is. Are chinese companies able to make something which is not 90% inspired from other companies such as apple or samsung on which they add some weird, useless, no one asked for bling blings?"
Probably the first person to do justice to nothing
I mean its still mostly just hype and nothing much else other than those leds and a different ui
"If Nothing has to learn anything from just 1 company, it has to be One Plus. They literally abandoned their fanbase."
Nothing hype machine recruiting all the big YouTubers again eh? This time we're being told it's 'innovative' because it has some LEDs on the back and if you don't get how innovative this is your not cool or something? Hmm.
"The lighting up for ringtones was first done by Nokia, waay back on it's feature phone with 4 side lights... Nokia 3220 or something"
Something phone? 🤷
"Lmao so the only ""new"" feature  this phone has is some LEDs. How much was Marques paid for this ad"
NO AMERICAN RELEASE!
I don't think you'll be missing out on much be the way nothing is creating hype for this phone
It's an exact iphone without the notch
I am waiting...i want to buy...😊
"Looks cool but the question is how many people actually keep the phone in the screen down position? Why will anyone want to risk scratching their display. Also say I get a call, I can just see the name on the display, why will I turn around my phone to see the light and then interpret Ohhh this is the person calling me. This does not look practical"
मैं एक युटुबर हु मैं आपका मदद कर सकता हूं
"What I'm allowed to show is the back of the phone
Proceeds to show front of the phone"
Gimmicky.  Pass.  iPhone or Galaxy all day.
"pixels are great too nowadays, just kinda buggy sometimes"
what would you use for a phone cover? nothing?
Marques please stop doing these if you consider yourself a genuine reviewer. This embargo shit just builds unnecessary hype which leads to people spending money with preorders on subpar products when they actually do come out. Nobody wants to see just the back of the phone. Mrwhosetheboss has stopped doing these and time you do too. Don’t let the Industries control the narrative.
"Yes lol ,great comment"
Revonext QT5 HiFi Stereo Wired Earbuds Noise Isolating
Looks like a stripped iPhone 12 to me. Futile buzz around this phone.
Lets hope its not all just hype again like the earbud
"It looks interesting as an idea, but unfortunately I never put my smartphone screen down, and I find ringtones terrible, so most likely I would choose something else😔"
"I don't speak English well, so my statements may sound strange, and that was just my opinion."
"unfortunately? thats a weird way to put it. Also, you find ringtones terrible? Like all of them, like the whole concept of audible feedback? is this a bot, lol?"
The last minute sounds  familiar which sums up NEVERSETTLE (Untill Oppo acquires you)
first i thought the back is just for look. But they managed to give it practice futures
Sound familiar?? One plus??? What???
Give this nothing phone 📱 to me
LED gimmicks are cool but the real question is what it has on the inside
Thanks for showing something probably over 50% of your following won't be able to buy... Sucks this isn't coming to the US.
you won't be Missing out on much most probably
What would be the display size!?
Not sure who is the target customer for this kind of flashy LED back. Some kind of attention grabbers would like to flash and distract everyone in public transports  or airports or cafeteria with this LED show going on. Most people would like to disable the feature or cover the phone in a non transparent case to avoid embarrassment.
But price segment most important
Lovely
"they say they will start change.
i didn't knew that change is uniquely copying (camera layout, lights animation, design) LOL.

 Thank god I bought Xiaomi 12 pro atleast a change."
That sounds familiar 😬 roasting at its best
after a long time im excited about phones.
The Nothing phone ... hehehe
Led light on back is awesome 😊but it is waste feature 🧐🥱. No use on glowing led on back🥴. More battery drain become possible🤕.But nice marketing strategy from nothing👏👏.
"Man, cool video but Iphone is the way.. The phones you mentioned in this video are like created in LittleBigPlanet 2’s creative mode. Like, cool but no thanks!"

OnePlus 8T cyberpunk 2077 edition
👀💥
I appreciate different phones. Samsungs and iphones are boring
"🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻, Awesome video!"
I Like The Design And Notification Lights Of The Phone But i Don't like the front left side camera
Nice
Imagine black back panel with LEDs that would be great
Matt black version would be sick. I would love to see it
Nothing phone like different my thought but only led light show not different
"Im impressed. Its funny watching apple come out with all these features we had a decade ago on cydia lol. Havent been impressed by any of apples ""new"" features"
I'm pretty dissapointed they just announced it's not being released in North America.
Gimmicky
Kindly update its camera samples and other specifications.
"But...who charges their phone face down?🤔
Whaaaa..."
what will be the price of this phone ?
looks neat. would I pay $2600 for a neat looking phone? lol.
I want RGB in that phone that will be so sick 😍😍😍
It looks like a Star Wars phone :)
Plz bring detailed review of Nothing OS on Phone-1
"My god, those are the worst sounding ringtones I’ve ever heard. Are they serious?"
"When he said ""nothing has built an entire user interface into the settings....."" wait nothing built it? How did it come to be? I'm sorry but that was too funny how it was said"
If it has a headphone jack it has already won over apple🙃
I need this phone. But I can't miss out on a Case. Hopefully there will be a good Case.
it looks like iPhone 12 and 11
"Cool gimmick but I don’t buy a phone purely for looks, to earn my loyalty you have to be able to support your product for many years ongoing and not abandon the concept immediately. Nothing has a real possibility to break into the electronics markets IF they play their cards correctly and not go egotistic like other brands. In an industry where there is brutal competition, you have to be different such as LG but what kills a product faster is dropping support right away days, months after the initial release."
Damn
Those ringtones sound headache-inducing
Excited for this one 🤩🤩
Are you just showing the front of the phone?
"To me 5:40 just seems stupid. It sounds like they're putting all this effort for what? To mimic something that a cheap case can do? Special packaging despite it will either be thrown away or thrown into the closet? All to steal away what you suggest is a small proportion of the user base of another company?

I mean it's great they're doing something different bit the effort vs reward scaling for them seems skewed. Hell, how is it any different to a big company like Samsung and their BTS collab? Or Apple with the separate color launch? (Both of which will also be made redundant as soon as you put a case on the phone)"
DBrand should make a nothing skin that we can slap on the iPhone.
At 500 euros I would still put a case on it.
In display or side mounted fingerprint sensors?
So will this have it’s own phone OS? Or is it using a android skin?
"I like it, how much is gonna be if you know!?"
Is it true that this phone not going to be released in the United States?
Anyone having this phone in hand is obviously given by the company to say something...nit necessarily useful
"How many of you leave your phone ""screen up"" on a table"
The front looks cooler than IPHONE
"They definitely pulled the ringtone composers from sci-fi movies, and I’m here for that."
"Member that time will smith was like ""i want fortnite and marques brownley in rewind."" Like what a strange combo. Does he even like fortnite?"
So this phone all about only Lights
IPhone 11 design with Android features and light up back leds. Wala.
I wonder how it will impact battery life! If nothing wants to mark a difference. Bring battery technology that could make the phone last atleast 2X.
"Love the progress bar , but will it be more powerful than an s21+ or have as smooth of a system as iOS?"
6:32 No OnePlus harmed in this video 😂
"Does this thing really cost over $2,600?? Or where to pre-order/buy?"
"This looks pretty lit, fam!"
idk why but this kind of reminds me of Watch Dogs video game. :)
Bro the theme+ringtone+led blinking looks like it's haunted.
Looks like an iPhone 11 in box design with new tweaks as Per the design
sound familiar to oneplus .
"If only this phone was offered on Telekom Romania, as of now that is not on their list of supported carriers, so support for that seems wishy-washy if I were to try it.

Also: I *really* hope this phone has a built in radio. What I love about my Galaxy Grand Prime that I use over there is I can just plug in my headphones and they work as an antenna...if this happened with this phone it would be golden and I would quite literally consider switching carriers."
👌👌👌👌

This is the first Android phone with an even bezel all four sides!
last part got me
"This phone is literally what OnePlus could've been if they stayed with their original appeal. I would gladly buy an expensive phone if it was THIS good in it's gimmick. Stand out, but actually *stand out.*"
"That’s fcking good design phone, i hope we can quality test that"
THE TRON PHONE 😍
"tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der
 Master K. I.                       !!"
Bro what name of this mobile....and this phone look similar like iphone
This is all kinda gimicky tbh. The cool factor will last a couple of weeks then it’s dead.
This reminds me of my old Nokia 3220
"Why have you completely stopped covering OnePlus products?

You didn't review the OnePlus Buds Pro at all. You only gave an initial impressions of the 10 Pro without the correct international OxygenOS installed, and then never came back to it. Nothing for the 12GB version of the 10 Pro. Nothing for the upcoming 10T.

What gives?"
"I love it, I’m gonna buy as soon as it releases."
Does it have default App locker
The ultimate notification LED reminds me of my blackberry gemini back in 2009 😆
"They will launch them cheap and boom, it suddenly has a market. Launch cheap = Great success. :D"
This led arrangement looks gimmicky.
Nothing will be doing nothing.
👍👍👍👍Main Ek YouTube per hun👍👍👍👍 aapke video se mujhe kuchh help mil sakta hai kya👍👍👍👍👍 aap ka video bahut Achcha hai
Ha ha- lovely narrative towards the end😄
Man show us the display 🥴
"Imagine working at the desk across someone using this phone and their phone lights up every now and then.
I wonder if silent mode will turn off the LED at the back too, or else people with this phone need to turn it off when going to movie theater ."
depends on price really
"i remember when MKBHD review Red Phone before it's release, he feel like excited like it's something never done before (and it turn out to be a phone with 3D display worse than 3DS display), now we got this, another 'paid' review from MKBHD waiting to fail hard like Red Phone lol"
So SO SO SO EXCITING
Wow. So I just saw their team announce they are doing the invite system again. Then panning out. Not so sure going down that path is wise...
how i can buy it? and where?
So to actually use its best feature we can put case on the phone..and it will keep breaking..thus huge maintenance cost..
Oh cool another nothing event love your videos😀
"the concept is cool, but the execution falls short (to me, at least). We will wait and see how this develops over time"
Not coming to North America!
Now its time to check the whole perfomance of this phone bro!
👍🏿
whats the point of making a new product if you're just gonna copy someone else and not even do as good. just added some useless lights on the back
Would be better if the LEDs were rgb and you could controll the colors and patterns
It's so cool !
Ok now that looks like sth out of Watch Dogs
"It's definitely gonna work as long as their price is below $400. Then, they can increase their price later. Use the OnePlus strategy."
I got so hype after seeing this video only to be let down after finding out it won't be available in the US or Canada. Massive fail.
"Marques, you're allowed to say OnePlus. We know you loved them. We know they turned their back on you. We now you've got a Samsung in your pocket, and we know that having something so mainstream hurts a little bit... We feel it, too."
If it comes in 7gen1 no one is gonna buy it
Apple needs a light up apple and transparent phone the insides of apple devices already look sweet
I definitely buy this mobile.. because former head of OnePlus ceo Carl pai.. present OnePlus mobiles not value for money..I think This mobile is Big compteter in midrange & OnePlus mobiles ... Pocket friendly budget iphone 😜🥳
lol you can’t even show the phone and can’t  use in the states…🤦🏾‍♂️ pointless
"If nothing looks like iPhone 11 
Why does iPhone 11 looks like Motorola one power 😏"
"the earbuds were so bad, had to return them.."
I will call this DedSec Phone
Amazing edit wonderfull iphone
Marquessss can i get oneeeeeeeeeee 2 july its my birthdayy
Weird ass ringtones but effective.
Felt the shots fired at OnePlus at the end haha (former OP3 and OP6 user here)
I want to buy this in india from where i can
"Wow, i would say they just made some random lines, no finesse. These lights to me seem the stupidest feature to come out in recent times with no real use. Also those horrible ringtones."
New trends is bout to begin.. super cool..good luck nothing 👍.. peace bro.
Can you give it to me.
"The very key here upon release is PRICING.
If this above $1000, then for sure this will flop coz people will just go for the safer Samsung or IPhone Flagships.

But if they're at the sub $800 or 700 range, then this will be interesting and if Carl Pei can make this like the OnePlus of old that we all love and not the current OPPOFIED version...."
samsung s22 ultra is far better looking than this ugly lighting toy. .
"Here come's NOTHING™

"The market is going to change, like the accessories supporting this design would be different. Then others will try something similar in few months and the design would be universally accepted. Specifications information needed."

This Phone looks 50% Dope and 50% Childish . Not sure if it would be successful
"I wold like to have a phone with the whole back that lights up just like the jbl pulse,"
"The brand name is ""Nothing""? It sounds like something an edgy 14 year old would come up with. The products might be great, I have no idea tbh. But that brand name choice is downright unfortunate."
Nothing along with that UI and design looks more like a billboard than a phone!

"guys, I think he was taking about one plus"
"Because OnePlus has become has straight up trash and costly to upgrade, i think this could be a perfect replacement if priced properly. I'm still using my OnePlus 6 and 7 to this day. I hope Nothing destroys everything in competition."

"The OnePlus5T was very good value for money at the time.  This feels like they are applying the same marketing tactics, but the value proposition is missing.  No doubt many people who know ""nothing"" about history will buy into this.  If the brand is successful enough, we will again get to see enthusiasts feel betrayed by the eventual switch to more ""mainstream"" products.  I left OnePlus for the Pixel 6 Pro and am enjoying it very much.  I have a feeling that my next phone will be an iPhone."

does it has pure android ??
"I really can't wait when it comes out. I really need one, it looks amazing and finally something different."
i wish they changed the camera double cameras. make that different so the whole back looks diff. otherwise i love this!!!
I pre-ordered one along with a nice black case from Ali express 😆   nah keeping my Z Fold3.
"MKBs comment about appealing more to the masses over time is referencing Apple? If so, iPhone didn’t really have a huge fan base at the start. And it wasn’t really a niche product. If anything I think they’ve gotten less mass appeal as they cater to high-end and pro use cases."
I think ‘abandoned’ is the wrong word for what OnePlus did. ‘Used’ is probably a better fit. Or ‘Manipulated’ ‘Grifted’?
But does it have a notification slider?
"I can said is that all these flashing light will definitly consume battery power , fancy but not realistic, good try for nothing"
not even coming to the US
Guns all out for OnePlus at the end
Sounds familiar... OnePlus. Nothing phone is on my list... loved the back. I'm in...
Yeah it looks just like a slightly tweeked version of an iPhone 12
"There's ""nothing"" unique about this phone.  It's the galaxy in the front and iPhone on the back.  This whole video was about LED lights on the back. Wow, special"
2:25 showing the front of the phone?
Sic! I'm buying this.
Why though.
That’s the worst ringtones I’ve ever heard in my life😂
that light function sounds amazing... i would love to be able to get 1... i doubt it will be available in my region though... so i will probably get another android phone again...
6:33 OnePlus
a lot of fluff
"Nothing is clearly taking the ethos of how apple got big initially. A marketing first compney, make gimmicky features that people talk about which then bring hype to their product. Hopefully they can back it up when you remove all the fluff and get to the actual hardware and software."
Why doesn’t Apple do this to make the logo light up on the back?
Apple : 😧
And people will still cover it with a phone case
We need invite system to buy that shit.. July 12th would reveal the specs and maybe the impression video coming out will be appreciated 👍
The apple logo on the back 👀
"So, not going to happen in the great old USA.  So that's a bummer.  

Also, RGB leds would have made it probably pop that much more.."
"Not going to lie, I like a lot of the design concepts on it."
Adorei
1+????
"Я як зрозумів, у цьому смартфоні немає стереодинамиків?"
"I love the earbuds, they act a little wonky sometimes but a nice product. I'm definitely gonna buy the phone. I'm definitely feeling Nothing products."
"I think the nothing phone looks really good, it manages to emulate the elegant minimalism of apple’s phones whilst still managing to be unique. I have to wait for a more detailed review to decide if it’s worth buying, but it’s off to a great start!"
but... I'm really loving it😊
Cool
it looks an iPhone without notch😮
"I got the nothing ear 1 a few months back and I gotta say that they‘re just amazing. I know. there‘s better and worse but at this price, they‘re just great!"
Os??? Assuming android?? Or….?
It's like if iPhones were actually cool
I’m actually really stoked about this phone!
Another hipster useless fashion garbage
The colors on your t-shirt! If you mean that shameful flag then it would be a big shame on you Mr. Marques.
Sounds familiar? Ahhh... Yes it does bro. I feel u.
This shit's crazy 😧😧😧
Something is better than Nothing
IF IT HAD RGB INSTANT BUY!!!
buy redmagic 7 so
Man I miss the notification LED... My favorite one was on my LG Flex
"Price is important!

Is it?

Why review other phones when you only use apple and say it's the best in all ways for no reason ?
"Because you can still have personal bias, while going through pros and cons of the phone."
The bezel reminds me of the iphone 4 with a larger screen. The back has a pretty cool design.
Slightly cyberpunk aesthetic appeals to me
The nothing  phone looks awesome
The phone will be a party banger with these led's
Wow! Insane tech 🔥 loving the competition and new player in the game. 📱
Research about Islam & Muslims. It’s not like the media says about it. The media does not want you to know the truth.
Have me a Tron vibe tbh.
Why No word about the software???
"ROFL, I hope they do not become something like One Plus .. 1+ had a vision about 8 years ago and lost all of it now and their fan base"
"The phone won't be available in the US and if you try to buy from other countries it may not work in TMobile, Verizon or AT&T. Wow"
"PCMag confirmed they are ""focusing on Europe"", won't be US supported ""yet""

“While we’d love to bring Phone 1 to the entire community around the world, we’re focusing on home markets, including the UK and Europe, where we have strong partnerships with leading local carriers,” the company told PCMag in a statement.

""PCMag reports that anyone who tries to use Nothing’s phone in the US is likely to have “unpredictable” coverage on T-Mobile, no support for voice over LTE on AT&T, and no service at all on Verizon."""
"i can make a bluetooth connected phone cover with these disco led lights, no need to make a phone for this."
I wonder how the back of that phone will survive while in direct sunlight. Like a car in the summer heat with no tint or sun screen.
Looks to me like all hype and zero usefulness. I mean if that's the most outstanding feature of the phone then yes it's gonna be full of gimmicks and nothing more. Oh well.
"I expect a minimalist esthetics of Muji (no mark) when I heard the name “nothing”. But just by looking at the backplate, it is already a mess."
"Insert Captain America gif ""I understood that reference"" here"
Bro next video performance and camera 📷
but that looks like iphone..without a case
I like the jab at oneplus 😁
So basically an iphone without the iphone's best feature(iOS)?
My birthday is on July 12th
Familiar OnePlus 😅
It better have expandable storage and a very good camera
Any chance to get those ringtones on my iPhone?
"""Sounds familiar?""
Cries at OnePlus"
why am i seeing this phone beating apple soon?
"I don't know, because you can't beat Apple if you don't offer the phone in a whole continent at launch."
No headphone jack. No replaceable batteries. Not interested.
2.23good to see a led light backside but who even keeps there phone screen face towards ground
"In one hand the back of the phone looks cool. But in other hand, I'm turning my phone upside down, while I don't want to be disturbed by notifications"
iPhone
Looks like an oh one
Pretty cool take. ::bows down:: :D
The logo created on the back with the led looks like a minimal Apple logo
"Well, I'd just be happy with a front facing LED... SAMSUNG... that would flash and let me know I have a new message. Why this has disappeared is beyond me (yes, minimal phone size and maximum screen is the reason) and blown away that other phones and Apple OS never had this. The phone featured will require a clear case and then the owner will need to lay the phone face down. Nothing wrong with either, just personally not a fan of either. Boy, I'm difficult! 😝"
5:55 he just started taking about OnePlus?
Only the Alert slider is missing 😥
"It's such a cool phone! But I don't want to see another ""dragon slayer eventually become the dragon"" story"
i really don't understand the point. Can't you just have the screen itself light up?
"Looks really cool. But havent seen anything as useless as this. Imagine spending this much RnD money on LED on the back, and different ringtone patterns, and transparent cool look, just to achieve what every phone in the world does if you just turn it display up lmao."
"Lmao. You know what also can tell you who's writing or calling you by specific pattern of light? A screen. Where pixels light up in a pattern of a letter and you can even write whole words with, and if the your lucky and technology is advanced enough you can even be able to write full name of the one calling. What a coincidence that we're having just exactly that device on the other side. Sheesh"
Just the back? C'mon
It's so pointless!
OnePlus fans started to get emotional by the end of the video. I feel you.
From that nothing Owner my favourite so as of marquee boy he is doing always different I am sure this would work well I wish him best of hell of luck
6:42 for high five
I want Apple to acquire the company so that we can upgrade our iPhones with this super cool feature
2:00
2:00
"I'd love to see a battery test for these guys, I can't imagine their software optimisation is excellent right out of the gate but I'm happy to be wrong"
Kon Indian haa hit like
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
So have ring call pattern for different people that you have to memorise. When you can just see the caller ID on the screen? I guess this phone is not for me.
Their whole selling strategy is borrowing the iPhone design and adding some LEDs to the back of the phone!?
that Oneplus reference was pretty slick but cool phone design overall
"Neat gimmick, poor implementation, and I'm sure we'll see Apple do it correctly in 4 years.  🤣"
I want it and now!!!!
Personally I think they’d do pretty well if they made a case for iPhone with the same LED’s as the phone that would work with notifications and battery
"That would be sick! It would periodically charge itself against the iPhone’s wireless charging magnet, and it would connect via Bluetooth."
Believe in our Lord
So basically it’s just gimmicks in this phone.
How does all the led's affect battery life and heat?
"Fam not too sure about those glitch sounding ringtones, seems gimmicky."
Not Marques throwing shade at OnePlus again. 🤣🤣
"The ""Sound familiar?"" caught me soo off-guard"
"sounds familiar? Shout out to Early Oneplus Fan Base!

eye rolls at 4.24 ""that is an interesting, actually new feature!""

guess MKB is also fed up of the use and throw approach CP!"
This will fall out of fashion extremely fast
"Does anyone actually lay their phone screen side down? Aside from the risk of scratching, it's also slippery and bound to fall in most places. Best of luck to them though. I might just buy it for the symmetrical bezels"
It's so Cool 😍
Looks cool but that's it. I bought the ear 1 and I really regret it. It's really buggy. I feel that both of these products are design gimmicks.
What's the point if you gona put cover anyway
Nothing is really NOTHING💯
This is soo cool
"🙏🙏🙏Heloo🙏🙏🙏

"Everything cool but the ringtons are a lil bit aggressive,  seems like the FBI is calling you"
At the ending you talked about oneplus company i guess
low key Powerbook G3 ❤️
kinda reminds me of when I used to deck out my nokia phones back in the late 90s and early 00s with flashing LED lights on the keypad and battery with the clear case lol this nothing phone just brings it to the modern day version it seems!
The good old days when you really OWNED your phone and it had your personal touch. You just don't get that same level nowadays even if the the tech is much better
Sounds very familiar. It was a Pixel perfect recreation of why I switched last time I bought a phone.
Imagine buying a League of Legends phone
Condition when you make a smartphone but forgot to put the back cover on it 🤣🤣
Seems OnePlus Strategy reboot!
Prise in India????
So now we have to use phone from rare side
"Finally they made an Iphone with Android, may consider buying it (just kidding, but as a proud owner of a Oneplus One I think Carl Pei knows his shit)"
All this hype and Phone 1 won't be released in the U.S. Market.
"Honestly the Nothing headphones feels gimmicky to me, so do the Nothing phone (1) when I first heard of it.
But *this backlit?!* It's quite game-changing in action. 🤯 
I love how it's not ""just some fancy deco"" but actually FUNCTIONAL, and even more, quite non-replacable and practically user-fdly.
That different patterns & buzz according situation is definitely something ""minor but awesome"" premium experience features. 
Got me from no expectations & desire to ""Wait, that's actually COOL!"".
(Rogphone also got backlit but it's not using it well)

(And absolutely agree on working on different design. I appreciate iPhone's design (well it works & kind of signature), but for other brands' replica/similar designs really got me bored. That's why I was quite excited when S21, Pixel 6 series (maybe Flip3 too) was out coz they just hits differently. I can understand why they stay in the design and not against it, but also as a user, for flagship phones I expect more characters 🤷‍♀️"
You people will eat up anything. No one would honestly pick some stupid LEDs on the phone's back over an AOD.
What OS will this run on?
"Apple and or Samsung will steal all of those new features, book it! Or buy them out."
imagine adjusting all of your phone contacts to ring differently and then still get no calls just like before
Then you have to keep your phone face down all the time?
"Also £2500 for edition 1, limited to 100 units. Price yourself out before you begin. I am not spending iPhone money on a non iPhone. I still can’t believe people pay a grand for an android based phone. Like £600 is max what I’d pay for non iPhone from any brand."
"Yeah stay ignorant, android is the future"
Is that an Apple PowerBook Pismo on the desk over your right shoulder? Excellent vintage Mac choice if it is! 🍎
nothing is the new one plus
Nice new phone.
Ah the good old never settling days 🥹🥹
iPhone?
THAT LOOKS NOTHING DIFFERENT FROM THE IPHONE
Now I can proudly say I have nothing!
Love from India
I'm kinda disappointed you didn't show the LEDs light up in dark!!!
If they came up with a matt black back with the same light feature then I bet MKBHD would be all over it!
those LED's are really harsh and agressive... a subtle fade in and out would be so much nicer
"these spidermen, batman designs make a company feel childish and this design here is cool"
Cool
Awesome design but I hope they also focus on processor as much as they did on the design 👀
Cool phone. We need more cool looking phones that aren't over the top.
Sounds like more than nothing.
Marques Brownlee please help me our with this please
Lol love the little OnePlus story at the end
ui must be should Super smooth
Please if you are in Ghana and you want to but a phone in usa what are the process I will be going through?
i bet the camera is like OnePlus phones... rubbish!
Yes sounds familiar! Oneplus
surely there isn't enough room to upgrade phones now. the led features can be added to any phone with a custom case I guess.
"I would love to change my main phone from am iPhone to something else. But nothing comes close, still, and not just in terms of the phone, but the interaction or ecosystem, although I’d forgo a lot of the eco system if the operating system on the phone was good, but bloated android is never any competition. Sick looking phone, but it’s not about that, I need a sick OS to go with"
Also just read this won’t be available in North America or Canada.
and then you use it with a solid case.
Its an incentive to buy a clear case.
Bro blk shark pro 12/256 not in India plz help how to get
The phone looks like how people would've imagined smartphones before they were invented
It even sounds like that.
The phone looks like how people would've imagined smartphones before they were invented
Actually no smartphone has multiple cameras.
6:08 ifyk YK
Thanks for revealing the phone before it comes out!!! The front part
Get annoying overtime 😂
You mentioned 12 and the teardown pic is 12 pro
Mi nombre es Carlos Fernando Ausländer del Álamo soy de Canarias España me parece una pasada
Who puts their phone with the display facing down ? This just asking for scratching of your screen .And this nothing phone just looks like a Apple knock off .
"Sounds familiar, Carl! But come on, it's actually an iPhone 12 with a clear back and a OnePlus front.."
wow attractive
New companies have better understanding of required innovations to become unique
Finally! LED 2
"It's really a beautiful phone, very sexy 🤩"
Sound familiar.... OnePlus
Finally I dont need my iphone soon :D
👍💘👍
They are copying apple so much
"Those ringtones, very graceful and yet murderous rage-inducing sounds"
"Am I the only one who think that it looks cooler than an actual iPhone, (it would be even better if they added a third camera)"
It's android right?
If iPhone and Android had a baby
its cool but to be honest the back of a phone is probably least viewed at :(
As you or some people say it's a naked version of iPhone. Yeah.! But nothing's way ahead when compared to iPhone's boring design with boring bezels.!
"The screen LED can give better notification, just keep the phone screen up"
This thing looks properly sick
I'm into it already
"I like it, if it has good spec, good software and a competitive camera/price, definitely getting it."
"6:31 yeah, sound like OnePlus 😂"
This is gonna be oneplus all over again. Carl please don't let that happen.
I wonder how the battery life is impacted by all the lighting 🧐
"I want a black one with red LEDs.That would actually look really friggin nice.

that got a surprisingly big amount of likes"
​@Pabbi Sharma Close Encounters of the Third Kind When the mothership landed and the Light Strobe effect and sound would make the phone look pretty sick !🔥🔥🔥
"​@MJ Music Test Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
 The mothership strobe lights and sounds would look dope!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥"
​​@Den Lim Tron: Legacy Clu or the light cycles colors would be super sick🔥🔥🔥
@MJ Music Test dope🔥
"@Den Lim That's actually dope with those colors too! I thought of another one, light grey and neon orange!! 😄"
if only it cost $300-$350. I bet it would be like $400 base with with import taxes and markups totaling to $550.
What if the phone drops and some of the LEDs go off?
Want.
If they can make the back tinted that would be nice
This reminds me of Swatches from the eighties.
More like the gimmick phone
Malayalikalkuu Gayaraj ettan varumm🥰
It’s going to flop real hard
RGB phone here we come!
Still Love OnePlus from bd 🇧🇩
"I thought it was an iPhone 12 before reading the title ngl
Not a fan at all of clear back phones but this one looks cool and the features are nice"
who leaves his phone upside down on table? (not me)
Kinda get a R2D2 vibe from it with the ring tone
"The LED notifications are awesome! Samsung used to do it in older models on the face. They no longer do that, I very much miss it."
"This Phone is ""nothing"" different.
Looks like an iPhone 12!"
"I just love your videos.  So smooth, slick and professional.  Thanks"
this phone reminds me nokia 3220
Nothing Will Be Nothing Unless There Is A Good Processor ..Give A Hint On Processor Fast.
6:07 RIP OnePlus 💔
"No, question answered. People bought Oneplus for the Hype behind the price. Make it 350$ like the Oneplus One. Otherwise you gonna die. REAL SOON"
Looking great but how about back-up (charging)
It's very nice phone
the perfect iphone se
just looks like a cheap iPhone knockoff with wooAHAHWOAHH LED lights on the back???? NO WAY!!! TIME TO DROP MY MONEY FOR LIGHTS!!!
This phone screen on time 3 hour less 😅
"Am pretty sure that this new Nothing Phone1 we charge the phone often due to LED backside with efficient brightness,  even they fix huge battery ... I can wonder if this man shows the camera quality, this clip may be a paid promotion people should understand."
After nothing forget using anything other than clear casr
Please take my money.
The back led notification lights are cool but unnecessary. If it was something revolutionary then i would have agreed..but its just for show and nothing else.
Just Imagine this beauty in Black 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THE NOTHING PHONE LOOKS *NOTHING* DIFFERENT 😂😉
One Plus Roasted 😄😄
Copy of iphone 12
"TBH am selling my iphone 13 pro max and will buy nothing phone, am fucking tired bcz of this notch"
"If you live in the US, I'm sorry to tell you that the phone (1) will not have carrier support in North America."
"The Roast to OnePlus was phenomenal if you take in to account that the founder of Nothing is Carl Pei, cofounder of 1+ 😂🤷‍♂️"
The way you cleverly showed more than the back of the phone is amazing!
"So all this hype about the phone, now to find out that it's not even coming to the US!
I'm so bummed right now 😡"
"wish some company makes customisable phone, where a user can select modules in the website :
ram, screen size,camera ™"
🙌HYPE PHONE (1)🙌
*Need one.*
when I saw the thumbnail I thought you just photoshopped an iphone 12 lol
"Karl pie sir u did it nailed it literally thats one like former ceo of oneplus hat's off to you congratulations it gone rock the world and compete with iphone really valuable, just more more appreciation to u & ur team"
I want to support a startup but I’m worried they’ll go bust and we all lose support.
keep screne down all the time ?so basically a phone with many light patterns on the back.
This is sick!
Blown away!😳
I thought you might take a shot in dark room but you failed
they should call it Tron phone
"I am youtuber❤️✨
❤️Mera happy Adhii channel hay👇
✨✨❣️Aapke channel sae halp ho sakte hay👇❣️



❣️✨Nice video ❤️❤️"
If it is in black then it is really look badass 🤓
Nothing has happened!
Love the oneplus reference at the end lol
Phone is ugly 🤢 and the name is wack.
only white led's ????
The oneplus story at the end 😂😂😂😂
Jacked up iPhone 12
The ringtone/notifications demonstration part was really satisfying to watch for some reason
Because they’re super badass
Those features are cool but irrelevant to me.
It will all depends on the price because the CPU will be a mid tier CPU.
"I guess people are now bored with slabs. More and more people will turn to phones with uncommon design. Hopefully we go back to Nokia age, when there were thousands of designs multiplied by thousands of form factors. I myself got Z-Fold, because I was just bored with slab phone."
Unique and useless at the same time. Who's gonna keep the phone screen side down on the table?
"“Nothing” Phone is Incredible unique in Design and Promising like Apple Products. 
Bro what will happen Next for Samsung, Redmi and other Chinese Copy Cats???"
Theres a Naruto phone 😊
"Marques was referring to One Plus, btw"
"I'm avidly against apple, even before the iPhone. So this is a welcome sight.  interested for sure.
Edit:ok...I'm sold on the dbz phone."
Typical Pei. Drip feeding info…
How much will the phone cost???
immediately no
They focused on nothing feature too much lmao
Definitely! Definitely! Giving this crazy cute phone as a birthday gift to my beautiful mother ❤️
That Oneplus reference did hurt a bit ngl
So confusing ui😀 what you guys said
"this is good for the apple haters who want's apple products but don't buy it, because it's made by apple :D"
"Those are the most irritating ringtones I’ve ever heard, what were they thinking??"
"Won't be available in the US despite being covered here. Good marketing strategy though. 

Wonder how much mkb got paid for shilling something that won't make it over there"
I live in the US and happen to buy quite a few phones that are not readily available here in this market...the internet exists for many reasons.
6:08 that escalated quickly
Why isn’t there a headphone jack 😢
I thought it was an iphone case at first lol
Wtf this shit…
"*insert pointing Rick Dalton meme*
OnePlus watching the ending"
I think a case with cutout of the led and with some magnet will look hella future based phonw
"nothing is a phone for geeks, i would love to see the R2D2 or TRON versions which uses licensed sounds when those LED lights up."
6:15   sounds familiar
WOW IM IN LOVE.
Love the design 👌
Different form factor
"What phone you're using?
Nothing.
But I just saw you with a phone.
Yeah, it's nothing."
now it will distract me even from the back
underrated comment 😂😂
"I like the look, seems like a really interesting phone :D i would try it"
Best o luck 🍀🍀🍀🍀
Love it!
I'm very excited for this phone
Super bro 🇮🇳🤜🤜🤜🤜🤜
I have tried really hard but all I see is an iPhone clone. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Bro where is Fingerprint sensor side or in display
A case with cuts (lines) aligned to LED lines would look cool.
"Im incredibly hyped for this phone, it looks awesome and this led notification system is a simple but really enticing innovation. I really hope the specs for the phone match up. 

Also correct me if i'm wrong but I'm pretty sure we just saw the front of the phone for the first time in this video. Its really weird that it feels like they purposely hid the front of the phone for this long but in the end it just looks like a normal phone display."
"@Mit Mit I thought the Phone 1 would have a underscreen front camera or a pop-up camera like the oneplus 7 pro phone. A holepunch isn't bad tho, I was just talking about how it seemed like Nothing was hiding the front of the screen only to see that nothing seems different about it compared to the standards of other phones."
"then to your standard what front display is not looking like ""normal phone display"" ?? a notch + hole punch ?"
6:23 . It's OnePlus🤭
"Genuinely speaking i think tech has lost it's spark over last few years but i think this phone might be a revolutionary because it really does brings what you call ""Cool tech"" rather than just specification bricks. Really hopeful for it to succeed."
The safe play yet different showcase
Why ever in the world I would put my phone face down
This light gimmick will certainly make me buy this phone
He was talking about one plus ig
Tell about UI sir that's most important to compare it with iphone!!
Hiai eivoi ka ngaklah
blinking lights would be cool in 1998 nokia
This a cool phone can’t wait for Apple to steal these features. 😂
💯💯
Whats the price of this ?
I was wondering the same thing.
Ill throw my OnePlus and buy this.
It's a failure
Pov oneplus
That’s so dope
those ringtone sounds are *t e r r i b l e*
iPhone 12-esque back and side.
looks like an iPhone and a one plus had a baby 🤣. Didn't xiaomi do a see thru phone as well?
This is what imagine the phones from watch dogs were
Iphone is better for u anyway
"General design of phone looks nice. It reminds me of iPhone.

Functionality of the transparent back is effective."
Looks great to me though.
I like the glyph usability for notifications. But the see-thru look feels very cheap and old school 90s to me. Not into it.
How does this guy have 15mill + subs? Mindless drones.
so lights like nokia 3220
"I really loved the hardware of this phone,  just look so sexy.. it is ✊🏻"
It’s quite a step for a new feature to enter the market.
"i'd absolutely buy it because yes they are right phones do look really boring these days, even tho this may or may not be a great phone to use right now as its their first phone im very interested in what this companys future could be like"
"As much as I’d like for there to be more competition in the industry, this is just a plain stupid, gimmick of a phone.

And when these “reviewers” agree to follow an embargo, you know they’re being just another shill.

How can they not be? They’re clearly agreeing to generate hype for a product, which may turn out to be absolute shit. People really pre-order stuff based on it. So, it’s outright misleading and unethical.

What baffles me is why these top “reviewers” would agree to do sth like that, and then pretend to not be a shill. They could easily buy the latest tech that’s rolled out with all the income they generate themselves, and do an honest “full review” of it then, so that their viewers could actually make a fair well-informed decision.

Yet they continue to pull off shit like this, and continue to get away with it. Money is indeed the root of all evil."
"It's going to die out if they don't put hardwork in both software and hardware.
Indian are eager to get a hand on iPhone for either youtubing or showing off.
So nothing phone looses here."
Talk about biased preview/ review.
Good to see the front even if he told us he was only allowed to show us back.😂😂😂
This is pretty amazing🔥
6:30 i got the message tat u said ( jst like  OnePlus)
"It's cool and all but nobody is actually going to buy the phone unless it actually has high end specs, cameras and display to actually draw in the user. And right from the get go the display has pretty thick bezels and the back design won't really draw anybody in to buy it for that reason alone. I am very skeptical of this"
Watch from 6:08 and you might guess the company.
Cool 😎
But....how many people use a case again 🤦
"What make OnePlus successful at start was flagship specs, at a budget price. How well this phone will sell will really depend on starting price"
maybe one of the very first android phone i'm excited for. the design the os everything is so cool.
Like Toy phone😁
You can't build a company honest enough if it does start with shamely copying THE other one... stupid for a 1st phone
What about the battery size and battery backup?
I've never seen anything so ugly. It wouldn't be so bad if we could see the actual innards.
"I’m super curious how this hardware could be especially beneficial for people who are Deaf or hard of hearing. The flash notifications on the iPhone are pretty limited, and having this many different LED options could be great with the right software!"
You’re paid by the company 😂
Im just curious. Will the bone vibration sound works on deaf person?
A single RGB led like the old Nexus One is much useful and can be configured in several ways.
Or just look at the screen would maybe be the best option 😂
Or just look at the screen would maybe be the best option 😂
"Specifications please tell,dual stereo speakers is available or not?"
the name Nothing Phone kinda sounds unattractive though
aaaaaand it won't be sold in the US. For now.
"Now that we know this phone is not launching in North America, I feel way less excited about it. Bummer."
Question is how many people put their phone charging from backside?
"Since it has individual LEDs, Im assuming that they can light up down to the single LED as well? So instead of the entire strip lighting up, can it get configured to light a single LED in a predetermined location?"
I've Nothing to say about this.
Those have to be most epileptic ringtones ever.
"i assume the screen has some really strong material, because in the first week it would be full of scratches in you leave it with the back cover up in order to watch the lights!!!"
Hearing this video using Nothing Earphone 😃
If they are successful Apple is either going to iPod them or acquire them.
Give them few years and these guys will making super expensive phones that does not care about the customers.
consoom
If they add the Metal Gear Solid '!' LED setting. I might buy this phone lol
wow i wanna have one...hope it has good processor and display
What will be its approx.  price?
sounds familiar oneplus?
iphone will copied soon
"what's the configuration of this phone?
take love from bangladesh"
Nothing brand next huawei
Why does he say hes only allowed to show the back of the phone when there are multiple shots of the screen? 🤔
This phone is not Launching  in North America btw . Only in Europe
That was huawei with their innovative ideas 😭
Anybody else get Tron vibes?
"iPhone = Air Force 1
Nothing Phone = Bapesta"
@Alexander Peck i prolly get one if it's cheap
@Kamakazee so is the nothing phone. It was a compliment for sure.
Bapesta's are sick tho
Earlier in the video he says he can only show the back of the phone. All through the rest of the video he shows the front lol
"I want it soooo bad! I love Apple's iPhone design, but love Android too much to switch over; the Nothing phone may just be the sweet spot I've been looking for in a long time -- AAAND MUCH MORE!!"
I hope they have a slightly pimped android as OnePlus has. I miss a lot of features which my current stock android doesn't have. and I miss the dnd button instead I got a very annoying assistant button I have to switch off to be a usless button.
Waiting for launch 🔥
That was for OnePlus by the way
That ringtone sounds like a animal from Avatar
"So no 3.5mm jack, huh? The only one feature I wish they didn't pick from Essential Phone 😑"
Review its Ui and OS
Bsdk saara time bs pretty cool kr raha hai
You forgot about the Kylo Ren note 10
I condemn this kind of bullshit
Fuck yeahhhh that's so cool
Please gift me please
This phones actually sick.
This nothing phone is good for 12 year boy..
Wiggle and create scratches on the screen?
"Ah cool, a gimmick phone!"
What I can show you is the back of the phone.. Also Marquez 0:12!
Ending gotta be about OnePlus
Too bad this ain't coming to the US.
"Why does it look like a iphone x, leds also look like an apple logo"
$2000 for this
Too bad it's not going to work on US carriers
Wow what an iPhone copycat
а чем он будет отличаться от всех остальных в чехле?
"I don't know about this one. I don't think I'd buy that just for the LED notification system alone. It's cool for sure but at the end of the day, there's a far better alternatives that does the same thing better. Smartwatches. Keeping up with notifications is one of the main uses of a smartwatch. That ringtone LED pattern feature is the same. Looks useful at first glance but when you think about it, every phone released within the last decade lets you customize ringtones and vibration patterns for each caller. But do you even use that feature? No. Because there's a better alternative. Smartwatches. You don't have to remember which caller has which ringtone or in this case LED pattern when you can just look at your wrist and and see their name. These features would've been game changing a decade ago but not in 2022 where even a budget smartwatch would put this entire notification system to shame."
"That fill light has major ""Can I please not have any shadows on this check I'm trying to deposit?!"" energy."
This guy is always  a step ahead 👌🏼
most unique design for a phone ig?
That OnePlus call out in the end!
Does Nothing have stocks? I’m tryna invest
THE MOST ANDROID “IPHONE” IN THE WORLD
"its the os that matters bro, fuck all this shit. if it runs android im not using it"
The slow zoom on the “broadly appealing” dig at OnePlus was a kool easter egg
it's looks like iphone with punch hole camera 🤣😅
"Having different ringtones is unneccessary, you could just look at your phone if you can have your sound enabled. Same gors for the lighting, it is just not needed at all"
answer is no
These features could all be duplicated on an always on screen...
I like the way you slapped one plus 😂
"It is cool but, practically not so usefull..drains the battery"
The LED lights lighting up in a certain way lets you know who is calling? Well if you put your phone the screen side up you can actually SEE who is calling. What a useless feature.. but it is a cool gimmick though.
The real question is: does Nothing Phone will end up like Oneplus right now aka Overpriced average phone?
"Based on disappointing their ear phones were, I would definitely not buy a first gen phone from them."
I miss One plus 😭💔
That jab at OnePlus hurts. They are really just making generic phones now ☹️
This is cool
Like it.... Good Design & Great Built
I’ve been holding out for this phone since I bought the Nothing Ear (1)’s. Then today I found out the phone wasn’t coming to the US. Looks like I’m getting an S22 ✌️
So many LEDs will contribute to battery drain. I wonder how much SOT can we get out of it with full LEDs turned on.
Why that C dash C dash symbols tho and not full circle or something?
"Bro what is this
Why u only showing design of the phone
🤬"
This chinese guy always copy iPhone
Could you please let me know for this phone 1 cost in India
Apple my favorite they will make something better
Looks like a cheap iPhone copy from India or China
I LOVE IT!!
"Yes, it definitely sounds familiar Marques! Can understand how frustrated you are with recent 1+ launches 😉"
i waaaaaaaant this
"I won't agree that it looks like iPhone 12, because at the end all phones looks like that only. Some will have less or more cameras, a little different position, but at the end it's almost same thing."
"The Nothing Phone is NOT being released in the United States according to the news today. Yet another phone where the only way you can buy it is if it's imported, and you get no regional support of any kind if you do. I know, I have a Poco Phone."
So iPhone 12 will look like this without the apple logo.
"Man, in pictures it look crap. But looks dope in the video. Now I can also understand the reason behind those stupid ringtones."
"That thing is cool as hell. I'd want it to come with a ""ringtone editor"" app that lets you create custom LED patterns, similar to a video/audio editor where you have a timeline with separate ""tracks"" for each LED."
Looks 99% like the iPhone. what are you talking about sir?
India me release hona baki hai bhai 12th july ko 😂
"This is what Nokia did with the 3220 in 2004, but with RBG lights!"
"even more, even more will cost us 1000 dollar just like OnePlus . they all are the same."
I am hooked.
Cyberpunk role play complete 😎 for deaf people the visual alerts are awesome good idea give us more of this cyberpunk feeling tech please 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Oh they are doing the same thing that Oneplus did and you have a great phone which is hard to buy
Real tech reviewer.the other reviewers are bunch of hobos with dick in their hand instead of the phone itself.salute to you Sir....
fuck I'm buying asap
Wont be available in the USA. Marques would this have impacted you uploading this video had that been disclosed?
wonder how the battery will hold up...
It's awesome 😍😊😍
"i 'll buy, if it have like hologram like notification :)"
Looks like an iphone 12
Nothing but gimmicky.
I will definitely go for it !❤️
6:30 Yes OnePlus sounds so familiar.
That phone looks sick
"Looks like a futuristic TRON phone. I like it, but the LED's are not enough by themselves. I hope the hardware is up to 2022 standards."
"""so when Nothing is done.."" excuse me, sorry you said nothing is done, so what is done?  😂😂"
Buying
Soooo TRON LEGACY MOVIE vibe.. Kinda like it.. Just need to make it more better... Lights could be placed on the sides too.. to make it even more cooler.
what will the price?
This phone is “nothing” compared to other smartphones out there.
"So, we can't see the front of the phone? Just the back? The Glyph Interface on 2:23, was that still the Nothing phone?"
Can't wait for this phone to be tested by jerryrigeverything 😅
I wonder how does someone will make a case for this phone ! Looking forward to that 😀
"Well...I mean, they make clear cases for a lot of phones. I think someone will likely figure that out eventually. /s"
lights ok but battery backup?
"Not very ground breaking. Anyone remember the Nokia brick phone and how you could get custom made shells with lights that would light up when calls came in? This is like that only a lot more intricate. The whole thing seems so gimmicky and actually tells a lot about the consumer landscape - that aesthetics trumps practicality and function. It is like an iPhone with a clear back. Is there anything deeply different about this phone that’s worth investing in? I feel smart phones have definitely hit a plateau in their evolution. Unless smart phones finally find a radically new form, they’ll keep relying on glorified bells and whistles till then."
@TechnoRuhez  😎 lol
"back of the phone lol,"
last statements were for oneplus i guess
I think I will buy this after OnePlus abandoned me.
Sound familiar
"You can definitely tell that teenage engineering had a hand in making those ringtones, can spot some pocket operator sounds in there for sure 👾"
Are they related to Nothing? I agree they have that same sick minimalist flair
Nothing nailed 🍎
It looks aesthetic
"If Camera, Battery and OS are not optimized. Forget about it. People does not care about design or gimmick features. I sold my pixel 6 because of its OS bugs and short battery life, even though design was sthing new and Camera was simply amazing."
This looks awesome. Definitely going into my watchlist.
Hey Marques does this phone has a alert slider as we see in oneplus and apple devices?
Sounds familiar? yeah... I was actually thinking about ONE PLUS.
"If that recording led can be turn on or off through apps then it's cool but if didn't leave option to keep that led off, then it gets the attention of the monster whom I wanna try to record secretly, so that recording led can be deadly"
"Nobody is going to keep the screen face down, so all the features in the back side is off no use."
Omfg
We Indian user required Ruf and Tuf phone 📱
Well done Carl Pei.
25000 se 35000 rupay me aayega ye phone😑😑
iPhone X Samsung
"i don't get it, who will charge the phone keeping the screen downside to see the light's in back,i think some ambience on the front screen  edges would be really cool"
Build up Nothing and send it back to OPPO?
Are you involved financially with the Nothing company?
I like it
Man can't these guys create something original without ripping off another companies design?
well most people will be using case to protect their phone anyway
i liked the OnePlus reference. Cool phone but if the leds were RGB... it would be .. unbeatable.
6:32 @OnePlus
I like it
666 原来是前一加的创始人搞的东西
"Although the outlook is cool, i also hope the internal specs are cool as well, hope its a flagship device rather than a mid range specs device"
中国的公司吗？
Bezels are hugh 🤢
😲😍
What's the likelihood that it'll follow the footsteps of a certain phone brand we all used to love (lookin at you OnePlus)...?
OnePlus noices when he says sounds familiar
Jerry Rig is going to lose his shit
I'll probably wait for the 2 or 3 since I'm still chilling with the pixel 6 but ill excited to see where they go
I was thinking whole day with the 💭 thought of buying it.
That's nothing
i would buy it
"Agreeing with others that the ring LED idea is great, but has anyone imagined what a godsend this would be for anyone with hearing issues?  
Or to anyone trying to find where they left their phone? ""I hear it, it's over here _somewhere!""_  
I really hope they use some strong AI for the camera, and incorporate most of the other features that pulled market share in the past without falling into the ""wider audience"" trap Marques mentioned."
Yeah! I would love to see what a hearing impaired person would think of it. It seems like the light features could be super useful!
"ok so the back of the phone is really cool, but I never leave me phone face down when I'm not using it, and I'm sure that the majority of people don't either. So, while it's cool, I feel like only a tiny minority will ever actually use the Glyph stuff in the real world."
"FINALLY A ANDROID PHONE AN EQUAL BEZEL ALL THE WAY
IT ONLY TOOK THEM 5 YEARS"
"I actually like the look very much, I just hope they keep a non bloated Android and that the hardware works well enough and they could sell well."
@iNeed2P yeah i can count on carl to make good ui
"@Mit Mit don't forget nothing's ceo was the head of OnePlus, you can expect clean UI from from nothing os"
I would hope they actually work on streamlining the interface even further. with a name like that.
non bloated android doesn't mean that android is gonna be smooth smooth lol just look at Google ... perfect example right ?
Of course they won't bloat the OS. That takes time and money to do which small projects can't afford.
Price ?? Tell me please
1+ got at bad burn right there hahahah
4500mah + blinding LEDs = 4 hour screen on time.
Th notifications LED reminds me of the LG’s / Lollipop flip phone. Would be great if they can create more patterns for the LED.
No matter what I am gonna buy this phone.... It's exciting .
6:23 One Plus.. rip
the storm troopers will be really happy to have this.😂
"First Boring, now Nothing, what's next?!...... Disappointing?"
Nothing is basically OnePlus2.0. everything that carl pei learned from OnePlus will be applied here minus the problems and issues!
I love the led lights. It’s pretty futuristic
I just lost my Ear 1 😭
That equal front bezel look is a win for me 👀
"If I have to see the back of the phone for who is calling or the battery percentage, what it the screen for? Plus who wiggles their phone with screen facing down?"
*loved to see MKBHD pich Oneplus shit game*
It's the ecosystem 😓
What will be the price range ???
I want
"The phone is sample but futuristic as well, cant wait"
Best Phone
"so nice one can say ""I'm sure theres a clear case coming from Nothing"""
This phone OS is different from Android
"That thing is cool as hell. I'd want it to come with a ""ringtone editor"" app that lets you create custom LED patterns, similar to a video/audio editor where you have a timeline with separate ""tracks"" for each LED."
Nothing but gimmick.
"4:04 Mark my words, someone is going to get a call in the middle of airport security and end up shot"
BUT DOES IT COME IN BLACK AND RED???
"I really like the sounds of those ringtones as well, I want them for my current phone."
"The ""OnePlus"" story ; starting over again.!"
👌🏻 For fans of old-school OnePlus
"💛 I am youtuber 💛 
❤मैं यूट्यूब पर है❤
🙏Mera C K C C chandan 2 channel hai👌 मेरा C k C C chandan 2 चैनल है"
"oh wow ... tbh i expected it to be ""tacky"" but actually it's pretty appealing to me and i'm kinda interested now ..."
The ringtone feature is so cool
Please make that promised video of the s5 80 Maybach i really love that car
"Something big coming right ? 
Hmm....He Is coming 💙 Not nothing , It is "" Nothing """
Nothing company: lets add rgb to the back of the phone. it will get iphone users to switch to android.
"At 6:31 ""Sound familiar"" What is he talking about?"
this reminds me of my old nokia. you could buy completely different cases. some were clear and had leds inside.
"Damn this one looks pretty cool, I’ve had my sights set on the Tesla phone but I might get this in the meantime lol"
"The problem with all these phones, no matter how cool they are is that they don’t have IOS."
Sounds like “One plus” familiar!
Actually pretty rad.
What I want to know is what that old PowerBook is up to in the background. :)
Sounded like a Oneplus reference to me for sure....
Holy shit that's amazing hmmm im thinking 🤔 of this phone in different colour options
Having this phone not come to the US makes it worthless to a great majority of your audience.
Why don’t these guys just make a case that integrates with an app you can get for either android or iOS? Or do they?
reminds me of the One Plus from back in the day...
"As we are learning this morning, this will not be available in the US."
The iNothing
whose gonna flip their phone all the time?
Looks dope af I would buy it
Must fix to change the colours of the led then it will be fantastic!!!!!!!!!
i like it. i hope it mass produce asap
"6:22 Sounds familiar? 🥲
Me: ABSOLUTELY."
Probably nothing.
Please tell me camera experience of nothing phone & their price
"The ringtones and lights really speaks to me. I’m old enough to remember “modding” my Motorola flip phone with programs on my computer. Or adding the LEDs under my candy bar phones keypad to light up crazy colors when I get a call. I’m tethered to apple so probably wouldn’t switch but for some reason I really like the back lights, what they do and the ringtones sound refreshingly new and unique."
@Jonasthe good old days
"Ahh I get it now, so the people who wants this phone is the same people who prefer to play super Mario on a 30 year old Nintendo."
the ringtones and customization do give me a fresh vibe that I feel like reminds me of back when I'd be really into modding my phone or excited about new tech in a different way
"If it's a good phone, then that'll be my phone next year. They just have to keep making them."
Still wouldn't buy it.  It's still a Chinese phone which would have backdoor SW that sends all your private information to a Chinese server.
Interesting to see something new. It looks like a gimmick and not made for practical day to day use.
Look like they concentrate on the design.
cool concept but just wait of battery
"What OS? Android, then no."
this is literally an iphone 12
It's actually what the stormtroopers use!
Ring tone of DEATH
Just by looking the body everyone gets impressed. That's impressing. No one cares about the performance and value of the economy. Create more and more so that this Earth gets filled by debris of electronics goods that no-one can live for the next 500 years.
The „Tron Phone“ Right out of the Movie. Looks really good.
How will Nothing make an ecosystem like Apple?
"bro is there any way to block a game in pc for few days
i have exams nearby, i don't wanna get distracted
i can't afford to delete them 
i can never play it becoz they r very big and don't have that much internet"
Design 10/10. Specs ??
"beautiful and classy content ❤️ Your brother from the Arab world, nothing left for 510 andante sisters scared you ❤️ O Arabs"
"Does anyone actually lay their phone on its face like that? Since the dawn of time, I have always laid my phone on its back so the LEDs would be useless to me."
This is beautiful and super cool love it
"""what i am aloud to show you, is the back of the phone""- proceeds to show front"
What is a pirce of phone
Пыс Ныга!
"Lol the shade thrown at the end xD ""One"" more phone that'll someday abandon it's original fan base that'll become the ""Nexus"" between the three for doing the same."
"All these features are useless for anyone who keeps their phone face up. All the light patterns could’ve simply been displayed on the OLED screen.   
And even for the minority of people who likes to keep their phone face down, I don’t think these features are gonna be enough for them to buy this over an iPhone or galaxy.    

I wish them luck but they poured substantial resources on a gimmick. Again, the patterns could’ve simply been shown on the display.   
Yeah it’s technically different from other phones, but the difference is far from meaningful.   

Looks aesthetically cool though. I’ll give them that."
"I want this phone, so different…..🤔"
This phone has the same energy as the red hydrogen one
"I just wanna remind people that Nothing is a startup company. We're witnessing their first steps into a huge market with extreme competition. What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
Mixture of iPhone design and OnePlus front...with little amount of transparent innovation...
One plus in the rawest form.... This time let not yucked by BBK or load of potato chips
"The phone like what its name, its nothing."
We're reduced to buying phones for the led light show.
"Eventually, when we use back case...nothing becomes nothing😂"
Useless but I love it!
i think its a gimmick feature it takes up battery than the other smartphone because of an led at the back.
"Wish there will be a black edition with white LED, that would be awesome.. :O"
"That thing is cool as hell. I'd want it to come with a ""ringtone editor"" app that lets you create custom LED patterns, similar to a video/audio editor where you have a timeline with separate ""tracks"" for each LED."
I'm loving it
Any 🇮🇳 Indian  ... 🤍
"Oppo Reno 7 Pro. Notification LED around rear camera panel. Very cool this phone looks, Nothing. Nice name too."
I need mate black....... 🔥
The sexiest back in the industry
Love it how you kicked op in the balls
The notification features look like Nothing I've ever seen
And what about UX?
The iPhone of Android.
My first impressions 😯🤔 then I saw your ‘tweet’ about the light show and I was like I had to watch…🤗🎉🎉🎉 not bad ‘Nothing’ if they did stick to the 90’s look and flare they definitely have my vote. I remember Nokia 3300 series was one of the first phones I learned to hack. There’s this hack that gave away peoples addresses when you hit the right combination of numbers and symbols. I thought that was Kool. But the thing I loved more So was the ability to change the batteries out now I can have a sequential lighting One ☝🏿 and the notification lights was blue/red If I remembered correctly but that phone was the IPhone of it’s time (Oh Nokia!!! How time have changed) that’s where I See ‘Nothing’ is taking this 😁😍🙏🏿
What one plus a company or it was thing of the past?
Nothing phone 1: Nothing happen
Sound familiar (in the last part of the video)😂😂😂😂
"If I'm going caseless, I want plastic back there."
ഇവിടെ മലയാളികൾ ഇല്ലെ
🙂
Nothing put something in back. Now people would focus more in back side than the screen. This would divert people from phone addiction.
"At first glance, the Naruto phone looks like a Bic Lighter"
"Okay, Marques... Just so I understand correctly: This new smartphone, which you promote in your introduction with the fact that all other smartphones always have to serve a mass taste, which allegedly should not be the case with the Nothing-Phone, has on the whole the same shape as an IPhone (which you find ""actually cool"", well, I'm not such an iPhone fan, and what is ""cool"" is always in the eye of the beholder) and a few ""different"" features, which are mainly limited to beeping and flashing funny... so, to be quite honest, I don't see much that is really revolutionary new here. Same old stuff in brandnew drags. It might be possible that really useful details will be presented in the final release, but if the Nothing-Phone will then possibly be located in the upper price segment without offering real innovations apart from pure design aspects, I will certainly not become a customer. At the moment, it all looks like a big announcement with little substance. So the brand name may be appropriate..."
"Damn as a big sci fi fan, I'm considering returning my pixel 6 to get this instead lol"
"I just need to know why you capitalized ""looks"" instead of ""different""
Do YouTubers just chose random words to capitalize"
Who is here after techno ruhez and trekin tech's video
"Looks cool. OnePlus is finished,"
Remember when everything was translucent? Love the clean look they did with it.
Does it come in Matte Black😉
Not a single person says it's copy of apple in terms of design. If a small companies does it they whole youtube community would label if as copied. But they are silent here. Hypocrisy
"Thought these were a slab of plastic, for addicted ppl"
Kerala
what about gaming?
I lost my job during this pandemic And decided to start a youtube chennel to 8 other strong. Wish me well...🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
i swear i thought it was an iphone 11 wo its back
Great review Marques! Thank You!
"those ringtones and flashes remind me of the old school text displays in the Alien movies for some reason, the blinks and clicks. I love this."
kinda reminds me how OnePlus started...
Finally a video that showcases nothing
...they need to make sure pricing and distribution is right.. If they can launch it as low as possible then the aesthetic will make people buy... Chinese phone company oppo vivo huawei made affordable phones at first and they are players in the market. They to be IN the game to make money not a 1 time wonder
Meh
"It's OSM Yaar 😄🤪😁
Back light looks pretty cool"
"Thanks a lot for the info!
Really appreciate it!"
"I feel like we'll see OnePlus's story repeat itself here.
What's good about that is that the first phone could be pretty good at a reasonable price
What's bad is, well, 6:08."
We have seen similar lights dancing to ringtones/notification in old Nokia phones like Nokia 3220. That sure is a really interesting but definitely not an actually new feature. But anyways it looks pretty sick and has been long time to see such a feature.
"Rancak hp nyo 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Nio den 😄"
"Just like PC vs Mac there will be battles across the Android eco system and most of the iOS users will say “cool feature, wish i had that but it’s not enough to make me switch”"
Matte black with RGB led would have been dope.
Amazing
You are  the best 💕💕💕💕
"Literally to the 1% who's reading this, God bless you, and may your dreams come true, stay safe and have a wonderful day."
The next phone is nothing phone 1. I want to see oneplus reaction lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The real question is: are people going to buy a phone based on design or performance?
Any prediction on price?
"India , it will be mostly 35-40k"
"I am getting a hint here. Though Marques is not allowed to speak much about the phone, it was clear he is dying to tell us there is something up with the software side of things, while not being able to say so explicitly. The way he mentions ""make another average phone"" (0:39) right at the beginning of the video is a clear indicator of that. He again said that the Nothing phone looks different ""no matter what happens with the rest of the phone"" (5:12).
I don't think he is impressed overall. Lets wait for the full review."
Oh someone's calling me. Let me look at the back of my phone instead of reading the caller id.
6:32 Oneplus
6.08 That dig at One plus was on the spot.
"It's all about the ecosystem, some people won't leave their favorite platform even if you offer them a free gold plated phone from the other company."
This phone is dope 😍
I want this phone 🥺🥺🥺
"I'm sure you're the best at what  you do, BUT why would  you allow a knock off company like NOTHING to your channel? I had to do a search on them to make sure this wasn't a joke!!"
The ringtone feature is so cool
It’s like those toddler’s led boots……
"This is cool, just makes me wonder what parts of the iPhone Apple has patented lol. That ringtone thing goes crazy though!"
I don't know who would make the radio interference sound their ringtone
Nothing inovasion light in the back 😂🤟
"I think the more mature smartphone, now it becomes at nokia age where you sell uniqueness because internally it is same, just faster processor etc. 🤣"
6:31 what's familiar?
"Look sick but since all the innovation is on the back of the phone, I think Nothing should have just made this a premium phone case for flagships with an app to control it."
so Karl pei flex this phone saying it's different from all the others phone and it's only for the leds?  wow nice flop
I don't like it.
It’s literally and iPhone with a different back colour
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life and suffered the wrath of God in the cross to save you from eternal hell. Stop sinning. Clean your life. *The end is near.*
"I usually put a case on my phone but even if I used a transparent case or no case at all, I never put my phone face down."
sounds familiar 😂😅
This phone look like a supermarket led bulb.
"MKBHD:  ""I can only show you the back...""

MKBHD:  _proceeds to show the front_"
He meant about the processor and stuff
We all hope that we atleast get flagship level experience because this is how all phone was started specially one plus. Hope Carl pei will remain in this company. Hope he'll not flew away which I think it will going to happen
That OnePlus reference at the end though
Price
It might be looking like an iphone but man that design and lights on the back are no match. That's so unique. At least someone is thinking creative
"If nothing is successful in creating or building its ecosystem then no one can defeat Carl pie. 🖤 Actually in this time we need competitors who can actually beat iphone.

Nothing should also work on its brand new local software like android or ios...

First they will sell at low prices then after  high prices.

But Carl pie should stick to medium budget phones offering best services.

He will rule the smartphone world in future."
"After seeing the reel, was looking forward to the video"
That oneplus reference in the end was dope🤣
Will it come with alert slider or not?
"This is nothing new. We did this 20 yrs ago with the nextels. Changed out the phone's body with a clear body and when anyone called or chirped, it lit the phone up with all types of lights and pattens."
Nothing works against Apple.
amazing
Love how innovative this is
"Great to finally see a big hardware difference with this device. Great concept, can’t wait to see the full review. I’m now positive we still haven’t reached the peak of smartphones just yet😅"
No comments
This is awesome not gonna lie but I barely have my phone facing down or looking at the back of it. Maybe they move it to the sides later. Overall it is a good step...
so glad that MKBHD called out the notification LED; I used that so much on older phones
"Highlight of the video… apart from phone:
1 Mocking ONE handset company strategy 😉
2 That bulky laptop in BG.
Phone looks promising tho."
Super diffrent phone!
"This isn't a phone, it's a marketing campaign. Stop giving these jokes a platform for no reason."
4:52 literally exactly what I was thinking
Looks way too much like an old iphone
"No 3.5mm jack, lost opportunity to bring some value"
The thermals for gaming on this phone is probably gonna be horrible. Not for gamers. More of a casual to enthusiastic users.
So wonderful 💖 ❤
"How important are the looks of the back of a phone anyway? Most people (me included) put their phones into a bumper case anyway. And those hide the back, if they're not transparent. 

This is a nice feature for a small group of power users, but the mainstram won't be interested. Thus, this phone won't sell well and endanger the exitance of Nothing as a company. I really don't see the point."
Apple should just light up the logo on the vack. Would be so sick
"I get millennials have money to buy tech therefore companies always focus on what they want (boring minimalism) but as someone younger, that stuff is getting old. This is for the new generation who cba with copy paste phones anymore"
You killed it at 6:08. I really liked the subtle sarcasm.
Commenting for YouTube algorithms
And you said ios is better than android 🤣
"A 70% of the video talking about LED? That's not interesting to me

Edit : a full video about LED is definitely not helpful to me"
"For me, I’m almost converted. Price point will be a huge one for me. Will it sync with Apple products?"
"hate to spoil the party.. how's this going to work with a case? let's face it, we'll use protective cases.. unless we're just super brave.. hmm."
The fan base abandoning brand he was sarcastically referring to - OnePlus?
"Completely agree! Likely why CP left OP. 
_-_-_
Hey, @mkbhd. Your comments at the end of the video do remind me under others of OP, which is why I moved away from their phones after owning a OPO, OP3T, and OP5."
Was that a dig at oneplus at the end? 😂
I hope Nothing doesn't end up leaving its fans with nothing in the future when they get recognized like some other company we know.
The punch hole ruined it for me. I have a OnePlus 7t pro and no way in hell I'll go back to a screen with a hole in it. 2022 was supposed to be the year punch holes disappeared 🙄🙄
When you have to oversell a feature with a 6 min video for all the useless things then really is a NOTHING to wait for product
The end of OnePlus era
I am from India and I am glad to appreciate Nothing Phone 1
"First impression is good, and if the back notification LED comes with RGB colours that might be dope"
"Perfect time for it's debut! Since OnePlus (my fav) is officially abandoned its roots I'm still searching for a good, ""underground"" substitute that will not be next OPPO sub-brand. Your predictions about going more and more vague in the future might be right, but for now I'm going for it (when it comes to EU) simply because there's no other options for people that like to have unique, startup gadgets that works and looks triple A. Peace ✌️"
"Motorola, Nokia, Google"
@Ankit Raj trash chinese market phone which has 0 potential of being a good phone brand
Is IQOO around in your area. It's a VIVO sub brand with average ui but everything else is soo good at a reasonable price.
Good to see some new things in a smartphone rather than reusing the same thing again and again with little to no changes. Can't wait to see full features of nothing
"waiting for the camera level...  compare to iphone....


OnePlus user's 🥳😍. come here"
"I am losing my ""confidence""mai itni mehnat karta hu par lekin koi chote youtuber ko support nahi karta sab star ko karta h bas🥺😭😭😭😭😭"
Loved how he showed us the front after specifically saying that he can only show us the back😂
Looks like an iPhone 12
Jo mere comment pad raha he usski mata pita ki Umar bhagban badhade
"Definitely out of the box thinking, but  looks like a toy phone for me. 😛"
Truth is ..these phone won’t sell out
That looks great but I'd want to know how it performs day to day before buying one
Is it just me or the nothing Phone looks a bit thick ?
imagine adjusting all of your phone contacts to ring differently and then still get no calls just like before
"@Christian George mad respect for you too bro, I just have no life <3"
"@Dubsido wowee you gottem good. attempting to call someone out for commenting on YouTube by commenting on YouTube when the original comment was also a comment on YouTube. makes sense. 

also you keep replying to people in this thread lmao"
Just no scoped half the video bruh
Thats deep. Making me reflect on my life now 😂
💔😂
It's just like Nothing!
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Mkbhd: Sounds familiar?
Oneplus: 😬"
In 52465: the nothing earth
"ngl it looks like the ghost character from antman and the wasp get it ghost, nothing"
"I want to get this phone. No joke, the look is my type."
😉
Everyone who is gonna complain about copying of iphone...just remember their price difference
sounds familiar?: yep it does
5:38 Deep emotions start from here.
no its the same
What is the operating system on this ?
those few lines he said before saying sounds familiar got me 🌚😮‍💨😂😂
"I love the ergonomics of an iphone, but im more drawn to the android world! With an appealing price theyll certainly have my money!"
"Hey what phone you use?
Nothing"
Well here we go again with the birth of a new OnePlus phone. That's what I see so far I don't know if I'm interested The headphones yes the phone not really..
"Ooh, burn OnePlus"
1+ plus of early stage
This will definitely fail.
"""Sounds familiar?"" asks MKBHD. 
Yeah, OnePlus is hit with nail in the coffin.! 🤣🤣"
Soooo in a few years they will become what OnePlus is today haha
The next competitors of Apple kinda excited
Not a big deal
finally some innovation
How is Marques controlling ringtone from other phone. This I think is the part of ecosystem they  are talking about.
Very nice so cool☺️🙏👌
Is it from Star Wars? 😂
"On that last comment: HMMMM couldn't be OnePlus, couuuuld it?"
That led ringtone sync is cool....It would have been better with more colors but of course their a new brand and it would be interesting to see what they can come up with.
What a Clone lol
"Back of an iPhone X, if they’re lucky it may run like an iPhone X and front of an android device…"
"These are the worst ringtones I've ever heard in my entire life, they could be used as torture..."
Maybe is the first phone from Motorola razr v3 that I love it
"Very cool phone - some nice features - one that really resonates with me is the unique ringtone/light-pattern signature - that is definitely cool.  I also like the look of the phone and like the fact that it is not a ""bigger-is-better"" device - their best efforts have been packed into a single reasonably sized package... I would love to give one a spin. 🙂"
"This company is going to fail, coming from the future 2030"
4:03 Sound like a gunshot from a far distance
a really unique move would have been supporting right to repair by making the back removable but nah let's do stupid lights and lots of marketing.
"Soooooo actually, the phone with the biggest (albeit ever so slightly stylized) Apple logo on the back, which even lights up, is not an iPhone?"
That thing looks extremely cool

i just want old oneplus back man.
Just an overhyped piece of $hit
"Adding led's at the phone to make it unique

Next adding a gas stove"
The phone looks cool and I like the LED's on the back. But still I think the Nothing logo looks like a modernized Apple logo 🤣
Could anybody help me find the name of the  intro track ?
The whole light system on the back looks cool but pointless I mean why do we need rear notification lights? Bring back front notification lights that's what we care about
A free ring light on the back of my phone would be pretty neat ngl
Just thinking about the business strategy of *CHINE$E BRAND$*
"It has the back and sides of an iPhone 12/13 and the front of an oneplus, looks ugly imo"
"Auch, shots at 1+"
Here goes nothing 🥰
"A$3,841 nice!"
Shut up Take my money. Already.
Nothing is good
U said an iPhone 12 would look like this but you showered a 13 pro max 🤣🤣🤣 that shit do look like and iPhone and my first thought was wtf they made a clear iPhone smh. How much they paying u?
R2D2 bot in our hands!!
Great innovation for disabled people
"If I wouldnt have bought an iPhone 11 a few months ago, I would definitely buy it"
The Nothing Phone : Transparented-iphone 12 with USB C port and more flexible UI.
I would buy this phone just so that when someone asks me “What are you using these days?” I be like “Nothing bro”😂
That screen is dope looking man totally symmetrical design that we want to all other phone's
Wish it comes with an in-built crypto wallet :)
КАК ЖЕ ОН АХУЕНЕН
6:25-6:35- no ONE PLUS(BBK ELECTRONICS) WERE HARMED LMAO
Bro oneplus 🤯
6:00 OnePlus 🤡
Still dropping knowledge to this days. Kudos dude 👌
"You have not talked about the soc, ram, or screen and camera. Curtis of embargos. I guess in a next video we know how it performs."
That subtle dig at OnePlus
"""Will it be a success?"" Depends on a combination of things, including pricing and battery life. With so many LEDs that might just be not so great..."
Well spoken on your last part (timemark from 6:28) of the video.
I can see Apple making the Apple logo light up and doing things like this on iPhone
looks like a toy. no thanks
Simply hi-tech
these ringtones sound like they're right from watch dogs
"No thanks
The only feature that would make me switch smartphones is swipe gestures

A modifier button that you can press and hold on the side or back of the phone and then configure swipe gestures to do any task you want while that button is held"
"Hi, Marques. I have a solution for the iphone notch. Instead of putting a camera at the front, why dont they put a smaller screen at the back?"
i love how that back looks. star wars lesss gooooooooooooooo!
"I hope Nothing priorities Software updates and better and optimized UI experience instead of launching a new phone every couple of months later...
...
...
Sound familiar?"
This should have been called the star wars phone
"would love to buy this, can i boot arch linux on it?"
yea cool..  DOA
"The bezels are too thick for a modern phone, it just looks ugly and outdated to me...."
Just Awesome 😲
*slaps non transparent case on it*
"That thing is cool as hell. I'd want it to come with a ""ringtone editor"" app that lets you create custom LED patterns, similar to a video/audio editor where you have a timeline with separate ""tracks"" for each LED."
"Hopefully Nothing OS will be open for developers to build apps that enable these features, if it doesn't come built in"
while iphone still the same phone and boring design
I swear I thought it was an iPhone.
"This thing is dumb, you can just put a case on iphone with that ""feature"" if you need to."
My question is is this a new innovation?
Who will put their phones with the screen on any surface lying there???? People are obsessed with having a perfect scratch - less phones... putting LEDs on the back is totally stupid and unnecessary!!!! Was it on the front or side then yes...but this...this is a no go ....
"That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. this is what the 👽 aliens are here for."
Smartphone cases disliked this video.
Looks like the govt can track us better...  Thanks but no thanks....  Who cares what it looks like its a cell
Id buy it better then iphones
"i like the minimalistic tech design route they went with, defitenitely fresh"
hey samsung look at your video🗿
"One of the reasons I picked up the Sony Xperia SP was for its illuminating strip that was featured at the bottom of the phone and the ability to customize it to specific notifications(missed calls -> red, whatsapp msgs -> green, text -> yellow). I really loved it! After several years I am now looking to switch and this could be my next choice. I am just eagerly waiting for its specifications to be revealed."
"Unique, yes. Something i want, absolutely not. Phone is always on silent, no vibration, no wake up screen. Use my watch to filter out what is important."
"I just wanna remind people that Nothing is a startup company. We're witnessing their first steps into a huge market with extreme competition. What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
"It actually reminds me more of an IPhone 4, just bigger, more bold and and with the dual camera setup."
I always loved companies that are not afraid to be different!!
"hope for black color variant, reminds me of tron legacy with the back"
Looks like a Toy iPhone with Chinese LED Lights
"Feels like a very elaborate gimmick. But if they added rgb, they might find themselves with a new customer base"
0/10
"This is cool and all except for the fact that your phone's screen will take scratches here and there, while I believe this to not be a major issue considering the glass is resistant to damage I would still never put my phone screen down, Also the back Led system is kinda useless, the screen can turn on, tell you the battery percentage, show messages and display other contact information, Though this looks cool it offers no real effective use, it is trying to solve a problem which doesn't exist, I like that they are trying to think out of the box but the screen on your phone will always be able to display much more data (cause its a screen..duh) plus isnt reading (dad) as the contact on your screen not much easier than having to decipher a string of flashing lights like its morse code just to find out who is calling you.  with proper UI the screen could provide this data in a much cooler, aesthetically pleasing manner.
I have nothing against ""nothing"" (hehe) i just want to give my opinion on the matter, Though i find the device cool from the 'oOOh its has lights"" perspective it still doesn't appeal to me in the functionality department, also TBH its kinda ugly from the back, looks like someone dropped the phone and the backglass peeled off (i realize this is due to the fact that its transparent)."
That looks like an iPhone. Even the arrangement of the LEDs resemble an Apple logo.
That last minute Oneplus reference. Ouch haha
"Imagine if a robber pulls out a gun and says ""what phone do you have?"" Then you say ""nothing"", he  pulls his trigger then shoot you 🤣🤣"

One plus strategy
It looks more like from the StarWars Era... great info thanks a ton 😊
"I just wanna remind people that Nothing is a startup company. We're witnessing their first steps into a huge market with extreme competition. What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
0:15 they will so much so will get sued soon
inothing
I like it but also get a Virgil “off white “ feel with the design some what .
"I thought you have two phones, but I looked carefully and saw only one phone  You have edited the video of the other side 😂"
I don't think the lights are that useful. Usually my phone id in my pocket when I get notifications or in my hand so the lights on the back are probably not very helpful.
Very cyberpunky
Ifag go hide in the cave... This is NOTHING era
lol they said Ć
"The lights are cool but I feel like they are scattered all over and dont really compliment the clean white theme they have going on,  It kinda looks like the back of the phone is broken and only a few led's are working.






I have nothing against ""nothing'' (hehe) all im stating out is my opinion of the device, I really like it in other aspects."
"A bold bold design with a great great execution, the smartphone world needed this"
"My friend - ""hey which phone you are currently using"" 
Me - ""nothing"""
Brooi want full review
I would use nothing phone if they sell in Indonesia
This phone looks like from a cyberpunk movie.
👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
"прозрачная крышка есть, негр по повестке есть, надо брать."
You said you could only show the back of the phone but @2:25 you show us the front of the phone…?
Nothing interesting.🙄
Я хочу это телефон!
"This little guy just screams cyberpunk 2077 yo !! , Bloody thing straight up reminded me of a couple of concept arts that I saw of phones from ""blade runner"" , especially with that brill and snazzy ringtone light feature !!!"
Looks like an iPhone 12 white with a cracked glass on the back instead. As he said no particular reason to buy something like this . I'd rather just buy an iPhone or OnePlus lol . Moreover lol the LEDs in the back make it kinda look like the Apple logo tho'. All this phone has is LEDs and an ugly look  tbh
It’s a bit meh
"I like it LOL.
I am not a big fan of smart phones although I am a tech-geek in audio LOL.
I got my first mobil phone, the Motorola 8700 International back in 1994 when it came out.
I still remember getting cross-eyed after 15 minutes of use LOL.
Phones have come a long way since then.
It would be interesting to see what it cost when it hits the market.
Thanks for sharing!"
"i can't get over it, it's an iphone with a punch hole camera and with android... 
so PERFECT !!!"
Sounds familiar ? ONE PLUS 🤣🤣
this phone looks like an in-game device you'd find in a Kojima video game
i'm definitely going to get this phone !
6:31 one plus?
Dayum that's the new sexy ! 💀
"I guess people are gonna buy it, since One Plus is now going down in the list of favourites of  people, as it used to be."
thats so not new wtf... red magic 3s had a notification led bar ....
center hole punch camera would be better
So we need to place the phone on its screen everytime to enjoy the big part of its existence
"@Marques Brownlee
Can you sell me one of your old laptops for $50. 🤗"
"First of all, do people actually charged their phone by putting the screen facing down? I usually don’t. I don’t know is it really necessary for the back led"
sounds like oneplus
"omg this phone is so amazing ! 
these light feautures and the fact that's an iphone deisgn with only a punch hole camera... BEST design ever !!!"
The frame and the cameras look a LOT like the iPhone 12. Thanks for the video I’m looking forward to the full review.
"Personally speaking, I would prefer to put my phone facing with its screen facing upwards so all the notifications that I want to be reached can be seen clearly and promptly. Such LED bands are nothing than a useless and annoying add-on. 

The Nothing ear(1) is pretty cool cause you can get a pair of earbuds that has good ANC, sound quality, tiny little latency, and even volume control on the buds. These are the real things that make ear(1) stand out. The transparent part is more of a design signature. 

But for the phone(1), according to what we can see now,  it is more like a narcissistic design from the company that intentionally tries to make a difference but there product managers are out of real idea"
"My phone is almost always facedown so something like this is interesting to me. Although I will say that at the moment it's not made for the general consumers, especially with price point this is more for people who like experimental tech."
"If you want something different, go Sony!"
The one thing that brakes a phone deal for me is any type of notch for the front camera. It's a pain in the a** finding one without. Can only think of two brands without and that is Sony and Xaomi (Xaomi mi mix series that is) think Samsung have phones to but i don't like to spend stupid money on a phone you only use for 2-3 years. Any other no notchers out there?
Fingerprint scanner?
This should be SOMEthing! I'd love RGB lights but this is a good start!
"Simple put, iPhone at back and Pixel in front.
Carl really meant it when he said industry needs innovation.
Look guys real innovation.

Sounds familiar like oneplus 🤧🥱
"OMG yes we get to see the front !
and it's BEAUTIFUL !!!"
Finally some cool innovation in a smartphone. Looking forward to it
I love the phone could be my first smartphone
06:33 Sound familiar =  1+
Sweet stab at OnePlus in the end 😅
It does sound familiar...
Ok so we're you talking about one plus when you were saying losing the original fan base ??
"Nice comment on one plus
What a useless feature, do they want to keep looking at the back and remember all the weird patterns of lights? Probably meant for only geeks"
"My old phone was samsung j2pro,(2016)"
LED lights are awesome
A transparent colored cases would work the case would change the colors to the case color
I would want all usa phones to adopt the iphone design as american phone and build around it. Would be cool
Wouldn’t the leds consumes battery?
"""Gimmick"" phone of the year award goes to....."
20hours  = 31Lakhs 🤔
I'd love to have one but I value my wallet over the exclusivity
"Always on display - Am i a joke to you?
Mark my word, nothing phone will become nothing."
Nothing like an iPhone!
Such a cool phone.
That reference to oneplus 😂👌
Can someone mention the outro tune/track name?
This toy is an iPhone alternative. Lol 😂
"It's quite interesting, though I know nothing much about this phone. Pardon the pun."
I like it.
Gives me some the 80's blade runner cyberpunk vibe.
"This exaclty looks like iPhone, isn't it?"
"Hey Marques, that last hit was on OnePlus, right?"
shooting game fire and flash
"you made a video to show me the back of the phone, woooow!"
"- So, what did Marques reviewed in this video?
- Nothing."
"I like the name of it, Nothing, people need to understand that phone's are nothing. I need the Nothing phone"
It really looks quite impressive next to a regular phone. The look takes me to the Tron:Legacy 2010 film •
Didn't you say you were not allowed to show the front of the phone but did at 2:24 - 2:31? 😄
Dude i imagine deaf people are going to be loving those notifications
Star Wars vintage phone
"I want it in iphone 12
Mini sizee plsssss"
"Tip from someone who has worked in tech for 9+ years, always buy the second generation."
"പണ്ട് കാലത്ത് ""ചൈന ഫോൺ"" എന്ന് പറയുന്ന ഐറ്റം പോലെ ഉണ്ട്😆😆😆. Notifications വരുമ്പോൾ LED ലൈറ്റ് മിന്നി തെളിയുമത്ര🤣🤣🤣"
Apple killer or not i don't know but OnePlus killed 👌
DOPE
Wow.... I like it!
Finally New design come in Market after iphone 11 🤷
"BRO this phone  back looks so futuristic i fell in love the moment the lights turned on-
i wanna buy it when it gets stable, personally i beleave in this company"
"If I ever choose Android, as a secondary phone I go for this one."
buy buy buy buy
I want it
"Looks pretty weird)
Let's see what happens in the long term"
nothing to see here
How many people actually keep their phones screen down?
@stealthmaestro then it's a pretty clever strategy
Alot of us do
"What's the screen size on this, does it fit in a single hand?"
"@C Liu that's disappointing, I was hoping it could be around 6.1 inches then I guess no need to wait"
It is apparently 6.55 inches screenwise
'sound familiar?' 😪oneplus
"LED lights synchronized to the ringtone was something that Nokia did with the Nokia 3220. Not sure if they were the first though. 
But I remember as a kid, it was jaw dropping to see colored lights strobing and blinking along with the ring tone. It was dope."
Bawasir bana diye🤣
I love how he mentioned OnePlus without even mentioning it
How??
"Flashing LEDs on the back sure are nice but gimmicky at best, Nothing literally has Nothing else to convince people to switch until they have a real killer feature, which they clearly does not have because they're running Android, and because it's Android, if they have something useful, expect the others to have it as well, the last time the smartphone world came close to being different were the failed Ubuntu smartphone, and Microsoft's failed attempts at Windows Phone."
feels like oneplus hahaha
Why am I getting the second version of oneplus vibes??
"Smartphones nowadays lack so much innovation, that we're getting exited over some flashy gimmick on the backside"
Is nothing phone 1 is better option then op 10R !?
"6:08 Sounds familiar??

Yeah it does. ONEPLUS, from flagship killer to pocket killer. Name another one? Pixel phones. 

Name another on a different category? Poco... It was once a flagship killer with the flagship SoC. Now it's either cheap trash or expensive trash.

Basically every company does that or eventually will do. Sooner or letter. Don't be loyal to brands, just like the product and what they got to offer. First they will show you something shiny to attract and the next is to make the brand a money pumping machine."
Shut up and take my money !!!!
Really cool... kinda makes me wish i had a secondary Android phone
"if this is in black color, then it is fucking sick"
ringtone kinda reminds me of Trium phones
Can I have it
annoying lights .. no thanks
Looks too much like the iPhone.
I don’t give dam much about looks. How it works that matters
"It's a cool feature, but frankly it's totally useless. I LOVE the look on the back of my phone, but if I scratch it, the phone is doomed and warranty will be void. I need a phone without a back at all. Just some gold contacts and an API. When will the case itself be a feature? Remember the rugged Sony phone?"
"Still have my Oneplus One. Cyanogenmod. Though no updates for quite a while, still good for browsing and other not so complex stuff"
"Such a ""WOW, WOW"" notification sound  and ringtone. Can we download it from somewhere?"
I can say the speakers are going to be great
"One Plus came at a time when phones had huge scope for improvement, and they rode that wave brilliantly by being able to cram top notch components at low price. Right now, good phones are a commodity, regardless of the price, and an enthusiasts’ market doesn’t exist anymore. That’s why in order to stand out the only thing you can do is put some fancy LEDs in the chassis to solve a problem that doesn’t exist (I’ll keep the screen up if I’m bothered to know who’s calling). In my opinion, this shows how dumb is to put money in the smartphone market as a startup in 2022."
oh the One Plus burn...
Liked how you mocked carl's first venture OnePlus 😂
cool phone !
You know what's even cooler than led lights? An SD slot and headphone jack omg that would be revolutionary !
"Disappointed that the phone doesn't have those, even though they're ""trying to be different""."
When do they make phone with 2 sides screens
I feel like now apple is going to introduce a built in LED background that is similar to the front screen but diffused like the LED bars on this phone. Imagine if the iPhone looked the exact same but you could program the back to be like a 240p led background that was as dynamic as the front. Wouldn’t be too hard to implement I imagine
"hoping to see a black ver, but i deff would love this side by side with my iphone"
Apple ~Finally one worthy opponent 😂
6:32 ONE PLUS hold my beer
didn't know you got all those custom edition phones tho you don't make videos on them. btw ima buy the nothing phone anyway
"I hope its worth the hype
And i hope they dont install bloatware like Chinese manufacturers!"
I would definitely buy this phone if its affordable no iPhone prices
I actually dig the look.....a couple questions tho....would the clear back start to turn pale after a while??what price range does it release at??no sneak peak at the specs or software?? The limitations on how much they can show in the video just boils it down to its looks which is cool but not convincing enough make any good opinions about it
"My first impression was that it looked like a hard drive. The LEDs are cool, but more gimmicky than useful. I don't remember the last time I used a phone with flashing LEDs in the back (or front for that matter), and I've never missed it. Heck, I hardly pick up calls from unknown numbers anymore because of all the spambots 😅."
"I, and many others I know got Samsungs for exactly that reason. We use aodNotify so that we can distinguish app notifications."
"i will keep my 6t till this phone is available to purchase , i love it !"
I loved the oneplus reference in the end
"Good morning, my friend. Just one question. What is the secret of the name? Nothing. Thank you"
do you now work at google ?
he left out specs
"Looks great, also wow, inovation!! it's a been a while..."
"The marketing ploy to get an insane profit margin by auctioning of the first hundred phones is wrong and should be illegal. I can’t believe Marquez supports a company that’s sole purpose is to manipulate the consumer into thinking that an average, readily available, and borderline outdated technology is somehow a rarity and exclusive only to the nothing brand. It’s no different from the psychology behind loot boxes and other micro transactions in the gaming industry. It’s shady business, and should be criminal, it really shows what MB is all about with him selling these wolf tickets for clicks."
New cartegory created. HYPE PHONES
New iphone copier LUL
well i am excited for this phone and I'll definitely give it a try when it comes out
If you could pick any color for the LEDs then for sure I would get this
3 million views in under than 24h? King 👑
"Make it black, and take ma money"
I like this phone but I think it would be awesome in black
Now I can get down with this!
They should just put a small screen on the back near the cameras for notifications and selfies with the better cameras
This is so sick!
"really cool looking back, reminds me of gundam for some reason... but with a price of close to A$4K, yeah, sorry, a pass for me despite how much I love the look of it"
Price sir
I guess no cover then...
I hate Samsung so much now. I used to be a Samsung fanboy n now I hate them so much
The Oneplus Joke lol
I would've gone for this but according to rumors they are going for 7 gen 1 which is mid range chip but it's they also release a 8+gen1 model that'll be an eye candy
Protruding camera is a no no for me.
I HECKIN' LUV THIS !!!
one plus! it sounds familiar
Nothing will fail like OnePlus?
This is super nerdy looking. Hope the market for teenage to early 20s boys is big enough for them.
"""sounds familiar?"" : Oh yeah definitely !"
Sounds familiar… epic … Pete Lau are u listening!
Nothing is impossible ✨️
awsome smartphone

03:20 Wiggle Wiggle - Jason Derulo  :D
"In some supermarkets you can find very cheap bluetooth speakers that have led lights flashing different colours more or less to the music. Like a permanent Christmas decoration that you can take everywhere you want. That's what nothing phone's led lights on the back remind me of. To me, it looks far from cool, rather cheap and pointless. But let's wait for final product."
"Losing the initial fan base for broad range of customers . 
When he said sounds familiar , he meant OnePlus ! 🥲"
"Tbh I felt those ringtones were terrible, only thing I liked is charging animation. Currently we have phones with Amoled display which can show even complex information than these simple LED. Let's hope that it's not a phone with just gimmicky lights.."
"All these phones can be different,  glass back, plastic back, see through back, collaborations, but end of the day 99% of people cover the back with a case so I don't think it really makes a difference"
So it looks like a iPhone and the lights on the back make an Apple logo? What a joke 😂
Nothing looks different to me…😐
"they are not gonna make millions of phones like other big companies, so for the limited amount as a small company that they make, it is unique enough for them to be successful."
which camera using wide angle
"@MarquesBrownlee ""I can only show you the back of the phone""

Half way through the video shows the front of the phone while demoing the LED pattern  🤣"
@Heavy0331 2:24
he's using an iPhone to configure the patterns. you can clearly see with the bar at the bottom it's an iPhone
Looks like an iPhone.... lol
You literally only talked about the ringtones/notifications feature and how it looks.
"i mean, what else can he talk about when the only thing you're allowed to show about the phone is the back --- the main gimmick of the phone?"
"Based only on what is shown in this video, I would call this the ""Nothing Useful Phone""."
"""My phone won't jiggle jiggle it glows"""
"My only question is: in the real world, why would I look at the back of my phone to see who is calling me when I could just look at the front of my screen to see their name?"
That’s dope
Last we all end up wearing case
Felt like Marques is hinting about One Plus at the end of the video.
It's just an iPhone
6:27 sounds like OnePlus
Lame.
"That OnePlus reference at the end, LOL."
any one know Approx price ?
its an iphone but worse
This mobile feel me Electric shop..
Hallo Nokia 3220! 😁
Does the clear plastic turn yellow over time?
The kiddies will love it. It would drive me crazy.
3:21 a little too much confidence in the warp stabilizer being able to cope with the depth of field there.
Nothing 1 looks amazing what about gaming
Mi 11 ultra has the ultimate back of the phone notification indicator
Now that's some innovation in a Phone....at last...
is this a joke/phone back mod for an iPhone? or is this an actual phone?
Idk I think it’s kinda sketchy that you can’t show it turned on I am getting flashbacks to the Microsoft fold 🤷‍♀️
"A non iPhone looking like an iPhone, omg, count me in, m up for this phone all day, if they actually put decent specs in that elegant piece, damn sure everyones gonna follow"
I actually like that it looks like an iPhone 12 but with LEDs on the back.  What I really want to know is what the software is like because the software makes the phone.
Missing the LED notifications from Samsung 😥
If only it was an iPhone 12 and jailbroken
Interesting idea too bad my phone is basically in my pocket all day and those lights would be useless.
Nice video 😌
"""""I Respect every one who were involved in this, seriously the best piece that I've ever seen on YouTube, hats off to well all  ! Love your videos  😉😉😉👈👈👈"
Different and unique concept
The ending was the best though 😂
"Who wants a phone you have to use backwards for the selling point? Sorry, this will either sell like hotcakes, because it's do weird, or not at all"
The parody phone
Why does MB sound kind of fishy & biased and all appreciating here?
Love the idé !!
"I feel that real innovation can happen in OS. Still, it's almost impossible for anyone to even dream of creating a new OS when ios and android have a duopoly, few LEDs are cool but novelty ends there for any new phone idea. one can only play with visual elements."
"I read that they're running “Their own version of Android” on a different site, which is the biggest pass ever. All Android users have ever wanted since the past 10 years is a proper phone running stock Android. So we're basically going to get another buggy Android with sketchy update patterns."
"The only thing I like here is the charging light, otherwise the rest seems a bit much"
"They made the back of the phone useful, and that surprisingly piques my interest. I hope they get the basics right... battery life, software updates, the rest of the hardware."
They should provide the same quality phone case and use the material which they did with ear 1's case .  It would be dope if they come out with their own case . We'll buy it cause back panel is something worth to show to the world
"A case might beat the whole purpose...I wouldn't cover this dope AF back with anything..at max, I will slap a Gadgetshieldz transparent skin and keep it minimum..that's it..."
"My phone is always facing up when it's on a desk so I can use it if I need to. I like the idea of bringing the notification LED back but having them on the back would be so useless for me.
Would really limit case choice too."
@Pixels zenfone 8 and PH-1 did this the corect way.
"I mean there are quite a number of phones that still have notification LEDs, so they're not exactly dead, at least not yet."
"Exactly, your screen can already tell you this information with much less complexity"
I never put my screen face down. That feature is nothing to me
"people actually putt their phones facing down? smart notifications light would be on the sides of your phone, not making you hide your screen to see an led"
Release the full review. The company doesn't care.
i am buying nothing
"I’ve come to realize Apple is not a fan of lights (unfortunately). Only being used on products where absolutely necessary and as small as possible. I’ve been saying the iPhone needs some sort of indicator light since iPhone 3G, and missed it when I switched from my blackberry. Anyone remember the days of switching the backplate of the iPhone to make the Apple logo glow?"
SD Gen 7 ?
Are they still working with Teenage Engineering? Love the design. Hope the actual phone isn't garbage.
"Well, I’m buying it just because it’s a cool toy."
looks like a punk version of the iPhone X
6:07 I knew where it was going
Sounds like shots fired at OnePlus
"The lights remind me of the nokia 3220, awesome phone for the time. It'd be great if the LED's were RGB"
Y does the non thing phone have a MagSafe in the bck
"Well that's the back. What remains is the front. By the time users have memorised their visual and audible combinations for each notification, it would be about time to get the next Nothing, which will ultimately be different. Bit of an exaggeration but has to be said."
Next…nothing Watch 😏😎
6:28 OnePlus dis LOL😂😂😂💀🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't like Android phones iphone king whole Android phones in the world
I don't like Android phones iphone king whole Android phones in the world
Is there any price indication yet?
I am one that doesn't care what color the phone is... cased.
Hello MKBHD how are you?
I have OnePlus. I will buy this phone .
"5:10 a transparent iPhone 12 would look like this if you make a custom housing that removes the metal on the back, if you remove the glass you won’t see what dbrand represents. they look very good but they’re kinda misleading"
I am waiting
i am really excited
Love from india
I hope it's going to be a flagship killer.
Nokia 3220
If this is anything like the nothing ear buds then no thankyou. Far too many bugs for me
Nothing make even more better phones every time until bbk groups purchase the company
Y’all just sit here and wish u had just one of those cool electronics he has 😭
This Is Insane ❤️❤️
Why no headphone jack? Thanks for nothing
"Looks like, an iPhone"
Waste of electricity
"Flat display on Android flagship with reliable camera, great battery and fast and optimized OS. That is what I am expecting from this device."
Maybe the phone cover of nothing phone have a cut out just like how iPhone's back cover have a cut out for it's logo
"Dude, I just wanna explore more about the OS..!! 
And Very well Explained the Small Details of Transparent Back with 900 LEDs and also there working; Superb Observation..!!"
Nothing+
This are all nice little features but I don't think they will not establish after the first hype
"I really hope they succeed and sell well, we need more players in the game to drive innovation and competition."
Personally I think they’d do pretty well if they made a case for iPhone with the same LED’s as the phone that would work with notifications and battery
Such cases have been available in the Chinese markets for years now
@Natnael Berhane YIKES. Now that is something I didn't consider so far now.
So basically Apple only needs a case to crash this company out of the market😂
I think that someone is/will be working on this concept while I'm replying to this right now.
I thought that's what it was at first
ok its cool
"I personally think they should've just silently released it. 

Doesn't have much of that x-factor for a first gen phone (maybe it does, but we can't see the rest of the phone). All they've done is draw too much attention to themselves which I personally think is not a good idea for this phone.

Media and tech reviewers will destroy them, I hope they make it good enough"
"Unless the software is great, no one will bother buying this phone"
It’s be cool if you can change the color
Bro when your going to review the phone features
This phone is pretty sick in terms of design that perfect bezels squared shape and useful two cameras hope I will see more colours in it and a competitive price tag with it.
"I thought it was an iPhone 12.. Seems kinda similar, like a customized iPhone"
"I heard the earbuds were a major flop because they didn’t live up to the hype. The audio supposedly was pretty lousy, and they ultimately were not totally clear as promised — but they mostly failed due to the audio being worse than headphones costing around the same price or less. 

I worry the phone will fall down the same landfill chute as the headphones. There will be people who will try it, but I don’t think there will be masses of people clamoring to get their hands on one like the major players. 

I know it’s a startup and I commend them for trying to do something unique . . . but looks and flashing lights alone won’t sell phones. It needs amazing audio and speakers, a super hi-res screen, top quality cameras, and battery life. The cameras on the back are already underwhelming. They don’t seem to look special and I can almost bet they won’t be as good as most cameras out there. The lights are cool, but it would make more business sense to develop cases with visible electronics that feature a light system like this and slap them on iPhones, Samsungs, etc. People would be more likely to purchase that.

They overpromised and undersold on those earbuds. I have a feeling this phone will fall to the same fate. I could be proven wrong, but somehow I get the feeling it’s not going to turn out as good as the hype like last time."
11/10 OnePlus burn.
"Essentials had a great run, but somehow they failed. Their PH1 was probably one of the most aesthetically pleasing phone to look at and hold. I still had compliments about it back when I had it, way pass when they announced that they would shut down.

Now this look is kinda...meh."
Story of OnePlus repeats
¿Innovation? XD
"VERY INTERSTING REVIEW AND VERY HONEST REVIEW. 
WE CAN SAY THAT THIS NOTHING PHONE HAVE SOMETHING TO APPEAL PEOPLE."
"I am definitely impressed with that there is genuinely something new, and my gut reaction is to bee excited to have the flexibility with visual notifications that have existed for decades with ringtones, but it's still very unlikely to be something I buy.

The teardown look would be cool but it's too white for me, at first I thought it was cracked glass to be honest. I don't know if the LEDs on the back are bright enough to get my attention compared to what my current iPhone flash does. I also can't imagine going back to a phone without a case, the last time I did that I owned a Nokia, phones these days are just too expensive, breakable, and necessary. But fundamentally I'm so entrenched in the Apple ecosystem I was never gonna be a realistic customer acquisition anyway."
That is dope
The first thing that came to mind when I saw the back of this phone was: Casette Tape!
"i really like the recording light. everyone is walking around with a high end camera now, its really nice to see when someone is recording (when they shouldn't)"
@J K then there will be mods to disable it. Why are you so freaked out that someone might record you
@Rushav Kumar Panda it would be great to make that light permanent. it shouldn't be possible to turn it off.
Why would anyone who doesn't want to be seen ecording leave that light on?
One Plus Mention😷
what will be the price of this phone
"too childish, not interested"
GIMMICK
THIS IS A DUAL EMBARGO !!!!!!!!!
But does the back of the phone matter at all? How many users put their phone down screen against table etc. I would say most ppl never look at the backside after the first few weeks with it.
Dope af
All hype lol
its not coming out in the us and canada by the way.
"I m getting one 
Comeback after 6 months and nothing will fail oneplus for surely oneplus is very disappointing now"
"As an avid smartphone user that's been in every mobile OS since 2001, I have to say this looks really good so far.
Apples design is really really good. And their hardware is ""ok-ish"". The atrocity is their OS and the walled garden mentality.
If the Nothing phone runs Android (and the brief look make me think it does), I'm very interested.
Looking forward to the next part for sure!"
"Yes, notification light is really important in smartphones."
A simple case would hide all those features on the back of the phone tho
Nothing to see here.
I am strictly apple ( and nothing will ever make me switch ever. No matter how good the nothing is) and this phone looks really really cool to me and is making me consider buying it as like a second phone to go with my iPhone 13 Pro Max. Can’t wait to use it someday

""Tomorrow is mystery""❤
""Today is gift""❤
""That it's why l called present""❤"
Is there a notification slider?
”All the time you wanna check on it just wiggle the phone” Yeah just scratch the screen against the surface to show charging status…makes sense..
6:30 that reference to OnePlus was hilarious 💀
"That's looks cool ,just because looks like a clear iphone 12....."
This phone unique….i like the design 🔥👍👍👍
Would be cool to see something similar to Asus zephyrus notebook matrix in phones.
the subtle nod at oneplus at the end was peak
Love your shirt 🤙😁 The colours look awesome
@rabi0ne 😂😂😂
GDogg stands for GayDogg then...
"If someone really wants to ""take on 🍎"", he may be better not to take it on the battlefield of smartphones. 🌚 It's a mature market without much space for real breakthrough innovation that is needed for the take. People should try something different, like wearables or something."
Phone from tron legacy
wasn't expecting this. it looks so sick with those back leds
Mean u cant use case or cover
"""more broadly appealing and sells even more"" till carl leaves and starts something phone 1"
It's iPhone isn't it?
it isnt gonna be released in america and canada
I am loving the design!!!
Sadly I don’t think any company can compete with apply mainly due to iMessage we have our own ecosystem it’ll be hard for a company to do what apple did and do it better to make people want to buy the competitors phone
Symmetrical bezel flat display. Nice!
"I hate these “we’re allowed to show you” videos.
This whole thing could have been a short, but the channel wouldn’t get paid as much for that."
"Hello, Humans
The average person has 5 liters of blood. Once a person loses 40% of their blood, they will die without immediate transfusion.

TERRANCE OUT"
I'm definitely going to buy this phone
oops you showed the front 😂
"Looks great and even seems great or practical.
But if the rest of the phone is nothing to loose your sleep about, it doesn't matter.
First comes the phone itself and if that succeeds this feature would be great. I would still miss the alarm slider from OnePlus. Why does no one else copy this?"
"Keeping aside the performance et al., taking on giants like Apple and Samsung and China-drop brands, Nothing came up with a 'bold' something. Just the back of the phone is enough to steal a few customers and to break the monotony of design (more or less the same matte, plastic, glass panel)."
Which processor is it gonna rock?
"6:33 
OnePlus : 🥲🚶🏼‍♂️"
"From the video I can tell that it has some sort of face unlock, reverse charging, no chin and almost a stock android like skin."
How about a DBrand skin with cut outs for the LEDs
This is beyond awesome! The all-white look reminds me of a spaceship or something
6:35 yup definitely sounds familiar (sad One Plus noises)
honestly just makes me want a clear option for my iPhone.. Im far too comfortable in Apple ecosystem to change.
"Backpart of a phone is actually used for NOTHING
How many feature in back is not fair 

,,, Umm, for normal user....."
"It's nice. 
But I'll add some different functionalities to the back LED lights, e.g.: 
1 - Different colors for different notifications.
2 - More customizable functionalities with the LEDs.

And also, this back plate is built with which material?  
Maybe create a case with the system of the LEDs? 

Just some ideas."
"​@Mohamed Lenieb Sure thing, that's is the reason when I talked about the LED lights, need to improve the technology to put my idea ongoing."
"No, doesn't work that way if it doesn't have argb or rgb lights"
Phone specification please?
"Wow, that not nothing."
FARTED SO HARD I HAD TO WIPE MY BUTT!
"HTC  is launching FUTURISTIC of SMARTPHONE to the world but no one is talking about it ,I am sure everyone will talk within few days that's capacity of the product they are going to launch 
Everyone is under the shadows of NOTHING which is just a HYPE creating COMPANY .
As CARLPIE  has done his ACADEMICS in DESIGNING and MARKETING ,so he's is doing the WORK on designing and marketing that's it he has NOTHING NEW to INTRODUCE to THIS WORLD"
"If this phone is functionality wise good, I’m probably buying it"
i think the way those 10 ringing tones and the led flash are well incorporated is just awesome . cant wait to find out about the gpu and cpu. thumbs up
@Vlad Avram +
Soc is rubbish. I'd buy it if has at least a dimensity 8100
Snapdragon 778G confirmed
@weston statt 778g+
Cpu is snapdragon 7 gen 1
What a waste of battery… What exactly are they doing that’s different. Better phones for the environment? Morally transparent? Upgradable? All I see is another deceptive product filling the bloated tech ecosystem. Folks willing to pay into this are init for the short-lived “hype.”
Lmaoooo OnePlus was it right ?
Which countries will this phone be available for in its initial launch??? Been a loyal OnePlus customer for almost 6 years now....Feel like trying something new for a couple of years.
Nothing like a broadly appealing subtle poke
A red battery would be 🙂
i like watching phone unboxing that i cannot afford to buy.
"Hola punch camera  display, I wonder what's the resolution and refresh rate"
Whats that chunky laptop behind u bruh?😂
Superb flop company till now because the company mentioned the order and launch date but not mention till the price of mobile..
"""Nothing is better than apple"" those words aged like milk."
ok
Nothing just hyped it's product with the Apple brand value. Actually they very well know it's gonna tough to fight with competitors in the real world market. I think nothing phone 1 will be just midranger. It's not going to be extraordinary what we were thinking. Do actually back panel matters for most people nope. So whose gonna  waste money just on a different cool looking back panel. Nope it not gonna work for  nothing
"I would consider it depending on price. Without wireless carriers offering subsidies, I don't know if I would get it at full price through the manufacturer."
"Clear case is coming for sure....
An I'm clearly in love with this...
Let's see what the specs will be."
This very cool... Hopefully het get to keep his company this time around.
"This is what u call dope marketing.... Just a bunch of LEDs and a big youtuber for 7 minutes and this CEO guy made the whole world talk about its product... This will be everywhere now...
Marketing of a device without even talking technically about it with the headline 'IT GLOWS' !!!! 😉"
The one plus nothing
Miss the good old NOKIA 3220 :D
"""The Nothing Phone looks different""
Yeah it looks like the iPhone 13"
Bought a S22 earlier this year but it's trash. Might buy the nothing phone if the reviews are good
70% video is about back led lights
"Title update ""Nothing looks different"""
"It's very .... unique. 
When I first saw the thumbnail, I thought it was a new design for iPhone 11 😅

Also, could you do a review on B&O H95s? These are a pair of high-quality headphones and are worth the same price as Apple Airpod Max's (in AUD). Just want to see your opinion on them, and if they are worth it, in comparison to other headphones on the market."
"If I was a stormtrooper, I would want this phone. Needs a Red light when Vader's calling."
Looks like an iPhone 11/12/13
"So this company sends you a new phone and for now you are only allowed to show us the backside.. screw that, i pass!"
INTRODUCING :  🖲STAR WARS EDITION⚔️🕳️👽
"bruh Marques test out the naruto phone _and its dimensity 8100_ to see how far MTK has accomplished since 2020!!!
I feel that no big youtuber has really tested out how good dimensity 8000 and 9000 series of phones have achieved compared to blazing hot snapdragons these two years"
Puts on a back cover :)
"Keep in mind, startups always look good and impressive at first. Disappoints come when they start to follow Apple's footsteps."
"We need more startups, so we can buy their competitively priced first flagship before they become expensive and boring like the other brands"
"Cool ringtone, the Nokia’s also had that feature back in the days, blinking the LCD’s backlight on the rhythm of the ringtone 🔥"
If it has good cameras this might be a new era
No iMessage. Not interesting
I wonder how many people place their phone screen down to make use of the LED notification back.
Nothing ear Product was crap
just a new coat of paint to sell more phones.
"Initial OnePlus phones were hit and they were and are budget friendly phones. Carl Pei has made really good OnePlus devices in the past. After he left OnePlus, OS has slightly become bloated with changing the dialer to Truecaller and many more. Carl's last device in oneplus was 8 pro. After that OnePlus is just copying Samsung designs and making os uglier. They just want to replicate what Oppo is doing just by tweaking the software to make it look like a flagship. All of that sucked because OnePlus after Carl left has been losing the OnePlus feeling. I have been using OnePlus since the OnePlus 1. Related to Nothing I can see a sense of personal touch it has to offer. Well I see Carl as a visionary because he knows how to make things just good for the masses... Not considering Nothing phone till I don't get its hands on experience but I think it's going to be a phone that will make people switch."
Looks like the iPhone 11
This Phone looks like Nothing.
That sounds familiar 😂😂😂
"So many phones that haven't changed in years.... Nice to see something actually NEW. Obviously, it won't be everyone's ""thing"" but at least it is new."
"A good name is better than riches. 
The good name: 
1. The boring company 
3. Nothing"
Gimmick.
It will be nice if those light support LED
He has something personal problem with OnePlus i guess 😂😂
This phone feel and acts like something you would see in Blade Runner 2049.
That phone is not unique whatsoever
6:32 Oneplus
yeah im not impressed this video felt like an ad for some gimmick on a phone.
All cool etc but I always place my phone screen up on the desk lol
that ringtone light show is an awesome feature
"Me to people who put a case on it : how about u put on a clear case instead. 
Them :😐😐"
6:33 OnePlus: cough cough 🥴
"So it's an Android that looks like an iPhone, with some lights on the back"
For those who wanted an Iphone with Android
"Can't really hope to get my hands on these, so many phone doesn't sell here in my country lol"
"Love the experimental electronic ringtones, it sounds like Autechre wrote them haha"
"This is Dope 
Like one of the phones in Sci-fi movies. I love it . I hope they have a nice operating system"
LED notification on the back of the phone is kinda weird design choice since most people put the phone on surface with screen facing up to prevent the screen scratced.
"That LED light with ringtone feature is good but if you are only buying for that, buy a toy instead…"
"This is super cool. I would absolutely purchase that phone even just for those lights. I expect it to unfortunately run android but hey, You can’t have everything can you…?"
This phone feels like a real R2-D2 with those sound and light combinations...
what about battery it will drain so fast think so🤔
For a nothing phone it sure has a lot of things.
Am I the only one who thinks this design has a resemble of the old Nokia 3200 and 3220? Am I way too old for this channel? LOL
The ringtones give me anxiety 🥴
"looks cool.. lets see camera, battery performance too.  IP68?"
cue imperial march
2:52 So you just wiggle wiggle and it glows?
"The back LED functionality is really cool. But I personally hate if other person knows I am recording something 😕. It is needed when you are actually talking to some shady person or gathering proof, so need more better ways to hide our actions instead of telling publicly that we are recording them😂.

Also I do hope this new brand does not end up in Mr.WhoseTheBoss' disastrous products list 😂"
"I'm always down for something that doesn't follow the mass trend. That said, it has to be solid in it's own right."
I highly doubt of this phone will be high battery efficient considering that led feature don't get me wrong it's cool for sure.
Leds don't draw too much though
"OMG, it is just a copy of iphone 12！Is it cool？"
Damn that intro's sick af
"Hello Marques, thanks for highlighting the comment  yesterday, it was a  little bit late for me as im in the UK but  that did certainly surprise me :)"
Nothing is Nothing 😂😂
Nothing is Nothing 😂😂
Will it come on black color  ?
THE EUROPES IPHONE COMPETTR MADE A PHONE SAME AS iPHONE 12
"A clear back iPhone WOULD NOT look like a transparency skin, iPhones have metal plates the components are protected and screwed into, you'd see stainless steel with a cutout for the wireless charger and rivets for the screws to go into. Maybe a few gaps here and there where you see battery or PCB but this does look like a clear iPhone painted white hands down. Please look at a real image instead of aesthetic tape next time Marques"

"And maybe if the first run is successful enough,
then they can make a slightly more broadly appealing,
slightly better phone overall that sells more.
And if that one works,
then they can make an even more broadly appealing phone
that sells even more,
and then even more broadly appealing and even more,
until you've made a very broadly appealing phone
that sells the most,
but that feels like it abandoned your original fan base.

"Nothing Phone: The phone when jiggle jiggle, it glows"
The Nothing phone really lived up to its hype
future.
i love the idea of the phone hardware design and the use of the light. i can't wait to see who well the camera and the OS works since that's where many of the minor phones fail to get consumers to buy
@Vipul 2.0 I mean. the N was capital but that can be also explained by it being the starting of a sentence so I guess we'll never know....
@Vipul 2.0 That is the whole point
@Кристиян Трънбашев now i am actually confused what you are trying to say
Nothing is better than iPhone
Ringtones gave me an ear bleed. What gimmicks.
"When he says ""Sound familiar?"" at 6:32, we're talking about Oneplus, right?"
:O It comes out on my birthday!
IPhone have better customisation.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Mkbhd Isheep eco
gotta say was very skeptical with just the design but with the added functionality it makes it less cosmetic and more functional. i feel the first few iterations will be wild and then it trims into the mainstream market and then we come to say nothing seperates nothing from other brands
Your hands are pale
"Dear Carl,
You ve did a tremendous job making this unique phone. Im going to get one btw❣️"
'Nothing has built a new user interface' what the hell
A transparent cover will be fine but have to change every 6 month to maintain clear look.
"Wtf is looking ""unique"" about this phone? Literally nothing. Oh, the back.. yes, just get a case with that design - or you get a case for this one as well anyway, so you won't see it.
This phone looks exactly like any other phone, especially the iphone of course. Fuuck, when can companies finally make good phone designs again, like around 10 years ago? Especially Sony (and some of the Microsoft phones too)... :("
Bro it's literally in the phones name
Nothing  Phone should launch Black Colour  option and the white led indicator will look good on black back.
Ooooo wow! Nothing phone  Unique phone 👏.
The ringtone feature is so cool
nice
very very
Nice
"voice acting is good, everything is clear, very interesting"
@jtp jin but in some conditions where some of us work \ reside in - would cut well through the ambiance \ noise.  those who know   know
Cool phone
"Price in India is INR 60,000 Onwards"
Not digging the lights at the back. Weird but who knows.. altho really not a fan of glowing lights which potentially would take up battery life in time
I WANT THIS
"I'd love too see how they've priced this, and also a bit more of the software and ofcourse camera and overall performance"
"@Audrew Miracle yep, nuts."
@Kjeks Klaus for real 😳
First 100 are dropping at £2500ish
Happy to see prasad tech in telugu in vivo add
"I gotta have to say this back looks dope. I can tell this new feature will be joyful for me to play with for a few days. But after the honeymoon, I think I need a stable phone more than anything else. Since they are a new company, I might be concerned that their operating system and hardware ( especially the back ) will not be stable enough and cause many problems like Google Pixel 6 did last year...yeah, even a company like Google. Well, I'm trying to say that if their software and hardware could reach the level of Samsung Galaxy level, then I'm in; I mean, who can refuse a phone that glows?"
Any malayali here
@Ishaan Ajvad 😂💓
@Mini Milta malayali poliyale
Yeah
But what if I don’t want to scratch the screen. The feature is very limited. It is better to be on edges for sure
"the phone looks like a i pone, spsly the body structure"
"There is always display on ADO features available in most of the phone.
No need backside LED"
looks like a modified iphone
When the light started doing the machine gun ringtone all I could think about was   boosie  it's a chopper lmao
"Finally a company that can ""think different""."
I wonder who put display side down.
The only thing is: why would I get this phone and put it upside down while I could get basically any android and have always on display give me more detailed information on notifications than just some light?
"Hey Marques, that laptop in the background. Which one is that??? It's huge.."
"Most of us put camera part down. 
Because we worried on display would get scratch."
They should add QUAD DAC like LG used to put on their flagship phones.
You dont need a back notification LED if you have always on display....duh..
Imagine we getting These LEDs with RGB.... OMFGG!!!!
Still the bump
I want a black version of this phone
"As a Two Phone Marty one of the biggest things I like about this phone absolutely is the recording indicator. More recording indicators on phones please so I don’t feel like I have to cover my sick multi-camera lens phones on public transport

Either that or physical camera caps that are attached to phones being integrated somehow that lets people know I’m specifically not recording or taking photos of them"
so sick
"It's a cool gimmick, but don't leds drain more than aod? I guess they'll work for phones without oled"
no one with sense puts their phone face down (front glass touching any kind of surface)to do anything ...so i dont understand the attention given to the back....like those side lights that illuminate the phone when a message or call comes thru...useless
What is this video
It’s definitely a good idea I hope they get access in the US.
First unique model in smartphone section...loved it ❤️
kiddish af
"My first Smartphone was the Sony Xperia SP. The lighting bar at the bottom was so cool. Still no one dared to touch this concept. Sony is actually a really interesting smartphone company but they can’t figure out naming, marketing and the basics. But besides that, it was a great phone."
"This first phone with some actually new, cool features in a long time"
Trolling OnePlus at the end just touched me stronger 😂
"Sounds familiar?
Uuf oneplus
Still hurts to see the downfall"
They are certainly doing a good job on hiding what sets this phone apart...
yes
Not a spy phone
"If this was running iOS, it would be my endgame phone 100p"
Those ringtones sound really disturbed though.
"Basically Nothing has nothing special that makes me switch.

All the rest is noise."
was that last sentence meant for oneplus?
Nokia 3220
the nothing phone look NOTHING like other phones
"I love this design, I feel like I haven't personally seen a phone this subtle but dramatic at the same time for the whole glass back since like the Nexus 4, and I still love that design too, this looks super cool to me I will definitely be keeping an eye on it as to how I can offer my support, and whether I will end up buying the phone"
Nokia 3220
"“It looks like nothing to me.” 

Anyone get the reference?"
I WANT IT!!!!!!
"Here's an idea, why not make a case and a app that has some or if not all the same features as that and slap it on your phone if you want a phone like that."
Please for the love of God just put in a headphone jack 😭😭😭
Who waited for Mario ring 🤪
Putting a headphone jack can make them steal at least 10% of the customer segments from the market
That phone looks ugly af and even more so with those LEDs. Very few people are gonna buy this.
??????? ?????????  ?????
Finally something new.
So it's all lights!!! So it's actually nothing! Honest!
Led should have 64 different colors as well
The design of the Nothing phone is copied from the iPhone 12  😂😂
Yes it does sound familiar. That is exactly what happened with “OnePlus”.
Overrated project and company
"I'm sorry. I heard nothing. (Correction), after clicking other videos and they had has audio. And then back here, then there's audio."
"Well, it’s nice to see a new competitor in the market. The features aren’t that interesting to me right now, but will follow along to see their progress for sure."
That dig at Oneplus towards the end >>>>>
Can't wait for the nothing ecosystem 🔥
Ooooooo what a way to end it. You hear that? *cough *cough *OnePlus *cough *cough
If I was an android user I would consider changing over to this phone only because of the amazing hardware
NICE  AWES0ME KEEP_IT_UP! ✨🎉✨🎉✨🎉🎉🎎🎭🎎🎭🎎🎭🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑✨🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆🎀🎀🎀🎀
And that’s something new like it and hope to see them competing in market soon
Impressive
Throwing shots at one plus at the end
"lol come on, it looks like the newest iPhone, and their wireless earbuds look like AirPods Pro. The difference is the more square-ish and transparent accents look. This isn't even form over function design-thinking, its just style and branding, and that's no startup-like behavior. It'll die out once that futuristic trend dies too. It's no Jon Ive being inspired by Bauhaus and Braun designs. Its a gimmicky ass phone. The glyph interface and its ringtones sound and feel like a tamagotchi from the 90s than a sophisticated product."
You mean Oneplus🤣?
I felt that Samsung reference I miss Turing off the TV at school when the teacher show bill Nye
"Nope. Not buying something that will have to be hidden in a case anyway, and not interested in case-less phones which easily can break."
I’m not an Android guy but this definitely caught my eye!
"7 minutes to talk about just LED's on the back . Really ? 
Not even saying once that is a blatant ripoff of the iPhone 12 design language."
"@Ankit take away the LED’s and it’s an iPhone 12 
They literally added useless buttons to the Lock Screen in the same spot 
JUST LIKE AN IPHONE…"
How can u say it's a copy when it is just so different apart from the cutout?
"Mkbhd:""Sounds familiar?"" 
Me:No shit it, it does sounds familiar"
Was that a shot at oneplus? Lol cause I feel the same way about them
This looks like a phone from star wars..
"I like new notification light but this new light notification feature is 18 years old. I see this feature in Nokia 3220, Sony Xperia U, Sony Xperia SP."
Transparent iPhone with Android inside :P
I hope they succeed I really like the transparent design they have.
A nice cryptic message sent to Carl pei manipulating its own fanbase 😅
"design isn't enough this days. if it's not power by money, so must be new os that make new company stands out."
If its like $700-$900 then I am definitely interested but im betting its like $1500+ like every other stupid phone
Imagine this in black🥵🤩
Sound familiar ? Never Settle
i WANT A GREY COLOUR JUST FOR BACK LOOKS COOL😎
"Similar to an iPhone but damn, that looks so good!"
Still waiting to replace my Oneplus 7 pro phone to some phone without a hole in the screen. Can't find any.
And it will all be covered by a case :(
"That ""Nothing"" is quite something ""Something"" for a phone.. Full review pls 😬👀"
So an iPhone 12 without iOS then…
"If this is THE selling feature, this phone will flop"
"$3,000+ AUD....BRUH"
This thing looks absolutely amazing and very unique
Im tired big phones with more than one camera  cant really find a simple looking phone like iphone se
lol there is even an apple on the back side XD
Imagine you buy this phone for all those cool lighting and then you start using a cover for safety
Transparent cover!!
The R2D2 sound and light combo. Wow. That kind of thing could pull me out of iOS
looks like a cracked iphone imo
The first phone in a long time to actually feel completely unique from the rest. Waiting for the launch and full review of it!
…. 🦗
ok
"From the all around design till even the antennas, that is the iPhone 12 design with a clear back. How can u call it “unique looking”"
"Ok I saw the rest of the video where you also mention that, but u insist that the iPhone design ripoff is interesting, and that it is “super different”. Tell me honestly: If you had been working your ass off to design iPhone 12, would you find that ripoff “interesting” or just immoral ?"
Sounds Familier? Blackberry?
"Very interesting. Don't like the iPhone 5 squared-off design, but definitely unique. For me it will come down to how well their version of Android is executed. More colors, including colored LEDs on the back, would be neat."
"Those lights and ringtones remind me of the classic nokia 1100 

Tech these days"
I just want to say: nobody needs this nothing phone
Wait till you see the Matt Blak version
"No thanks, gimmicky."
Earlier Sony Xperia devices used to give such features. Slowly they faded away by more budget friendly companies.
"If they wanted to take on Apple, they should've made this phone available to the USA, where Apple is mostly preferred. I was thinking about getting this before reading that it won't be sold here. FAIL"
Ngl that's pretty dope hope they add more colour support of LEDs so we can have different colours assigned for different apps.
Where to buy this cool thing?
"NOTHING proved that In 2022, Design innovation in smartphones is still possible."
I like this vedio for ur description not for phone
Why you didn't show the UI at all
"How about the OS?? 

As long as this are gonna rely on Google for the OS part. Let’s just have it if you wanna go for Android purest experienced. Go for Google Pixel. If you wanna go for iOS then it’s iPhone. Simple. Done."
TAKE MAH MONEH
damnn that was an amazing ending!
So how’s the pixel 6a?
This is sick. I’m sure Apple developers are watching this video with a notepad in hand.
"The case will of course will have cutouts/transparent area where the lights are so it doesn't matter if you have a case on, you can still see the lights"
Where do I get that Naruto phone tho
I think a lotta birds are gonna be upset they’re not getting any royalty checks from the stolen ringtones.
I love LED Notification 🤩
It definitely should have been a RGB LED.. otherwise seems a cheap
hmmmmm 😏
Honestly speaking that looks awful hand down.
Nothing unlike Apple.
6:20 reminds me of OnePlus... 🤔
Flashback to the Nokia phone days where you can swap the case to a see-through case & the lights will light up according to your ringtones when somebody calls you.
This phone is looking dope!!!!
What SOC is the phone using?
"Nope, not buying a Chinese backed phone.  Too many problems with software built with backdoors that only the Mainland can access.  i.e TikTok"
Was waiting to ditch apple. Maybe this is it
This phone is on dope!
You put in a cover which most people do and this phone is similar to any other phone 🥱🥱
No they will put a transparent cover so everything will be visible
This is the “Balenciaga 23 fashion show” of phones
Would have liked a centre punch hole.
Looks like something a cyberpunk citizen would use
Wow so unique and classy at the same time would love yo try this.😁
Shots fired at one plus 😂
Oneplus
"From niche to broadly appealing? Hm. OnePlus, what's good?"
the lights look like the original icon of cyanogen rom from back in the past
I so miss the notification light 🚨
6:06 OnePlus
"While the LEDs are a novel idea, it doesn't cut it for me. For all the hype created around it, I would've loved to see something new and revolutionary with maybe the display, the battery life, the design of the phone (transparent doesn't do it), camera or speakers even. This, I feel they've just slapped on a transparent back on to a regular iPhone lookalike and called it a phone (apart from any insignificant minor modifications they might have done). My tip: don't go against something like the iPhones or the Pixels unless you're bringing something huge, a game changer to the table. 

Take Pixel. Pixel truly had a revolutionary camera (+the clean, stock build)  that set it apart. iPhones are well known to give a consistent, high quality user experience. What does Nothing bring? LED lights? I'll pass. I was really keen on Nothing delivering on their hype as it's time someone disrupted the big players in the phone industry by giving us something new (like Tesla did for cars)."
That last statement tho.... TRUE ✅
BaD AsSS
"The lights being on the back for notifications is in my opinion genius - You can sit at a table with your phone out, still get notifications but not seem asocial."
This phone is so SICK 🔥🔥
"Those ringtones are epic, probably inspired by star wars"
"""Sounds familiar?"" 😄 yup"
Hey OnePlus! Are you hearing 😹
"Actually the flat edges ,the phones interface and the dual camera setup looks like an iPhone 12...but the design and their template is pretty unique🖤🔥🔥🔥
But wondering how's the protection case gonna come for this phone...🤔😶"
Looks like an iphone would be cooler if they changed the shape a little
The ending scores 100 points.
Love it
"umm, I want it.."
AirPods Pro case should have MagSafe reverse charging so you can hold the phone while the case charges stuck to the back

Nice gimmicks but that’s all it is. Sadly.

"Unimpressed, all these features go away when you put on a case, and an always on display would do all this and more without having to put phone face down everytime to use the new feature `*cries in iPhone`*"

"@LockHeed That gets dirty very quickly, and at least 50% people don't prefer it, and then you're locked to one type of back case."

😂😂😂"
this is going to be a OnePlus rerun. hype. invites. limited. then they sell out. 😅
seizures all day.
Firefly or lighting bug?
They audio in this video isn’t up to MKBHD production standards.  If your team isn’t telling you this we’ll…there you go.
reminds me of motorolla phones.
"Thing is.... getting samey and boring isn't really appealing to the masses.  Sure, the masses buy it, because that's what's THERE.  An actually innovative company appeals to the masses by producing something unique, not by copying everybody else and hoping for the best.

That's how we end up with bougie friendly safe pastels and boring products.  Does it sell?  Sure.  Would it it there was actually an alternative?  I'm guessing not...."
"These features are useless. Every Android phone in the world, if we put it down a 5 feet above will get shattered. So we need to put a case."
I think i am the only one who is seeing at those led and thinking about battery.
Why white LED? It should have been RGB LED set up.
"Upcoming phones
This is first model so can't do so much experiments.
Keep it simple if people like the lighting idea then maybe different colours will be available in future models"
I don't remember the last time i kept my screen side down and back side up when not using my phone . Is all this led light show actually of any use 😅.
paid video
DOES A IPHONE CASE FIT ON IT?
This is so cool cApple will steal it in 30 years
Did anyone else also think all the ringtones sound like different bird calls? Is that why there was a bird in the teaser image? 👀 Starting to make sense now.
You'll see next year (2023) the other companies copying and putting LED lights on cell phones 🤣🤣🤣☝️
That phone actually looks kind of sick
"LG died on their hill, and never abandoned their original fan base."
"I hope I have the imperial march, when my wife calls me, and the led light turns red"
R2D2 in your pocket ... and you can make a call 😉 and not just to Obi V. Kenobi 🤭
It’s not gonna work. Lot of Gimmicks.
Brutal
This video doesn't utter a single word about - Oneplus 😂
Waaaao another thing I don't need in my phone.
"The HTC one has that case that also lit up notifications through the case , dot case ??"
🔥
2.7 million views in 14 hrs.. Nothing is impossible 😁
That reference to OnePlus XD
I'm all for innovation and companies being new and trying new things. But why the hell did they have to go with the iPhone look?!🤷🏿‍♂️ Other than that it seems really cool hopefully those lights don't go bad and blow after a couple years.
"But we all know we are going to use the case
So whats the point"
"i thought this was a custom iphone 12 at first, but its actually its own pretty cool product."
This is just another gimmick.
another fake iPhone13 xD
Bring back top left corner Punch Holes!!!! its the cleanest look by far!!
"leds in the back and a transparent design won't be enough, hopefully they bring some impressive software tunings to fight w/ Samsung, Google and Apple"
Love the dig on OnePlus
"I wish they were RGB LEDs, and different apps could choose any colour for their notifications"
Reminds me of nokia 3220
might want to put a flashing light warning before the ringtone section
"It’ll be another oneplus, couple of years later, they will become the now oneplus. Sucks but it’s true"
Just hope this phone have more compact size like 6” but huhh once again it’s not
"You would be One Plus, just say it."
It looks like a modded iPhone 12
It’s funny that when I was wactching you said that like 10 seconds after I commented
Matte Black?
I m not watching the video that describes back of the phone because they are not sure about the front. I thought very highly of you mkbhd but this video said it all that you are just behind making money and would promote any shitty thing in your channel.
"Doesn't like the front camera position 🥲
Everything else is perfect 
The back camera setup I think will be main and ultra wide
Wht about telephoto 🥲
These two downside
Else i Loved the phone ❤️"
Commenting on every video I see challenge
Those ringtones are so cool haha
"The phone is really impressive....and am planning to buy it, but the problem is the cover 🤔🤔"
No one plus was hurt while making this video 😂
The hardware looks like combination of iphone and OnePlus
"I don't think it's really good because most of people use cover in back and the white one also get pale in so less time
If the phone comes with power like apple then I will buy it 
otherwise it's like a politician promise"
No one plus was harmed in this video...
"Hi MBK, how much battery power does that gimmick use?"
Rip oneplus carls really step up the game this time
How many times he said sooooo
Would have been happy to see RGB tech on the back panel instead of just white. I see the future of back panels with frosted back panel inlaid with RGB to make it as colour changing back (for many uses). Cool start for the trend. Super going... NOTHING is limited
I hope this phone does good.
MKBHD Son of iphone
transparent back seems just gimmick!! So where is the innovation?
Geeking out over the ringtone / light patterns... wonderful!
Over 2k for a knock off iPhone
What a waste of wood
Peace.
"Nice round up of what is there is to reveal about this phone, I like their approach however, show more tangible things which are unique to Nothing."
i would love to buy one if they didnt auction 100 off
Coming out on my birthday 😁
That's pretty dope.
I'll be honest. They should have made a phone-case with the lights and the functionalities. It would make a lot more money than the phone itself.
The shape of the glyph looks like an apple logo 👀
"hmmm, I will definitely be looking at Nothing with interest. 😊"
Why do we need LEDs on the back if we have always on display which has more functionality
"Nice design. More importantly, how does it function? I’ll check back when a more comprehensive review is available."
dbrand about to make those phone even more🔥
4:03 Imagine your phone going off in a movie theater with that 😬 “AHHHHHH”
or showing backlight in a music concert  *=*
I love the look of this phone. It’s so sleek. Reminds me Apple but Android. If they are still making these phones in 2 years (when I’ll upgrade) I will most definitely consider them.
Garbage... just give me a phone with user friendly swappable battery
this phone is so futuristic sci fi kinda thing well im grabbing one of these when it comes out so excited.
"They will do great if they get the software and the price right at launch. In my opinion, there are a lot of people who can still live without a complete ecosystem, they don't have the needs for a smartwatch for answering messages or things like that, or the seamless switch of the earbuds between the phone and the laptop, and these people are more than tech enthusiasts thinks. Even if, today more then ever, working or studing has became almost impossibile without a Pc, certain features like Apple has, or maybe even Samsung, are ""useless"" for the average user, and that's why i think that Nothing is a little bit late but still in time to became what they want to (sometimes when you saw how and where other companies have faild or what they could have done better it's ""easier"" to start and go in the right direction). They have sold more then 400.000 pairs of ear1 headphones in less then one year despite be a completly new company, bearly known, especially outside the tech industry. They know how to market things, they know the audience they want to reach, and they will, because they know how to comunicate, and Carl Pei showed that he can do things like that like he did with OnePlus before, making the brand one of the most loved in the Android world (until the ColorOs thing). So, as i was saying, they still have time to build their own open ecosystem (whatever this means) but, even without it, they can sell a lot of Phone1 (if it will be good) like they did with headphones, and, i'm pretty sure that a good part of the owners of ear1 (and also OnePlus users that feels let down) will think about buying this as their next phone because they don't care about a complete ecosystem and, unlike a lot of others android phones, it looks great with the same design lenguage of the earbuds :)"
"the real benefit I think this would offer is finally normalizing putting phones screen down. I already hate using my phone (yeah yeah call me a boomer) as I just hate being *_that_* available, but even though recently I have had to start using it more, I've found even just leaving it face down on my desk helps far more. While this term is overused as fuck, it's a nice ""mental health"" boost. I think for me personally that primarily comes from simply not being available all that much because as aforementioned that's my main issue with phones in the first place, but I could easily see how simply not having it be there is a nice benefit. Can't really speak to that though, because I don't really have a solid contrast point, basically all of the tech I own integrates seamlessly when off aside from my actual computers, I've just always hated cluttering my vision with screens unnecessarily."
Show some camera samples
"Hey man, can you put a strobe warning on this video? Damn I was pretty excited about the lights on this one, but I wasn’t expecting the strobing."
Copy of iPhone 📱
Okay the one plus shade was brilliant hey if it works 5G in the US and gets regular Android updates I'll spend my coin on it cuz I like the notifications with the lights
"Carl pei is genius, about product, abou marketing. That's why one plus before one of the best market in USA !"
"Yes, sure. But 2.7k? I'm sorry I can get so much more from literally any other company for that money."
No one here gonna mention the nudge at OnePlus?! Started exactly like he described: a company dedicated to the loyal user base which ended up making a very broadly appealing phone but forgetting about the OG supporters' wants.
Would be pretty sweet if the back lights were RGB
Oneplus 🤫
"that's an iPhone, but a half of android, or an android with a half of iPhone, whatever that is, they just made my dream phone became real, also with the LEDs. can't wait for the specs and distribute to indonesia XD. edit: i like the word ""nothing"""
does no one else see the clear apple logo the LEDs are making?
Those ring tones stress me out
"Although it is a different look, I still think it's kind of safe. Not too out there, just plain white. Which might appeal to a lot more people than you are probably thinking of."
"100% loving that sci-fi look at the back. I'd buy this in a heartbeat once it's officially available in my region.

But of course there'll be haters. They've *nothing* better to do except hate."
Spigen has a great clear case that should be fine. Lights are cool... But if it's just lights it won't be enough...
"Looks cool. But, it seems like a pointless gimmick. Doesn't really advance the user experience of smartphones. If a startup wants to actually compete with the heavy-hitters, they're going to need a lot more than a light-show on the back of their iPhone 12 clone. (Even if it's a really nice clone.)"
is that an IPS screen and not OLED?
I want this one 😁
That was Realme phones at the end right?
The aesthetic is on another level.
Deja vu with the minimum wage phones again. Just like before selling cheap phones is not sustainable.
🤣😂🥰🥰❤️ Dope.. Impressive lighting tweaks
Thanks marq😇 for showing us the beauty 🥰
It looks like a white iPhone 12
if i buy this most probably i would get a back case first then screen guard
"Love the ending dig on 2 of my favorite phone companies, they started off so well with handing off customization to the users and then ended up getting way too mainstream. I would love to see how Nothing pans out. 

Also side note I just feel the white LED on a white phone was an underblow, might look cool during the night time but not so much during the day. A different darker color back for the phone would've put more emphasize on the design feature they are actually pushing for (but then that's just my POV). Will definitely wait for the full reveal along with the software."
@Randy Smores OnePlus. OnePlus One was super customisable. Even the shades of the led notifications could be customised
who was the dig aimed at?
You said you can't show us the front.
Meh
"Its a iPhone, with extra bullshit. So lets be honest but the name suits the phone, it's nothing. We have seen the lights before, years ago before smartphones. Blinking leds must turn people over, really? Come on people. The price probably is even worse."
An iPhone running android software. I like it!
"I really like the custom light ringtones. It reminds me of my favorite old school Samsong flip phone that had that ability. It was just a little light in the top corner of the phone, but you could set the color and pattern of flashes for (I think) up to ten contacts."
"Man this does look cool, I’d be fine with a bumper case or clear-backed case (or one that has cutouts for the lights!). Take a lot for me to switch from my iPhone now that I’m used to it though"
Didn't even think about the case tbh
I just wish someone would come out with a revolutionary mobile OS. It’s currently either Android or Apple. I’m bored. Can we do something original and new with software vs just repackaging Android?
"Poor OnePlus :))
Or 
Rich OnePlus :))
You name it :)"
The first phone is a great and unique one. How many companies can say that?
That looks so futurestic.👁️👄👁️
That's what OnePlus look like in ~2014. And they became mainstream.
LOVE it!!
"Design is nice and all that BUT what I really want is a company that makes a brand new OS exclusively for their phone or atleast a new OS, because I think it has gotten boring between Android and iOS, like we really only have TWO options? Cmon"
"As a OnePlus user, I'm interested"
Reminds me oh when OnePlus first started out. I’m looking forward to seeing this phone come out.
"@RONIT MAHAWAR no, he was just a director and co-founder"
That's whom he was referring to at the end...
"cause person who started nothing was the ceo of oneplus 
afterward he left oneplus got ruined"
Reminds me oh when OnePlus first started out. I’m looking forward to seeing this phone come out.
Yeah… that’s what he was getting at near the end of this video. The company that said to “Never Settle” but then they did — more and more each release. That has been so sad to watch.
You get a Plus One for this video ;)
"$3000 right now on stockx, damn... I don't think I will get it then."
What an ad
Interesting question: is this the one and only color? Or we will se others coming up later ?
"This is cool, I would prefer an led shaped in an 8 shape or something where you can illuminate any letter or number that way you can get an idea of who contacted you. Also maybe 🤔 some rgb?"
"To be fair, I don't think this is actually an answer to iPhone... rather, it's an answer to Android users who want the iPhone look...."
"Hi,I hope u can get a Vivo X Fold and do a review about it,thank :)"
"The different patterns for the notifications are cool, but why do all the notifications sound bad? Also, who uses ringtones anymore? I would have preferred multiple vibration patterns"
Kind of makes me think about Tron :D
"Yeah, sounds familiar."
That glyph ringtone thing is pretty cool. Would love to see more things like this as there is a lot of application for disabled people.
Another way to drain battery…😕
No
Those are the coolest default ringtones ever
those LEDs got me like🥺
Clear case coming from nothing?😆
Good Job back stabbing nothing at the end there for giving you early preview. If you are board of phones move away from the segment. You definitely have a crap team compared to LTT even though you were from same time period.
It looks dope🙉😳
+1!
I'd rather have an ir blaster than a bunch of stupid leds lol
Looks like an iPhone with no label
THIS is the missing key that is bringing personality back to phones. I love it.
Looks like out of watch dogs legion.
"Interesting. Thanks for sharing Marcus. Nice feature with the lights, and reverse charging feature. My question is, the battery."
Did i hear 1+ (one plus)?? 😆🤭
"Marques: I’m only allowed to show you the back
Also Marques: Shows us the screen"
"This is gonna be a big hit , it's such a unique phone and depending on the cost too , I sold with the led lights and the love the boxy design 🥹"
"Me, I'm the target audience.  I still use my Pebbles, even."
"Okay now I'm considering buying this over the pixel 7 pro. Waiting to get a few more details on camera, os, etc."
I don't even use ringtones. This phone is cool. No way. Not for me
The ringtone are actually sounds of a Dot matrix printer sames goes with their font.
It’s copied iPhone. Look like same iPhone
"As long as thing isn't absurdly priced, and doesn't follow the lack of QA of the Pixel 6, this looks promising"
Lol phone or a light
"I have a feeling this will be another Essential PH-1. I bought the hype and owned the Essential phone, loved the design and everything, but eventually went back to Samsung. I feel like it's really difficult to beat the big guys now who have sheer number of employees dedicated to R&D + software maturity + some sort of AI and quality of life improvements they come up with."
This look really impressive
Gimmicks
Who else thought that their volume was on mute at 3:03?
I will never buy this. Why? Because I never put my phone screen face down like this. Why? Because any slip or accident touch or sliding etc.. will end up the disaster!
I can see the light being useful for macro
"I never keep my phone face down, so led in the back doesn't make any sense for me. It looks cool though and will be fun to show off. But if the battery backup isn't enough, led will always remain shut, just like 120hz display on my s20 Fe."
Storm trooper phone 😍😍😍😍😍omg those ringtones 😍
It's a gimmick..
"• Lights up to indicate notifications
• Glows when you use reverse wireless charging
• Bottom light is an indicator for wired charging progress (shake to show)
• Fill light for cameras
• Blinking red light when recording videos
• Blink lights to match built-in ringtones
 💡പ്രകാശം പടരട്ടെ🤣 വിപ്ലവം വിജയിക്കട്ടെ"
Just a little hint for guys planning to buy this.. You can’t put a regular phone case on this to see those Christmas lights ✨
A phone from cyberpunk
Those ringtones need to be put on Zedge
"No impressed with LED lights. Need some honest reviews on if the phone is worth that the price will be. Learned, flashier does not mean better and flashier is sometimes used to over shadow the defects. Too many people like the flashy crap and flock to it like moths to a flame."
I’m an iPhone user. But DAMN do I want this!!!
I miss the NEXUS ERA so bad :'(
Tesla phone and NIO phone are coming soon.
"this is stupid, nobody has their phone face down for extended periods."
"Mkbhd: ""according to the embargo we can only show the back of the phone""
*Proceeds to show the front with the almost iPhone like chin*"
Why did they take an iPhone 12 and make it translucent lol
"this phone is really well designed.. while looking lil close to iphone, having a full display without the notch and nice symmetrical bezels all around made the difference..the led on the back is cool too..it's nice"
take me back to 2012 /2018where tech was interesting
"But will they unlock the damn bootloader is the question?

With no new phones with SD slot, they could totally move into thst spot. It's ripe for the taking."
I will buy this for sure.
It looks so freaking cool but sadly It won’t run iOS and I just love iOS too much to make a switch
Omg I'm already loving the nothing phone
T͟h͟e͟ p͟h͟o͟n͟e͟ n͟a͟m͟e͟ i͟s͟ L͟I͟T͟E͟R͟A͟L͟🙋
Is there any headphone jack
"So far, I kinda dig nothing"
The LED's in the back are weirdly cool! I just appreciate that someone is innovating with phone designs.
Sounds familiar. Thanks for pointing out apple
Foldables are the next iteration of smart phones. There is nothing revolutionary about this phone.
"It looks like a cool phone, but two things prevent me from buying it: cost and size. I couldn't spend $2600 on a phone. I just don't have the money for it. Two, it's just too big for me. I currently have a phone that is over 6 inches diagonally across and it is too big for my smaller hands. I really like the concept, but they're definitely not aiming for affordability here, which is okay. But if they get off the ground, they should certainly look into that."
6:33 OnePlus 😂
samsung: 👁️👄👁️
Let me guess you've been using it for the past 2 weeks?
waiting for prices?
Fake 😂
​ ohh really....😂 so tell me what i won...
Have you reviewed Elon’s Pi phone?
Remembering the OG OnePlus.
"Missed opportunity call this the ""Light Phone 3"""
Nothing phone is not competing with Apple phone relatively.....but its will make Oneplus lost market direction ....lately One Oneplus new designed doesnt impresssed ..reviewers includding oneplus fans ...so do I .  I was fans of Oneplus for quite longer time  but the new design really lost design direction & very exclusive phone..ever.   hopping Oneplus  won't end up like HTC..
"Feels gimmicky, even if it ""works"". It's not disruptive enough, imho.
Would be interested to know if Nothing's product value proposition is mostly based on aesthetics/cosmetics perspectives and minor differentiated features."
🙌🏾
"Nothing about this seems very appealing especially the price..
They have lived up to the name.."
super futuristic
"For a first phone from a company, this it quite impressive"
can't wait for it to turn into a trash company like oneplus
Samaung did this in 2015
That looks like just a cover with fancy l.e.ds
"it's really unique and charming, and kind of sexy. Truly the people behind gave countless efforts."
Had some doubts about this phone but after seeing this vedio I'm sure this is great phone and the led in the back is great only part is the thing with case I hope they make it kinda cheap and doesn't destroy the cool factor of the phone
Predictor ring tone 🔥
star wars🐲
Transparent tech needs a comeback!!!!
"5:33 um, yeah bro. It will be a breath of fresh air to this current two man race."
"I see it can be quite irritating with the lights when there are notifications coming in. Looks like the smart phones market is now too overly saturated and companies are starting to play with other parts of the phones like LEDs. It will only be interesting if users can customize the layout of the LEDs, or replaceable LED back covers with different patterns, or maybe aRGB LEDs? I will not buy this phone just for the sake of having LEDs at the back. I mean, how often do I even look at the back of the phone everyday right? I would prefer having the notification LEDs at the sides of the phone rather than at the back of it."
meh
We all know what happened to one plus
"The light flashing bit was neat but those ringtones were the most godawful obnoxious things I've heard, aside from music ringtones."
Gotta give it to Carl for innovation. Everybody else looks exactly the same
"I think instead of coming up cool looking physical features smartphone companies should focus on improving software experience cause in the end it's all that matters. Today companies are trying too hard to stand out in the market and neglecting the most basic feature ""user experience"""
The oneplus slander is appreciated 😌🤣
"What a nice product, I would definitely give it a try if I didn't love my Iphone enough"
ooooooooooo LIGHTSSSSS  (sold)
"Yep sounds familiar, you're talking about the Cincofone from Cinco Mobile. It's a great phone. Over 10 billion purchased."
"The lights does look cool, but who puts their phone facing downward? 
I believe you can do the same design with AOD (always on display)"
What if nothing comes out with a folding phone..that's gonna be cool
It looks exactly like an iPhone
I'm a fan
Do people put their phone screen down?
"Well honestly I would be purchasing a phone this later half of the year and nothing phone came just in time. Its really cool to try and use,"
Nah.
@CHRISTIANMAFIA never. 🔥❤️

"@CHRISTIANMAFIA being right or wrong is meaningless in this, it's a matter of preference and perception and I care not and that's fine."
Ur wrong
The subtle shots fired at OnePlus at the end lol
"Looks aside, is this another reincarnation of the Oxygen OS?"
🤣
Nothing definitely describes the amount of interest I have in this phone.
Imagine putting a back case on the phone. Way to kill the differentiator 😂
Same story like oneplus.... Again a new hyped company that can only last for couple of years .... Same they done to OnePlus
Great notification feature and I hope the software will be great as well great strategy
Damn that ringtone/light flash feature looks and sounds awesome!
"damn bruh i remember your videos from years back. crazy how much you came up from just being professional. amazin, happy for your success bruh!"
"So far, I’m unimpressed. Hopefully, they have killer software. The exterior is a cool design but adds little in terms of new form or function, oft made stealth sealed in a protective case. They’re competing in a crowded market and aren’t bringing much to the table to differentiate themselves on the hardware front."
"Yeah I was a bit underwhelmed with the phone. I can't see myself using the led lights that much, it may also use may also drain the battery. But who knows, time will tell how this phone will do."
💝💝
Apple should have done this on the back of the iPhone with the Apple logo.
Your videos are fantastic
Lol its an iphone from cyberpunk 2077
*looks at OnePlus*
I'm freaking actually loving it
Cyberpunk are coming
This is phone is a geek of all nerd phones
Oneplus first and now its nothing.... Love the alert slider on android and now its notification lights on android
Wht name this phone??????
I am so gonna buy this
lol 😂 no u Aren’t bro
super super interesting video/phone/concept
I would like to know the specs
"The skin tones of your hands is nice.

-Man from internet"
Maybe dark shots would've shown  the light intensity of the LEDs
I almost call it an iPhone 15 🤦🏾‍♂️
Finally some good F**king food
"I only keep my phone on vibrate for calls/notifications. The idea of a phone having a light up back and a bunch of ringtones that sound like a remix of a dail up being connection being ""a feature"" does not make any sense to me."
It will be the most valuable toy phone 😂
But it’s a mid range phone. Why Nothing?
"As an iPhone user, I am very impressed with this design. I hope the software doesn't disappoint b/c that's the main thing android phones are lacking these days"
And then you slap a phone case on it.
"The StockX bidding for one of the first 100 phones off the production line states ""not fully supported in the United States"". I know a vast market is outside the US, but seriously? Hoping this is only for the first batch..."
oneplus was not harmed in this video
Thank you for sharing.  Very interesting.
"I like the design of the phone. Lets not kid ourselves though, notification LED's were killed by AOD."
Just read that this Phone won't be available in the US or Canada....booooo....surprised that was not mentioned in this video.
"2:32 That's so trippy! When the lights flickered like that, my phone got a notification which made it vibrate to the same exact rhythm as the lights."
"The ringtone feature is so cool, reminds me of the alarm+matching vibration iOS has. I'm also wondering can an iPhone 12 case fit the Nothing phone?"
"@shonole iSheep really do believe the bullshit line:

""wHeN aPpLe dOeS sOmEtHiNg, tHeY dO iT tHe bEsT.""

😂😂😂"
"@TankQ LOL what, Android has had that capability for 10 years."
@Ad!thya iOS does one better. What nothing is doing here. Since iPhone 5 maybe. I like Realme though. GT neo 2.
ok
Android has ringtones and alarms paired with its own vibration patterns for quite a while now. Even my 2020 realme phone does
"I think I dig the lights, generally speaking. Still makes me long for the good old days of my BlackBerry Bold 9900 and my custom led notification settings (but really I just miss that keyboard)."
It just depends on what else does the phone offers me. But I can’t say no! I’ll be down to get one why not!
"""Yeah that's a no for me dawg"" Randy Jackson"
"I actually nothing phone very interesting
Love it phone but specifications and phone camera worthy wait and see"
"""the most impressive part to me is there are ten built in ringtones - they each have a light pattern that lights up to perfectly match the ringtone"" 

man this is kinda cringe - someone has to say it..."
looks like iphone 12
This is dumb af ngl
"While they can be called a ""startup "" carl isn't new to this 
 I guess he actually left oneplus because of oppo strategy to make them extremely boring and expensive, compared to what they used to be"
BRO I SAW THIS TWEET
"I like the shade he threw at the end about ""not appealing to the original fanbase anymore"".

OnePlus really fked up the ball on that one. I hope you can openly talk about that someday Marques."
OnePlus was not hurt during the making of this video....
Utterly silly. 😂
"The way they use the light is neat, but I would put a cover on it and forget about it before the glass breaks. Also, how many people usually put down their phones screen down?"
I have it down alot
I was thinking the same. It seems a little weird to me. Even if there's people who do that I don't believe it's the majority of smartphone owners
90% of the time screen down right here.
It's one kind of Children Toys phone 😂😂
sound familiar? ye.. One +
"While the concept is interesting, I feel like this is going to be another Essential."
Nothing has done something unique 😉
"Meanwhile Asus ROG phone mind voice, ""Am I a joke to you""😂"
"Would love to take selfie in front of Mirror   
It is so different love it"
"Looks more like a kid's toy with funky LEDs rather than being productive, different doesn't mean good."
The notification sounds were horrible
"Cool, so OnePl- I mean Opp- I mean Nothing managed to make an iPhone ripoff with lights."
"hey man, when reviewing the phone later, plz mention the vibration and speaker sounds compare to samsung or iphone. rly the basic small stuff matter for everyday use."
"Nothing to see here











☠️"
skill cant beat the old school nokia
"damn... this makes me wish Apple didn't have such an awesome ecosystem. I love my iPhone, but it is the quintessential ""glass slab with a camera cluster"". Just that battery charge indicator, alone, makes me want this!"
Nothing has everything.
I've been looking for a decent alternative to Samsung.   I hope this one makes for good competition.
"@franz no, My first smartphone was a very early Android and it was terriblely unreliable so I switched and then I had an iPhone for quite some time.   I wanted more freedom to side-load apps, change the theme, have expandable storage (which is slowly being taken away).   and as a Windows and Linux user, I hated iTunes.  It never seemed to work properly for me.   So it was a matter of filling the needs and wants I had.  If Apple would become a more open system I would consider switching back.  But until then Android seems to be the option most suited."
it's either you just hate apple for no reason or you're an android fan who would choose anything over iphone.
this guy is now a paid advertisement for whoever pays his asking rate...he does a good commercial...but he lost his true self at this point...so sad to see. use to be so genuine. now just praises whoever pays him. i bet he does hit pieces too now if a competitor paid him.
Look like ii was made for cyberpunk
The knife throw at OnePlus. Loved it mkbhd.
The nothing phone = trash phone
"2.5 million views in 12 hours? That's a lot of hype. I'm all for the cyberpunk esthetic but it all will depend on the specs. If I buy a new phone it will have to be better than my current, which right now is the Pixel 6."
"every new phone manufacturer: lets start differently from the others
after a decade of existince: lets copy brand a the design is appealing to customers.

OnePlus, LG, Samsung"
That dig on OnePlus though 😂
Sounds familiar? * Sad OnePlus fan noises *
Shots at OnePlus and I totally agree 👍
"Looks pretty interesting.
At the very least judging by OnePlus's track record, we can probably expect the first couple years of products to be great, before they devolve."
"Their products have already devolved, from the first step lol."
Sound Familiar lol Oneplus 😂😂👌
I wonder how those leds will affect battery life. Very sick though
"ok who owns Nothing because all the comments are praising it and this thing is fuckin stupid

how much did they pay you marques"
Waiting for iPhone to copy that and the legendary line comes out - its only available on iPhone - Steve j
"I'll tell ya what. it's been so boring lately with alot of the current smartphones out there. They all look generic. Big camera setup on the back and plain back.

However, Nothing is very unique and I quite like it. And actually new functionality that's refreshing. I've always been a die-hard fan of the Pixel phones. However they've just lost their way I feel

Might actually switch to nothing. it just depends now on UI Design and Camera quality, as well as other features it may have and the chipset. 

Definitely a contender tho I feel, for people who want a little more uniqueness, than a boring Iphone or Android."
"Nothing about this impresses me......cool, a clear back. The light having different functions is a straight gimmick. Either a phone is in a pocket away or you always have your phone facing down to. The wiggle to see charging status is the only practical thing I see. A promo phone to show people that a phone has lights on it. Its iPhone XR with a whole punch and thick bezels."
"I mean it looks cool, but i ain’t switching from my I-Phone for this."
"How many likes for Naruto 👍🏻, Naruto op 🔥"
How many ppl use phone cases tho
4:44 a bumper only case would be better
Imaging how those arclic back will be scratched on the desktop ... eww
That phone is nothing. Well kinda looks like iPhone 12 tbh📲
Has a very tron like feel
6:33 songs familiar... Nice punch at the end to one plus 🤣
Were you talking about Oneplus on the last part of the video?
Why this video is not trending?? @youtube
Because its a cloned iphone
iPhone 12 with iPhone x camera setup
👍❤️
Circus
Gimmick
What is the name of the company?
This phone looks like a gaming pc lmao
damn looks like a Tron phone
This is a phone for clowns 🤡
Yup who would buy this when they can just get a real iPhone
Sir lights on back side will be same for both limited edition and normal edition?
i want nothing so bad
shots fired at oneplus and poco
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️....
"The design looks really cool. If it now also delivers on performance, price, camera and general usability it would be a real option. I wonder if people would mod their iPhones to look somewhat like this as well"
No point to “mod” a IPhone they clearly copied apple even made a knock off apple logo on the back
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️....
"Phone nowadays are judged mainly on their camera capabilites and battery life. If their phone have subpar qualities on both of this criterias, then definitely it will not succeed to the mass market. It will be just a another niche phone for specific people."
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️....
Im not  impressed. Its is just a wannabe apple without the real benefits.
Exactly they even made a fake apple logo on the back of it
"I wanna buy it, just so they keep making them, this is so cool, and I love the idea of transparent tech. that colorful plastic imac still has a special place in my heart."

"@Rxiya x♡o talking about cloned , iphone will clone type c , foldable screen , and aod that already exist since 2016 in android  ... I valued innovative things not hype useless things so i use android"
"@Rxiya x♡o ios is like a kindergarden level of software so childish, i am an expert user need cuatomization.. cheap car boasting fun to drive , rolls royce boasting customization .. i doesnt want the phone i buy to tell me what to do  , so i use android"
@Iron Man literally android cant even come with a basic 128GB of storage paying all that money with cheap batteries and poor security
Apple should REALLY adopt a better asthetic with these boring iPhones every year. Rounded corners are boring. For the price tag it's just not worth it to keep buying the same boring design

"In the end, customers will prefer a reliable phone. iPhone is famous primary because of this. It's ecosystem is the secondary reason for its fan following.

Nothing should have its primary focus on software reliability."
Ah OnePlus...good times...
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️..
"since the OnePlus starts to cater to the mainstream, i think they're retrying the ""never settle"" again with this brand lol.
wonder if it'll end up the same way"
How is the software.. Os..
@Marques Brownlee:  You're very good at this!  Nicely done.
I hope their ui keeps up with the outside looks because honestly I have the nothing earbuds and AirPods Pro. They’re reasonably comparable so I HOPE same can be said about this phone.
Cool gimmick that added on to Nothing.
"The market needs a slim large display unit. Say about 8 "". Online videos can be streamed wirelessly from your phone onto this display kept nearby.  It can also function as a data input terminal.
Goodbye eyestrain and squinting.. and the need to carry around large display phones. Any comments ?"
"Love different things, this is one of them ♥️🫶 all support"
Shots fired to OnePlus!!
It's false advertising there's definitely something there.
I will get that phone when it comes out.
he showed us the front of the phone lol
Once again the hardware can be cool and innovative but the software and eco systems will keep me with that brand.
"Looks cool, glad to have something new on the table I would say"
Always on display is way more useful.
That took me back to when everyone would have their different Nokia cases that would light up. I like it a lot. As someone who has no favor of phones. This is up my alley to be honest.
Looks like you got Sharged.
when iphone and oppo make babies
"Cyaaaa iphone, next one will DEF be this."
I am gonna buy this... ❤️
"You don’t see the strategy is to get a partnership with Apple in designing their next phone if they aren’t in bed already, either they don’t know, don’t show or don’t care"
this is the phone that you don't need a case
"'What I CAN show you... Is the BACK of the Phone.'

>Shows the front of the Phone a few times"
Sheer stupidity
Imagine if it comes in black
I want
Ugly phond
"When we get a phone like Framework laptops, with their philosophy and quality. .. Then everything's gonna change, and I will be switching as fast as I could. .. Meanwhile 🤷 my $230, 256gbRom with SD capability and 8gbRam Poco m4 Pro. .. Does everything I need"
Marques just had a glimpse at the future One+ 😳😅
Like how we threw some shade to OnePlus phones at the end there.
"I love the look of that phone, all I'm thinking is about it's cases😂, I mean make strong more durable so case is not a need cz it's beautiful"
"US : so what the price of this beast?

Carl Pei : it's a changing game... It's Nothing 🙂"
Bumper case is back. We can leave our phone face down
"I'd definitely put a case on it, but I hope that dbrand comes out with a clear back grip case..."
It’s kinda cool looking… but OMG IS THAT A G3 POWERBOOK PISMO BEHIND YOU!? I haven’t seen one of those in many moons.
"""Sound familiar"" Oh god yes. Painfully so. Not even just in the smart phone industry either. But oh how I miss my note 3 / druid 3 / env 3."
"If it comes in black, its an easy buy. reminds me of tron legacy."
So basically its an iphone like looking phone with and Android heart...i m sure carl wont want to go the one plus way....if he really wants to stay in the market for long !!
"So its basically what every other chinese company does, copy Apple and sell it as innovative? It looks good, but for the price itll probably come out at id rather just buy an iphone..."
"Pass for me, I'll be interested if it came with a google play edition (pure stock android version) otherwise nahh.."
I love that Oneplus  jab lol
the useless phone
"4:00 
Do the speaker test without doing the speaker test."
"Nice vedio, But, Are you being briefed by Nothing company not to go on other side of the phone."
"Yeah, OnePlus did that familiar thing you're talking about."
The fact that the hands on video consisted of ONLY the lights scares me for this product
The different notifications lights on the back look like a great idea for deaf people.
Someone please let me know what would be the price...
Will this phone be an Android phone?
"Very cool phone, I thought it was a custom iPhone. I want to know, if a manufacturer can customize the iPhone and sell it, will it involve infringement of Apple's patent protection rights? But I think it must be a cool thing for someone to do it and sell it."
2:53 I'd like to see you wiggle wiggle 🎶 for sure
that is one ugly gyph pattern. chinese is all about gimmick and quick cash and move on.
"Dang, this phone is wildly impressive. Super creative, and honestly separated themselves far beyond their competition in my book. I have an iphone, but I could totally see myself getting one of these."
"You must be kidding -- are some tacky LEDs on a phone all it takes for you to be ""wildly impressed""? Because I can find you multiple flip phones and Nokias from 15-20 years ago that did LED notifications better than this lame thing."
"This is clearly a flop waiting to happen. The ""Nothing Ear 1"" earbuds sucked. They looked cool, and that was it. People are such suckers for hype."
Back light blinking along with ringtone reminds me of an old Nokia keypad phone.
I think they took the iphone 12 as their inspiration . It almost looks as an iphone 12 magnets (magsafe magnets) visible
Hahaha dig on OP !!!!
"I am not an Android guy, but damn this is a very interesting phone. Even with the simple approach they have made something unique and different. A real differentiator. I just don't want to be the product."
"The LED lights on the back are a cool gimmick but the info isn't anything you can't get with Caller ID or just double tapping the screen to turn on the display for a second. If Nothing follows in their OnePlus predecessor's footsteps then I don't care about whatever gimmicks they add because they'll do some horrendous things Android to ruin background apps.

Software is way more important these days than what is just a fancy notification LED"
would get it for those ring tone light patterns
6:05 🤣
Bro that leds flickering looks like a sick edit you’ve done in After effects wow
Looks like a gimmick. The lit up back for “ringtones” looks cool but I usually keep my phone in my pocket if I’m not using it
man this is cool. Apple is just such a tech giant and a phone monster. I wish things like this took over
Hmmm how are phone cases going to work?
if the camera is good this phone gonna be hit
Finally AAA Android iphone 😂😂
Wow do we really moved from hardware only reviews to partial hardware??
"MKBHD looks like one of the Nothing investor🤔🤔🤔, i don't accept light feature makes different in phone"
It's very good and very futuristic like 2049 and so on its ahead of time
I need more transparent phones
Why he not show the spec? camera?lol
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
"What a bad phone. 2 cameras in a 3 camera price point, I'm talking about no optical zoom"
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
Guess you better like clear cases
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
🤷🏻‍♂
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
"That thing is cool as hell. I'd want it to come with a ""ringtone editor"" app that lets you create custom LED patterns, similar to a video/audio editor where you have a timeline with separate ""tracks"" for each LED."
"I dont like the back -> 1. I will need a transparent case probably, which i dont like 2. no need for notification-leds that make me more attached/addicted to the phone"
copypasta comments everywhere
just waste of battery
Reminds me of Nokia 1100
you should join their discord server. they do listen to the users and that's the place to do so mostly.
i foresee flare when using the LED lights at the back for photography or videography
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
Bruh really said you can tell who's calling just by looking at notification lights 💀
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
It looks like a ripoff of the iPhone 12

If it is Android it will never be cool enough!
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
"I am 100% buying this phone. The best phone I ever owned was my Essential PH-1, I ended up buying two of them after I took the first one swimming. I realise that buying a phone form a startup is a gamble, but there a certain amount of ""soul"" found in these first attempt phones that you don't see from the bigger brands.
Edit: Nevermind. I guess it isn't coming to the US 😔"

👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
RIP for case manufacturers!
"I’m so disappointed in the state of the mobile phone industry. Literally the only new “innovations” being made here is the gimmick lights and clear back design. We literally know next to nothing about how the phone actually performs, and can’t expect anything more than standard android experience, but people are still excited by it.

Imagine praising a new generation of console gaming experience, where the only difference is now you have gimmick lights on your PS3 and clear case design on it or something."
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
I imagine that there will be a dbrand skin that will go along with its light like in PS5
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
In seeing pictures of this phone I literally though it was a custom iPhone 11. That’s how similar the body was.
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️...
The light patern ringtones is GREAT for deaf people and blind people who still got light perception !
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️....
Looks like crazy modded iPhone 12. ;) Nothing special.
Looks futuristic.
Do I see a PowerBook behind you? That’d make a cool video to see!
Hang on... Do people put their phones face down?
"Aside from the LED at the back, I love how its bezels around the screen is uniform, much like the ones we see on iPhones. The only other company I've seen to do this neatly is Samsung with their S22 lineup. So kudos to them!"
A fiber optic upgrade to their phone cases! Why waste the power and who wants a clear case?
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️....
I hate this. I put my phone upside down for a reason! My opinion.
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway🎁🎁❤️....
I'd switch to this if was $10 or less maybe. Otherwise why? Every smartphone does the same thing so stick with who you've been with.
Nothing is pretty nice.
Lol.   ( 1+ )    2.0
You can tell is a basic phone bc he only showed the lights
Cant wait to see the notification functionality on an iPhone in 10 years.
I loved the 1 plus sneak diss lol
You would never catch me with my phone face down on a surface.
"Dang, Nothing is more bold at ripping off Apple's external design than Samsung."
I have never commented on any phone review. I’m a iPhone user but wow I really like this phone. So much potential.
I wouldn’t use those ringtones it would scare me and everyone around
"If internals can rival flagship android, I would switch"
"This phone is super fucking cool, if they still exist when I'm looking to buy my next phone I might have to pick one up."
"the lights are just an attention grabber. now they only need to deliver a working phone with clean OS and regular software update for a long time for this to be a thing. imo, hardware only attracts people to buy it. software is what makes people keep using it."
"Agreed that the nothing phone 1 ""looks"" different, but how does it ""feel"" though???👀"
Lol what a way to take on Android devices like Samsung/OnePlus/Google Pixel and iPhone. Back looks like iPhone and front like many androids. Both fused into one. Haha.
I might buy this in the future. Looking forward to the actual review
"until someone looks at the back of the phone, this is pretty much an iphone from the side, and similar to many androids from the top , and barely stands out. The back is cool but it cant single headedly be the USP of the phone. what they do with the rest of the phone will be the real deal."
"Dunno. I'll be honest as someone who rarely pay attention to my notifications, and someone whose phone has been silent since purchase this is kinda useless for me.
That said, the idea is cool enough"
What is the screen size of this nothing phone 1
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway❤️..
Looks like an 2 year old iPhone 😬
"question is, are they going to launch it on markets like India, China, and Indonesia?

in war, you need a staging ground before an actual invasion assault..
I mean, if they want to take on Apple, they should start on where Apple presence is ""weaker"" first and build a staging ground on those market.. there's no point doing a paradrop on strong Apple markets without their own established market on other regions to support their company's continuity.. if they only sell em on EU and US, their adoption rate will not be high and probably disappear like Essential Phone

while they're just a startup company, Xiaomi is no different when they started out with their MiUI theme app.. but Xiaomi targeted the right market first when they build their phones before expanding worldwide and into other stuffs like TV and Vacuum Cleaner.."
I hope the white accents doesnt go yellowish overtime like most plastic based materials
I just appreciate someone trying something new honestly.
love the look but love the ringtone even more. holy shit. they sound futuristic
Looks like a Star Wars tech.
"Lights, sounds, colors, trims, cool, etc… But No one, including you, spends Any time on the Real Differentiator…….. the OS.   Ease of Use, Productivity & total Information Security?  Google has brainwashed all reviewers into chasing “shiny objects.”  Great job Alphabet!"
That phone looks just like every other single phone…..
wish the leds were RGB to add just a tad more customization
"Ctrl C
Ctrl V"
"Personally, NOT INTERESTING !!"
"The amount of effort they've put into what looks like a gimmicky feature, is really impressive. I like how they're trying to tell us that there's more to phones than the usual boringly repetitive designs we get on an average smartphone these days. 
Its fine if it looks like an iPhone, after all, aren't many competitors making brick-sided phones these days? What's so wrong with them joining in on the bandwagon. I'm just hoping they as well focus on the more important parts of the phone like cameras, battery, and the software than just depending on those extra features (which nobody really needs) to pave their way into the industry."
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway❤️.
6:32. Yeah it sounds familiar. Oneplus did this to their fans.
"If they add colour, up the resolution to like 400 led colour clusters per inch, maybe making them out of organic light emitting diodes I could really see this concept taking off. Imagine being able to watch videos and games on this!

No seriously.. I don't really care what the back of my phone looks like as long as it doesn't slide off my desk. I don't need to decode some glyph to see who is calling, it says so on the screen."
Why do we need notification lights when we have OLED screens?
"Reminds me of the Essential phone. I bought The Essential Phone but the signal was total CRAP on T-Mobile whereas my other Android phones worked just fine on T-Mobiles then limited LTE network. SO,  not buying The Nothing Phone until Youtube reviewers publish signal data. Oh and NOTHING is a really stupid name."
No links to any Chinese phone brands? Just checking.
It looks like one of those weird cheap iPhone clones on Amazon
6:24 that hit me as a long time oneplus user ;(
"It's nice but and pretty but in reality i never put my phone face down... So it's a pass for me
Also, just an other android phone, maybe one day we get something different than android/ios"
"The transparent phone reminds me of 90s tech like CD players and N64, gameboys"
Awesome storm trooper phone you got there marques
Has a very tech look but hopefully the phone performs well as it looks
“Sound familiar?” Master class on PC shade 🔥
"lol another Apple copy with bunch of childish accessories for kids, and probably android inside. No thank you, but good luck."
😂feeling threatened or something
this phone is for me 100%.
"Omg, this is horrible. 😰 This phone looks like an iPhone on the back, looks like a cheap android on the front, and it runs on god only knows what patched version of Android. So… The only “new” thing would be the lights on the back?"
Gimmicky trash. An led phone case does the same thing
Makes me think of Tron and futuristic stuff
sounds familiar? shots fired :D
"Great name!  So when my wife asks me what I bought today, I can tell her ""nothing"", and that would not be a lie.  ;-)"
Even if people like to buy cases which in Inida people do there are these see through cases which will help keep the phone safe and also show the phones unique design
What's special about it? NOTHING
You said that you could only show the back… but you showed the front..
"I like the aesthetics and I wish them all the best. But after getting burned with Essential, I’m just going to see how people receive. 

One things for sure, the only way it’ll succeed is if it either has a carrier deal or is affordable. Otherwise it is DOA."
"That phone might be very well good for me, cause I'm always missing calls. I always have my phone on mute or vibration, I use a Mi Band and a Poco and we know how bad MiUI software kills background tasks. Looking forward to seeing a full review of the battery, camera and performance."
Meh 🤷🏻‍♂️
"I have the option to use the flasg LED for notifications, but don't like it. It always feels like I'm taking pictures if random people when I'm out 😅"
If it’s cheaper than and as good as an iPhone I’m taking it
"Looks like an ad, but I don’t like the looks, seems like a toy"
"Interesting but the light that comes on while recording? Not so great, except you can turn it off and on"
This would make for a great phone case 😂 which is what I thought it was when you posted the pic on IG
If it can runApple IOS and it comes with a clear OTTER box then Nothing will have my business.
Nokia de lucecitas con esteroides 💪
Was that a dig at 1+ at the end there? Love it 😂
"The phone Marques was saying was The Life of Oneplus right now 
😥"
"I do like the form factor and design. If its camera is a as good as a Pixel camera, I might be compelled to get it to replace my Pixel 5. Up to now I always stayed with Google phones. The only time I was near to get a phone from a different company was with the Essential phone, but the camera was a sidegrade from my Nexus 6P at the time."
I think Apple iPhone will be copy notification Led only difference between Apple logos will be use for notification
"I like the glyph, but my habitat is dirty so the screen be not touching surface. If transparent screens become mainstream, would love to see that again on the frontside."
"This is one of those products that gets points for trying to be different and build its own character but isn't very pretty and attractive. The back of the phone isn't very harmonious, it's a bunch of shapes thrown together, so having it be transparent and seeing those parts that are primarily like this for practical reasons is kind of unnecessary, you know? I'm all for personality and character but we hide electronics and internals because they aren't meant to look a certain way, it's all practical.
Now granted there is an effort here to make it presentable but would you really want this as your phone over what you have right now design-wise? I don't think many people will go get this because of its looks. Just screws, notches and clearly indicated areas for parts on the back, looks forced.

On top of that, why are the LED's so buffed? A stronger and bigger light has more use cases I guess but if you want them just for notifications aren't they a bit too much? A scenario keeps popping up in my head, that of being in a movie theatre and keeping notifications on because you want to and the light being too distracting to you or others. I saw the options to lower its strength but those are still a lot of lights.

Design-wise I think it's definitely ugly, sorry. I don't get the company's direction of having devices be transparent but not clean. Some people apparently like what they're doing, so good for them. I don't get it since the company could really hammer it in and go bonkers with the concept but right now it's an awkward mix of trying to be different but also the same, with an ugly result that appeals to neither.

And yeah I don't like the ringtones either. Pretty much all of them are obnoxious and ""sting"". Weird direction."
"""im sure we get a clear case coming from nothing""?

get it? CLEAR case from NOTHTING?
👁️👁️"
Is it durable enough not to have any protective case? The obly possible option are clear cases for now.
"Ive seen lots of begging, but begging to apple for these features? Maybe in 2038 we will get an iphone 267 wich has these features. But andriod will do it in maximum 3 years"
sound familiar....onep**s. RIP
impressive
"Depending on the specs, I DO want one !"
if the software is better than Pixel well bye bye GOOGLE and SAMSUNG.
1+
"the flashing ""feature"" reminds me of antenna that flashes on your flip phone in the 90s"
This could be really helpful to people with hearing loss
Isn't that draining more battery
The sound design on those ringtones are giving me a huge dopamine kick
Just moving the paint from the glass inside 😂
love those led lights hehe
"I’m curious what else this phone has to offer, cuz only those LEDs are not that special. Who would want that and why anyway? Those lights are just battery consuming. Personally, I clearly don’t need them."
No. Adds to existing  tech waste and polutution.
its seems very interesting but from here I can see a lawsuit from Apple on patent infringement
It’s launching on my birthday!!!!😊😊😊
"Haha love the shade thrown at Oneplus and Carl Pei. If this phone is remotely decent, better get it in the first few iterations before Carl becomes drunk on success again. Although at least this time it isn't being marketed as a flagship killer, so the price won't be an outright betrayal of its original concept."
"Why does this actually look like my dream phone 
Looks like iPhone on the back and android on the front"
No head phone jack = dead on arrival
Why would you not want the charging LED to be on all the time when charging? I'd love to just leave it on the table and have an always-on reading of its charge. I can't imagine its power draw would be very significant.
Too bad it isn't coming to NA :-(
I'm buying that phone. Just because it's different.
Sounds familiar? One plus be like ...I know what you doin there man 😭😭
"This phone is actually genius.  Think about it, its feature set is so physical as to give you as much information as you need without wasting screen time."
"Assuming he is talking about using the same strategy as OnePlus there at the end? (especially given Carl Pei etc)

Bit of a deep cut for your avg audience to make that connection tho?"
The ringtone stuff is ASMR!
"I mean... with an always on display can't they just have dot pop on the screen as the ""LED notification""?"
It looks like it's from TRON! Very cool!
I would definitely buy that!
I want this phone... Now!!!
I bet that wiggle to light up when charging will be going off all the time on transport.
Damn the shade thrown at OnePlus at the end tho 😶‍🌫️
I'll be more interested in how the phone cover makers design their covers for this!
It’s a very neat and interesting concept and for those who love to dabble into technology and want something that sets their phone apart from everyone else then yeah this device looks appealing! I wouldn’t consider this an entry level device either! It’s definitely gonna cost some $ in my eyes!! Very neat and interesting though!
Is this the first interesting phone design since Nokia Lumia phones?
That bit at the end was a little too real 😬
This is what pixel should have been
I have been an iphone user since the iphone4 and im pretty interested in this one. I dont know why but its speaking to me!
I actually like how it looks very much! But I'm stuck in the Apple eco system...
That's the coolest looking phone I have ever seen.
"6:23
Shots fired."
We don’t see it because it’s unnecessary. Simple as that. Gimmicky.
Helo sir i am from pakistan
no evil cell phone for me i am done with them !!!
This phone looks amazing
Never heard of that idea you spoke of..... My OnePlus 7T in the drawer made a beep when you said that tho 😂😭
Nothing special phone
There is someone coming to beat iphone. But its definitely not  nothing
Back in the days we could get LED sticker to place behind Nokia mobiles which would light up on ringtones
"While this phone looks cool, I worry about it's functionality once in a protective case. I'm one of those people that always puts a case on my phone, I do not want an expensive device to get shattered by accident. So I wonder how those LEDs would work with a case..."
What a smooth landing on OnePlus at the end😂😂😂
Dig at OnePlus 🤫
They just put some LED lights on the back of the phone wow 😂
"I fucking love it
Idc if it looks like a transparent iPhone, as he said, thats dope in itself. This is what i want. Exactly."
"Personally, it looks like pretty much any other phone to me. It isn't ""naked"" enough to be cool, nor does it have an aesthetically pleasing design.
The lights in the back and its features are interesting, though, and I feel like other phone companies may ""take inspiration"" from it."
"That hint to OnePlus at the end may be more significant than we think. The starter of nothing was a starter of OnePlus so they may just become another flagship maker.

But then again nothing isn't owned by a company that also owns 2 different flagship makers soo."
here's hoping this is a 350 USD flagship killer like the Oneplus One
and flagship killers come with good price/performance in the first iterations. remember one plus one...two
Nice but the offset hole punch looks crap
Will this be one plus all over again?
"I think this phone is gorgeous, at first i thought it looks like an iphone with a clear back, but then when he showed off the features i was pleasantly surprised, this is something different and gets me excited again about phones! He is right, they ALL look the same, but Nothing tries to do something else and i think this concept might work! I will buy 1 i think when they do come out, just to support them and to have a cool phone at the same time as well!"
Meanwhile I’m still waiting for reverse charging in iPhones.
Cool iPhone
Abandon loyal fans...... ONEPLUS comes to mind
Bring back the notification light😡
Wish more companies did that dope led stuff
"I just hope the size is the same as iphone 12. Most of the Android phones now is the same screen size that's looks boring. So hard to find a smaller one handed friendly phone like pixel 5, 4a... I can only name these 2 coz there simply isn't many these days."
No one is going to buy this crap. Useless gimmick.
did marques just just spoiled the front of the phone? i looks so good with those even bezels upfront!
"The nothing buds were insanely similar but I said nothing (ironic). But this phone is a straight up copy. Unlike the buds you can't even play it off, throw on a notch and a cube around the cameras and also paint the back (which, unlike the buds, is ugly) and it's a 2 year old iphone."
Maybe it’s just me but I’ve never been like  oh let me put my phone down on a table with the screen down so it can get scratched up…
the leds are an innovative and beautiful idea but imagine if they were colored
"""Shut up and take my money now!"" 💵"
Interesting i'm waiting for this phone ...
"If they'd gone RGB on the back LED array, that would have been more impressive."
"I love the design! However, it seems like all the innovation is on the back of the phone. The only times I want my phone turned on it’s back is when I don’t want to be distracted by notifications. All the those lights at the back defeat that purpose. Most of those functionalities could be achieved by just turning your screen into a minimalistic notifications center - light up a small part of the screen when you have a notification while the rest of the screen stays off. Granted that would work for OLED screens only."
@Ankit it is
"When u don't want to get distracted by notification u turn on DND ... How come ur not distracted by the sound or vibration. If u turn on DND those led lights, sound or vibration anything won't go off. I don't know but ur comment seems dumb to me"
Wait for the phone to launch. Who knows what all surprises are ahead.
"the ""inovation"" is redundant when 99% of smarpthone users use cases. as for a clear case, 1 out of 4 people might use one, a ton might try, but then will go back to using a real case. all this is fact based off 15 years of smartphone user behavour."
Agree with all that. I had an old Samsung that did it well with notification lights around the side edges.
The analog synth sounding ringtones are so fresh!
"if tmobile carry it, ill try it"
Change the ringtone so you know who’s calling by the light pattern…. Or just leave your phone face up and read it….
I wonder how 1+ felt about that jab 😆
"This makes the whole smart phone industry look sad. When we get excited that there is leds on the back of a phone, all it does is highlights how stagnant the industry has become with innovation."
I just checked the price.  $2600.  No thanks.
"I always use rugged cases, hope they do a case with just the leds lines and also we need RGB sorry..."
"which phone is he talking about when he said: ""sound familiar?"" ?????"
"Just another iPhone wannabe. 
Oh, China."
lol that Oneplus reference was great
The one plus attack
សួស្ដី​
I still just want a modern sidekick phone that isn't midtier spec'd at best.
Interesting to see the phone next to 3 BBK phones.  🤔🤔🤔
"Haha... Taking a jab at One+ 🤪😁
I guess big part of their success or failure will hinge on the price. Not many people will buy it if it's gonna be in the flagship price range.
And the Individualised light patterns will probably be more confusing then helpful; kind of a more is less kinda thing.
Also being to different might prove to be boring in the end because due to it's transparent back with lights, you'll only be able to have it as is or with a clear case which won't change the look at all. So the current boring phones will actually have more customisation options starting with the different colours then lots of case options or custom skins..."
The one thing that kinda kills this phone's design for me is the fact that the front bezel is black instead of white. And if it also had an under-display camera on top of that it would be the most futuristic phone to ever release tbh.
"Also the cameras are black 



(just kidding lol)"
"Oh god I hate the wiggle thing, that'll scratch the screen"
I love how the original creator of OnePlus hasnt lost his spirit to create and engineer new products. Hope he keep Nothing in his hands this time
I would really like to know what the user interface look's like and how user friendly it is.
"Hey guys, MKBHD here, today I'm doing a video on nothing. *video ends*"
If there is a fingerprint sensor on the front I am sold
"What a bunch of stupid sounding ringtones and overly hyperactive leds.
The transparency is not for me either. Or the white.
Is the rest of the phone even worth talking about? Since you didn't mention any specs..."
👎
“I can’t show you the front.” *Proceeds to show front
"Very cool looking phone, I’d definitely consider it if I didn’t just switch to the iPhone."
so now i can't put my phone face down at work so i don't get distracted
i need this phone
"You have to wiggle the phone to see how far it's charged? A more elegant solution would be to hover / hold your hand above it, then it shows the charging level."
Gamer phone
"We live in an age

- Marques Brownlee"
Really great to see this level of fun innovation 👍
Main screen OLED display can do all these and better.
"From glimpses of renders that's been going around, I knew this was going to be something different....can't wait for the next full review."
This 🔥🔥🔥
"I liked it, until i saw Android on it and that is something i really don't like. We really need something more then just a slick design and led's and that's a whole new, privacy related, OS on our mobile phones. Which is really open source and ready to make it or brick it. Because Apple is going full on AI related shit which is nothing more then a full time scanner on OUR phones which tries to seek for any suspicious activity. Because their AI already is scanning our photos. And Android is nothing more then Googles (also AI scanner) profiler and ad marketing plug which nest itself deeply in our lives."
I think this is impressive!
That light thing is actually quite impressive.
take my money....
"On that last bit, they really have settled. RIP OnePlus"
I've obsessed over the Pixel 5 having symmetrical bezels as most phones last year always had a thicker chin but damn this one is sexy af.
Lookslike iPhone but with Androind inside. Hahah
Soon to be another Oppo brand
Ringtone links ?
reminds me of the nokia 3220 xD
"If only they could include a feature to make the phone cost the same as its name, I would definitely buy it!🤣"
Could those flashing lights trigger seizures for folks nearby? 😳
Maybe a dbrand skin with the lights
Dope.
"While admittedly a very cool design quirk, it's not gonna be enough. At the end of the day it really boils down to how much value it will be, so its pricing. Look at Sony. There's no such thing as a bad product, just bad pricing."
"I think it is definitely a phone that would become a talking point when someone sees it's features in action. Much like the ZFlip3 or the Fold, people don't see it everyday so when a feature like that is shown it will draw a crowd and gain attention that way."
If the back LED got RGB other than just white~
Bisa aja nyindir oneplus nya :)
"$2,651 yowsers"
i only want it for the ringtones lol
"aside from performance, can't wait to see the tear down and drop test"
It’s a gimmick. It will fail.
Lights with ringtones .. remind me of Nokia 3220 ...
Fin.
Shots fired at Carl pei. I agree with that analysis tho
When you started talking about “more broadly speaking phone and then more broadly appealing phone” I got flash backs of the one plus days 🥲
"I was excited for a minute when you said “their own eco system” and showed the light app. I thought they were trying to introduce a new operating system into the market which had me hungry for an alternative to apple or android. But, after looking it up….nope…just another android phone that’s had flashing lights added. Nvm."
Nobody will buy different OS phone
Really looking forward to this one. The notification LED is the one thing I miss the most from older smartphones... This one just takes it to another level
You can activate notifications to use camera or flash around screen. On Samsung anyway
I mean Sony phones still have them so it's not really gone.
"You could get a phone case that does this. Why migrate to an entirely new ecosystem for some dumb transparent phone? I can understand headphones, but a phone is so much more and requires PC or Mac compatibility and other devices for convenience."
Just so you know there's no way there is 900 LEDs on the back of that thing. 2:00
"You either die a hero , or live long enough to see yourself become the villan 😎"
"Great review as always. BUT why I need 1000s of LEDs to tell me that someone is calling me? From a UX point of view, a notification on the front screen telling me who is calling me is much more useful. That's why we have notifications that give us context...."
"If it’s under $800 NZ dollars (so $500us dollars roughly) then I would switch from my iPhone SE 2020. It’s good to have another non Asian branded garbage/spyware in the market. We need more western made phone like iPhones, Google pixel and now this company!"
This has flop written all over it lol...if juggernaut Google can only muster a 3% market share then I doubt this company will do anything
oh imiss my Xperia U before
It looks like a prop from a Black Mirror episode tbh
thank you for pronouncing Naruto correctly!
"This is the best first embargo video! They don't just show the back in one video! There are actual technical and interesting features at the back! In excited to see how this company will go, it has an interesting screen despite less screen time.

It looks like an Android version of an iPhone, full screen, punch hole front camera, and squared off edges, I want to see a pro version of this phone...

P.S. you could've said at the beginning ""This... is Nothing..."""
"a mix between iPhone and Android. I hope it delivers and provides more unique features, and do it well."
Processor 🤔
"I mean looks like an iPhone with a skin or case, not exactly unique

The LEDs on the back...who actually rests their phone screen side down? I also have an always on display that shows me notifications. This is so obnoxious for no reason lmao"
Neat LED light show. But it looks too much like an iPhone 13 max. Wish they took even MORE liberties to make it look unique.
All I care about is if it has micro SD support
epileptic: kms
I mean. If it's got stock android. Count me as a customer
The stormtrooper phone
6:32 *oneplus left the chat*
Hahaha he was taking a piss at OnePlus at the end
thought it was an iphone 11 case
Subtle jib on OnePlus 😂😂😂
These damaged street lights would consume lot of battery.  Isn't it !!
The phone's value is...
"If I weren’t invested in the Apple ecosystem, I would legitimately probably buy this."
Love phone
"The OS and Camera need to be REALLY good, otherwise this phone is all for nothing."
I am kind of in love already 😅
Looks Like It Fell off The Millennium Falcon or An Astronaut dropped his phone.
Hmm so it looks  like  an iPhone 12
Such a stupid phone.
"Those ringtones are impressive, very interesting that you can customise."
WOW. That's a brilliant design.
90s vibes. Love it.
RIP Essential
In sha allah I'll buy this phone 🤳
Imma big fan of the Nothing Phone (1) this would make me go back to Android if the cameras are good and the screen is amazing 😍
It's a very interesting design. But what keeps me away from new start up companies. It's the lack of updates and the years you get them for. On the other hand Samsung and Apple are getting better and better.
I love it
"I should agree this backdoor's phone kinda looks like iphone 12 and i mistook it when the the first time glimpse into the thumbnail. But really interesting new approach, now days phone's company indeed try to distinguish their phone through the backdoor design and its sell off well too"
Where’s it made?
Lol
"If this phone worked with Apple Watch, AirPods, and Apple ID I would definitely switch"
The nothing phone that looks just like an iPhone but just different. This is pure gimmick and nothing materially different. The whole shape and look of the phone screams iPhone copy and no matter how many little gimmicky features it has it will just look like an iPhone wannabe
That's pretty cool
"The ear1 had a great design but ultimately they were a disappointment. Right bud lost its charge while in the case. Sound wasn’t good. Noice cancelling was not strong. 

Like the back of the phone. Hope they actually can pull off something new. But in the end of the day, Apple is not all design. It’s quality too and quality is hard to pull off!"
This is dope! Curious about the reviews
I want to see performance -_-
"I’m shocked you didn’t mention it just looks like an older iPhone - same frame as an iPhone, same camera as an older iPhone… what’s innovative other than some LEDs on the back?"
I wish the light pattern was more symmetrical.
So this is not a phone for me who leaves my phone facing frontside up. And I hope Nothing is going to include at least 3 screen protectors in the box when the appeal of the phone design is only really applicable when the phone screen is resting on a surface.
Damn .. That OnePlus diss at the end .. love it !
interesting. comes out from sci fi movie. cool.
"It looks really cool, that's for sure!"
is he talking about oneplus? with the last part
Now I have NOTHING to impress you🙃
This really scratches my Cyberpunk enthusiast itch really well
Nothing on price? Data? Specs? Dang!
This is called DANGDUT PHONE
Innovation = gimmick?
Eww more android junk
How much
you had me sold at the notification light
"Doesn't really do much for me looks like every other phone with some lights on it. What we want is removable battery, headphone jack, sd card slot, usb ports, etc. This is an everything phone lol"
I feel like the lights are a pretty cool accessibility feature for the hard of hearing. Like they would be able to distinguish diff ringtones for diff people.
Surely some of the surfaces at the back can be transparent?
"i love those ringtone & led & sound, super cool"
"Stop talking about undisclosed payments, we want the real shit"
Nothing promo lol
"How am I going to secretly record women on the street if it has a recording indicator mu guy
The ringtone flashing lights is going to give somebody a seizure eventually"
"I watch youtube on my TV with big floor speakers. I'm used to the intro being louder than the rest of the video, but damn that ringtone demo section of the video was painfully loud"
6:32  oneplus : 👀👀
excited
Who put their phone face down on the desk?
The last comment hit close to home... Man do I miss early OnePlus
That ending. Ouch
That jab at OnePlus was hilarious lol
"I personally don't care about the body, but if the software is cool? Then you will get my attention. So let's wait till July 12th"
"Cool? Dope? Or im too old?
That light notification, i think nokia 3220 do it better?
Their mission is to beat apple , but hey , try beat samsung first. Im using s22u , but the light show cnt attract me"
The thing is nobody keeps their devices face down....so what's on the back of the device isn't relevant at all. We spend 100% of the time looking at the front display. Its a good tihng Pei left One Plus...because this device is DOA!
"Weird decision though it's not RGB. I think for like the charging indicator it would be cool to color it according the percentage. Plus that would helpful for notifications too. I can imagine I can indentify the application based on it's unique main color, like discord blue vs skype blue."
"Not sure if he was calling anyone out specifically in the outro, but it hit me right in the OnePlus"
"Nothing beats colour, colour the notification"
I like it something different we need that I love to buy that as beautiful something different you know something to change the phone industry need to change and that's a beautiful change right there I like that
This phone reeks gimmick.
The one plus shade was REAL
"It's literally a crap iPhone ripoff with a sick led setup.

Hard pass.

Carl Pei does it again, another year of listening to his ego rants only to under deliver as usual

Shocker"
"The design is cool. The thing i want to see in a phone today is a system UI that not remember Android and have stability and software optimization, i want a thing that i can trust and have for many years, not just gimmics"
The Toy phone kind of real
Ong this phone alrea jus looks dope as hell
"They play on the cool factor and that’s it. The design is cool, you’ll get bored and maybe even annoyed by the leds I guess and end up with the same phone as everyone else at best… I wish it had ACTUAL new features…"
Looks like a dumb gimmick. Can't imagine wanting to leave my phone face down to see whats going on instead of just looking at the screen
"I love the look and the led, reminds me of starwars but I am now confident someone will come out with a case that does the same thing."
Are they reinventing old LCD screen on the back using leds ?
OnePlus 2.0
Hey Marquez whats that power bank in the background at the start?
"Looks good. Give it Google camera, good battery and clean interface and I'm in."
I think I just found a worthy successor to the Samsung S10
iphone copy?
Wbu the rest of the phone though…
I like new phones
That's The Future!©️
Whats the price tag on the box??
Little dig at oneplus lmao
Amazing
"Sounds very much familiar marques...

But *how* is my doubt 🤔🤭"
"That symmetrical bezel is so good, it’s also nice if it supported a 5 to 6 yrs of os update."
I see exactly zero reason to “switch” to this nothing burger.
So is the op10 a good phone or not?
"One thing they do actually better than apple, the phone does not have a notch"
"id get it, to keep the consistency between apple and android devices inside hand and pocket. android unique selling point is past beyond powerful chipset, biggest ram, largest camera sensor. brands need to come up with new strategy, or some distinct features but not niche enough that be able to hook the masses. a close example would be z-flip and alpha/pro camera, one managed to find the stable footing while another isn't."
"I've got nothing against the company, but these are just gimmicks. No pun intended 🤗"
Good video
That's so neat
The shade at one plus 🤭😂
the flashing lights reminds me of the clear backing of the Nokia & the ability to see all lights during a message.  I freakin love it.  can't wait for the full breakdown
If nothing can keep on time updates and actually have strong support on the device I think this is a winner in my book. Remember what happened with nextbit and the robin phone? Killed it after releasing the nextbit robin 2. Let’s hope that’s not the case with nothing.
Get👏Me👏That👏Naruto👏Phone👏Now👏!!
iPhone 12 rip imo
I miss 7 minutes ago when I didn't waste my time watching this.
"As neat as the lighting is, most people, including myself, use a cover and will never see it. We don't want our phones breaking if we drop them, and accidents DO happen."
nothing ear 1s were kinda shit though
That OnePlus pun though!
Iphone x Off-White
Had I the money I would buy it
"It's really very cool, and the glyph system is doing a lot more than I expected, but instead of thinking ""Maybe I should switch"", I'm just wondering if Apple would ever do something like that (Answer: ""yeah nah"", but that's the thought process as I was watching- sorry nothing!) 💁‍♂️"
"It looks great, until you have to put a case on it so it doesn't break when you drop it..."
"Add addressable RGB.  No really, add that and sold.  Don't care if you add unicorn puke level RGB, I will happily get that.  
OH AND PLEASE, I AM ON MY KNEES BEGGING FOR THIS.  Please add a decent DAC in it with a headphone jack.  Even if the headphone jack has a little white rubber seal thing to sort of hide it when not in use.  Pretty please?  I really want to rock at that awesome AUX party man.  Please please please, headphone jack.  Don't care if it's a V2 that costs more, I will wait for it happily. :)"
It looked like an somewhat transparent iphone to me
Better be a 650 to 700 range in price
wow what a great idea
"Cool gimmick, but I would prefer to have a second screen. One that draws less power than the LEDS and can provide me with waaay more information than the cryptic blinking LEDs can."
Love the uniform bezels around the screen might have to buy it just for that
"I am thinking only about the price... If its in the right place... It can be a 🏆 i am thinking they should place it around 30 to 40k (INR)

Around 400- 500 USD"
The notification lighting is cool
*crys in Oneplus* at the end 😅
You get a phone and you get a free camera and ring-light for videos. And guess what?...It is android. Please!!! bring it to me 😢😭😭😭. I want. 😢
its a gimmick. wont be around long.
"This is a nothingburger. Not different enough to really be interesting, and not proven enough to want to switch from a main brand."
Goodbye OnePlus
What's the OS
Gimm ick eyyuyyyyyyyyyyy
this kind of speaks to me
"When he said ""sound familiar""? YES! - - OnePlus"
Bro this is an stripped iphone 🤔
The only thing that matters is privacy and security going forward. The data extraction from users has to be ended and the only way that happens is if people switch to privacy respecting phones and OS's. Apple and Android are NOT private. The best option as of right now is grapheneOS on a de-googled Pixel.
Nothing to See Here!
"Ideally…in a utopia..if a phone was as necessary as they are now, I would want an highly ethical company with an ethical phone.  The gadgets are cool just wondering why things can’t be done with high ethics."
2:22 Didn't he day he can't show us the front? Df
LED on the back: completely and utterly useless!
"Wow, these ringtones kinda suck"
"I ilke how this looks, especially as someone who has a pair of Ear (1)s. That said, my phone is on silent, and that wont change, so I dont know how useful the glyphs will be. But the overall aesthetic im down with. just need to know about the rest of the phone"
I want it
"Looks like a nice phone. Based on the OS presentation I was expecting an anime matrix like thing on the back, but still looks good.
Hope they make it and within a few years achieving a coherent clear aesthetic among the ecosystem. I'm a sucker for clear products so that's enough for me. I don't need a revolutionary proposition to be aboard."
Cool shit
if this had iOS I would buy it 4 shure
"""You know who's calling you just by looking at it"" 

Well my phone has this really innovative feature where it shows the name of the caller on your screen 🤯"
What about battery life? Leds on all the time must not be a good sign. or not?…
"I want it to be as ""niche"" as teenage engineering products..."
"Looks too cheap for iPhone 12, maybe android remake of iphone XR."
I don't find myself laying my phone screen side down very often so I don't see how this would be very useful to me personally. I do miss when phones had notification leds on the front though like my galaxy note 9 had.
"I'm in the Market for a new phone, So I'll give this one a look and I can say right now, if the Software works like it's supposed to, I'm in"
"Honestly, this phone brought back my passion for innovation in the smartphone industry which was long gone since the ages of the Galaxy S7 and OnePlus 6. 
Nowadays it's all just the same designs and features in every phone year after year, all brands and models. All the same glass and metal bricks, with a screen on one side and cameras on the back that allows you to work and browse through social media. Since it's already a normalised and stablished industry with very little room for exciting innovation in technology, design and wow factor, a shift towards emotional design had to be made. A way to appeal to people's identity so they can express themselves by owning something different and unique that stands out from the crowd. Just like those collaborations between brands are trying to do or the iPhone with the new personalized lockscreen.
I'm really excited to see what comes next RGB lighting coming for sure. Bring back that notification LED so I can assign a color to my favourite contacts like the old days."
Read the first and last sentence of this nonsensical paragraph. You’re wrong buddy
"Well I’ve had the Ear 1 for a year and what I can say about Nothing is the following :
Their products are really nice looking, with good features and not too expensive. Only problem I had is, the earphones died twice in less than a year (I had to use the warranty twice and replace them). So I’m a bit worried about the quality of their production. I really hope they can step up, and that way it will probably be a success on the long run!"
Oneplus?
I thought it was an iphone
"6:25 
*Cries in OnePlus tears* 😢😢"
"I'm interested to see the features they pack into the camera.  If they can nail the camera quality, those LEDs will be such a fun tool in phone photography."
This phone is very gimmicky. It’s hard to be excited simply for a couple LED’s.
Imagine it had RGB
"Personally if I had to choose between an iPhone and the nothing phone, appearance-wise I'm gonna go with the nothing phone.
Now from the software perspective I don't know, I don't own an iPhone, only had cheap androids.
I now have a mac and I get why everyone likes the ecosystem, I can see the potential without even having an iPhone.
That said, those lights on the back could be enough so that if I had to choose between iPhone and the nothing phone,I'll probably go with nothing phone."
"No thanks, I’ll stick with iPhone"
Looks so cool
I could imagine the case having spaces for the LEDs but who knows
"That looks pretty awesome, I would buy it"
Review of back of a phone
Except who puts their phone down screen first? Scratch magnet!
"@Crispy bacon I don't get people who don't use a case tbh, I mean those are some serious risk takers:)"
I do but i have a case lol
"Or, you could put your phone down face up and get all that functionality built into every phone ever."
"Could you do a review of the Mudita Pure phone, thnx, love the vid!"
Loved it. Feels like you are in a cyberpunk
The phone should cost nothing because it's a Nothing Phone 📱 it's pretty cool.
As freaking awesome as it is.....unfortunately  it will live in my Otterbox case just like every other phone.
"I dont get what is the big deal about this. So it has cool lights on its back but everything else it offers is pretty much the same as any other android phones out there. This is just another iphone copy, design wise, with android OS."
"So uh who's gonna tell them that LEDs do die pretty easily after a year or two right....

This is cool and all but when one or a few die Ya it now looks ghetto."
These ringtones are hitting hard. Good one
Very soon we will see smart phones with displays on both sides.
(Good refined efficient ones)
i mean their products always look awesome ... there is no argument there imo.
"Sound familiar? 
Yes!- OnePlus"
Okay can they make a Sidekick now
Tron the Phone
"not surprised about the phone expected from carl pei, but come around software i feel like it's gonna be dissapointing"
Lol where's the headphone jack ?
@Crispy bacon sadly I can't afford to get with the $200+ program 🤕🤕
"99% of new phones don’t use headphone jacks, get with the program"
Nothing wrong with it
"""Familiar?"""
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Look at me talking about LEDs and neglecting the geopolitical and socio-economical consequences of popularizing stuff made in china. Look at me sleepwalking everyone into complicity in human rights and labor rights violations. Look at you being tricked by LEDs measured through with all sorts of scores on all sorts of variables like kids tricked for candy.
If LG couldn't do it and it had great innovation. Well this phone won't make it with just extra lights nahh.
This is nothing. Nothing really interesting and needed. It's being different to be talked about. Meh
They used to work for apple and now they using apple blueprints. PASS I need something new
Can you talk about the phones software please
I need one😅 with transformers sound🔊
The phone looks extremely meh there's no changing this fact. What slightly different phone? This is identical to everyone else with the meaningless fugly LEDs.
"If they had tried the full screen display with an under display camera, my interest would have been piqued. There really is a lack of OEMs pushing that in the NA market which is a shame esp if Nothing is meant for enthusiasts. As it is, it def just looks like an iPhone 12 running Android. The whole lighting gimmick is cool for the first 5 minutes you are using it until you realize you would have to always leave the phone upside down on the table for it to even make sense. Still waiting for full screen display…"
I actually really really like that phone. I just hate android unfortunately and I’m assuming that’s what it’s running. So I wouldn’t get it solely for that reason. I do realllllllly like it tho
"Since there are so many led, would it drain battery faster than other phone?"
Led is the best power saving light alternative
So I think I really want their ringtones.
"Very excited for the review, I'm up for a new phone later this year, this might be it !"
Yep it sure looks different but I'm far from sold. The lights are more gimmicky than useful for me.
"Oh it looks like the iphone 4, has a light on the back, ringtones.. wow! What’s new?! I can answer that: nothing. I wonder how much they paid him to do this video"
"So many phones I would consider if they had a headphone jack, expandable storage, and an s-pen. Note 9 continues to ride hard until I can get my hands on a Sony."
You gave them free business advice
"Dope ringtone and notifications light implementation! I can see that it will stand out and has a pull over other generic phones. The price & availability will however, decide how far it will go."
If this gets priced as a flagship in the $1K range then it'll fail instantly...no one outside of the tech community has any clue who this company is so they need to price this phone accordingly
"this is super cool, but i can't change to android from ios T_T"
"Let’s be honest…. Nothing phone is a branch of Apple and they are too ashamed to admit they made a more affordable phone. It’s a business move, because they still want that top notch premium dollar for Apple products. But that’s just a theory, could be true."
"sounds familiar 😂😂 too true, typing from a one plus that has lost its way and don't want to upgrade to a bland new one. I like the way this nothing phone could be going. if it works well and has a good battery I'll get it"
"who else watched this and said 
“i’m getting this phone.” 😭 this is the modern hardware innovation a lot of us truly wanted. kudos"
I totally dig this 😂♥️
*4:21** millennials invented flashlight in phones*
I wish there is a feature to change the color of the LED lights or they should've stick to black
"Battery consumption from this LEDs 🤔
Also will be interesting to see black coloured one"
it gives me like a cyberpunk style vibe and I like it.
"I feel like this is just a mockery of the phone industry. Pei founded OnePlus, after all"
Wow that's pretty cool. I work as a retail salesman and sell phones to people. I can definitely push this and would even try it out myself depending on the interface
Love the real facts in your videos 😍
reverse wireless charging.....nice
There's Nothing like this phone.
"Yeah, sounds familiar.. OnePlus... 😢"
Im interested in the first few runs if there is a good custom rom scene for them otherwise idk if I will bother.  On a side note they managed to make the most annoying ringtones possible
@Kieren Rogers or that they open it up so people can do custom ones
"I agree, the ringtones were frustrating, let's hope that there's atleast some good ones that actually make good use of the glyph"
"idk why, but I kept thinking nothing and essential were the same brand..."
Well... That's something
"phone looks great honestly, but i do wonder how much those LEDs effect battery life, since theres a large number of them. if it's not significant then im all in for the design."
with the thumbnail of the video i thought it was a clear iphone 11😭
"People would just slap a case on it, and then the lights ar covered..maybe a clear case would do.."
"With OnePlus dead, we need real flagship killers in the market."
Just need a black one with the ability to choose the LED color! RGB selection!
Love how Marques shaded Apple and can get away with it.
"Markus B Lee:
The Black Phone:
06/24/2022
Nothing: July"
I learnt Nothing.
You showed us the screen?
6:08 to 6:33 😅
My only consider at the moment is... How much does the use of all the led lights uses up the battery consumption
This looks really cool and innovative. I hope they can stir up some trouble.
I dig it !!!!!
Bf22a
iPhone ripoff
there's nothing new under the sky
6:23 definately One Plus
gimmicky
Is that a powerbook in the background???
Futuristic. I kinda like it!
Luv it! 🥰
"woot! Check out 1:32, there's a typo in the labeling!  MODLE: A063"
yeah we know this is just iPhone-ish but much better
This phone is super sleek and I'm a sucker for an led for notifications and that light design on the back sold me. I think the only thing that might hold me back would be the eventual price. I'm not super cheap I own an S20 Fe so 700 dollars is reasonable but I don't think it's different enough that I would spend more than that
2500us?...hell no😂
Bro this phone is theeeeee android bro .. like theee phone
Essential ph1 all over again. I will not be a part of that mess again 😂. I don't care who the CEO previously worked for.
I thought the notifications were moved form a small led to our wrists with a hefty price tag
It looks like a recycled iPhone
"so its still a regular phone???  iphone design with android system, not to mention the earbuds copied a lot from airpods pro and jbl pods, definately not a unique company at all"
Me watching the end on a OnePlus...
If I was an android kinda guy I’d buy that phone no problem
If I wasn’t locked into Apple stuff I would probably get this
that back LED remind me of Nokia 3220
If the os is as good as the phone looks I’m in
"if i were to design a phone, thats it!"
you can bid around 2500$ if you want 1 of the first 100s serialized phones lol
2:53 RIP the charging port after a couple of months
"You could say ""I have an iPhone 12 with Android"" hehe"
Usually 99% iphone users put thair overpriced toys into the bumper! So all this led lights useless. And they are useless - just draing the battery life
"Weak gimmick. ""Their own ecosystem"" ugh, no thanks. Bye."
Won't be long till you come back with one I suspect.
"So basically, Nothing is now something?"
"Wow, outstanding looking phone, never seen such thing"
"What I want to see phone companies start making again is small phones.  Like, under 5 inches."
"Android is clueless, we need a new os, ios needs a competition, I hope nothing can do that."
This phone looks so dope I hope the os is just as good
"The camera's probably gonna dissapoint me so im not expecting much from a new phone company. But i hope they should make the camera more like iphone or google pixel, not like the usual chinese oversaturated looks"
Looks like an iPhone tbh.
"Underpainted glass slab: Bland.
Glass slab you can see some painted electronics and LEDs underneath: Innovation.
I wasn't sold on the Ear 1, I'm not sold on this. They're trying to pull another OnePlus, and the current market has them having to try to stand out even more than OnePlus did back in its hayday."
I don't give a shit about the phone Unless I see nothing's business plan for the future. As mkbhd asked when is he going to sell the company ?
Nothing gonna be the next OnePlus
So no one is gonna complement the symmetrical bezels?
All Apple has to do is add a flashing notification light to the next iPhone and this company has no USP and will fail lol.
Different? Looks like a magsafe case... haha
I remember on my Nokia N900 I could set color and blink patterns to any kind of notification in a pretty complex UI. You could basically morse-code the whole Bible if you wanted to. I just used it to dim the charging indicator LED at night. The N900 was way ahead of it's time.
"The design of this phone, looks damn near perfect. Its about time 'phones were fun again'. If it had a headphone jack I would buy it in a heartbeat"
They already have wireless earphone so no hole
That shot at OnePlus hurt me personally lol.
"I think the lights are cool, I also think that Google perfected this back with in nexus lineup. I'd much rather have different colors for different notifications than different patterns. I really do miss that feature. Just my two cents.."
Razer Phone 2 did this. I had the original and the 2. The 2 was so much more refined. Unfortunately it all stopped there and I went back to OnePlus. I also owned the essential phone ph-1 which I definitely miss.
"@Kalliste  i think the phone1 has the fingerprint in the unlock button because in the first seconds of the video Marques unlock it but there's no icon for the fingerprint on the display like other phones, but who knows, maybe he has disable it."
Yup loved that color notification LED
One of the things I missed the most going from Nexus to a new phone too. AOD helps. Nothing phone also needs fingerprint scanner on the back. It's far more natural than on the screen.
"looks like iphone - same fat borders, same frame which is not suitable overall - NOTHING special. Everything secondary. Oh - led lights...AMAZINg, ringtones - anazing is this NOTHING or another apple presentation - when sone old fart selling outdated crap for overprice?"
Why should someone place a phone on a flat surface with the screen facing down?
Valid point!
Is it just me or does somebody else see an abstract apple on the back?
"real strategy really, you know that's not happening why would i buy a phone with only gimmicks I'll soon get bored off 😮‍💨"
"If they were gonna go with a DBZ collab, why didn't they go with a Capsule Corp theme? I get that Goku is the face of the brand but he's also the ultimate luddite. Naruto is in a similar vein. And while I like the look of the LoL one, it looks like the Cloud9 Halo Infinite skin. They should've gone with a Hextech look."
Marques are you an investor in this company?
You have to bid on a phone??? Just checked the website. Last sale was $2651. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
It's looks like!  nothing looks like something 🤔
"It dose sounds familiar.... OnePlus.... But oh well the same master mind ther is, Carl Pei. Wouldn't it surpass OP in few years or not? 🤔🤔 (Bet it will)"
"Honestly I haven’t even watch this video and this seems like a generous tutorial for a vintage look phone.  I know is weird cause this is not common on phones, but who remember back in the days electronics with transparent covers and so on."
How repairable though
Looks literally like an iPhone 11 Concept
Those ringtones though 😬
It looks like it comes from the Star Wars movie 🛸
dang... i will buy it
"Did you just spell Samsung? :)"")"
"Very gimmicky to say the least, unless it is very efficient those LED's will just eat away the battery. To also appreciate and take advantage of the LED's you will need a clear case or no case as mentioned so that's a for me. I'm looking forward to the full review tho..."
It would be nice if its rgb which could turn those led colour it would be awsome like cyberpunk phone 😍
I like it because it doesn’t look like an iPhone 😂
1:02 my birthday lol
"As far as branding goes, I really like Nothing. They're stylish dudes who bring some cyberpunk-ish/industrial vibe to boring tech. I'm an Apple boy, but something inside of me wants to buy Nothing products."
BB8 what's wrong? Nothing
4:12 that ringtone reminds me how my old speaker tells me when I'm about to get a phone call LOL
"Well we can say, “nothing is different”"
"To be honest, I don’t find any brand replacing apple. I had high hopes on HTC and OnePlus. But I don’t see them replacing what apple stands for. Surely, android did change a lot over years but innovations in smartphone space has slowed down. The questions is always always what’s next big thing. 

With HTC nomore, OnePlus taken over completely by Oppo and Phones from Samsung and Chinese brands being just fancy phones with buggy features doesn’t make up a great deal for the future. Hope this can gives us more from what I can see now."
"Thanks for the review.
Now I want the Naruto phone."
naruto phone review when ??
Lol those ringtones are awful
This looks like if the empire made a phone
"Slap a skin on it! Just not covering the lights.

Imagine a black phone with those lights"
"Not gonna lie, they've managed to pack way more functionality into these leds, than I've thought. It's enough for it to be more than just a gimmick. It's nice not to be disappointed for once."
"it's true but the question is how well it will be adopted. if the themselves treat it like a gimmick, they're not gonna put too much effort in it and it will not go much further than what we already see here. Also depends on how accesible it is to App devs"
I think in black that would be sick with the LEDs
The way you described HTC at the end of the video...lmao
In love with those lighting effects...wow that's cool
Did I miss the specs?
at 6:28 my mahn was literally trolling oneplus xD
"2,500 Euros 🧐🇮🇪☘️"
Phone industry exposed *shocked*
That’s an iPhone in a skin
This is cool
"Me, an average One plus enjoyer, loves the look of the phone."
wow im imperessed. if it comes with IOS ill buy it
So it runs on Android?
"Let's all be real here for a second, we'll use this feature for like two days and then forget about it. So that makes it a gimmick "
"Me: Mom, I need 700$ to buy NOTHING.
Mom: So you won't buy anything with 700$. Promise?
Me: Yes Mom."
"For the first 30 seconds of this video, my eyes and mind tricked me into thinking I was watching THE NOTHING IPHONE!😹"
Gimmicky.
Can they make small phones again? My wife has been dying to have a phone she can easily hold with one hand comfortably.
It sounds like One plus for me... And maybe the nexus line up
Anyone notice how the LED’s on the back are in the shape of the Apple logo? Including the bite and the leaf?
A nice little pinch of salt to OnePlus. Delicious!
Only 100 of them will be made and they will be around 3000 dollars U.S ......
"This is super cool.  It’s quite similar in concept to the OnePlus, and as someone who owned the OnePlus One, and OnePlus 6, if I was still on Android, I’d definitely consider this guy as my next daily driver.  I love Nothing as a start-up and will likely support them if they do Apple compatible accessories.  Would anyone else buy a blutooth iPhone case with the same light feature?  I sure would!"
Sounds familiar?😂
"I love your t shirts, superb👍🤙"
And what happens to that lovely back when you put a case on it.
The end point is on point. 🍻… also not and iPhone. 😈
"think its a phone for the cool modern,minimal  people."
It looks stupid... Reminds me of toy phones we used to have as a kid
"i think the most important thing is how does these two cameras perform and how good is the battery life, and then the key factor, the price."
Those ringtones are garbage lmao
"""looks different"" 
looks exactly like iPhone"
"MKBHD hope your well! Just checked out their website and they are auctioning these off? Going for around 3,000? Seems like a bit of a hype desperation move? There stuff is great but this approach seems pretty “supreme -ish” and not the most authentic…"
Can’t wait til Apple steals this
The Ultimate Side Chick Phone!!!
I know I will buy one xD
I'm just glad someone is ready to push the envelope and break tradition
"Everybody else: Reviewing on the released pictures
MKBHD: Hold my 🍺"
"It's interesting, I'll give them that. I see so many comments that tech in 2022 is boring, but people are complaining when someone tries something new. I'll 100% watch the review vids and it's good for tech channels getting views."
amazing smartphone!
Great phone for hearing impaired individuals.
Me watching it on my iPhone 12
I love it
Love the subtle dig at OnePlus
"98% of the time, the back of my phone is away from me (in the...back). My phone is always face up (so I can see notifications and the always on screen).  So I am having difficulty in understanding the appeal and utility of this."
"OnePlus today has abandoned the original philosophy of Oneplus One
This is OnePlus rebranded as Nothing making a start all over again
Good Luck!"
Hi
I got the reference (1+) at the end of the video
"It looks absolutely amazing, i guess the main thing for me would just be the fact that i'm not a person who ever puts their phone face down. All the notification functions the back LEDs serve is what i use always on display (with phone laying face up) for. It's been beaten into me from the days of easily scratched screens to never put my phone face down on basically any surface other than like my bed. Now days i know it's mostly ok to put your phone face down since the glass is better, but that's a habit i would specifically have to change to get any use out of the LEDs on the back of the phone. 95% of the time i would never see them."
"@VMYeahVN okay, you're right 😔😔"
@alnexus Flashing LEDs on the back of the phone is more of a distraction I would think lol
I think that was their objective. Putting your phone down makes the phone less of a distraction for most people imo.
@Ankit Same here lol
Maybe u don't use glass guard i m more afraid of my camera lens getting scratched 😂
Damn this phone has potential bro
my dog did not like hearing those ringtones lol
Shouldn't it be black instead of white? So u can see the lights better?
Damn I'm loving this phone
I'd rather have a horizontal/vertical stand on the back of my phone
I would buy for 499.
All these lights. This phone is gonna have no battery life lol
How much they paid U for this ?
"As a long time android user this is something I have really been hoping for. While apples software is personally too limiting for myself I have always liked there design ethos, which is essentially non existent in the android market. So this is kinda like an iPhone with USBC a really interesting gimmick and best of all runs android"
I smell a lawsuit brewing..
"Oh look it's an iphone that runs Android with a light design. 

Seriously? This is what perks your ears? Lights? 

What happened to phones like the LGv20 that could do everything this phone could but then times more? Why do you people seem to care about pretty lights and lol, ringtones?? Also those ringtones all sound like garbage."
"Main factor to switch will be the OS. If they are targeting the android audience these cool features comes with cost. Market leaders in android might be Samsung, Xiaomi but majority of them doesn’t own a thousand dollar android phone compared to Apple. Unless they come out as $400 android phone they have less chance to succeed. 
About the led lights. 99% of the time user will be facing the screen while using the phone or in pocket while ringing. Are they really dumb enough to spend on development just to serve very tiny percentage of users who keeps their phone upside down on a table in a meeting just to show off? 🤯."
RIP OnePlus. The new flagship killer has arrived.
That OnePlus reference. Subtle.😂
"Come one man this thing looks just like an iPhone. 

Nice thing what they did with the leds tho."
"And all this backlight functionality means ""Nothing"" ...the moment you stick a phone case on it..."
Thats what i wish my iphone looked like. super modern and cool. COOL PHONE COMPANIES! WE WANT COOL AGAIN! IM 43. I WANT COOL AF
"We are waiting for a new concept , I think that new concept has a brand car name already in it!!"
Their watches are going to be sick-tar
Those ringtones hurt my ears and eyes and give me more anxiety than I already experience when answering the phone.
Good reference to 1+
Honestly after being a life time fan of Apple I would try this phone out
it’s the razor of iPhones
not like I would use them but those ringtones are horrifying
i will sure buy it ... if it comes with gud price
this is EASILY the coolest Smartphone ever released looks like straight out of TRON: LEGACY
Nice 1 + mock  to close 👌  🤣
the lights on the back is in the shape of apple logo but with the letter G
At least show us the phone in a dark room man. This way we would know how bight the LEDs are. Missed opportunity.
The end refereing to OnePlus hahaha
and even more...and even more....and even more....until it becomes oneplus 😣
"I didn't like the design at first, since I saw the front I started liking it, this is their first phone it the industry so I'm glad they approaching it with a different design, most Android phones look the same, if the phone will have good camera quality, good screen and good software UI, I'll be hooked for sure🔥👌"
"that´s real nice and different, i like it!"
"Still a phone.  Still phone shape.  Nothing extraordinary.  Great hype up, though."
Mkbhd uniased review!!!!
"the thing that makes or breaks this phone for me anyway is going to be dev support. Do they allow the bootloader to be easily unlocked and the phone to be rooted like Oneplus used to or do they keep it locked down and an absolute nightmare to do anything on it. I guess time will tell.


full disclosure I haven't looked up anything on the phone if they did say they would allow easy bootloader unlocking/rooting i may be very interested in this device"
Wow YouTube fix your bot problem holy hell
"""sounds familiar?""
Who is he referring to?"
in my opinion the phone is already dead and isn't gonna take off simply because the main gimmick doesn't hold up to daily use led notification functionality just isn't that practical the extra light for taking pictures and video i could see working but only to a very small group of people
I can see light sabers ring tones.
Quirky but all of these are solved by Apple Watch or leaving your phone face up on the table
very gimmicky
"Will this phone sell through providers like ATT , T-Mobile , Verizon etc ?"
I'm intrigued by the new ringtones nothing's baked into their phones. Wouldn't mind giving these a try on my phone :)
"""No chin"""
"MKBHD: sounds familiar?
Me: yes, OnePlus."
Look’s like a iPhone
Who was he referring to when he said “sound familiar?”
"Imagine not making all the back full of leds to draw images or cool patterns, lol."
"possibly best android phone design to date (especially the super slim, even bezels) but notification lights is the last thing I'm looking for when choosing a phone. we already have sooo many ways to get notified, dont need more damn notifications."
"All I see throughout this review video is the back of the phone, the beginning of the era of using phones from the back"
😀👍🏽
someone threw the i and made it better
"OMG I've waited sooo long for a company to make an iphone look alike in the android space...
Because I love apple designs but I don't like their software (it's fine if you don't agree with that tho lol)

The design for me is the biggest factor when buying an android phone nowadays because I don't care much about specs honestly"
I like design my parents where poor they never bought me ringing mobile toy now i am rich i will buy this phone in my childhood memory thankyou founder 🤩🥳 (whistle with peepe sound)
I think they down the right path💯
"I love that Glyph notification - really miss the notification light on my previous phones, so useful for seeing what's happening at a glance"
"""seeing what's happening at a glance""

Isn't this already solved by the always on display...?"
if you can change the color of the led lights on the back that would be pretty cool
"Lmao, that silent roast on OnePlus is well deserved"
Cant wait for the review on this one
You could actually get an opaque case for this that just has cutouts for the leds. And that would still be cool. :D
It looks like an IPhone
Can we see how bright it is in the dark
Damnnnnn super nice phone though 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Am i the only one who thinks this is totally unnecessary because of how many people put their phones in a case...
"I'd love to see a feature than makes it so the back lights can change colour and indicate different apps you assign. Twitter could be blue, email could be red, and messages could be white; then if you get multiple notifications at a time they each have a light to shine through."
"@Arpan Malhi Nawp, Not halal friendly."
@mishka 1 😂..and 1 lesbian for your self too
@Arpan Malhi build your own gay phone then.
"My Sony Xperia 1 III has this feature, when I receive a notification from Twitter, it's blue, Gmail is red, WhatsApp is green and so on. When the battery is low, it turns red too."
Yah i would love to see LGBT lights 😍
NUMBER 20 ON TREADING LESS GOOOOOO!!!!!
The back looks like an iPhone 11/12  😬
Ppl saying they copied and shit but don’t realize Samsung and apple done the same stuff their whole life but if the phone had a button on it they would be like shit was so 2015 like what do you want a phone to look like 😂
"This phone looks so nerdy, the sci fi droid like ringtone and glyph lighting up too? I hope the rest of it good cos I really want to buy it."
I can feel u man! Your last words are very deep. I also feel the same way for 1+. What have they done?  Why did they even do it? Have no answers 😊
😭
"Holy shit, I want this phone. I. Want. This. Phone. This is the first time I’ve felt this feeling in years."
Interested on the battery situation
"I am pretty sure that a matte black version is also comming sooner or later, and judging by nothing's past record, it's gonna be better!"
i think im gonna buy it
This is awesome
Imma buy this
Look like cyber phone ❤️‍🔥
Nothing about display and all
6:31 for some people who didn't understand it's 1+
Nothing exciting here (Get it?).  Its basically looks like an iPhone 4 with a custom back plate.  We have seen this before years ago.  Only the battery progress bar is a neat idea.
That's so dope!
Apple: For $50/month you can rent our iOS and put it on whatever device you want.
I never understood why no backlit logos/lights on the back of the phones. It would be a killer feature and useful also like in this case probably will be. Especially for the fruit company it was their theme for so long for macbooks so weird they didn't go this route...
"Would not buy this, even if I am in need for a new phone. My experience with Nothing ear buds was so bad (a buggy mess), I shortly ended up buying Oneplus earbuds pro and I didn't regret that. This phone could end up like a Google Pixel, with a lot of bugs. Or quality will be inconsistent."
This looks NOTHING like the rest of the phones out.
"MKB's style is ""broadly appealing"" . . . 👍"
"yes, OnePlus 🤦"
I liked the back a lot and if you can change the colors of the LEDs it will be sick. Time to change the plain monolith slab into something fun again.
"I really wasn't interested it looked like a gimmick but now I'm really wanna switch 
Hope there's no issues here"
"Kinda need to know specs, price and support time. So rather wait for the full review before buying."
OnePlus :C
"I really want Nothing to excel
Carl Pei is an absolute unit that understands putting the user experience first"
"Love the light/tune combo tones, such a great idea."
Who knew Apple and One+ had a baby
iphone 12 lol
"The back looks great, but I think Apple might have something to say about the industrial design!"
The glyph feature is cool addition. Bet this phone will look very sweet in Cyberpunk 2077 yellow theme.
It looks different? No it doesn’t. It’s an iPhone with a weird pattern on the back.
"Is it just me, or do the LEDs on the back kiiiinda look like a Google G and an Apple apple got married in wireframe?"
"I had expected way more than what is demonstrated. Phones today are the centre of everything for us. 
You want your phone not just to look good, but also to 
- click good pictures: I know most of the game happens in the software domain, but I hugely doubt if Nothing have invested so much on the software aspect since they are a startup, plus haven't seen anything being advertised about it, the embargo to only show the back suggests that only the back is the USP and NOTHING else. 
- A smooth immersive screen: the screen of the nothing is no different, it has a punch hole. NOTHING different there. Even if it has fast refresh rate it is already something that we have seen. 
- Quality sound: just from this I mean media consumption experience. Quad firing speakers that if were collaborated with Dolby to provide the best phone speakers ever. That is disruptive. But NOTHING here to suggest that aspect too.
- Processing: Do you really think there could be a game changer thing that a startup can do here other than providing the best processor? It would be present in other phones as well. NOTHING extra ordinary here too.
-Security: It's just as secured as other android phones. 

Conclusion: High ambitious approach to disrupt the market but NOTHING that stands out other than the perception that the founder carries from OnePlus. 

Nothing that currently suggests that it would be a disruption and make everyone go for it. After sales service and other aspects too need to be considered, where NOTHING is clear."
7 Minutes video to show exactly nothing.
can we gET THE FAKEMASEUAWELESEESSE BOGWENESWLENEENENE ACOCUNTE??????
"Any other colors , black maybe 🤔"
WHERESS THE FAKE MAIEUYESSSD BORLAWENBEANEDNED ACCOUNT??????
"Now that's one hell of a phone,  especially the naming"
I’ve been using nothing ear(1) earbuds and I  can vouch that they are not that good at all
how will cases look on this phone
I’m watching this using nothin earphones
that's why I like the Moto razor flip phone cuz it was something different and it fits in my front pocket on the forums people say oh it doesn't have a fast enough processor or a large enough battery or enough RAM I'm an average user and do average business work things with it it works fine for me and it fits in my pocket and it's different all the phones look the same and then people go put these huge cases on them and all the cases look the same
"I like those  lights, it would be hard to switch a pattern if you take someone out of your faves tho. Does it come in other fun clear colors,  and it needs a skin, not a case......  unless, of course, they're going to go all the way crazy and come up with cases that match the LED light patterns."
It is not for me today but maby in the future. Hope the 2 have rgb lightning :p then maby
All I care about is will this phone work with US Bands.
"it’s boring. i think this has to be one of the most impressive pieces of tech i’ve ever seen it’s just a bootlegged iPhone with LEDs on the back. that’s literally it, nothing interesting about it"
I'll definitely buy one if the spec is right AND if it comes in matte black.
how much will this be??
Y'all heard the OnePlus jab?...😭 Ouch that hurt 🤣😞
Esto es lo que lo usuarios de apple esperábamos de la pantalla desde el 13. Me gusta
Oh they have bought me alright
"3,400 CAD are you kidding"
"MKBHD: “What I am allowed to show you… is the back of the phone”
2:24 *shows the front of the phone*"
"I want the lightsaber sound and ""movement"" around the big LED strip"
"It Looks cool but theres No real Innovation. Nowadays its Just about the look.
If you compare it to a Car. Its Just a a very similar Car With different lights"
"“Cool feature where you can see who’s calling by assigning a flashing pattern to specified contacts”

…or you can just look at the screen that shows you who’s calling"
"Those LED will eat battery so quickly
And who wants to be notify notifications and battery level from back
Usually everyone put phone in charge by front side...
Not being offended but hope this nothing goes nothing in upcoming days"
Love the LEDs ... but wish it could have been LED different colors
Isn’t it a startup by the guy who was the face of oneplus?
Damn I thought this was gonna be about the NoPhone
reminds me of a dystopia but i love it ngl
The iPhone among the Androids
Gimmicky.
This backlight triggered a question. Why don't we have two screens main one in the front another one on the back
Talk about terrible ringtones and copying iPhone. Couldn’t have come up with their own design for the phone I guess.
It looks nice but it's over hyped
Lol I thought it was. Iphone
Great end to the video. They need a wake up call or somebody will replace them.
"Looks cool. It's gonna be forgotten pretty fast. 

_Next!_"
Apple jotting down notes
Anyone else thought this was an iPhone 12 case?
I actually like it. It adds something so simple and functional. Considering notification leds are out. I assume a Nothing 2 may bring in RGB lighting.
"It's cool, but I don't ever set my phone down on the front glass, so I never see the back of it"
looks like iphone but with type c take my money!!!
Screen dimensions?
I would absolutely love this phone! Only problem is… it’s running android lol. If I could get that thing running iOS it would be a game changer! But ain’t no way I’m using that cheap ass software
Why not review phon intirly
"Yep, sounds familiar."
That last bit was about OnePlus.....loosing original fan base....
"If you mean to imply that Nothing’s trajectory could match Apple’s I don’t think today’s Macs really seem like a departure from early Power PCs, etc. It’s just for some reason y’all wanted to use virus prone, unreliable PCs, and eventually got on board and came to Apple."
"Co-founder of Nothing, Carl Pei, says that challenging Apple is a goal. Quite obvious. 
Will be interesting to see how much impact his Iphone – sorry, Nothing Phone – will actually do on Apple's market share. 
But nice to see them try.

The phone uses their own OS, so it's a pretty ambitious move.

Backed with tons of investor money (Carl Pei and his co-founders do pretty well themselves) they might have a good chance to do something good."
I’m more curious about the privacy settings than the way the phone lights up for a “tweet”. Kill the new world order one world government United Nations.  we can’t leave earth hence the firmament.
"Ironically, thought your title said ""The Nothing iPhone LOOKS Different"" 😅"
Ijustine would properly be like: I don't know what these lights do but they are soo cool uwu.
This is basically a Twoplus
hows the battery drain if u fully utilized the back leds ?
"This is ""Nothing"" like I imagined :p gonna definitely buy this"

Can’t wait for the review

Can’t wait for the review

This is a paid promotion promoteing a strange backing that a majority of people don't cares about
"in terms of market shakeup
this is maaad meh
the essential phone was wayy more of a wow factor than lights on the back.... it actually had new tech we still have yet to see AND nice design
this just has design?
and not even that crazy they actualy made covers to hide the true internals ( like xiaomi did . . . in the mi 8 . . . long long ago)"
The title should have been: “This looks Nothing like your phone”
Anyone remember the Nokia 3510i? They have the side leds that flash with the ringtone.
It looks just like my iPhone
nice call back to the one plus origin story there
That subtle jab made me giggle. It was way too familiar 😭
That G3 PowerBook in the background tho (I think???)
What a waste of battery power
Idk about those ringtones...
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway❤️.
That OnePlus shade at the end 😭😭😭😭😭😭

👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway❤️.
Red magic phones have had leds for a while now.
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway❤️.
It’s been a long time since I seen a new phone that was doing something different that made me say wow that’s awesome and something I have always wanted. A clear phone lol. I know it sounds crazy but it was something always though android would do hence the name. I’d buy it. I am one foot out of the apple ecosystem anyhow.
Oneplusssss 😂
Put iOS on it and i'd buy it 😂
Can't wait for the review
Bro can you review the Zenbook 17 fold pls I wanna know how good it is
Uhmm that’s a Apple Logo sir
This is the coolest phone ive ever seen... And the design is super cool yet formal like iphone and balance bezel.
"I want that, literally."
"Nit gunna lie. If the software is good enough and the price doesn't smash the £1000 mark then I'd give it a go. It looks awesome and I love nifty features like this. How much do u guys think it will cost 🤣, my guess is between £/$700 to £/$1,000"
I'm sorry it's not different enough why would I want that thing on the back I like a nice smooth sleek back
"It’s pretty cool, but I’m all about ecosystem. If Nothing manages to get people out of Apple’s hands, it will be very few as most are in it for Apples ecosystem."
Yeah looks good but don't expect me to not put a case on an expansive item
I’m sorry but this things has the look and feel of the misformed baby of an iphone 8 and an iphone 12 with the front camera of an android.
"No matter what time, what video, or what it's about, Marques always has to mention the iPhone 😂🤦"
"Since Apple Watch release, I don’t care about ringtones. But it is cool."
"What this Phone needs is: good battery !!! A thing, that only iPhone is the best."
"Fun fact : only mkbhd got the real nothing phone 1 IN HAND,  others just use posters and clips from internet to speak about it.


That's the power of MKBHD"
"0:18
Bueno, parece una copia descarada de un iPhone xd"
those ringtones!! 😂 back to nokia 3310 i remember we use to buy some sticks with led lights that use to flash every time you was receiving a call.
"This is what i imagined future phones would look like, sick design"
Design is real nice! First andriod that's peaked my interest in a while. I hope it's not too expensive!
"So cool, I love it"
The total absence of room sound makes these videos nauseating to watch
Any resemblance to real company strategy is purely coincidental...oneplus cof cof🤭
"Looking on the front... and we're going back to Nothing's April's Fool post ""just another one""... 🤦 with the hole punch camera 😒"
"""Sounds Familiar?"" 😌😂 Looks like we are in a loop!"
I’d love a deep dive in to the OS. That’s all I really care about when looking in to a new phone
"Just checked on their website and it looks like they have their own launcher so you can get a preview of the OS. (also means it is just an android based phone, which was to be expected)"
You know when innovation in phones is fucked when a youtuber this big has to talk about lights on the back for 6 minutes
The leds are a good idea and every phone should have something like this! But the shape of them is weird tbh. 😅
Who is watching this video in iPhone 12 ?
I'm buying it
Nothing did actually spend some time developing this time.
i am 100000% going to get this phone
Me too!
Would be so slick in black with the white LEDs..... Now that's something. The led logo looks a bit like a simplified Apple logo. Imagine cracking the back glass and the LEDs get damaged... Better have some strong backglass
Pretty cool
This is a complete gimmick. No surprise seeing all the fake comments from their pr team 🤣
The nice thing about the lights on the back of the phone is that its very good for people with hearing impairments. They have to rely on flashing lights and customizing them makes it very easy to screen calls.
"@Chris Black I might be missing something, but isn't this just about leaving the phone always facing up? Like you could do this ever since phones had OLED panels."
@Facundo Montero This can do it on both sides so it’s not missed. That’s what makes it nice and it’s why I commented on it. I have friends that are hearing impaired and it does make a difference.
All of which an OLED panel can do just fine too so...
"I mean... you can have this done much better on front of the device with oled screen.
Who puts the phone screen down ?!"
If I was apple I would sue them for the design.
"Oh my gosh I love that look, it‘s like a 100% my style
Which actually makes me pretty sad because I‘m certainly not going to switch to that phone and unfortunately it doesn‘t make any sense to buy it anyways just because it‘s pretty damn cool"
What phone you use?
We are up in for another OnePlus.
Screams gimmick
Features that nobody asked for.
"Very interesting development. I wonder what influence this will have on the ""mainstream"" manufacturers."
Mr. Nothing.... TAKE MY MONEY
is the dragon ballz one world wide yet?
"That's cyberpunk as hell and if it's actually a good phone, I'll buy it."
7 hours 1m views😢
I think it looks nothing like I ever seen before. But seriously the mobile market is so cluttered right now it could go unnoticed
"One question ...why not a dark room for a better video/point? as comparison, is like Edge screen from Samsung but more practical because is on the back off the phone, I think, correct me if I'm wrong"
"Nothing phone, something phone, whatever phone, no phone, all good name spinoffs"
"It's really hard to be excited about this. I'll give them the compliment for their creativity, it looks interesting, unique and they've integrated actual usability into it 
But.....
I don't see how LEDs on the back of the phone are meant to excite me when their function is done by the front screen in better way. Rather than assigning different ringtones that flash different to contacts to be able to recognise them, I can just look at the screen and see who's calling. Instead of wiggling my phone to see how far it's charged, I can just look at the battery percentage on the screen.

I just don't know how often I look at the back of my phone to care about having stuff there"
exactly bro!
Wow
Goofy ahh ringtones 💀💀💀
"I would love if companies that makes cases would make custom cases like so that you can see LED lights through tiny holes on the Nothing Phones back. Example... a case where you can see progress bar indicator for charging, the bottom holes would have an battery icon that lights up 0-100% on the case, which is important. Other light parts whatever comes to your mind. Maybe notification icons like messages, calls, emails on the top right corner, that lights single LED light for those icons? hmmm"
"I like the idea that there going for but I need 
Specs, price and availability"
I like the shot on OnePlus near the end of the video
""
*watching this video with my Nothing Ear 1s right now*
The important question is... can we use the glyph interface for morse code? 😂😂
"Imagine a newcomer introducing its first smartphone in 2022....




...and the back is the only interesting thing about it."
"Nice, a bunch of shit I’ll never use😴😴😴

Sent from an iPhone"
it just back glass led alarm?
Was that a OnePlus reference at the end?
I thought you were Re reviewing the iPhone 12 for a second
I really like the look of this phone. But as you asked “Will it (the light features) be enough to compete with others brands”. My answer to that will be determined according to the PRICE.
finally a worthy opponent for the nokia 3220
The oneplus reference 😂😂😂
"6:24 was he talking about OnePlus? 😶😶 ""Sells the most but that feels like it abandoned your original fan base"""
It just looks so clean. Hopefully we get other colors as well
Those are some cool sounds and light effects
That thing looks awesome but what the hell are these ring tones??
All hype
Yeah thats cool but software and features has to be par with apple features and more.
That OnePlus dig at the end. ooooooohhhhhh. lol
"the lights reminded me Siemens m55 and m65, which had light indicators on their edges strobing to match a ringtone. It was pretty cool back then, one of the few features a phone of the time could possibly have, unlike now, when a smartphone can do so many things their owners don't even know about"
Pointless for my use as I'll most certainly want to put a cover on the phone
Yeah thats cute but  aoftware and features has to be par with apple
So NOTHING has done SOMETHING!  🙂
basically an iphone that’s running android. nothing special
I think those RING tones were actually DOPE! 👍😎
"I've gotta say I love the fact that they are trying something new, I highly appreciate unique hardware"
What is new? The ringtones?
Should’ve been “This…is…Nothing.”
It looks super cool.
Isn't it an iPhone?!
iPhone 12😂😂🤣
iPhone 12😂😂🤣
At the last he is talking about Rog😂
"kinda reminds me of the transgender symbol haha
its pride month, so coincidence? .. yea probaby"
"Personally I find that there is ""nothing"" new,  with an always on screen we could do the same thing (and this is useless with all the smartwatchs). 
Foldable screen or AR glasses (with option like DEX or continuum) will be the only real/next evolution of the smartphone."
"Ok, this *IS* cool but.... It is a question of how deep into Android that they had to go to mod in this functionality. Two... Heat. For the quick flashes that they got going on, I am sure it is fine but a few of the functions allow the LED's to be on for a sustained amount of time. That does makes me wonder about how it is going about cooling, assuming that it is."
How much did he get paid to publish this video lol
"I would +1 your last line, since i know exactly what you mean. XD"
"I think it looks kinda nice, but I expected something more disruptive to be honest. I had too high expectations."
hi cuckoo!
Phone cases are a thing... I highly doubt many companies will (oh my God those are the most annoying ring tones wtf) bother making a clear case for that. Weird gimmick. And not a great start to have a start up controlling these types of videos right now. Didn't y'all make a video with Mrwhostheboss where you said this type of limited videos are bad
A broadly appealing Like... 😂
"Does anyone know if you can buy that Naruto phone in the US, and if so, where?"
Who hates his screen so much to let it face down
"All white slim phone, “glif interface”? Y’all remember Tron? I’m actually very interested"
I would like the PCB
"I'm not leaving iOS, but this phone looks cool."
"It’s so pretty,, I’m sure getting one with at least 256gb ram. Make it available in Dubai."
"So they went from making plastic fake phones to curb phone addiction to making actual phones and earbuds?
Kinda wierd"
Nothing is better than something in this case?
I like the fact that it looks futuristic and prototype-ish. Unique indeed.
"awh c'mon, that should have been the cyberpunk phone!"
Imagine a nothing phone mini
I like it
"Nothing phone is the second generation of essential pH1            they bought up essential phone n their team n came up with essential pH2....     

Essential was great n hope this be great too..."
"Sound familiar?
One plus : 🤫"
My hope is that one day in the future we have other companies allowed to incorporate iOS into their phones. Imagine a Samsung phone within the Apple ecosystem. I would 100% more likely buy experimental phones as long as I had iOS in it instead of Android.
"@I reply to dumb people No hate? That's the most BS thing I have ever heard, iOS is targeting a different auditory, Android another one, even though most manufacturers want it to look like iOS."
Why would you want ios in Samsung? Android is a much better os than ios. No hate on Apple but ios lacks even the basic android stuff.
"Not going to happen, also... just buy an iPhone?"
Sounds familiar? Yeah oneplus.. we are lookin at you..
throw the @
this is really dope! is this an apple product?
"as a OnePlus fan and owner about to jump to iPhone in the autumn, the story of the OnePlus brand hit hard."
"most important question is, does it come in mat black?"
"I need that phone 😍
I call it the Oblivion phone because it mimics that movie’s aesthetic 🔥🔥"
"Trying to make a new feature work on smart phones in 2022: 
Hey! this our phone, you should use it from behind 😁😁"
is there a phone to those of us that dont have a phone but want to experience what it is holding and looking into a phone all day?
Nokia 3220 - Amateurs 🥱
The advert music for Nokia 3220 is literally playing in my ears right now!
Apple come with glowing Apple logo nothing phones become not a big thing
"As much as I love their Aesthetics, and I really do, when it comes to an android phone, I'm really only looking at three things, battery, camera, and how smooth the OS is. If they can hit those, i'm in."
I think they'll maybe hit 2 out of 3. With how much a camera being good is based on the computational image processing. I doubt theirs will be good right on the first phone. It usually takes a while for phone companies to dial it in.
I look forward to nothing
this phone looks amazing
No references to OnePlus at all 😂
This is doing more of a toy thing than a phone thing..!!
You know nothing! John Snow.
the ringtone led sold me
"Too many gimmicks. Also why bright white color? Why not black? Those led lights in the back would look so much cooler, instead, they went with white on white rofl"
I think NOTHING have studied a lot about iPhones and many other brands that they are gonna do their best to establish something that won't crush just on a first model.. It good to try out after who can blame a guy for trying'😁 otherwise it would be all for nothing! 🤣🤣. As we wait!!!!
I shouldn’t be able to see nothing.
who cares about the back of his phone ???
"Yeah, I'm definitely getting this phone. ♥️"
The LED pattern around the wireless charging area and the one on the top right makes it look like a minimalist line drawing of an Apple logo
Good knock on OnePlus there. Took me a while to get that one 😅
"I feel like this is the G3 iMac's long lost great great great grandson as an iPhone. I love it. I wish Apple would do some of this stuff, especially with lights and translucent glass/plastic."
Nothing is interesting…..
"To be honest, Nobody was expecting that led lights be that good"
Punchhole on the side??
Boy howdy do I love me some gimmicks. Not really. I'll just keep my iphone for the next 5 years like my last one
"Alright, I know Marques said we can only see the back, but yes, the front of the phone is visible a few times. Interestingly enough, it has what seem to be even, thin bezels, with a tiny hole punch camera cutout on the top left side of the screen. Not too much, but nice nonetheless."
"Alright, I know Marques said we can only see the back, but yes, the front of the phone is visible a few times. Interestingly enough, it has what seem to be even, thin bezels, with a tiny hole punch camera cutout on the top left side of the screen. Not too much, but nice nonetheless."
He did all the review just to say what he said in the end
If they sale thier first phone cheap then i am sure most of people will try it and it really depends the prices first then the software and and hardware
I have been following Nothing for a few years now and I am so glad to see they are becoming recognised for their unique design aesthetic
sounds really familiar!
"Apple fan: Nothing beats the iPhone
Android fan: I know right!"
Something tells me that the camera lenses are interchangeable which would be literally mind blowing🤯!!!
"They could just give us what we want...
I mean wouldn't that be enough to make me switch?

Just listen to the things we've been disappointed  about and give us those things in a flagship...everytime...apple or Samsung leaves at least 2 things off...make a phone that gives us that as well and win the game...simple"
"Put rgb on it and all gamers will buy it! 
And maybe a black edition would be nice."
you said you're allowed to only show the back of the phone but you showed everything else 😅
I’m curious how many people naturally sit their phones with the face up or down.  Seems like the major selling point is contingent on consumers placing their phones with the screens facing down.
I was interested as my note 10 contract is coming to a close. Then I saw the price...
Bro it’s the Death Stranding phone
So imagine this the lights plus Morse code would be dope as heck
"I, just, want it!!!"
You are not Maques)
There is also a BLACK ONE of this smartphone. I saw it in a YouTube video.
The back is cool but I will use a case anyway so I don't care.
"The hard part is that if this style becomes popular and apple sees people want the product like this, they will just make it for their phone and make it better and more consumer friendly and than this company becomes obsolete"
But does it have a headphone jack?
"They better put the strongest glass on that phone if you have it face down all the time, especially when shaking it to check the charge."
it's a custom android in an iPhone shell that screams edge lord.
"Still seems pretty gimmicky, but I'm much more of a value and function guy over aesthetic and form. It'll have an audience that will go for it but I expect it will be relatively niche."
That OnePlus diss was smooth 😏
It is too nerdy. I always wear a case like 99% of every person I know. I don‘t understand who needs this phone
i hope they wont charge us 1000 dollars for same phone with adding another camera.
Fukkk iphone.... I want this one !!!! That's too cool !!!!
Am I the only one that noticed that the “glyph” is shaped very similar to the Apple logo?
Better title: The Nothing Phone looks like NOTHING else
RIP. OnePlus 😂😂😂
"Literally the first phone I want just bc of the looks (also prefer the whole punch on the side).
Had one iPhone and a few Galaxy S but for other reasons, its just a bonus that they were not ugly. (Galaxy S20 line is horrible looking and I would skip even if I had money at launch)"
if its got 120hz... im in
im so done with big phones. Give us something iphone mini size
"Having to physically flip the phone over every time I got a notification to see what it said rather than simply looking at the screen as I currently do, I'd see myself disabling the flashing lights for notifications option pretty quickly."
"Go Carl, go!"
Nothing special
CEO had to served time in prison 😂
"Hmmm, me likey"
how about use actual display?!
"this is some of the stupidest shit I've ever seen, ""oooo, lights I can play with"" so dumb 🤦‍♂️"
What color are the bubbles though
Itll be cool if the next phone they release the LEDs are rgb and you can set different colors to apps or contact notifications or ring tones. That would give so much more customization.
Ok wow this *just* might steer me away from the pixel 6a for my next phone
"The look of this phone and the glyph thing is very appealing to me and i imagine to a lot of people out there. Now nothing just have to deliver in terms of software and software support. If they don't skip on popular and now essential things like stereo speaker, hdr amoled display, 120 fps adaptive refresh rate, atleast 4500 mah battery and their commitment of longer software support + bug free stable firmware, they are set for a great start, i just know it ! And on top of that, if they could include micro sd card slot and 3.5 mm earphone jack while keeping the cost down, they will become the heroes everybody has been waiting for in the smartphone industry !!! But i know that's asking too much from a startup... So i would be happy to switch as long as they include the basics i have mentioned and keep the cost in check. Also a charger would be nice."
"It would be cool for the cameras to be tucked in, and they could bring back the bumper cases"
The battery tho?
The design is really nice
Shut up and take my money!
"I like the ""teardown"" look. It's vaguely technical, but still clean thanks to the use of all whites. And the notification light + back display of battery life is smart and neat."
Boo. They promised a completely transparent back and that's what we got. Expected it to look more like the Ear 1.
Cool but I won’t buy it…
"*I Guess There Is ""Nothing"" Interesting About This Nothing Phone*"
This is a pretty cool phone to have ngl
I'm buying one.
The design looks like unfinished iPhone 12.
"Provided they're going very stock Android on the software - which I prefer to all other options just on a UX level anyway - so updates can be fairly reliable, and provided they're available in New Zealand (very few phones are), I think I'll be buying one.
First phone to come out in years that actually feels new, exciting and interesting. It actually looks and feels like the future of phones, but not in a dorky sci fi way. Love it, but I'm still curious about availability and pricing"
RGB lighting would be pretty cool on the phone
"Just a gimmick. Nothing else. 
Tbh people want value for money. These tech gadgets (or phone) are just for the rich ones to have it has a showpiece."
Looks amazing
smartphone case companies are going to have a hard time on this one. Bumper is the only option.
Meh stick with the giants /
"The company should rename to Nowhere.

”I work at Nowhere and we’re doing Nothing”

The ultimate dad joke company"
"Yes, this is incredibly tacky looking and gimmicky, but what's most important to me, is custom rom support. I'm not gonna buy an Android phone it the hardware is super locked and I'll be stuck on one or two Android versions."
"The problem is breaking people out of Apple's ecosystem. Since their ecosystem is so siloed, people who swap out of it, basically have to start with nothing, no music, no apps, no games, no other purchases. It's like leaving an abusive relationship to get a fresh start."
"TechAltar did a video a couple of years back titled something like ""Why enthusiast brands can't last"". It is worth remembering and revisiting. Enthusiast-focused products are a cheap way to build market share before transitioning to higher margin products with a broader market - most consumer electronics 'start ups' are nothing of the sort, and have no loyalty to the 'community' they initally create."
"To be clear, I'll happily buy a Nothing to replace my OnePlus if the first couple of generations are an attractive offer. I just don't intend to evangelise the brand."
"ppl really keep their phones screen down? I never put my phone like this, why? you cant even check time or something w\o flipping it."
"Coded is the sound that would play from my Hewlett Packard computer speakers, moments before a call was going to come in. Getting this just for that."
"why is the light like the apple logo xD
and the phone looks like and iphone xD"
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦✅
imagine putting a non clear phone case on it
"I want one, but it's sad that it will fail, different doesn't succeed and if it does it will eventually fall into generic."
Carl Pei is a genius
that looks like an iPhone 12 with light in the back
I think that's cool. It reminds me of Watch Dogs 2 pattern. Maybe a character from the game has one of these toys.
i saw that marques what you did there in the end. ICU
Reminded me old age Nokia 3220. It was crazy when launched
What is the expected price in india
I was hoping they would do something different with the front camera.
"this phone is very underwhelming, going off you previous headline: looks like apple and Samsung have nothing to worry about"
i like the look but for me the camera and performance is the most important thing on my phone so its gone be a HARD PASS but maybe in the future i buy one
"I bought nothing ear 1 last year and they did pretty cool job with that price range.

Coming to this phone, it looks pretty awesome and certainly that led will push people like me to go for it. I am pretty sure they will give specs which will nicely sit alongside competitors.

UI is the only thing which can make or break this brand a huge success. No matter how much people curse Samsung but it's ultra smooth UI attracts customers."
"""Dope"" it's not."
"The masses will not buy this phone. The niche crowd might get this. But no, they will not sell well."
OnePlus doesn't even sell to the masses. In the western market at least. Nothing has a long rough road ahead of them before they can reach the mass market.
Bro why the mobile phone company price their phones very higher price .
Nothing is looks more professional then others you showed
+1
"If you gonna put a bunch of leds on the back, arrange them in a matrix to make them actually useful."
"So happy you're still doing so well reviewing tech. Been watching since 2012, so proud of your success 🙌"
@Em Dblyou 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lol are you his dad?
6 minute video? Really?
That shot at Apple was nice
Not bad
"Personally, that isn't enough for me to switch to an unknown brand. It's cool they're trying to enter the market and I hope they do well. Some flashing LEDs on the back though just isn't ""LG"" enough of different for me."
"2014 : Lets make smartphone, what to do hmmm CyanogenMod 
2022 : Lets make smartphone, what to do hmmm Lights"
“Nothing” special!
What in the Star Trek
It looks like an Phone 12 with flashlights visible
Symmetrical bezels 😍
"DBrand or other case manufacturers  will have to either make a clear case or will need to have gaps to show that lights otherwise ther is ""Nothing"" signigicant left in the phone"
It's totally killed apple and samsung Higher range phone
Love the one plus reference at the end.😂😂😂
Anyone who knows just knows
"Marques, I love the voice you bring to the world! Thanks!"
No slider?
So what’s the point of a notification at the back of a phone
This is dumb
Stormtrooper phone
I'm looking forward to this. I hope I can run lineage os in this.
looks cool but for $1199 I don't think they have a chance in the phone market
One Plus felt the insult...
"""Sound Familiar?"" - The sad part is you can say that about more manufacturers than not these days. 

To this day I miss my wacky unique designed sony mp3 players. I think Mr Mobile nailed it best. ""When phones were fun..."""
Buy one get tracked 4free lmao
I actually loved the design and back LED light functionality
"I am buying this phone no matter what this phone turns out to be,,,, it would be just a cool memoir in the future,this phone is already   quite unique ...."
"""Sound familiar "" yes... story of OnePlus"
Tht led thing is insane
Too bad it will be running Android 💔
"Well, that definitely works. I'm in. All they need is stock android with 5 years security updates and zero bloatware. And boom, I'm back into android. I've only been considering samsung and google flagships, nice to see one more guy in the boat."
"Add some blue in key parts, make an R2 D2 Edition and take my money!!!! This phone just makes me think in a Droid Edition Phone."
Boring Phone
Looks good to me 👍🏼
Iphone on the back shit on the front
"😭what camera does this guy use, I was literally watching on 480p and I thought it was 720p"
Reduce it to a iPhone 12 lol it could be so lucky to be a iPhone 12
"6:07 .........
If you know, you know 😏"
"These guys must really think we look at the back of our phones alot, ps: we don't"
All the OnePlus folks are gonna jump onto nothing phone for sure. I know I'm gonna.
"Sounds familiar 
Hello oneplus 😂😂"
"anyone notice the Apple PowerBook G3 (Pismo?) on the desk?  ( yes, i'm old :) 
wondering if there's a connection.

The PowerBook G3 at least had a battery level led strip, like the Nothing phone, as well as an illuminated logo on the ""back"" (ie lid).

probably i'm forgetting some other similarities. the two are at least design icons."
it has the iphones aesthetics even in the ui kind of and all totality its really dope. looking forward!
we ain't gonna put no case on the back?
6:32 oh yeah I recognize that kind of a deal. My Oneplus 3 still holds up well after six years though. Can't wait to get a hold of the Nothing Phone!
"anyone: ""hey what's that?"" 










nothing."
@THE CRIMSON MISOGYNIST!  Cos there’s nothing to say 😜
I counted 3 replies plus mine lol
1.9 k like
What? You couldn’t have at least programmed the bots to make a few replies? Like you did for your likes 💀
I love how you have 1.8k likes but no replies
one + was supposed to be developers phone…it was an exciting time at XDA
OMG I was just in the market to replace my oneplus 7 pro and this looks amazing! Definitely gonna wait a month and try it out since this team feels like the real OnePlus.
"Dude, if I was deaf/HoH I would be so pumped about those light patterns for notifications!"
Seems cool. I think by third generation it may be a really good option
Does sound familiar
Finger print is there or not 🥺🥺
That last “ sounds fimilier? “— 😂😂
"Actually love the design! The overall body of the current iPhone with the transparent back - which is kinda special. But what I dig the most is, that it has a flat screen with no edges, narrow bezels and a small hole punch. 

I really hope it does come with an adaptive 120hz display, a fast in-display fingerprint reader, snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor and an almost stock android experience. Then I’d consider to switch as a long time apple fanboy 🤩"
Mannnnn this is a dope phone. I feel like other companies will “borrow” elements of this phone and “improve” or edit them in some way. Glad to see another option for a nice looking phone appear.
I would like the ring tones.
"Congratulations 🎊 🥳🥳
Message me on telegram 🔝 🔝"
Sound familiar? OnePlus....
"this is all cool, but why wouldn’t i just flip my phone over to see any of this…very gimmicky, esp bc i use a case…is this a ploy to keep ppl from using cases so as to sell more phones?"
Sounds familiar??? One plus 😂
@Telegram👉MK_BHD  why?
Gimme!
"They should do something in the software so can you uso some rigtones, or music, idk, where you can choose what light will pop. It would be a blast."
Epilepsy disclaimer
Completely roasted apple at the end :/ hehe
Just a new gimiki phone 😅
Sony should team up with this company to make the best smartphones ever
F in the chat for OnePlus
Sadly this phone is not made for people with epilepsy like myself :(
"Those ringtones are awful, I like the phone though"
"From a design aspect, this is the first Android phone that has impressed me in a long time.  Just slapping some different colors on a phone (the 3 examples in the video) just isn't enough anymore.  This super clean clear back with all white internals and the creative use of LEDs really speaks to me."
Ikr it’s almost like a iPhone had a baby wit a android but the iPhone’s genes overpowered
"@Daniel Kaschel Without mass appeal, they'll make next to no money and end up shutting up shop because they literally cannot turn enough of a profit to operate."
Believe in Jesus Christ
"@Cyber_Photography No, I just don't get where you're coming from.  Everything has been so boring for so long now unless you have a think for folding phones...and I don't because I don't like the delicate screens and the slight distortion you feel with your finger in the bend when using them annoys me.  There used to be more experimentation in the Android world but for years now it just seems to be similar designs with the occasional color difference.

So yes, you're all worked up over nothing and assuming I meant iPhones were any different just because I didn't specifically criticize them in a video about an Android phone.  At least that's best I can figure out what you're on about."
"@iammike yes I was replying to you and no I wasn't ""worked up""

Literally the only argument you ever here from anyone these days being criticised is ""your worked up"" ""your pissed"" etc etc

Those words leaving your mouth are enough for me to know my point was valid and you don't have a counter.

Enjoy"
"Notification lights died because they gave way to oled screens with always on displays, that was a good innovation, this seems to go backwards, it's almost retro-future."
I was gonna get an iPhone XS/11 but now I want this as long as it’s £400>
So I wont be able to throw a dbrand skin on it!
Who has their phone face down when charging
"This looks awesome! Slapping glowing lights onto anything makes it about 10x more interesting, but this really does look like a very useful feature, I would love to try it out"
This video is 3 hours old and has 1.5 million views already?!!
Those ringtone lights are for sure going to scare the crap out of me in the middle of the night in a dark room
If smart phones came out in the 80s
"The tones, the lights and the back are sci fi sick"
These guys will be sued so hard because of this design.
Those led lights can be used as  darth wader with light saber as back case
Just a wish iphone
The iphone without a notch is ugly
"From what I am seeing, I would buy the phone if the price and expectations are met."
I hope they don't abandoned back led hope it develop more and more
"They need to add more LED colors, not just white"
Great design i love it👌👌
"They definitely have my attention. If it performs well and the price is right, I'll buy."
""" i can only ahow you the back of the phone"" ....: Proceeds to show us the ui"
"It's cool, finally something fresh and new with android as OS!"
"i was going to buy an iPhone in a months time, but if this is out by then i might just buy it :D"
Who charges a phone with the screen facedown? The back is 'interesting' but I never see the back of my phone.
Basically a phone with some leds
"That glow on the back for cameras is something I wanted for a long time compared to flash or a night mode, but it’s not enough to make me switch away from my iPhone 13 mini. I’d like to see Apple or a third party come out with a MagSafe accessory that can utilize LEDs like this."
"Looks good design, but I think the back led is more like a gimmick, since most people will put a back cover....

Looking forward to the real features and and pricing to consider switching..."
I ordered a phone and got Nothing
The whole light feature is completely useless with a case lmao
Battery life: tee fiddy
"I think this is the best back idea of a phone I have seen in years, love the idea and implementation. It has that Aliens movie look to it. Cool."
ok l see it ok
"I wish phone manufacturers would bring back grippy premium materials like leather or wood for the backs of their phones. Hell, if you wanted to be modern (and possibly infringe on a Lamborghini patent) you could use forged carbon. Phone design peaked with the 3rd gen Moto X"
like the looks of it. need to know the internals
This looks really nice and cool.
"If they can add Traditional 3.5mm headphone jack, would be added 👍 advantage."
So Gimmicky
"That subtle dig at one plus 🥲
But so true tho got the one plus 1,3,6,7(only one that got spoilt cz of the pop up camera) ,8 and all of them work perfectly well till date but when I went to see the new one plus it was so disappointing"
Aren’t there any smartcases app combo’s that could emulate the LED “features”?
"You should do a video on anime like what animes you've watched, which ones you want to watch in future and anime themed tech that you own."
Looks like Star Wars phone 🤔
Reminds me of the Nokia 3220
"For all that's worth, you can actually install nothing launcher and get a taste of the UI. It's pretty amazing from official wallpapers to icon packs to widgets and ringtones. Go on give it a try."
"WELL, promise 5 years of  updates and I will be very intersted"
this is gimmicky as hell
"Why does it look like a mock-up from Apple? And no Marques, that's not cool 😂"
"Waiting for Carl Pie to respond to the last bit about ""Sounds familiar?"""
"They created a very different design, I liked it!"
"So pointless. A perfect Android phone would be one that’s a 7” S22+ with Xiaomi’s camera hardware, Oppo’s computational algorithm, Samsung’s UI, and 6000+ mAh battery"
Hope this one doesn’t end up like one plus
"Nothing will become the next Oneplus, I'm wondering now what the next company will be called."
I would 100% get that phone.
I really REALLY hope this phones turns out actually being good. The design is so dope seriously.
imagine a black version with Tron: legacy Clu's orange accent!
Can we see the front of the phone
"Will be interesting after the hype if it's actually any good, if  the ear buds are anything to go by it will have nothing good other than nice LEDs which is the only thing you can show, maybe the only thing that actually works as the screen and lag did not seem all that great."
I would like to get this phone
Wait... I see LTT! :)
"Nokia 3310 Review: The Perfect Smartphone?!
is this still the perfect smartphone in 2022?
i really thought of buying at least one unit. no joke. refurbished"
Am hooked
"Loved the ""sounds familiar?"""
"Sounds too familiar to OnePlus History for me, Marquees @MKBHD Also, i will like to see a Mate Black version, and I'm pretty sure they can take my money..."
I want to buy this
The oneplus dig at the end lol
I am excited to hear the specs and the price. I think the design overall is still boring but the lights do bring the phone to life a bit.
Man those ring tones sound like shit
"got pretty existential at the end there, hahaha"
Does it have blue text bubbles?
It's impressed me I gotta buy It's impressed me. I gotta buy this
RGB phones Incoming!
Who also does use his keyboard as a novation launchpad at the beginning of almost every video? 😅
Thats the coolest phone design ive ever seen o.O
It made me remember the Nokia 3220. Back when Nokia phones were different and each line had its own gimmick.
We dont have enough RGB on phones yet lmao
"Looks amazing, but stock android ruins it for me :("
I actually like almost every ringtone 😅 and I'm curious about this phone.
6:31 yea it does sound very familiar!
The last 📌 was for OnePlus now which is basically oppo & Carl pei should utilize on Nothing phone
Those ring tones are the death of ears all over the world
Mf which phone
Hope Apple adds this led features by 2034. cant wait.
"Hummmm.... still looks like an Iphone 12... 
😁"
"I came from the future, so mark my words that 2nd generation gonna have rgb (colorfull or rainbow) lights , I can tell because that's how it started for PC lights. 
Other than that I think the grandfathers of rgb phones was nokia 3220"
"Any company that demands half assed reviews such as this, is trash in my book.  This is a way to get free extra publicity and big YouTubers such as yourself should not be enabling such behaviour."
"You gross me out with the pride shirt, I couldn't keep watching and disliked the video"
"A:What did you get from the store?
B:Nothing😂"
what i like more is the placement of front facing camera cut out
i even thought it was an iPhone from the back! LOL!
"the way he said ""I'm sure there's a clear case coming from nothing "" 😂🤚🏽"
Looks like a phone
Not sure how i would feel constantly resting the phone on its screen and having to turn it around to actually look whats happening. I can understand when someone wants this phone but im pretty happy with my LG Wing with a clear back mod
OnePlus
"i own the ear 1s and they are great, this phone looks great and i cant wait to see even more regarding its software etc. huge fan of what nothing is doing already"
It's sure not the Nothing Phone anymore
The led notification would be useful for those who are hard of hearing or deaf. I can see this phone being used for a specific demographic or those who wants something unique.
"I like the idea of soft dispersed led lights on the back. Also, the fact that the phone is made by Nothing is a funny thing to say."
*After seeing the Ringtone with LED function I am convinced that these people can make an R2-D2.*
"Please remember Sony Xperia U, P & S series about the LED strip lights with multicolours at the bottom. It's not new I think..."
Lol first reveal the budget specs 💀
If it doesn't have expandable micro SD card I won't even consider.
"If I'm being honest, it looks kinda stupid."
One minus
Id buy
"Love it... and I'd buy into that lighting and ring tone feature for sure, but I'm really concerned it won't keep up with the camera and general performance of my flagship Sanmsung (and other similar top tier) phone(s)."
"@Daley Carter totally fair. I use my cameras for work pretty consistently which is why it matters to me so much. I guess I should say, I hope they do make a flagship phone of their own with amazing cameras and software that ALSO has this really awesome lighting and ring tone feature!"
"I'd be fine with that so long as it doesn't have a flagship price tag.

I can live with half decent cameras, and the performance of the software on phones these days is so negligible with each iteration.

I have a Z flip 3 because I thought it was a fun phone, and I feel the same about this. As long as the UI is nice and it can be a daily driver without any noticeable annoyances, I'd be down to buy this"
Hopefully Nothing is smart enough not to have their phones built in China. There will be a Chinese rip off company selling their exact spec for a quarter of the price.
A company listening to the needs of their customers?!?  What a novel idea...  I hate that my S20 doesn't have a notification LED.  Who thought it was a good idea to get rid of it?
Those ringtones are so cool
"That reference at the end, aren't the original founders of One Plus in charge of this phone?"
I love MKBHD but this video had literally no substance. Embargo again?
"I feel that the flash notification is so wrong, gonna make people even more addict to their smartphone with those flashes even when the phone is put on the screen..."
those notification sounds are awful lol
Atleast show us the software... lol
"So, What OS is running on this? Android?"
❤️👍
"Sounds familiar
*Caugh*1plus*caugh*"
"I think looks are way below in priorities when it comes to buying a phone. If it is anything like their earbuds, say goodbye to the company"
Feeling good about the nothing phone can't wait for it to come out hopefully they don't turn out like OnePlus.
se ve muy chingon!
Boring tbh. All that is just a gimmick. I hope they grow and improve as a company. But they won’t having me changing from an iPhone any time soon.
"Fun fact : there is Linus tech tips mouse pad in  short .

... And in this video as always informative"
"iPhone: gives us a water pistol emoji 🔫 
Nothing Phone: *Fully automatic ringtones!*"
"I would buy it!

As long as the camera and display are A+  grade."
If they make a foldable version like the Galaxy Fold they would have my money for sure!
"Sounds familiar? Yes, OnePlus , lol"
"It's funny coz I'm one of those long time fanbase. And now, I'm typing this comment on my new Galaxy s22."
"The last question, Yes, sounds familiar with One plus story 😅"
wait i actually am kinda into this
"The should collab, like by looks of it, it should be Nothing*apple iphone14"
"Thanks for the video. When watching, I thought who cares how to back of the phone looks and it is all about software and hardware. Now am really surprised after seeing the comments that folks are interested to switch to this because of lights. Am sure they do realized they have to keep the phone always screen down to see those lights and of course they can't do that when wireless charging. Makes sense.. eh!!"
Dope
Lol the back would be useless after you put on your cover which you will
One plus!!!!!
"Sound familiar
Coughing in 1+"
Follow up trend like oneplus
This is an ecosystem I want to be with.
that shade was definitely for onePlus :)
gimicky
"As a Oneplus user since 3 years now nothing phone is Looking great but ...
Speed,Battery size,Phone size ,
Cameras,
Software features,
Screen and everything else it is just not enough for me at any given price !  so I have to pass this time but still wish that Nothing company will continue to raise, innovate and build a real flagship phone one day  until then best wishes"
cool. but nothing compares to Nokia Morph
"So, it's like Teenage Engineering made a phone?"
"Plot twist : When they reach making the ""very broadly appealing phone"" stage, they launch a new brand - ""Something"". Rinse and repeat ♻"
"I think the phone looks cool and is clean. Interested to see how it performs doing normal ""phone"" stuff; cameras, battery life, etc."
The most awaited information is here ❤️
YES PLEASE!
Gimmicks
This phone would be an excellent candidate to use a real good bumper case.
I'll buy it.
....... I want it
Wow cool new idea definitely selling point. Certainly not a copy of RBG and many phones screen will light and vibrate on different notifications. Also charging animation quite neat feature don't even need to shake the phone
"Too white for my tastes. After all that marketing in dark tones, I expected a black phone... Cool ideas for the LEDs on the back, but... nothing you can't really live without. It will be appealing for someone who look for a phone different on the external part."
"Yep, down for it, would drop my iPhone for that, hope the UI is as interesting as the device, I'm thinking along the lines of Ratio by Blloc. Does it come in black ?"
"Transparency is complete turn off for me personally, but I really like the ringtone/glyph synergy."
I am so excited 😃
"I guess the weight would be more than 200 gms if the phone size is 6.7 inc. It’s a thicker one though. The bezel is not much thin as S22. It’s like that of iPhone’s. I’m really waiting for a compact phone from nothing. But it seems like a bigger, thicker phone with good amount of weight."
I'm honestly surprised that dbrand hasn't done more colabs with companies to license designs with big characters and properties.
Im already loving the back aesthetic 😍
The shade at OnePlus 🙃
"Dude, that part when you were talking about how nothing can become oneplus,, so dramatic ++"
"If next iPhone camera shape changed ""nothings"" goona have a new camera shape"
"Looks like an iPhone but has the spirit of the old OnePlus phones. I'm interested, depending on the price and whatnot.

However I'm not going to go in thinking this will be the enthusiast phone and after some time, they change and feel ""betrayed"" or ""abandoned"". Remember, while they're still starting up, this is a company and over time they will do things you're not going to like. They're a company, they only care about your money."
Those LED light functionality is a game changer!! Looking forward to this phone.
I wouldn’t say a game changer lol
Imagine if it's Android 🤫
He looks Somalian
"All of that is fine, but they are going to have to be just as innovative on the software side. I don't know if they can pull that off."
0:13 - That even screen bezel all the way around. 😌👌
"May not gel with everyone, the target would be a limited audience, case can’t be used and all that would matter would be a seamless software, I use their Ear (1) and I must say it has lots and lots of bugs and I wrote to Nothing, and yeah you guessed it, Nothing happened!!"
What’s dope? … Nothing! 😏👍✨
"Cool design no doubt, I wish they had shown some metal, maybe the charging coil at least. That White and Copper duo would've been 🤌"
R.I.P 1+
We're officially going backwards. Now we don't care what the phone does on the screen. We want to see what it does in the back.
Hear me out… could someone make a case with these LED strips on the back of it that gets its power through wirelessly charging and can connect via Bluetooth to the phone with an app that lets you customise the ringtone as well.
"This right here is what I consider a threat to Nothing’s business model. A case would probably be cheaper, flexible and does not require commitment. The phone is exciting, however I don’t believe it can stand against Apple or Samsung long term. In order to win, Nothing has to bring to the table something that none of the existing phones offer. It’s an incredibly tough market but kudos to them, as an industrial design fanatic, I’m thrilled by the design."
"Not gonna lie, they've managed to pack way more functionality into these leds, than I've thought. It's enough for it to be more than just a gimmick. It's nice not to be disappointed for once."
"@PRIME12602 I expected *nothing* 😋 They called out Apple so many times during their presentations that I could already tell they won’t have anything original.

Being a startup doesn’t mean you can’t design something original, it’s not a question of money, just creativity."
@Team Puzel expectations man we expecting a lot form a startup.
"@PRIME12602 The point is, it’s just very derivative of already existing products. Apple was inspired by Braun designs from the 50s. Not their competition.

I’m trying to look at Nothing from an industrial design perspective, and all they do is tweak what already exists on the market, it’s nothing new. As their name implies there’s nothing to learn from them, their phone is just boring. 

They’re trying to replace design with style but that won’t get them very far. You may like that style, but it doesn’t make it innovative. It’s not better it’s just different for the sake of being different."
"@Team Puzel “90% stolen design” you comparing to iPhone, it’s like saying Genshin impact looks similar to legend of Zelda breath of the wild. It is correct but it’s just a similar and there is nothing more to it. 

Here Nothing looks better than iPhone except iPhone 4 that was a masterpiece."
@Silver Joystix cuz a lot of people put their phones upside down so that they don’t get distracted easily and focus on people or work but they get anxious on what might be happening and this will let them know and will be less distracting(cuz it will tell what is happening that is it important enough to pick up the phone) and a lot of people keep their phone silent in a lot of places that led will let you know if it important or can be dealt with later.
M bored of apple and android both. Need a new player. Also was expecting a bit more info/ showcasing of the front and screen and ui as well.
Abandoning the fan base... Exactly what happened with Carl Pei - OnePlus. Hopefully with Nothing being a VC funded company it won't turn out like OP being the sister company of OPPO and then getting completely absorbed into Oppo
marques is so impressed you can tell lol
Betaabi se intzaar
This is an interesting design and concept. We need some notifications like this. But now..am worried about the battery with that powerful lits😅🤣
I doubt anyone using Samsung or apple would switch to this. Honestly start ups really need to focus on something else because smartphones are really a monopoly between the two
Sounds so familiar 😂😂
looks like the ipear from grand theft auto c:
nice flat sides c:
"It will great to have a RGB back light
But white also look great"
Remember Motorolla E398 with custom Firmware?
Alert slider 😑😑
If the nothing phone was running iOS it would be the best phone ever made
Lowkey reminds me of what the nextbit robin tried to do
what's the site?
"New Hope .
New OnePlus ..
Yeahh It’s Nothing …"
"best review I have seen, of the nothing phone so far. looking forward to see the full review when it comes out officially."
Nothing could be cooler
"The real question is: ""will it come in matte black?"""
Sounds familiar 😅
"That’s an iPhone basically, 14 or whatever, with LEDs"
"""Let's make a set of new features that requires the user to keep the phone down on it's screen without a case...""  "" Brilliant, yes let's do it. That's very beneficial for the customer"""
Anyone remember the One Plus X? Was my favourite phone and genuinely a unique offering at the time. This reminds me of that in a lot of ways. Cant wait to see a full review!
Reminds me of tge old nokias that lit up and danced to the ringtone
Gonna put a case on the phone
i would buy it
Came here from androwide channel ❤
now im super excited for the black version. i wonder if its gonna have a white pattern on black back or not
It is sure Dbrand is going to make light cutout case but jerryrig everything not going to make transparent back stickers 😂 😂 lol
pixel 5 huh
"I turn my phone on the back to make sure no lights can interrupt my sleep and this phone has a notification led on the back, great"
Very excited for this phone..... waiting for 12th July
"If black version comes with red or purple lights, im in!!!!"
The real question: was that a PowerBook G3 in the background?
I don't really see a problem with this type of phone like many other YouTubers say that no today's smartphones aren't boring they are improving from inside but I think that something that doesn't look interesting from look that will be no differ than othe phone but nothing had made something really interesting atleast by looks of phone 1 so I like it
I love Marques no hate but the fact he has nothing bad to say about the phone means that’s it a paid promotion
probably under embargo so he is barred from saying anything yet.
I wanna know why do people hype a gimmick
Seen this one coming. Top YouTuber  being one of the first to give a first impressions of the Nothing Phone. Get ready Nothing to get compared to a Samsung phone like every other smartphone to show how inferior your new Smartphone is compared to a Samsung.
Bro I haven't even looked at the back of my phone for so long and I'm still at 1:16
"Couldn’t they have called it a better name. “ what phone is that you have, it’s a nothing “. 😬"
My phone has a feature that lets me know who is calling me. It's called the screen...
"Sounds familiar?
OnePlus looking at this video: ......"
Ringtone visualization with LED's are cool to watch. Design is unique but not so appealing. But its a good start and hope to see the best from Nothing.
The Nothing phone looks different from IPhone 12 because it runs on android.
All those ringtones sound like R2D2!!
Bro those are star wars - style ringtones. Im sold!
Dang man definitely a nod at one plus in the end lol
I don't understand why it exists
U removed the bulky chin from the bottom now u won! N phone lets go
Am only interested in the front uniform flat bevels
"Innovation in 2022: 
Here are some lights"
Take my money 💰
Can it wirelessly charge an iPhone
"If I buy a fancy looking phone, then I would at most put a clear cover on it. I like how phones look by themselves."
Swapping with my OnePlus when this gets released.
"6:29 That’s shitty OnePlus! 
Carl Pei would certainly change OnePlus strategy, but unfortunately the other team, they have screwed the brand. I was OnePlus fan once. 

Good to see Carl Pei getting new things for NOTHING

I believe in you Carl ! Just get the fans back again. We need stock OS & fast charging."
"This is exactly what apple should do to the notch , this display and the deign looks great , imagine the iphone without the notch."
look and Design copy xiaomi note 7 pro  😄😄😄
Think I saw these guys on shark tank
4:09 Be careful. You might get a copyright strike from Deathgrips...
Looks like an iphone clone
Looks like another iPhone 12 except the notch and the design of the backplate
Gimmick
6:28 sure does.......1+🙄
Yes to the clear back phones!
"Nothing will never be ""the same."""
just imagine those LEDs in RGB.
"I mean this does look pretty cool, but why are the ringtones made up of the most harsh, disgusting, eardrum wrecking sounds possible? _Clearly_ nobody who worked on this phone has the benefit of being autistic! The light patterns, also, would benefit from even _just a little_ fade in/out, even if it’s just 0.1 seconds. I really do like the idea of this phone and many of the ideas they’ve used, but the current implementation makes this an _absolute_ sensory nightmare. I really hope they polish up these sharp edges though, as it’s lovely to see this kind of innovation in the smartphone market. Keep it up guys, but seriously, hire an autistic nerd or two - we’re _really_ not that hard to find 😂"
I really like that design if it runs IOS i would use it over an iphone
"iPhone SE that we all wanted.
If the price is right ..."
This looks like something that would be on cyberpunk. I actually dig it
"6:32 as a OnePlus owner who is hugely disappointed with this company, i feel personally attacked"
Nobody is gonna mention that it has zero chin which is hard to see in android phones
"But the nothing phone also looks like the masses of phones on the market already...
Actually, Nothing phone has really nothing special apart from the hype"
Shout out to One+ lol
"While i understand that the ringtones fit the theme they were going for, but they kinda just sound awfull to me :( very scratchy and glitchy ) but the lights sync up to them is awesome :)"
Cyberpunk
So you're only allowed to show the back of the phone? Nice hype piece
"Obviously, you can tell this phone rips off the cheaper iPhone 12 and 13 models"
Notifications lighting is cool but this also means we cannot use a case cover with it. Thus making it more fragile.
If they let us unlock the bootloader and they are developer friendly I would buy it and recommend this phone to other. I use oneplus but their days are over. But they do let us root our software and still kept the guarantee
Where can I buy that T-shirt ?
Who are funding these start ups?
Great and I depth look at this. Thanks as always ☺️
6:08 damn Marques hit Oneplus hard with that one.
"Too much for a start-up company,  the market doesn't need fancy it needs functionality. He should do the testing with African Market and see if the people will like it. All Chinese phones have had a big breakthrough in African markets and even Huawei was the leading in Kenya before they were kicked out of Android."
Another bullshit in production.
iPhone 15  be look like.
when are we going to see IOS in other phone companies? that would be cool
All the time this phone gonna stay upside down
Ending was like a flashback from 2014 to Present!
Did he change his name?
wasnt he only he allowed to show the back of the phone?
Hmm... that means we can only get a transparent case?
Black Transparent With Red Led looks dope in my views 😍
They just imitate apple design as close as possible. not very impressive especially since the OS will never match IOS
I like it. A phone from the movie Tron.
"Actually I really love the way they sell their products online, with real photo shooting. It gives the company a ""braun"" classic and futuristic style that even apple has lost."
Good thing Samsung consistently makes beautiful futuristic style
Isnt this the guy who left Oneplus before it turned to shit? Only this time he doesnt have another Ceo to interfere with his design.
"that's the stockx 100 serial phones that are being auctioned off. not worth it, but also not the official msrp."
"clicked 'buy now' to reveal the price
sent me to some 3rd party with a price of $2700"
The bad news is it’s yet another Google carrot on a stick piece of spyware to feed Google’s 90+ percent data collection revenue model. Boo.
"its one plus all over again, rinse and repeat."
now just make it rgb
Its a Fancy led light..
"it's the future concept for mobile phone, definitely for sure"
But the lights on the back look abstractly like an Apple logo. Am I the only one who sees this?
The ending statement said.. RIP ONE PLUS
2 MIN SILENCE FOR ONEPLUS AND REDMI FANS😂😂🥲
It's been a long time since I've fallen in love ❤️
Oh I like this.. It's different and I would definitely get this as my next phone. And if I do get a case it would be a clear plastic or glass backing. It's a kinda cool phone.
"REMEMBER: expectation is the key to disappointment; don't get your hopes up too high, lest we end up with another Nothing ear."
"super excited to tell anyone with the flash on, to turn it off. Pretty dumb idea"
3:52 ha god finally found an editing error in your video
Dbrand should make a case for this that is transparent and as resistent as the grip.
First I thought it’s iphone and customize it
i know where LG  employees went. If you know you know
define cool
notification lights. one of the most underrated feature in a smartphone.
Hey mkbhd i thought you said you can only show the back of the phone lol
It's a very niche product. They may be able to sell a few but ultimately I don't think It will take off.
"Finally something different, it’s like a nexgen Nextel antenna light .💡"
Whole video is about one odd feature in phone. That’s not ok strategy
I really like the light functions and this phone to be very useful for a lot of things it’s just the first gen but this could be the start of something very useful especially if you decide to use your phone as your main video camera for example how bright is it is a flashlight lessons again shipping question
"Damn !! The features are very impressive! I hit on sales for iPhone and will be doomsday for them for making all us fool In the name sake of cutting the adapter away from sales package!! Tim can't cook !! But this phone has a weird name ""nothing"". Just Carl, pie or pei!! Anyways, do you've a comparison video on best TWS ?"
Now let's see how Dbrand designs the skins for the phone.
this is really goddamn good
Is it waterproof?
This thing is awesome!
Wow❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
iPhone - Android Edition
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE
The Iphone 12 looks like the Nothing phone..
Finally a phone that's a bit more than a glass sandwich. This is one of the sexiest phones I ever seen in quite a while. I love minimalistic yet refined designs
Nothing new 😑
I got one of the premium Motorola phones and I was so amused by the ringtones also controlling vibrations to the beat it was so cool and then they removed it. 😭
One plus thaakapattar!
The lights function is very practical I like it a lot I think they should definitely continue with this theme maybe even include an RGB light strip within the light in panel and have different uses for the back of your phone I like it a lot I very much might even buy this phone if the camera video function is good enough for me
Ooh! Shots Fired @6:25
Does it run on android?
Seems mostly like a gimmick that goes away once you put a case on.
NOTHING basically copies Apple Designs and tweaks it just enough.
"Bruh what the fuck is this, rip-off apple?"
"nothing copied two concepts of apple
1.glowing something at back(apple logo) 
2.brick design.... 
please don't copy the price yaar(nothing but a request) 😅😅"
It looks very similar to the iPhone in terms of design the only thing is different is lights I don’t think that will be enough to challenge Samsung and apple so their OS better be good
why focus that much on the back of the phone. 99% of the time it is not visible to the user. looks like another gimmick to me.
looks like an iphone
"Those ringtones make my ears bleed but otherwise, looks cool 👍"
"I really dont like the way Nothing has situated themselves, with all drops going through stockX and devices being limited. It feels like OnePlus, but rebranded to fit the hypebeast trend."
"Man I really miss the days of weird, innovative experimental smart phones. I genuinely hope this phone is good and more than just its attractive gimmick."
Damn everyone gonna hate those ppls who will use this retarded fkn already annoying ringtones. Hope noone will use it
The front screen is crazy. No bottom bezel like other android and just one pinhole at the top.
That tooo on the left corner....👍
"Well, the bet is about software updates and overall support.
If it is a real startup as it shows, it will be another failure.
But I have the sense that big funds are behind, and then again, why they didn't tell from the beginning?
Really frustrating"
"In the end, it's more important how it performs than how it looks like."
Those ringtones are dope AF
"Sure I like it, but I’ve always had an apple device as phone. So I’m not intrigued to switch to something else that also has another OS. But if I had something like a Samsung, I would definitely switch."
"Oh I'm definitely up for the nothing ph1. I have the Nextbit Robin, I have the Essential Ph-1, this just seems like a natural progression. 🔥🧨🔥"
What a great phone...but I wish the LEDs were blue..
You said i am allowed to show only back of the phone but you forgot that while showing notification light  features 🤫
Am I the only one who really don't like it???
"I sort of hate this one feature preview/review of to be launched phones. If one doesn't like that feature, say its design, I don't think withholding more information which might appeal to that person is a good idea. Brands will do anything for clicks."
"Samsung front, Apple back"
6:15 he is talking about oneplus
"When I flip my phone over, it usually means I don’t want to be distracted and this phone wants to take that away"
It's a sponsorship isn't it!?
"Neat? I definitely would like to see more fun phone designs. Though this seems like a meh strategy. There's the mainstream phones like apple and samsung, there's phones that innovate like Sony's Xperia, and this is sort of... A hipster Iphone? Well now that ive phrased it that way, yes I understand why they went with this strategy."
"Times when One Plus was OG and Carl Pie was with it ,, RIP One plus"
Most interesting thing highlighted by @MKBHD @6:01
Is this video a joke?
"It’s a really interesting phone , I like the back lighting function for notifications or charing. But sadly I don’t use android 😿"
"The design looks pretty clean so far. The light gimmick is cool but I expect to see almost no users actually use the feature. The main thing I am waiting to see are things like actual specs, cost, and if the Android OS is skinned or stock and if it is skinned will they actually stay up to date or is this gonna be stuck on like Android 11/12 then be unusable in 3-4 years when no apps support it any longer. Only a month until we find out I guess."
I'm literally waiting for nothing
"The notification lights usually made me go crazy, a little light that burned my vision, this seems more… light."
fuss at YouTube to be able to like at certain point in time in the YouTube videos and comments as well.
(6:00) DISCLAIMER: Oneplus was not harmed in this video!!
Predator Tech
"3:49 ""So when you see a certain light pattern, even when the phone is muted, you know who is calling just by looking at it."" I've got good news for you! Flip the phone over and you can even see their name and maybe a picture ;)"
The ringtones remind me of the Nokia 3310 Era. Obnoxious noises
Is it comes with the Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 ?
"I feel a black background with the white light would be sick. or different RGB. and paired with an airplay type thing with the pods or even a watch, etc!"
"Awesome product. Long life Nothing.
Unlike NEXBIT..."
6:31 sounds like OnePlus lol 🤣
"This screen design is so beautiful to me, how hard is it for Apple to implement this instead of their ugly notches."
"I'm hyped to see, how this is gonna turn out. I love my oneplus, but they have made some bad decitions the last couple of years and if nothing can do it better, i might switch as soon as my phone has to be replaced.
Only time will tell."
They have that's why the the co creater of one plus left to make this company. Nothing. And he bringing the innovation back like he did when one plus was going up.
"""yoo thats a nice phone! what kind of phone is it?""

""oh its nothing."""
"It's pronounced OnePlus, Marques."
"come to think of it, the back led kinda reminds me of the apple logo? not that it is intentional but the led surrounding the wireless charger and its stem kinda just reminds me of it???"
"It's not familiar, just predominantly different from what you think. Yeah, i know what you think, apple fan boy."
I'd love to know the price point of this phone cause all I can find is about 2500€ and that's a 1000€ more than the fold phones or iPhone pro maxes
Really exited about this one! Something different and no 0815 shit!
I Don't like that 😕
"I mean if i was in the market for a phone & the software on this ends up being good, I would hands down seriously consider this phone along things like the s22 ultra or 13 pro max."
Looks like iPhone clone
ripped off iphones so bad lol can anyone design??? super sad
Awesome videos bro 😎
its got each part that looks like it can be easily replaced or have customization. that is sick
The future is now
Is there a rumored price?
Hmm this weird glyph in the back of the phone seems rather familiar 🤔. If you combine the big round thing in the middle with the diagonal line in the top right corner you get a minimalist bitten 🍎. Holy shit they copied the Apple logo !!!
static LED designs are pretty good.. would have been better if these were dynamic and customizable
Is the transparent plastic going to yellow over time ?
Absolute mess.
Companies these days lack base originality
this is the phone that can make apple users reconsider switching their phones to other system
700€ and clean software and I’m getting it
I love the ringtones. Underated.
I thought he said he's not allowed to show the screen😂🤦🏽‍♂️
"I'm already SO intrigued by this phone and what more it can do, the lights on the back for the notifications and calls are so gimmick yet so COOL !! Really felt like I was watching MKBHD holding a phone from Cyberpunk 2077 🤣🤣"
"I can't wait to see how NOTHING can grow, I have alot of hope for their phones and such"
"That's why the name is Nothing, bcs if they totally failed, there's nothing ever happened"
it's NOTHING like the compitition
"While the ringtones matching the LED patterns implementation looks cool and is definitely a new feature, the ringtones themselves remind me of the days of the nokia 3300"
Maybe I will buy it as a second  phone. But to switch form iOS to Android again…. thats not enough.
"Where have I seen that before?
Oh yeah, Nokia 3220."
The display and the SOUND too :D!
Better nail that clear case day one
"I used all the Oneplus phones untill the 6, then switched to Realme. For this I might go back to Nothing, if the price is right."
No glow in the dark demonstration?
Battery life must be something with all them led lights actions going on at the back
Creative. Might try it out if it isn’t too expensive! Not gonna change phones though! I don’t rly know anything that would make me switch from iPhone or Samsung! Unless a new actual useful feature comes out on one phone but the problem is all phones get any new feature within a month
No matter what....the ending of the video was broadly appealing 😂😂
"Shoutout OnePlus. I used to love my OP6, now I switched to Google Pixel."
"I really love the concept of this phone. I hope apple one day can make these ""naked"" phones or the modibility on phones will get easier"
The audio is a little bit ahead of his mouth and it's so weird when you notice it
excited for this new OnePlus phone 😉
"Meanwhile Samsung : ""Yo this company called 'Nothing' brought something unique to the market, we should close down our Flip team and put money back into our Galaxy lines. Just how we did with Note series."""
We're eager to know about using experience.. Touch response and ui things.
Looks like a Star Wars branded / special edition iPhone 12 to me
"only allowed to show the back, but showed the front lol"
I am looking forward to giving this a try as my Android main.  Come on Jul12!
Meh...
"That's Really Unique, Cool And Sometimes Useful 😌"
Holy shit i need this
pretty cool...
Gimmicks. Nothing else. That's how they should call their company. Give me a damn third camera lens for tele instead of this crap.
"Difference for difference sake...standing out by putting a light show on the part of the phone that people will look at the least.  As if anyone with a smart watch needs a notification pattern on the back of their phone.  

What is the virtue of standing out by championing pointless ideas?  Is there a gold-star to be had or something?  Why couldn't Pei and co solve some real problem in the world, some real inconvenience of mobile devices?  Start there and dare to start a new dialogue, a true re-evaluation of the status quo.

They called the company Nothing and the puns write themselves but they should have named it Nowhere.  As in 'our ideas for innovation are literally coming from and going nowhere."""
iPhone X
"it's crazy the void that OnePlus left in the enthusiast community,
It's so huge that we can't wait to fill it again with anything that comes up"
"You flip the phone down because you DON'T want to be disturbed and NOT see any notification whatsoever.

This phone is designed to be touched and open as often as possible."
Nokia 3220 anyone?
Needs to be black
Samsung LED Cover does all of these. So this is also not new.
Looks very cool but I'm more concerned with the UI and what support we would be able to count on.
Sound familiar oneplus? 😂😂
this could be a saviour for oneplus users....as well as a good flagship experience
Loved the closing monologue!
"Would be cool if they built in the option to have the lights in different colors. That's a feature I miss, the LED that tells you, based on color, what's going on. Like I had green for email, blue for incoming calls, red for calendar etc."
Nah... that's a Google iPhone 12
Does it come in black?
"Finally a cool and fresh design...I would switch from my LG V50, hopefully useful cameras..."
"The way he keeps saying""Nothing"" 😎😂"
"its so cool actually but it white .. ehh it really does look like the iphone
but in black 'dark mode'? with rgb neon LEDs instead  👀"
"""what i am allowed to show you now is the back of the phone""
Then 1 minute later we see the front of the phone xD"
this nothing cool actually
Apple wins.
nothing is stealing apple design?
Looks like an iPhone
I'm interested now let's see the software
You are the best Tech youtuber love you bro
Nothing really excites me
Is this a…interesting phone? For once in like 5 years
"6:32 Yes, that's definitely OnePlus."
"The back does look sick but i am more interested to see the specs and the software experience. All the bells and whistles won’t attract customers unless its par or sub par and is able to retain the essence that one plus had when it launched. 

I still believe Nothing phone is the next successor to Oneplus, atleast in concept."
"It's so crazy how humans are so easily mesmerized by bright, blinking LEDs"
اللهم صل على شفيع يوم القيامة محمد واله وصحبه أجمعين ❤❤
Nottin name sounds ok.
Ridiculous
"I love the look of this phone. It’s very Ghost in the Shell/Blade runner-esque.
Love the features that work with the LEDs."
"""Nothing hype went from being Something""

So far on the surface, so good, can't wait to get my hands on this bad boy next month!"
Do you think it will sell through cell phone companies like for example ATT or Verizon ?
I would say stupid
"definitely WAY BETTER than the Iphone!
Just look at the Iphone users, most of them look stupid!!!"
"looks like an iphone 11..shape, camera placements, led placement...then they added extra stuff on it."
Great synth
I'm really hoping that Nothing will make good phones because I was a new phone with OG OnePlus DNA because I got the 7 Pro which was old OnePlus's last phone.
"Apple hates that trick: take the iPhone, make it transparent and pack some cool lights on the back. And add some new annoying ringtones. Hipsters will love it."
"i regret badly purchasing iphone se 3 last month, this looks wayyy better 😭"
Sounds like OnePlus.
"I'm not impressed by any of this.  I would have been happy with a phone with a physical keyboard.  That would have been simple, effective, and different.  Instead, they are providing a phone that I literally have to use with the screen facing down."
"I just hope it doesn’t end up becoming one plus. 

That last section of this video did hit."
Ringtones. Really?
Looks cool but idk if it’s future tech or gimmicky
Being a OnePlus owner I think I'm ready to move to a new brand ❤️
Who asked?
No headphone jack :(
lmao looks like a cracked iphone 11
"the shot at OnePlus at the end , haha , funny as usual"
Last 20 secs He obviously refers ONEPLUS 🫵🏼 🫣
"Cool. If it is priced for the mid-range market/upper mid-range I can see their strategy working.
For the hi-end...no. Just design alone won't be enough to compete with Apple and Samsung. They won't have the display tech or the color science for the cameras.

That's what they did with Ear 1: lots of posturing about competing with Apple but nowhere near the price of both Airpods or Airpods pro."
"Wait i'm confused. You said you're not allowed to show the front but then continue to show it, or is that just an edit over the screen so we still don't know what the cutout looks like??"
Parece un iPhone.
"I'm calling it right now.

The device will be cool for like 2 weeks and then fail."
Nahhh not that impressive to make you shift from a established brand to an unknown one. OnePlus is the last company that were able to scale up super fast and survive. I don't think we've had any post that. Realme etc were backed by BBK officially from Day 1 so not included. Yes I know OnePlus is owned by BBK but they were extremely independent and more like a project for BBK
It's the ending for me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is interesting one👍
"I mean I was getting really really hype about this but then I realized oh yeah I use cases. clear cases always turn brown and I can't stand how they feel in my hand because of natural hand oils. I guess we'll see how this works out, huh?"
Wish it was Matte and lights pop beneath that... But yeah I would defenity buy that it looks dope 😂 if it's price right...
Its just a fancy iPhone clone ... AND I LOVE IT
one plus 2.0
Being a ONE PLUS owner... I definitely felt the last part 😔
"sorry to say but this look some toy phone, and hell no to those LED's , some cheap Chinese phone vibe😂😂"
i hope 1+ can safe whats left...
"I am an avid Samsung and apple lover, I've only had Samsung or Apple phones my whole life and this has to be one of the very first phones that have genuinely made me go wow, I like the fact that it looks like an iPhone 12, but it's different enough that you know you're holding something special. Its a really cool phone that is very tempting to switch to"
Flashing lights on the back not really very useful as most people don't lay their phone down on the screen or will have a case on ..so nothing new there. Looks very much like an iPhone 13 body with some version of Android inside.
Well that's great. but There is an LED in the back and we know that the LED is heating up. Does this affect the performance of the battery and the processor?🤔🤔🤔
Chinese. Remember.
"If there werent foldables i would love that, but i just cant get back to a normal slab"
great analogy there :)
But will the clear plastic turn yellow with time
I am not sure people would be big fan of the back! We anyways use a case with any phone. So hw useful will that back lights will be is questionable!
Nokia 3220 anyone?
"If it's the same price as a pixel 6 I'd be down. That look is sick (tho I'd put a clear case on it) and I really love the nothing earbuds for the price. Plus, Carl has vision and I expect he can deliver a great experience, especially with the Essential IP under his belt (another fantastic phone). OnePlus is a shell of its former self since he left"
OnePlus roasted 😂😂
Apple and OnePlus baby
"i dig it enough to switch to it for the design, but not if the internals arent up to snuff. Design isnt as important as performance to me"
Nothing is inspiring to buy it
Paid advert. Shame.
"Do people lay their phone down on the screen? I very rarely do that, and maybe only when I'm in my bed."
Now they need to design cool case for this
"Looks futuristic. 
Also would love to see it in black"
Now they need to design cool case for this
It would be cool if they were RGB lights as well
"At some point some phone maker will make back lights to display a letter or a symbol. Or emoji. Then ir will be really cool. Even the text message could be quite readable, if displayed 3 or 5 symbols per second. Would buy that."
That One+ diss at the end got me 🥹
Marques is the real og for saying that about 1+ in the end
Yea I totally disagree. I think 99% of people would mistake this for an iPhone with an interesting skin on it.
"I thought those LED’s were just a lookup thingy, but man their functionality is insane"
@Dean Martinez kids
useful also for the hearing impaired and seniors.
"@Sahil Sheikh Daring Today, Aren't We"
just gimmicky
Women… ☕️ fffrrrfff
That’s an iPhone 12.
"its like an iphone 11 with ip 12 body and android operating system, screen"
Why they all copy apple tho
hey dbrand do a white teardown collection so we can all have clear white iphones
Actually Nothing interesting
Thanks for the first look of the front! 😅
I like the OnePlus reference
"And then, I put a hard case in it"
"Marques is very very keen into how business strategy works
The only real way to survive is to stand out in a way that is economically unfeasible for the big dogs, such as carving out a niche of anime fans to be your consumers, because Samsung sure isn't going to waste time changing their Galaxy line to have a custom design - the designers and machinery cost isn't worth it for a few thousand phones sold, and they have to pay BTS to sing over their commercials.
The small niche companies essentially keep expanding using that niche as an entry point. The truly successful ones don't abandon their niche but OnePlus shows that this doesn't usually happen in the smartphone space."
Taking a subtle dig at OnePlus 🫣
it's exactly what I'm afraid for. I feel like it's just hype and like OnePlus it was justified hype until a point where the phone became just meh/average (OP Nord) after overselling it. Not sure LED lights can mean a lot of sales. The phone needs to be available worldwide and for me it has to have killer software like the camera; I got the Pixel in the first place because I want a top quality camera. OP got left behind on that aspect.
I like it oneplus ceo is really innovative and talented. Now oneplus is trash but I think nothing will take that pride with a new start.. 😉
A stupid product for empty people...enthusiasts wants phones that last 4 years with great battery life and build quality that negates the need for cases...
Ugly phone. Just trying to push anything to make it stand out... Desperate
Nothing is … nothing but copy of iphone 12 which loaded with stock android.
price and processor please
Nothing wants to look different with LED lights and ends up copying Iphone built style. 😂
"This concept seems familiar, almost giving the Nokia 8210 modification era vibe back in the 90s"
Nice phone but I will stay with my S21 Ultra for another 2 years.
"The main question I have is, are the LEDs colour customizable??"
It is just the same old ‘OnePlus’ story to recreate the success: ‘Copy everything off a hyper successful and make it cheaper with JUST and Exactly just one CHANGE’
As long as it stays snappy and is easily repairable I would 100% consider something like a Nothing phone as my next. I guess only time will tell. Still rocking my OnePlus 6 and it's going great to this day. Only had to change the battery which was super easy.
"So this is the new ""One Plus"""
"This is a decent first impression for new buyers, hope the software and the hardware holds up especially with Samsung and Google offering more updates with Samsung being more bug free 
It won't be easy, as the first product, hope they succeed"
No complaints as such but design could've been different.
Paid advertisement lol …
I got the buds and I love them and I might have to switch I’m currently on ios
sad it dont have the mute switch
As a starship and sci-fi movies fan I have to say that this back is really impressive.
What about hifi audio output?
"This phone made 13 pro max look old, they really know what they are doing, it's an art"
I see what you did there in the end
"For just this back, i don't think to switch to this phone."
So it's just like the Essential Phone?
"Everything great, but those ringtone sounds are irritating."
"""tech should disappear into the background"" Is their things then why the phone looks weird I don't think that thing gonna disappear into the background"
Can't wait to put a case on it
"Well, you could say that... Nothing impressive."
Still an android garbage
Keep the d-riding apple
The issue with making cooler looking phones is that they're still fragile... so I get cases that cover it up... they've gotta sell cases that emphasize and work with the design so you can protect it without missing out
@Patrick Carpenter what a galaxy brain take. Do you also go to victims of car crashes to tell them “just don’t crash your car lol”?
@Patrick Carpenter Genius idea! I'll just ask the universe to not cause any accidents.
@Son Of Montreal is good
@Just Ez lol show me a transparent case that feels as nice to the touch as leather and doesn’t look ugly. I used one it was terrible
Don't drop it lol.
i just in phon
"Started with Nothing, ended with OnePlus"
Finally Innovation in the smartphone market.
Meh. Why dont I just look at the screen to see who's calling? Those are some unusable ringtones.
That is an iPhone.
would be cool if you could sync those LEDs with your media or mic (useful in concerts maybe)
If they have a special edition will it be called the Nothing Special?
How can I get one of those??  I have been wanting to change my phone to either Samsung or something other than Apple cause they are just being the same old designs back 🤦🏽‍♂️
I need them ringtones !!
Not only clear cases. A solid case with just the pattern clear would be dope. Or even a case with half transparent half luminous. Imagine it would have a slowly glowing after effect.
Tbh i was never hyped about a Phone but this one is lit!
Tbh if I wanted to see some cool lights I’d just buy nice light… I mean it’s cool/odd/interesting looking phone but is it enough for people to actually buy it❓
Why did no smartphone include the TOS Startrek communicator sounds?
After using a back cover this phone is nothing 😊
"Lights look like a Battery killer if you can't shut them off. Oh my goodness, those sounds are annoying."
those ringtones sound like bombs ticking or half-life 2 sounds.
The back cover lights seem gimmick to me.
"If this one works, might consider the 2nd gen. Doesn't really need a replacement for a year or two.."
The way you dig on oneplus though 🤣
Reminds me of the Essential phone. So many were hyped about what Andy Rubin brought out but it turned out to be one and done.
Sounds OnePlus
Def gonna but myself one. I’m in love with this phone and design!
Those ringtones along with the flashes makes it look like it's glitching really bad 👎 🤣
What about tracking and privacy?
"absolutely amazing love it,looks like a sci-fi phone from space movies...wish i had a unit."
Nothing will become Everything in the next couple years.
Nothing smartphone is the reason why OnePlus has Colour OS 😭
I really hope they have other Features which make it unique. Just slapping some led strips on the back and calling it a unique approach let me suggest that these are totally posers. My assumption solidifies when i see how they describing themselves in their about us page. Just some generic hipsters who think they are special but yet are closer to a apple or Samsung than anyone else.
rip oneplus
🏳️‍🌈
"Sure, The Lights are good,
it has some features but the main point is would I as a consumer spend extra money for the lighting and the related R&D

Nope, Not me

But I do belive there is a tiny % of the market that will....

Lets see"
Hope the company succeeds.  The design is interesting and stands out in the sea of all the other phones on the market. 👍
I'll switch when it comes out. Carl Pei really knows his shit. been a OnePlus user since the OnePlus 2. Probably gonna end that journey on my current 7 Pro.
if it has a nice camera an exceptiinal battery and just even normal performance it is the perfect flagship
I really like it. Reminds me of the days when people would deck out their Nokias with see through cases and strobing led lights. My only concern with this phone is the OS.
A whole 6min video about the back of a phone. Says a lot
They told u u cant talk abt software ddnt they? You sold out
Because There’s an embargo
That subtle one plus roast was nice touch ✌️
It's truly nothing
Nobody is going to buy that phone…
The back lights are really useful
"i would 100% buy this. currently using the samsung s21 fe, very nice phone."
"Please camera, don't suck and you got a buyer 🙏🏾"
"Why would Nothing choose this design for the led's, other than looking like Magsafe? The LED features are pretty cool I suppose, but ehhh, maybe for the camera flash? Now a days with soooo many spam calls, those LEDs gonna trigger a seizure 😆. I'm over here with my phone practically on silent. Some of us waiting for those dreaded job interviews only to be fooled by fraud calls and texts. Good luck to Nothing nevertheless."
And this looks the same too. Not different.
Please Nothing! Don't be TwoPlus...
what's this?!
This isn’t broadly appealing. DOA
"The big pack of led of the back with differents shape for notifications and to fill when you are filming something real game changer when you dont rec a still picture but sequence at night.
I hope the specification would be good enough for small movie taking.
And if they make one ip68 it would be nice.."
I really hope that it ships to new zealand
It's an Android-iphied iPhone with a bunch of gimmicks that nobody asked for.
"those ringtones, give me a watchdogs vibe, and i love it"
Exciting to see some truly new features
"Not gonna lie if the camera and speakers are good, I'd definitely be interested in switching from iPhone to the Nothing phone."
Looks like nothing more than a gimmick.
فكرة هذا الهاتف توضح لنا ان الهواتف الذكية اصبحت مجردة لزينة اكثر من الحاجة لها(accessory more than a necessity)
I presume the phone 2 will be RGB
I need it 😮😮😮
i hate it
*cough *cough ONEPLUS!
6:30 this is the reason why I love your content so much. You are such a futurist that your ideas almost seem possible...
"lol this feels like pretty much a NFT scam, buy page redirecting to what's basically a scalper page selling only the 100 first units, with lowest asking price being $213k? wtf"
6:07 OnePlus!
Yeah he was talkin about OP at the end.
That shade he threw at OnePlus at the end 👀
"I literally laughed when he said that, SO FAMILLIAR"
"while it seems great, i dont like the fact it has only 2 cameras and the sales feel sketchy"
The way he ended the video by taking a dig on OnePlus is so awesome 😄
"Man, you're last comment can either kill or make the phone. :)"
Wish it had a headphones jack
"im on an iPhone right now, but if I were on android this is the phone I would get."
looks like an iphone
Display upside down + wiggle phone for notifications = lots of scratches on the display !!
"Wow. We've come so far. Ringtones and lights. This is pathetic. Not your video, but this whole concept. Just like the earphones. It goes beyond gimmick. What amazes me more is that people actually care."
"Huawei couldve used some form of the glyph light for one of their phones, i forgot the model but it had a halo"
I am waiting for this ❤️
What if the lights stop working?
"That light up back, I'd buy that as a case."
i was tired from OnePlus tg
"Looks garbage though. There are multiple ringtones you can set for your contact currently in your phone. How may times have you used that. There seem to be a lot of Gimmicks on it. Plus obviously giving the phone to MKBHD is nice marketing. It is any other phone at this point, unless it has a new OS."
OnePlus....Sounds Familiar
"I had been waiting for it, but the corner aligned selfie simply killed it for me. I will never buy a phone with a corner aligned selfie camera. My OCD brain will freak out in all kinds of ways."
something different is always nice to see. I wouldn’t mind supporting this startup.
"Gamers be like : 
Man this phone is cool but it would be much cooler if they replaced RGB strips instead of  those regular led strips"
Those led only white or rgb?
"For once I really hope you’re wrong with your prediction that Nothing will make increasingly normal phones to cater for more people. We need a company that continues making unique phones in the market, whether I buy it or not it adds to the choice and general competitiveness in the market."
I love it but i dont feel i could let IOS go for it…
I love the led Thing 😍 But I'm confused by the led design
"Man imagine having that ringtone, and triggering someone’s PTSD💀  4:03"
one plus ¬¬
Where is the phone?🤪
Sound familiar?? 😂😂 Nothing shouldn't really end up like the OnePlus!!!
I see cool bad ass cases that can have the light in the back go with it
"Okay, the lights on the back with the different functions is really cool."
It looks nothing like others in the market
So they let you take away all that hype??
Damn oneplus really flop that hard i cant imagine Marques referring to any other company with that jab
"I can't find any measurements and characteristics of this phone, is it only my? 
I especially want to kno how big and heavy it is"
Bro I what it sooo much
"the phone for Tron fans  
  
as for notifications to who is calling, who knew not looking at the number on the front screen was an idea."
Cool for 2 seconds and then I put an otterbox on it immediately.  😅  So don't break it!
Everything depends on software
After all these at last nothing gonna acquired by the BBK or some chinese manufacturers and a new journey begins for Carl Pei with a new company named F***ing
"Different! 

-Pharrell Williams"
Alt title: There’s nothing like this phone
Y u gotta do oneplus like that 😂
OnePlus 😮
Reminds me of the design of PSP
I'm sorry they coulda went a whole other direction but they way they went is BOOTLEG to attune to the few. NO GO.
No we don’t want a different looking phone. The days where we used to have cool flip phones are over. It’s all software now. This phone won’t get people to leave ios or Android. Facts
"Marcques, can I have a free  iPad Pro? Please I’m going through rough times."
That backlit ringtone thing is amazing for deaf people!
"I won't be buying that phone because everyone I know with an iPhone would just say ""couldn't afford a real iPhone huh?"" which would get on my nerves."
if they price is right then it might be success
"Seems dope but also seems like a dangerous phone for someone like me with epilepsy. I've had seizures triggered by people's cameras flashing from notifications, so I dunno about this one. Smaller lights with changing patterns sure, but they strobe fast enough to trigger something."
"""Sound familiar""
One Plus:😬"
"Waiting a long time for a video, missing you already"
"I really thought Marques was going to say "" So what Nothing has done is NOTHING "" in the beginning of the video.  That would be SOMETHING :D"
"this is why apple will keep leading the game because of phones like this one. the majority of people doesn't want these phones, the majority of people want a new software, a new CPU, and a new ecosystem. As you know the only company that has been able to do this it's apple, to be honest apple it's just on another level."
That design would make me so much more comfortable not using a case. The trouble with clean and sleek backs is the ease they show scratches etc. that looks like it would take a years worth of heavy use and from first glance look great still
"Silly gimmicks, cant imagine anyone would buy a phone just for the leds."
Suttle Oneplus hints about marketing and appeal had me going :’)
In Matt grey this phone Would hit  cyberpunk
When I first saw this I thought it was an iPhone
120Hz?
Cool stuff
Now in RGB
Sala kuch samajh me nahi aaya phir bhi last tk dekhna pada
"Bruh this embargo that you can only review the hardware first and not the software are the first red flags on this phone. Pure gimmick, must be a shitty hardware and camera."
"I think this looks SICK. It would be interesting to see if they will offer android updates as early as on pixel. If not, then that would be a real shame. They will lose customers if they can’t deliver that."
This needs a transparent quality case...
I think People Like Me Who Are Interested in Pixels Will definitely consider this!
It's looking cool kinda but I'll never buy
"It definitely looks different, but in all honesty I like the look! I hope the company does better over time that way we see more competition in the sector, which ultimately always ends up helping consumers"
Sounds like Oblivioun drones
All the people who say it looks like an iphone 12 can go duck themselves. This phone is different.
"I like the concept, basically it makes your life easier, this is smart"
useless just marketing gimmick
no facking way they beat apple or samsung
I love it
"There is NOTHING different about this phone... or at least, very little."
this phone is clearly from cyberpunk
In 8-10 years this phone's gonna come out with some version of colorOS.
This isthe most amazing mind blowing phone in the last 2 years..🤯🤯🤯
Дизайн красивый. Надеюсь прошивка не подведёт.
I wonder if it will have a 90 or 120 screen
remember Samsung j7promax
Looking forward for this in India 👌👌👌
This phone + Dbrand customization will be pretty sick
"I just... can't like this company. I hate their marketing so much, all of it screams Elon Musk, cybertruck style ""BULLSHIT"" to me. I don't know how to describe it, that and the way they just came out of nowhere with all of the sudden, seemingly every tech YouTuber talking about them, the whole thing just sets off so many alarms to me."
"Me : Who on earth will look at a video about some LED lights.

*makes a video about led lights*

Me : Yes marquees tell me more about it"
"This shows how big the brand MKBHD is, it's the only nothing phone 1 video on YouTube 🙏"
so no one gonna talk about how the led looks like apple logo or just me lol
the NothingPhone; the repeated strategy from the people who once gave us Oneplus!!!!
Such as dumb brand with air as promise.
MORE TRANSPARENT TECH PLEASE
this is how I would've expected Apple to evolve if they kept the design principles that they had back with those colourful iMac G3 from the 90's
That looks like an iPhone
Alright congratulations you have been selected among my shortlisted winner's🎁💯
"Sir can you give me one phone , I am very poor and can't afford one to buy. I am using a Realme 3i which I bought 3 years ago.  
I need it for my education and shoot of my vlogs. 
Please elder brother gift me one.🥺🥺"
imo it looks like an iphone… but cooler
Probably not the best phone for epileptics then…
"To be honest I like the first impression, I'm looking forward for the full review"
Only one color? :(
"Looks slick, let’s see if it delivers on everything else cos thats where it’ll be make it break"
"So long as they have a black version i will consider this, I have the nothing ear buds and I really like them. I wanna see the software and specs of this phone though because I am sceptical. although I loved oxygen in its hayday so maybe we will see some similar patterns. pricing is one to look out for here too"
Alright congratulations you have been selected among my shortlisted winner's🎁💯
@mkbhd going meta in the end
"The biggest problem is that a lot of people use cases, they will need a special one to still using those LEDs."
Tell me it has great haptic engine like iPhone
Just gimmick
Why would I want some flashy unnecessary LEDs in the back for notifications when I can have the whole front act as an LED notifications.
"I was gonna switch but there you go another hole punch screen 💔, guess im sticking with redmagic 7pro"
"I'm willing to take the risk with Carl pei. There's nothing out there that tickles my fancy these days. I would rather support him as I've seen what he can do.
I'm still using the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's the perfect phone in my opinion apart from the curved screen. Unfortunately the battery is starting to go and the camera updates one plus are putting out are ruining my pictures."
Broadly appealing
Sweet design. Nothing phone is going to be an instant success.
I liked that dig for One Plus in the end.
Alright congratulations you have been selected among my shortlisted winner's🎁🎁
Take my money!!!
I want It NOW
Such a good looking phone.
"The Oneplus 7 pro was one of those awesome phones with a truly unique design.. the popup camera to me was one of the coolest things.  There's a privacy feature there where obviously if the camera is down inside the phone it can't record you, and the front of the display was all display.  I was irritated when they abandoned that design so quick."
I really like the design. I hope they don't screwed it up with anything else
So the epilepsy phone
😯🤣
look cool
"Still looks like a prototype, I need video smoothing, at least 30w fast charging and charger in the box to even consider using it as a second phone."
"Lol this phone is so gimmicky
😂"
"china: we got a bunch of factory raw good to make iphone 12, nothing:  ok lets grab that put some leds, put android and apps and charge it, a good deal for china and for nothing, not for me."
Another video to drum up hype.
I am already in love with the design 😍
2:58 bit of an editing mistake 🤔
Can it use ringtones that don't make you want to throw it at a wall?
What's the screen? Anything less than OLED isn't worth it anymore in 2021... Or 2022? 🤔 Shit what year is it 😅
"Omg, the diffusion looks fantastic on those lights! I'm actually considering this for my next device. I have the Z Flip 3 but the rumours and leaks on the flip 4 look like it will be almost identical to the 3, so this seems like a good runner up. Now I understand what that image they showed on stage, it was the pattern of the lights."
"The ""sounds familiar"" is OnePlus, isn't it?!"
You not with case with led
"As MKBHD said, this could be oneplus 2.0"
Looks like a phone from cyberpunk
"I really, really do not like anything about this. I consider this a failure of design from almost every meaningful angle. Isn't this embarrassing?"
Alright congratulations you have been selected among my shortlisted winner's🎁💯
iPhone 12 with badass LEDs
4:04 the quiet kid at school
How do you rewind the tape?
This is genuinely sick. But now it makes me want a phone with a completely frosted back that has LEDs that span the entire phone that I can customize to do whatever I want in whatever pattern I want....
RIP Oneplus
"They could’ve made it look like a Galaxy S5, they could’ve made it look like a Huawei P10, they could’ve made it look like an HTC M8, or an LG G4 with the faux leather back, or a Palm Pilot, or a BlackBerry 9800, but it doesn’t look like any of those it looks like an iPhone 12, complete with LEDs that mimic the round Apple with a chunk missing from the upper-right and a right-leaning stem on top. That’s no coincidence."
"I don't understand the point of these lights, why would I use them because I can use an always on display instead"
Alright congratulations you have been selected among my shortlisted winner's🎁💯
1:11 ….2:23 😅
"The simple fact that all smartphones still have cameras that are standing out of the phone case is just one reason why i rather stick to an older phone. Its such a bad ""feature"", i rather take the tiny amount more and have them in the case, as it happened to many times already that a phone just slides down a surface (and no a phone case is just a bad fix for this, as its a design flaw). The second one is usb-c but thats the apple only issue.."
"I love it, hoping the specs are neat, and for a good msrp I'll be doing the switch!"
Whoever Just Made The Concept Art Of This Phone Is A Pure Genius !
Alright congratulations you have been selected among my shortlisted winner's💯🎁
I like it! Please let us know about the software in the full review.
"First look is... interesting. Also, this ability to distinguish events on your phone could be a game changer with people with certain impairments."
This is an iPhone with a notch less front
I need 90 fps in pubg mobile.
That is a great piece of hardware. Thanks for the review. I love how they stand out from the rest of the crowded smartphone field!
"Its a cheap copy of an iphone, NOTHING ELSE."
Wow Fantastic 👌 Slim bezelsless flat panel screen 👏
"Uh oh, another phone that can't be reviewed... RED FLAG!........ /s"
"Cool leds on the rear. But I usually have my screen up, so the screen doesn't face down and get damaged to the surface. So the led will almost not be visible for me so it wouldn't help me. Or am I the ""only"" one who has the screen facing up when lying on a table?"
"In public places and at work, I always put my phone face down (when it's in a case), so I can easily not confuse it with another and I also really like how it looks in a cool case.  In the case of Nothing, the only logical thing is a transparent cover or an overlay frame with a thick border."
It could be a flop or a revolution in Android world
Nothing could not be any more underwhelming. It’s entire motto is nothing more than gimmicks.
i wish nothing phone has iOS... some wish never come true
"If the colors of the LEDs and the ringtones could be changed/customized, I'd definitely be more interested. 🤔

Also, I usually put Otterbox cases on my phones (I'm a bit hard on them), so this might not work for me. 🤷"
"Android phones have become a commodity - new tech doesn't add much - so it's now more about a fashion statement and gimmick (some useful, some not). I expect to see companies that nobody expected to see in this market - entering it in the next couple of years. Won't be surprised to see a Nike phone, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Rolex... etc. Basically, top fashion/sports brands are likely to introduce their own phones... then watches etc. I definately used to love my Nike watch ~15 years ago!"
"""sounds familiar?""
 Oneplus users crying in coloros"
Shots fired to OnePlus for abandoning old fanbase.
"Hope they got more colors. Definitely would have to hear what specs they got. But im intrigued. Would like the option for the glyph to be in the front too for calls, cuz id slap a case on it. Hoping for some kinda refresh rate. Not the end of the world if theres no wide lens, but we'll see. Pricing will be interesting where they nestle themselves"
"Probably a stupid question, but is this phone running Android software?"
Cool phone. Too bad it looks like a toy and the cameras are most probably crap (considering it’s still an android)
">big screen on the front
>couple cameras on the back
>couple pale colors
>glass 

It's basically what this is"
I would be happier if the punch hole is on the middle!😢
"Nice approach at the end ""oneplus"". Considering this mobile first thing that came into my mind was history of oneplus.Let's see how this works out at the end if its really NOTHING or nothing ntg................."
"I think this would be an interesting phone for a week. Beyond that, it will just feel like a gimmick."
We have come a long way from ring light to ring light with a phone😂
OnePlus 2.0....in a good way
looks like a phone from an alien planet
"Oneplus : Never Settle... At least until you start getting success, then fuck em."
Price of the mobile?
"Nope.
If software is on point, camera is top notch and price is reasonable then yes. Otherwise no."
Oneplus 🤭
Trying to get market share from the top phone companies is a lost cause at this point.
It's an i-droid
"Friends : What phone did you use?
Me : Nothing phone 🗿"
Horizon zero down phone
Led iPhone = Nothing phone 😏
Hai new venture..new player..new startup..new hope....n All the best .......
these chinese are super clever😍
Earlier in the video you told that you are only allowed to show us the back but you showed the front too...😆
OnePlus die  nothing no1
I want to see how the cameras are going to perform
I really like how this thing looks. If it works well and has good specs this might make me retire my oneplus 6t
Gettin old one plus vibes from here 😍
Eagerly waiting for This Phone 1❤️
He can’t show us nothing bout the nothing phone. Oh the irony.
Coming from nothing double entendre
It looks like an iPhone 12 rip off just like the earbuds they made were just Air Pods Pro with clear stems
💣 icon attracted me more¡
"If you turn the volume high enough, you can hear all the one plus fans crying in the background at the end of the video...
Try it."
What about those who dont like to place their frontal phone screen on the table surface and use backcover.
Really felt the ending as a OnePlus owner and fan. Really don't want Nothing to go down the Oneplus way.
this phone looks amazing! it would be my second choice after pixel tbh
Самый необычный смарт за последнее время. Хоть кто-то придумал действительно что-то новенькое в плане дизайна. Наушники тоже топ🔥
Is that an iPhone
"I think it’s cool. It’s such a hard category to innovate in right now, and I’m happy to see new ideas coming out even if they aren’t revolutionary"
"Yeah, I think its the Oneplus co founder. Something different I must say."
Don't you love when you get another overpriced Chinese generic crap with a cool case?!
@Mr. Everything I could certainly risk it if i had the money! Already the Fold 3 is IP water resistance certified let's see if they bring dust resistance too. But all phones are fragile one way or another.
@panatha tube until you can fold glass in half I'll never be a fan of foldable screens. There's a reason we don't have plastic screens on your phones anymore. Let alone the gap in the screen that leads directly into the inside of the phone letting dirt and whatever else wants to party inside your phone. You you imagine a tiny metal shaving or something conductive getting in there and ruining your phone in a matter of seconds? Then you get to deal with the fact that you have to shell out another $1500 because of a metal shaving. Repairability is the future of technology. Not locked down devices that's impossible to extent the life of.
"I'd like a LED light for notifications on the back of the phone. But to me this looks like an overkill and a bit gimmicky. That's my first impression though, and i might change my mind. Of course I'd like to see the phone up close and personal, see the Android skin, learn the price and the cameras should be respectable. Anyway, a new device means more competition in the phone market which is good. But to me real innovation is foldables not LED lights."
OnePlus got called out hard at the end there...
Those light features could be really incredible for those with bad or no sense of hearing. Excellent accessibility!
I'll give it a try in July
*The Nothing iPhone LOOKS Different*
"Interesting. Except we put covers on our phones, so we don't really care about the design of the back of the phone."
Nothing Phone. Nothing Bad.
"WOW!! the blinking lights.
For those who are Hearing impaired will LOVE this."
"In the boaring world, he rises from nothing"
"""sounds familiar?"" Yes, it hella does"
Everything is Attractive...But NoOne will  keep their phone upside down on the table (Mostly) !!!!
I WISH IF IT HAD A CENTER HOLE PUNCH CAMERA
The lighting on the back reminds me of the OG Nokia phones where you could swap the antenna out for one that would light up every time you got a call. You could even get see through faceplates  that would light up. Those were the days.
"iPhone clone, nothing special"
This phone will get MKBHD award for best phone design in 2022 and this phone reminds me of oneplus one first impressions
"I just wanna remind people that Nothing is a startup company. We're witnessing their first steps into a huge market with extreme competition. What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
No one plus was harmed towards the end of the video🙂
I want it.
I’d add a flashing lights warning to this video
"At least they're on the right way in bezel management. They prefer to make it symmetrical in 4 sides rather than 3+1 chin. If it's cameras great, it'll be a real new OnePlus."
RGB slowly making its way into phones
Looking at the phones back and coupled with the quirky LED interface it gives off the design feel of something produced by Teenage Enginnering.
The camera module is so good.
"The whole thing feels gimmicky at best. 
Won't buy the phone for just some flashing lights..
Will wait for the whole package reveal."
Wish the LEDs could change colors
I WANT THIS.... I WISH IF I HAD MONEY... THIS IS SUPER UNIQUE AND VERY ATTRACTIVE AND A FUTURISTIC PHONE... CONGRATS TO THE OWNERS...
It's ugly
"I hope some day someone will make a round smartphone. Maybe with no notch or a teardrop notch, small rounded bezzles like a smartwatch, 3 cameras in a triangle on the back and another UI. UI could also rotate with a gyroscope Just because it will be the only one, it will sell fine."
"Nice, I wanted a phone that looks like Iphone, but with android, sadly looks like there are only 2 cameras, I wanted a telephoto, but I don't want Iphone."
Masallah 💚
Deadass thought this was the new iphone
Nothing getting apple cult !! This time for serious .
Pure garbage lol let’s put 10000 LEDs for no reason lol we get sold trash everyday it’s getting ridiculous
nothing revolutionary here... i dont like it.
So you have shown us NOTHING in this video
No exclamation mark after the video name? Now that's a first!
iPhone 12 Body + OnePlus UI & Optimization = Nothing Phone
That is a great piece of hardware. Thanks for the review. I love how they stand out from the rest of the crowded smartphone field!
Not a review. Don’t buy this yet.
so..modded iphone?
"If the camera is good and no bloatware, then im sold!"
Ok seems a worthy upgrade from Poco F1 The Last Legend
"I want phone I can use a simple as Windows 98, I have to make whole research when I get new phone how to transfer files and stuff.... And it doesn't matter what kind of phone it is because when I switch to Apple my memory gets clocked up so fast
.... Plus all this scam with phones locked to certain provider.. I need cell phone for my work and I need good signal...this year . I had like five phones I don't use because I cannot use them, and the provider signal is bad in my area..this days we basically have monopoly ...2-3 big companies...well done .
Is this a freedom to you ?Try get of the contract from At&t ,crooks ....they will send you to many collections .American dream got stolen by corporations."
"Show the ui , camera everything ehshhh"
Didn’t anyone notice it looks like an iPhone 11 except for the hole lunch camera.
"6:31 OnePlus be like- I know which company he is talking about, oh wait that is meeeee!"
That monologue in the last though..
This is Nothing
"I’m stuck in Apple ecosystem just like most of you guys stuck in Android ecosystem. I mean these phone looks cool and prettiest to me compared to Samsung phones. I just don’t like their full screen, rectangular shape and big on my palm. This phone is perfect in terms of design."
Price?
Thank you ❤️
"Supporter of flagship killer OnePlus. Still holding on to my 5t. Hoping it'll hold out long enough to get a Nothing Phone 3, or 5 if they skip 4 again. Maybe I'll be able to catch Flagship Killer territory again before it becomes flagship"
Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate
"I thought it would be something more revolutionary, but I still think my S22 Ultra and iPhone are more revolutionary."
Apple has nothing to worry about
iPhone and Google pixel 5 vibes
It looks like a really big phone. If they had this in a smaller size I would definitely consider getting one.
The back led light is amazing along with the ringtone 2 This looks like the next step to project Ara / google project remember.
agreed
"Anyways, making this teaser video... Cmon, give us full review. Like why 50 videos of the same, hate that, just for the views."
It's gonna be a revolution for the future phones
the ending is only for the oneplus community
@Telegram me👉Officialmaxtech.. oh yeah is this for real? 😁
This looks.... Interesting. Can't wait to see more.
If Tron made a phone…
No one can beat iphone the king of smartphones
absen gaez ❤️🔥🎉
"I like the look of the phone, kind of a throwback to see through phones in the 90s. The notification lights are pretty cool, the only hope is that they have a good price point and great performance.

And you're right, the market is a difficult slope for a new startup unless it's just looking to make enough waves in order  to be purchased by a bigger player."
I love the back design ❤️👍
"Unique and interesting, but absolutely would never want that.... So annoying."
"Nothing you had me at ringtone, I'm in"
"i would like to see other colors or at the very least be able to change the color of the LED's, however putting that aside I am decently impressed with what has been shown so far. I'll continue to reserve judgement about the entire phone until its out."
Seems like an always on display does a lot of the things the back lights do. 🤔
"Wishful thinking here, I hope it isn't OnePlus all over again 😅"
"I don't think a iPhone design with flat screen and more boxy shape is a had thing. The android world has been crying out for something as well designed. Think they missed a trick with not having multicoloured led notification lights on the back, although the white does look cool and futuristic."
It's really interesting to see how just by showing this design alone many people are willing to purchase the device pre release.
Another paid review . Thank you MKBHD .
Mmm intresting
OnePlus was not hurt in this video.. 🤪😜
like a phone from Assassin's Creed
"It’s bold but none of these new different features really matter to me and it’s not differentiated enough/could be replicated so easily. Who cares about the exact charging progress indicator? And frankly, I much prefer vibration over light up hieroglyph symbols that I can’t see when my phone is in my pocket. It’s a no from me chief."
Whats  the weight sar value price y r u not showing  screen  quality
How did I miss Naruto phone?
Does it have an alert slider?!
Side punch hole display looks ugly
this that Henry danger phone
If I want to stop light  can we?
Hints at one plus. Lol
That light feature is gonna be overhyped just like Samsung edge lighting. It’s cool at first but you’ll eventually stop caring bout it.
Got tired of my OnePlus 6 and new OnePlus phone aren't exciting enough but after OnePlus 6 this is the first phone I'm excited for. Hope it delivers
iPhone 12 white with MagSafe Clear Case 🤣
Uhh... The last line 😉
Looks like 'Nothing' going to take on  'everything' apple and samsung doing .
DAAAAAMN it looks waaaaay better than the iphone literally amazing ...
"Damn, that's really cool, only complaint would the front camera position, honestly, I personally never use the front facing camera, I'd rather have nothing. Also, if only they could get Apple's OS... but that's a pipe dream lol."
I am not nearly as observant as needed to know the difference between some of those light patterns so over my head. Nice to see a new idea.
Is thr black one?
Was waiting for that sounds familiar 🤣🤣 change the car to phone here.
I want this to become the rival of iphone
Love From Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩♥️🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩♥️🇧🇩♥️
I hope they don’t go the same way Oneplus are going
"Heh, I used to find people, who use regular flashlights for notifications pretty annoying. Let's see, how this will turn around.)
I mean that semi-seriously, though: it's more light, for sure, but the light itself is softer, so it might not be that bad. We'll see, but for now at least it looks different, yes."
I wish that LED on the back was RGB!
LOVE it!!!
"It's more look like the ancient one, the play station 1 in a small size. The wireless charging circle area is the place we put the disc. And the camera bump is the power button. Lol."
Mid phone from another Chinese fraudulent company.
"But, do they let you unlock the bootloader?"
Thats a alien phone 👀
"If it's anything like their earbuds, stay away."
I want that phone!
Nothing hype machine at full steam. Crazy that people instantly forget how they used this same marketing ploy for a lackluster product in the past
The see through electronics of the 90s are back! Everything must be transparent! I want Crystal Mountain Dew!
Ringtones feels bit irritating to hear
This screams cyberpunk. I will definitely buy it!
I will definitely
If it's a small size 5g I'll look into it
"If I was an Android user, I would consider giving the Nothing Phone a run. I think it looks cool. Of course, the purchase decision would also be impacted by my thoughts on the UI whenever we get to see all of that in action."
this is a cool bootleg iphone 12 the whole rear and sides and camera design are straight up copied from the iphone 12 plus the way the lights are arranged look like the magsafe magnets arrangement on the 12
That's a dope phone. I love it!
That looks like it would drain your battery really fast
This easily has to be the coolest looking phone in a while. The gaming phones take a back seat on this one.
"Notification LED is so cool, if only Samsung brought it back or iPhone started doing it with the apple logo lighting up. I still have my s9+ and haven't upgraded because it still has a notification LED. Also because it has a headphone jack. It also has the micro sd slot. The heart rate bpm sensor through finger. It's the one big reason I haven't upgraded yet. Because it's the last phone to have everything. S10+ was close and only got rid of the notification LED and then s20 ultra got rid of headphone hack and heart rate bpm scanner and then s21 ultra got rid of the micro sd slot so every year they got rid of everything which was annoying. The s22 ultra made its phone look like a note and I was more a fan of the s series body shape. The s21 ultra had basically the best design. The best feel. Just didn't have a slot for the pen. But it is far ahead in terms of getting rid of all the things my s9+ still has so maybe I'll move on and finally upgrade when the s23 ultra comes out. That's if the rumoured 200mp camera is true and I'm also hoping for a far better zoom lens and video recording capabilities because it's still far behind iPhone. I am certain my s9+ from over 4 years ago will still last another year. Maybe even 2"
Recent leaks indicate that 7 Gen 1 has antutu score near about 2 lakh only. I don't believe that.
Ok this is the not iPhone for iPhone users. I’d buy this. I like it a lot
This makes me smile for some reason.
If I remember properly even you have put up some investment in nothing company. So you would say nice things about it as u can see in video
"Hey is that an iphone 12?

Me: nah! Its Nothing.

Come on man tell me which one is it?"
Y wud I want notification indicator on the back? I m never gonna keep it on screen side down on the table 🤔
What you're allowed to say about it before the emargo lifts: Nothing
LOOKS GOOD
Where is that bi fold galaxy fold or tri fold
"I mean if this thing has the power and the Software to keep up with my current Oppo Find X2 Pro, i am definitely considering it. Those lights would surely help with shooting pictures in darker settings, also it looks like it comes straight out of Tron which is super cool"
Kinda reminds me of the Fairphone 3
NothingOS 1???
Loved that subtle jibe at One Plus 😆😆
"This is a abstract looking iPhone. If you can’t see the placement of the lights it makes it look like a reverse Apple logo. 

Maybe change the led placement and at glance most people will assume it’s an iPhone."
"But I do wish they would put a small mini screen near the camera and that way I can get notifications, time etc if I want to turn it on"
"The most BASIC title award 2022 goes to 

*drumroll*

The Nothing Phone LOOKS Different~ MKBHD"
"Is there any phone that could resemble the phones in black mirror series(season 5) ? The smoothness,thin look, actually small… its all what i need in a phone."
Colorful backlights... Anyone !
Sounds familiar?
Any Indians here😊
"Except for the deaf, this seems useless and really annoying"
"Whether this will be an upgrade (?) for my OnePlus 7 pro will probably depend on the price and the software experience, looking forward to the launch event.😁"
Wtf did i just see? It's shit. 100% shit.
This ain't for me
Nothing to me has been such a snake oil company. Talking about innovation and they made AirPods and an iPhone X that are transparent like gameboys. Honestly the company just reminds me of Beats by Dre all hype and pure marketing
"ok, but does it have an aux port?"
"I like the look, but ""The safe bet"" hole is massive and getting people out of it is not likely to happen."
Just wiggle the phone to see the status of charging and when u turn the phone all u see is a bunch of scratches on the screen 🤭 y wud I charge the phone with the screen side down 😂
Finally an iPhone with USB-C!!
"so im supposed to use the back of my phone to see who is calling what is the notifction and the chargeing status,so might i suggest you to turn you phone around and use the front side to not only all these and more"
why you have not shown it in dark room?
So how would the phone case look like given the amount of LEDs on the back?
now imagine being someone suffering from photosenitive elipesy siting next to someone with that phone
I want nothing
what does the dbrand skin for this look like?
"Love the look. I hate the glass pebble that every android phone has become, and much prefer flat edges, to the point I bought an iPhone last year just because I liked their new design so much. I ended up disliking iOS and moving back to an s21 but have been putting off the upgrade because I don't like any android flagships this year. This is starting to look like it might be my next upgrade!"
What's that laptop in the background bro?
"It definitely looks a lot like iPhone. But this LED feature, i think is just a gimmick. Not really a useful feature, just something to say is different is there. Also, if someone does not get a clear case, then this feature is totally wasted as well and clear cases normally is not the easiest to maintain"
I personally think looks on a phone nowadays doesn’t matter anymore due to vibrant varieties of cases skins available in the market and all people soon will care about is what a phone has to offer rather then how it looks.
6:32 of course OnePlus the company never settle
"Better luck than essential phone, I bought that and I remember the fiasco, got two phones from best buy, both had light bleeding from the edges."
iphone with transparent back...thats how it looks
Literally an iphone clone
"Weird ring tone, sounded like a draco."
TRON legacy phone
As an iphone 12 user i like it👍
Will this run on android or do they have their own os?
"other brands: lets start from the front.
nothing: lets make back more attractive and usable than front"
Apple nothing to worry about.
Looks shit
It reminds me of the R2D2 swimsuit that was doing the rounds a few years so.
Price?
If the phone has the same quality of the earbuds its gonna flop hard
"People wants different products, i loved!"
Raise your hand if you thought the LED ring was a copycat of MagSafe🙋🏼
no
So this is what a rejected iPhone demo phone looks like…
1+
"it looks like an iPhone, and I like it"
Why does he sound like he's sponsered 😁
All depends on how good the software ends up being!
a dig at OnePlus 6:19
Reminds me of OnePlus the way you say it in the end 😁
Marques so cute I wished I could work with him😆
old tech nokia 3220 had it. =)
The design is super fly!!!
Anyone know what the screen size is on that?
OnePlus 2.0 🥲
You have shown the entire phone including front 😉 Not just Back (Thank you)
My phone wiggle wiggle it glows
"LED lights on the back are totally dumb, it's like Tesla adding unnecessary tech for the sake of it and then charging extra money."
Title should've been: This looks like nothing else
Wow impressed!
As an iPhone user since the iPhone one I need to state that this piece of tech looks awesome and could lead me to switch - not from the software perspective but from an aesthetic hardware one.
"I LOVE THIS COMPANY, SO CREATIVE!"
The end was just so on point hahah
Can we start a kickstarter to buy this dude some lip balm? Unless its a weird tick..... he must have really dry lips because he keeps licking them like a lizard.
It looks exactly like an iPhone with a broken back.
In search of OnePlus we will definitely buy nothing 😄
"Digging the Tron aesthetic, it's also nice to see someone actually trying to make these amazing tools we carry in our pockets less banal. 

I am however, curious/concerned about how much extra drain the LEDs are adding on the battery."
It's probably close to the raw equivalent of AOD in modern Androids. Plus modern smartphones have gotten bigger batteries and better power efficiency so it's most likely as negligible as AOD.
it would drain less than the screen for sure
"@Apaullo 5,10,15,20%
20% for heavy use 😂
I think those are absolute wild guesses.
How quickly will you be draining the battery with the screen on? Let’s say you only got 4-5 hours out of a charge under real heavy use, you think the notifications would bring it down to 3.5 to 4 hours.

Think a bit more logically.
This feature would be negligible at best. Same with vibrate notifications, Face ID, Touch ID."
Wow could you imagine living in 2022 and worrying about left battery drain lol
None
"As a Oneplus 1 (back in the invitation days), 3T, and 7T owner. Yes, this situation does sound familiar. Oneplus has settled. and nothing will eventually become something. all will be abandoned eventually."
LED pattern isn't really good cuz everyone uses Cover for protection.
Gimmicky but I think it works and is totally... 'sick'! 😎
Couldn’t all this be replicated through software by expanding always on display? I can already see all my notifications and charging status at a glance. The lighting would be the only differentiator and that won’t be enough to convince me to go with a startup
I am actually excited for this phone.
"the nothing phone looks interesting, I may get one."
Badass. I think the last customizable notification led phone I had was a blackberry lol
That back light could replace ring light if it's bright enough 🤔
Probably limited to 12 units. No-one will be able to get their hands on this no doubt 🤣
"This showcase was dope,  at first I didn't really care about the phone thought it was meh. But all these little things added to it make it pretty unique and cool. Considering buying one, looking forward to the review."
"MKBHD :  Sound Familiar 
OnePlus : left the chat"
What id difference? Except the back glass is transparent and bunch of flashy leds. All are same of $ 100. devices.
"This is definitely cool, but I'm not sure how relevant lights on the back of a phone are? Do people keep their phones face down? 
That seems like a very easy way to guarantee scratches, especially if you plan on jiggling the phone to see the battery life while face down..."
It's looks mad nice though
nothing is on to something
Make the back do the hole rgb spectrum move the selfie camera to the centre 💥💥
honestly... I'm waiting on that potential Tesla Phone. I'm positive it's gonna go crazy.
Nice G3 Powerbook in the background.
"Notification like , movie background sounds ✍️🤗🙊🙈✨🤣  Predator ,alien , star war 🤫🤫🤫🤫"
that shade on OnePlus though… 💀💀💀
This would be incredibly useful for anyone that is HoH/Deaf!
Anyone know if a black version is confirmed or not? (As they did with the earbuds)
I love to see some innovation. And that's some innovation. And it looks cool. But these aren't  useful features. I can already see who is calling even in silent mode. By simply looking at the front of the phone. Phones already display charge level on the front of the phone when wiggled. It looks like it's a prop from Tron which I like. But there aren't useful featuresfor me to buy this.
Dbrand is not going to be happy with Teardown skins.
"Niche phone.  Glyph notification is original, I will give them that. Glyph notification is useless when phone is in pocket. Users of the Nothing Phone must use clear case or a tinted case.  All accessories will need to come from manufacturer as there is not enough customer base for 3rd party ones. All smartphones have the ability to modify vibration patterns for each ring tone so people can set it up so they know who is calling without even looking at phone in silent mode. I think MKHD low key showed the target market share for the Nothing Smartphone. It’s going after the young teenager who will want Naruto or DBZ phone. To old dudes like me it’s meh."
"No aux port, no thank you."
Haha love the subtle dig at the end there 😂 sounds familiar?
Legit just looks like an iphone 12 with a clear back and a hole punch display
Only if they had one the size of 12 or 13 mini I would have been all in. The form factor again kills the deal for me.
Hahaha One plus reference
Marques can't forgive OnePlus sheesh
"4:45 Clear case coming from ""Nothing"" lmfao"
"I love this LED light stuff they have added, have been seeing same boring designs off late. This is a refreshing change but the software and it’s optimisation are the most important part that’s where one plus had an upper hand along with the price. Hope they have this covered. People are not going to be excited about the LED lights on the back after 2 weeks but software is gonna be judged every time they pick up the phone."
Cool Mobile
""
Nothing as expected
Carl Pei is brilliant.
Looks gimmicky to me
Sounds familiar?! Hmm *insert OnePlus noises* :D
"Is the nothing company are the biggest fans of Apple? Even bigger than Xiaomi, lol"
"seems super gimmicky, I just don't think its necessary to use the back of the phone for all these things it takes a split second from a lock screen to figure it all out"
"A slightly quirky phone hits the market; everybody: 😱😱😱

Meanwhile, every 2000's phone: *hold my beer!*"
"seriously!! adding LEDs to the back of the phone, and that's all.. not worth all this marketing!!"
Can the led change colour
"And the million dollar question is, HOW MUCH???"
"Ya I like my notification LED indicator lights to be subtle and not  something that screams. 
Also  why would I keep my phone face down while charging?"
Yeah that ending part sounds very familiar😂😂
Proper iphone knockup. Typical chinese brand.
sorry but MEH
"Well, Bad luck for Jerry Rig Everything. He cant use D-brand ,TEARDOWN screen,on this phone."
"They’re trying too hard tbh, but is it $200? else no thanks"
Haven't heard a ringtone in like 8 years
"Yeah, this is the best looking phone by far."
"Iphone Peasants: ... [havent noticed]
Samsung  Sheep: .... [Dont care]
One Plus Hipsters: ...[remembers the feeling]

Me: Here we go again. Red Hydrogen One...Unbuntu Edge......Essential Phone...."
its cool but seems like its going to be expenisve to produce in different colours seeing as the internals would need to be different colours as well. Would be nice to see it in black with some RGB
Just waiting on Apple to do a cool collab phone.
"It looks cool, but I couldn't memorize the patterns. *The next step would be a backside full of customizable pixels to show pixelized pictures of the app or person who is calling.*

But to be honest: I am *waiting for HTC to re-enter the market!* Still have a U11 here, always liked HTC and hoping their next phone isn't as overpriced so it would sell at least."
did capitalism ruined oneplus or oneplus abused it?
Marques never misses an opportunity to shit on Oneplus.😄
To me tht back light Kindof looks like n apple logo(theres also a cutout on the right side) and then there is an “i” at the bottom… maybe a coincidence or maybe it’s intentional or wtv but was interesting
"I have an s22 and I really like the look of this phone and the features so far, I'm considering it."
First time able to see the front and overall phone in its 360 degree....thanks
Stupid useless gimmik. The company will be dead in 3 years
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven.
i sooooooo wanted him to say 'this is nothin'
"6:32 hey OnePlus, you guys listening? This is exactly why you lost your original fans."
No light demo in the dark? oops!
Wow😳
6:30 ONEPLUS
R they RGB?
Oh it does sound familiar.... Hmmm 🤔
take my money!
I wonder if the color of the LEDs can be changed. I mean why not keep multi-color LEDs there? :)
I AM SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING IT.
Spoiler Alert : OnePlus reference at the end people 😆
"""So what phone did you buy""
""I bought Nothing"""
"those ringtones and flashes remind me of the old school text displays in the Alien movies for some reason, the blinks and clicks. I love this."
I was thinking of Portal 2
the bleeps and the creep!
More like the self-destruct sequence from the original Predator.
"Please remember Sony Xperia U, P & S series about the LED strip lights with multicolours at the bottom. It's not new I think..."
bro yes! i was thinking the same. like he said in the video the whole phone looks like a sci-fi movie prop i love it
iPhone
"That LED pattern is a cool idea, but tbh, those ringtones are ghastly"
pov: my name is nothing
The ending tho...Oneplus got burned.. 🔥
this phone will be costing NOTHING!!
Why is nobody talking about that it looks EXACTLY like iPhone 13? From Symmetric bezel thickness to squared design to camera position to bottom bar.
That One Plus ending hit me outa nowhere...
"Yeah, the back side of the phone looks dope. But waiitt... we can't judge it too quick. This phone can sustain and survive the present huge mobile market, only if it have competing specs parallel to it's price ratio. That's the only thing which can make the Nothing phone a hit or a stand out from the other mobiles in the same pricing point. Always remember that, Pricing matters everything and all the time."
Here is one crazy idea: make a phone that will not shatter when it drops off so we can use it without a case.
Unbreakable glass? $2000 phone.
sounds familiar said in last was a reference to our beloved phone OnePlus One
I'm sorry but the design is nothing but unique. It looks like they took a iPhone 12 with a transparent back mod and painted it white. Nothing unique at all.
I’ll buy it
I spent money on nothing
“I’m only allowed to show the back” Proceeds to show the screen
"Whats the screen size? ..hope they bring a mini version as well, i think some of us are done with 'big-bulky-use both your hands' phones"
"The Glyphs on the back do kinda look like the apple logo, that had to be intentional"
Jerry Rig Evening is like..... hummmmm.
The era of smartphone hype has ended lol. There was a time when it was hot shit but I think at this point any phone you get is pretty decent and more than enough to get you through the day and do some gaming. So most people will go for the safe choice. Good luck to Nothing though.
What is the screen size of nothing 1?
"Really cool. If they can make a rgb colored lights, I would buy it, hands down."
Outro Logo Also Bright Like The Back Of Nothing One
LTT Mouse Mat ??
LOL
"You definitely hit on a subject that has happened throughout the course of history, for most products. The product starts out OK, then becomes ITS BEST, until it is finally mass produced and loses its quality and charm. ""Design for manufacturing"" is the process of reducing cost and maximizing profit for an existing product. It is part of product development and often results in a worse product for the end-user. Mass produced products are hardly ever referred to as ""over-built"", because anything extra has been stripped away."
All they had to do was put those flashy LEDs on the sides instead of the back. They were so close to giving the phone an actual useful feature/tool. SO CLOSE. Just had to put 2 and 2 together and understand that those 4 people who places their phones screen side down shouldn't be encouraged. Maybe next time.
My startup is coming
if the S21 Ultra only included Samsung's old notification light.. it would be a perfect phone
why do I feel like the exact target audience for this... god dammit I want one
"Looks a lot like another ""iPhone that runs Android"". Those lights are a nice touch though.
I'm looking forward to see what they do with this device."
"Great review, this phone looks pretty dope."
"I can see those lights on the back being very handy for someone that is hard of hearing.  this light pattern means a text, this light pattern means a call, etc."
You mean 1plus?
"Those flat sides are painful to hold , it's ergonomically worse than curved sides ."
iPhone+Android design !
What's the point of notification led on the back of the phone? Do we want other people to know that we got a notification?
Was that a dig at one plus at 6:33 ?
cries in Nexus
Does a feature like this on a phone drain the battery any quicker? Or is it pretty optimized to not make a huge impact on the phone battery life?
rip-off knock-off bootleg iPhone 12
That's true and sick.
this phone screams iPhone 12 to me
"This looks tacky AF.
It's basically an iPhone-esque design with the tasteless LED-obsession of a 13 year old ""gamer""."
Look so cool🔥. J wonder how's the software gonna be😌
Everybody felt the ending part
If this is a good value.  Might try it
Iphone ? Noo Its Nothing like Iphone
looks like its straight out of aperture science labs. and the ringtone sounds like that too.
I think I'd be more interested in this phone if the lights were rgb. Pc gamer here so everything must be rgb
Please Review The Sony Mark IV Dude
Can’t believe this Lmfao they really made a knock off IPhone just buy a IPhone if thats the case 💀 they even have the navigation bar LMAO google had it first but apple dominated it now all phone companies wanna jock off apple because apple is huge
Straight up buy and I am an S22 plus user.
Good but led power will be down getting older.
04:11 is dope
Its cool and gimmicky but it can’t replace a full fetched flagship
Gimmicky as hell. Idc about led’s on the back and think it’s ugly lmao. But I’m sure others will like it
i wish every phone company made clearback phones
You are the first man 🔥⚡on YouTube show full phone so thank you ❤️😍
6:31 oneplus reference
"He is so cool, you can hear him think"
"Yeah if this phone has the same crappy quality as the earphones, I mean I won't even look at it...
But I have to admit, in design they do great"
"Looks decent. I wonder about using the ringtones and light patterns for identifying people when they call if it's muted as a benefit though. 
Caller ID kinda has that covered already."
"What a cool phone. I would buy it if it's functional: stable software, decent battery and decent camera, that's all I ask."
This phone is thick af!
Move the camera to middle its a iphone 15 (front)
"The subtle Oneplus reference spoke to me! Thank you Marques for being so authentic, always *top class*!"
would be cool to have different colours with different colour LEDs. guess it will have all the top Snapdragon n ram I'd upgrade to this.
"The phones back look awesome, nice features. But, most of the times I keep my phone on its back, who keeps the phone on its screen so these features are usable?"
"Whats your phonebrand ? 
Me: Nothing"
I mean... the synchronized lights it's not too different from what Apple does with haptics and ringtones and lights for those with hearing difficulties 👀
"Lost opportunity of naming this video: ""The Nothing Phone LOOKS like nothing else"""
Apple engineers ready to copy and make it better😅😅😅 for iphone25
"Does anyone know if this phone will work with U.S. carriers? I know it's UK based, but I am very interested 👀 I don't see why they'd miss out on that market."
"My mobile don’t wiggle wiggle, it glows"
"6:30
One plus: yes lol"
This looks like a gutted iphone to me. I'm sure Apple will sue sooner or later.
Give me dark green with a mute switch
Is the screen 90 or 120
"Finally, RGB coming to mobiles 😌"
"I like this nothing phone. I personally wouldn’t use it however, I’m very intrigued and hope more companies does something new and different like this"
"I like that it’s different but outside of that is where my interest begins to fade. There’s a few issues. Most people put devices in a case to protect it not only front scratches and breaking the phone but to hold up the resale value. What would be revolutionary is if the phone was self serviceable. To me it looks like just like other phones with more that can go wrong. The second is that tech is more than devices, it’s about the ecosystem. There needs to be an accompanying watch as well as a software UX that rivals what iOS does with their devices and macOS or what Samsung is starting to do with Windows. 
For iOS how pairing your Bluetooth device pairs it with every other iOS device you own and every other feature of continuity mode in general. Or how with Samsung Dex you have a full fledged computer. I’m not saying this device is bad but ecosystems are more important imo."
It's the most useless feature ever. Why would I even need LED lights on the back of my phone ???
Diva who? Marques said Shadeeeeeee 💅🏿
IDC what you say but this is naked version of an iPhone 122
The progress bar at the bottom is really cool.
I think I'm in love.
Sound familiar? Oneplus
"Abandoned the original fan base.... 
Bye One Plus.... 
Hello Nothing!!!"
"I'm not in need of a phone but if I was it would come down to two big things, software support length and quality of the os. Too many times has a great phone been buggered by bad software."
"Who places their phone on the front glass? If they actually used sapphire like HTC did once, maybe it would make sense. As is, it will just get scratched for no apparent reason as everything that leds can do, screen can do better. If you put it in transparent case, that's like the only way to even attempt to use that ""feature"". It's one of the most useless gimmicks in phones I've seen so far. That look is pretty cool tho. Definately prefer my clean looking devices, but it has its appeal I guess."
Its coming out in july 12th?? thats one day before my birthday
I hope it launches in India.......this is sooooo cool I want one
"This is the first time IN A LONG TIME that I actually went ""Wow, that's super cool"" when watching a phone review. I would need to know more about the actual ""phone"" part of the device, but it sure piqued my interest. I see you Nothing!"
Yet another unusable phablet.
Peace ✌️
"Idk , the outside sure as shit looks like an iPhone to me"
"I like how it looks, but I'm not sure I trust them to make a whole phone. The ear 1 has been out for almost a year, and even after all the firmware updates whenever I pull them out of the case, one or both of them doesn't pair. I hope that it's just some hardware limitation that's kept them from patching it and this phone is going to be rock solid, but it's not really confidence inspiring."
"That’s an iPhone for people, who say they don’t want an iPhone"
I’ll try it .  Once they come out I’ll buy it as a work phone
A bit too familiar. Will depend on the price though...
"If the charging led lights up when you wiggle the phone, then it'll stay on while using the phone when charging. Either they make a pretty dam job of it not being annoying while using the phone at night while charging or people will get mad on it."
Gimmick city
The world economic forum says phones will be obsolete by 2030.
personally i don't think this phone will get anywhere
Coolest phone ever
Rip OnePlus.. that what you meant MKYBD right?
Don't read my name
The name of the phone is going to hamper the marketing
Man fell in love 💕💕💕 with its design
Cool looking phone but my eyes were drawn more to that Wallstreet PowerBook :)
Inspired by Nokia 3220
Brother what will be expected price in India ?
This is what we thought phones in the future would look like.
"Unnecessary bling on the back, I like the front and sides 👍"
Looks and sounds like something out of Tron
If they really want to stand out  than their competition in flagship segment 'just provide a good charger with the phone'
Pretty dope! But I’ll wait to see if they make a Pro version later on.
It's still just a glass slab. Surface Duo 2 is actually improving my work experience in my phone. Miss my BlackBerry Key2. Glass slabs are awful. This is just another one.
Can you change the color of the lights?
"'Sounds familiar' 🙂🙂............but this time I don't want them to abandon their originality and become a generic phone........ 🤔 Hmmm, but if nothing's plan works then they don't have to change..... new changes will appear on smartphones overall 😌... looking forward to that."
Wow that's definitely different than your regular slab phone nice
how much will it be lol 😂
A whole video talking about the gimmick and not really telling something about the phone! Expected better!
The full customizable RGB lighting must be coming. That would carve out a definite niche for those who are into that for their PCs.
If this phone is gonna be as unreliable and buggy as the Nothing Ear 1 I regret owning then I’m not interested.
You sure showed the front of the phone a lot for someone who wasn't supposed to lol
But does it come in black?
What is the OS of this fone?Android?
"Marques i love you man, but this is bullshit"
"They should focus on the camera, battery life and software. and also I want them to bring the alert slider."
"So it's flat and symmetrical, now please tell me it's a 5000mah battery in there and just take my money 👍"
I can show you the back of the phone…but here’s the front
"I'm ONEPLUS 3 USER and thought of switching to the top end model.... But Oneplus settled with oppo worst color os......


I was waiting for apple.... Iphone...


But fortunately.... 
Carl... X ceo of 1+ came with the bang❤️NOTHING came as my survival ❤️"
i really want nothing
Please don't be terrible Please don't be terrible Please don't be terrible Please don't be terrible
Great idea. A case. Mmmmmm Yeh I’m into that.
can we put ios in this beauty?
"Well, atleast someone is trying to do something new."
It’s an iPhone copy just see through and it looks terrible
I think they will launch the black edition few months after this launch it will be more dope♠️♠️♠️
"Oh my gosh, I want every piece of hardware that you have.  ...is that bad?🤔🤓"
"We are not getting charger with this phone 
Who is with me"
Thr lights are useless. Why would i put my phone upside down when i phone has a damn always on display??
I hate how much I actually really like this phone so far. Curious about the software and cameras.
"""Here it is! The new nothing phone!""
""Sir, that's an iPhone 12 with the back glass missing...""
""Excuse me? An iPhone 12 with the back glass missing...WITH LIGHTS!!"""
Looks so cool. A bit of outside the box thinking for once.
Dropping that phone would be tragic for all of those LEDs on the back
"Brother you have so much smartphone, please give me one phone please
Love From Bangladesh 🇧🇩"
"I never *ever* place my phone face down, so ... 🤷"
👆👆Thanks message me I've got something for you
"Phone looks pretty cool no doubt about it, but with all these LED i am curious about the battery life"
"It looks awesome...but remember the essential phone????
From what i hv seen from their nothing launcher...its too simple n looks very dull and boring...i hope that's not the case..
And the in built ringtones most of them sounded annoying"
I could have this as my secondary phone.
That’s an amazing light bar. Would have that on my iPhone if it was an option
OnePlus didn't create a single mass appealing phone they created a ton of phones for every budget just like the other companies and accessories to upsell their customers while lowering their quality both in software and hardware.
👆👆Thanks message me I've got something for you
Making a sick back and giving it to the YouTubers to review before launch. Is there any better method to do publicity?
@5:55 The shout-out to OPO was real! might exchange my phone 12 mini for this.
Something different. I like.
Cyberpunk Phone
"It's really hard to build another apple like company now, because customers are used to higher standards, they have certain expectations and analogues among other smartphones. New company needs to keep up with such standards and add something more."
Is this a paid video? It looks like a stretch
The phone is good but not for everyone...
Bro how much  this  mobile  price
that gounded very familiar
Okay now you don't have to purchase LED lights to make reels this is enough to do it for you. The niche market until unless there are some more cool things hidden under the hood.
They could come up with a case with clear stuff just around the led shapes and they could add Color’s for the rest
The LED had Just one  color
6:32 definitely sounds familiar exactly why I’m back on the iPhone 😂
"The Subtlety Portrayed By You In The End You Is Just Immaculate
*+1* For It 👍"
2:13 I thought of Apple logo 🍏
One plus fans be mirin
You know what I'd get for this?  I'd get something like edge bumpers that's just a ring of rubber that covers the sides and edges of the phone and something like a glass screen protector but for the back.
"Gotta admit. Pretty lame. 
Clear plastic back that can light up?? WOOOWWWW!"
😂😂😂😂   sounds very familiar
"Would switch to it however, am a little concerned about the quality of the cameras, it's their first try and am not sure that it's going to compete with the s22's and the 13's ."
We can't add protective back cover......the end
"i would prefer a ceramic back instead of this ugly back with so many lights..
you can use it for lighting your room"
"I hate this ringtones with ALL of myself but I love the detail of the charging level. It has potential. We have to see the software optimization and the rest before judging. And the design can be a mixture of Samsung and iPhone but honestly, I love it for that! The best of both worlds combined!"
idk man this looks like a potential next apple company
Lowkey looks like an Iphone
6:32 - onePlus?
"4:10 those tones are almost pretty clever. They’re not melodies, but they’re almost clean enough to sound like decent sci-fi sounds. They just sound a bit scratchy."
Nothing is nothing.... Just copying iphone
"Imagine if they pt a screen on the back and show a picture of the person calling ! 
They can show the time left untill charging complete on that screen too !
So many possibilities....
Or they can flip the phone around and use the main screen. Wouldn't that be wild ? 😁

But seriously. I like that white collor. My phone is black all around."
Did anyone notice the weird white noise that was bugging me the whole time
Now if that ran IOS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whats that sound uhhhh sound of nothing ??😄
That’s a customised iPhone 12
"That's quite the hefty charging cable. I wonder what the charging speeds are going to be.  Need 120 hz, warp charging and most importantly oxygen O2 and I'llk be interested."
"I love the notification led, I miss this feature. Charge bar is great too"
Wtf are those ring tones
Price will determine whether this is DOA
Amazing branding work
"The problem starts when you start reviewing the screen, the battery life, the software and the cameras... It will for sure be meh..."
"If this phone came out during January of this year, I would have most probably bought it. But since, I already have got a new phone this year, no way am I switching for another 3-4 year's at least."
If It has 120 hz A Great battery A Great Camera and Not expensive Im moving That phone so far is Different and sick in a great way
That looks interesting 🔥. Hope they can add colorful LEDs which any user can set as a notification indicator for some apps.
"Oh no, hope they don't"
Taking this phone to the airport would be wild
I would love to see this phone with a black option and with RGB LEDs so twitter would be blue and Instagram would give the glow of what they have for the icon background I think that would make it better and more interesting than just white phone white LEDs
If they come out with Thanos purple I'm willing to pay everything.
"I can't wait to spend time picking out the LED blink pattern to match the ringtones for the phone calls no one wants to answer. Also, this is dumb. None of this is of any real use."
I'm moving..
AXON ZTE 40 ULTRA LOOKED FANTASTIC THAN THIS
"Well, this phone gives distinctly Star Wars R2-D2 vibes."
"Imagine having this phone, then puts an opaque case on it"
in the last 5 years of having my current phone its been on loud maybe 5 days in total. that notification alert using the backlights has really piqued my interest. If they can hit the mid range market at a competitive price I would go for it. even knowing that in 2 years i may have to upgrade again.
It looks awesome but it’ll run android so nah….
"i want this phone, it looks so nice"
I have been a loyal one plus user since one plus one phone... But that ended with one plus 7.. that was the last flag ship killer post that is has just become a rebranded phone no  new technologically and almost cost similar to samsung... Now thinking of switching to nothing phones hope it will keep use exited atleast till first fine iteration
I was dying to see the front and couldn't wait till 12 July and you just showed the screen and said i am allowed to show back in this video.
looks dope
"Earlier i thought transparent back would be lame, but these implementations are dope.... definitely my next phone would be from nothing..."
"It does look like an iPhone 11 with a transparent skin, but the Glyph interface is a lot more interesting than I thought"
"Wow, this ""sounds familiar?"" thing just made my day! 👍 I hope Carl Pei won't do the same mistake twice!"
Easy to unlock bootloader? then I'm sold for most part.
"Ok, it looks cool and all... but am I the only one who gets flipped off by people laying their phone flat on the screen when they put it somewhere ?"
I literally thought this was a modded iPhone until the end of the video.
This is the coolest phone in a while.
Let's hope it's not expensive
If this phone doesnt come with120 hz screen and priced 35k above in india..then i will just prefer Iqoo 9 far superior mobile
"Very cool stuff happening with the lights on the back. But the novelty of that feature ain't enough to make this innovative. In the end, with regard to how we all use phones, it's still the same as the rest."
"But, does it come in black? Lol"
That dig at OnePlus tho 🔥
I was thinking Oneplus too hah
an excellenly tasteful dig :)
"Haha right, I love their phones too had them for years now."
Sounds like OnePlus.
"title: Nothing phone looks different 
me: iPhone"
looks sick no doubt
"you get the notification light on the xepria, so nothing new there"
mentioning a case did sorta kill it for me.
"In 1.12 you say you're allowed to show only the back of the phone , but in 2.24 you showed the front panel 😂😂"
Nokia had the blink-in notification light far ahead of its time which synced in with the ringtone and vibrates like an earthquake!
It doesn't look different
It’s such a gimmick imo; who puts their phone face down on a table just for some LED lights to shine? I’d rather like to see what the notifications actually are.
I want one!
"This is obviously a gimmik (It adds zero information over the normal always on display). but it works, not functionally, but works for the real reason it was added, to get some excited and pay!"
😂 sounds familiar
oh...looks so good
The back of that phone is really unique I’ll give it that. Just hoped the phone looked different from the front than the regular punchhole displays we have today. Maybe they’ll have something different apart from the display
This would be exciting if not for the fact that you can have all those features and more by just having AOD on the front...
"""i'm only allowed to show you the back of the phone"""
i will 200% buy this
"You didn’t talk about the prices? And configurations?

Will they export outside?"
"Its not the design that attracts me. Being a OnePlus fan, it was disappointing when OnePlus started taking customers for granted and started destroying the phone's uniqueness by replacing the pure stock experience with some chinese OS experience.. 

And Carl Pei decided to act. ❤️ I'm sure many of the OnePlus owners including myself will switch to Nothing even if the specs are lower than their current device just to get that uniqueness. To get that real stock experience."
"The Japanese company (Sharp) will launch a very competitive phone and I am waiting for it and the specifications it offers are wonderful. It will come with a mini_LED screen at a rate of 120Hz with a SNAPDRAGON 778G processor with a 6N resolution, the adreno 640 graphics processor, stereo speakers, a 6000M battery with a charging capacity of 80W, supports fast charging and wireless charging with a capacity of 40W, as well as reverse charging with a capacity  40W processor cooling system, fifth generation protection, and all this at a price of $ 275"
"the screen and back look cool, the ringtones suck, and from the launcher shows us, the software isnt that great. just my opinion"
How did you get an iPhone 12 prototype!?
Great design and well built 👏
"I think the back looks bad. I like the idea... Lights, some internals exposed with a transparent back, etc. But i just don't like how it was done. The shape of the LED strips just look weird too. Wish it was something a bit more intentional how the LEDs were laid out."
this phone looks scifi af love it
"If the first run is successful enough
They can make slightly more appealing  that sells more if that one works  , and they can repeat the appealing techniques until u make phone that sells more and abandoned your orginal fan base 😂😂😂😂😂😂 one plus"
There is nothing bad in the iPhone 12 design . The interesting part will be software updates and the UI on top of Android .
I think as per embargo MKBH don’t have much content to say about phone than led lights. Sorry to say MKBH
Kind of useless in long run. Everything will depend on how it performs
Like my comment if you would actually consider buying this phone and using it as your daily one. (This is not for likes)
Idc what you say 100% looks like a iPhone 12
Super 👍🏻👍🏻 I love it
Why there is so much hype for nothing?
Wahoo ill buy this phone.

"I have a Razer phone 2 (the gaming accessory company, not motorola) and they have a pretty cool blinking LED on the back that lights up for notis, but what I like most about it is that it lights up in the specific color for a given type of notification (red for a YouTube noti, blue for a text, purple for a yahoo finance, etc)...

"My dad had nokia's keypad phone with 4 independent LED sets each containing 4 or 5 LEDs. Those lights could be flashed alongwith all of the ringtones it consisted. And also it had a camera, so it was a fun but only 20 or 30 photos could be stored."

"abit dissapointed with  the bezel at front it's like iphone thick , i was expecting it to be as thin as the S22 series. anyway can't ask too much in a mid range phone. also corner hole punch ruined the symmetrical design ...... but for a midrange phone the  design over all is premium."

*sighs* Once again whats with the focus on things like this (LED) when most people will slap a case on it anyways???
Hi what exactly is your job? Love your video
@marque How you have been able match the Sound sync with light pattern on other phone?
I would for sure get this phone if I didn’t have friends
Hope they make a hardshell transparent case too
good idea from Nothing. stay original and we will suport you
The ear (1) were a total scam (so many issues on release and still having issues to this day if not more) idk why your even mentioning this phone
"i am waiting for something brand , because something is better than nothing😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥"
This phone looks dope 🔥🔥🔥
"Nothingggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🪴"
"I love how he said, let's see if they repeat another OnePlus without saying out loud 😅. Anyways, I personally dig the design. Waiting for the full review."
"Nothing has done exactly what I have hoped apple will do for a long time, just give the apple logo at the back of the iphone some functionality, it's to beautiful to just be a sticker"
"The people will buy this phone ,like sooooper fast , I'm sooo sure about that !"
The camera bump looks really clean
looks like S22+ from front but with a little bit more bezel otherwise its an iphone body.... No that I hate it though
Is this the reason Carl Pei started a new company?
Pixel 6A is going to be a competition for this phone!
Dope
I want it man 😍
"Apple will sue them soon, Gliphy lights looks like an Apple logo!"
Who is interested in the back of a phone ? 😂
👆👆Thanks message me I've got something for you
Looks great but I would have to fight with myself to use those LEDs. I almost never put my phone face down.
"That ""sound familiar"" at the end... Dope..😂😂"
"That is an extremely small chin for a company's first ever smartphone,,"
What os will it run ?
"With all those LED lights, your battery will last half a day"
"If killjoy has a phone, pretty sure it'd be something like that"
"the way he went ""sound familiar?"" Lol, were talking about you tim"
The big question is......does it come in black?
It’s literally a Samsung Apple
Kinda useless design.
ive been waiting for this video from u mkbhd
1+
Kinda useless design.
Nice... Symmetrical front and bixy design..❤️
"Carl Pei: let's add a notification LED

Design lead: Hold my beer"
He showed the front when he said he is only and to show back
Idk you basically need a clear case or go case less for this phone to work it’s special features
"Sound familiar? Yes, bleeding OnePlus. The 1+7 Pro is my last 1+ phone. Imagine making arguably the best phone ever and just going crazy after. I'll probably go back to Sony next year."
"Missed opportunity not making a full circle out of the 900 LEDs so we can customize our own image on the back. Yes it would be mostly memes and it would be awesome.

Sound something like the ASUS game phones would have, lol."
Spec ? 🤔
"memba the Essential Phone, yeah i still have mine with 360 cam, this will eventually end up being Essential Phone 2"
"Unintentionally, Nothing has created a phone after my own heart. A while ago I caught myself gripping my iPhone 12 and saying ""Gee, if only Android had a phone as esthetically pleasing as this one, with a software to match.""
And, by the looks of it, Nothing promises to bring EXACTLY that, and more. Now, I'm still on the fence after that Nothinf Launcher preview, but hardware-wise, I love what I'm looking at so far."
Time to change my phone
This looks exactly like iPhone 12
Yeah that sounds familiar ! I'm using oneplus 9 but it was way better back in the days when i had op3 ! Damn 😐
Nice.....But I'm not going to be the first one in the pool with this. I'll wait til the second generation.
This whole time I thought that was a cool iPhone case
Headphone jack??
It looks like a weird iPhone 12
Honestly if those back LEDs were RGB and I was looking for a new phone rn I'd consider it lol.
last sentence taunting was for apple phones ⁉️🤣
for Real!
Iphone 14pro is my next phone
"Guys, it’s really not that cool. You’d play with it for an hour, show it off to friends, and then get bored of it like everything else.

A few extra LEDs and ringtones is not going to move the needle in this era of phones.

The first production clear backed phone and they just wall off all the guts with white shielding 🤦‍♂️"
Реально круто выглядит
That dig at OnePlus!  I love it! It needed to be said...
"Ugh iphone design, but it also has cool 'back'lights, truly cutting edge 😌 ; P"
The exterior alone won't sell the phone until it's software & interface gets reviewed
"I'm not sure why you'd want the glyph interface - if you wanted to see notifications, you could just have your phone screen facing up so you can see what you're getting.   I don't see the point behind flipping your phone to get notified by an LED instead."
"I need this back in ""matte black"""
APPLE PUT THIESE FEATURES IN IPHONES
how will the LED's work when it's in a case??
"""Ultimate notification LED """
"I don't care abt the led gimmicks , probably would never use them. I want r2d2 notification tone. It should work well, b snappy. Have good features, easy to use like oos."
"so if nothing does something, its called different and dope while when sony does it, it'll called gimmick and for enthusiast?🤔"
Sounds very familiar...!
"Not buying any phone with more than a camera...unless I buy specifically for photography, which is not my case."
No dbrand skins for this.😓
No one as mentioned battery life?. Lot's of light's means lot's of battery juice. Looks really good though 👍
"It's fine, but I don't think it's all that interesting. The LED patterns remind me of the notifications on hybrid smartwatches - ultimately too arbitrary to be useful for all that much, which is why I prefer things such as Samsung's LED cases where you can print useful messages and icons on them instead.
Plus I'm sure regional availability will be limited, probably even more so than Sony and Google phones, and being a relatively small company, I doubt it'll be priced competitively."
Omg 🤤🤤🤤
"idea is nice but being forced to use thee inbuild tones only to have the light react is boring. maybe they should add via update funktion to create own pattern or switch them  to audio reactive.
Another idea would be a App that u putt in a Audiofile to Analyze it then Creates a Profile  for the Lights.
Even Nicer Would be a RGB or RGBW LED Variant."
This phone with Apple software will be on another level
I'm really interested in this but i fear that it will not have good cameras
The finishing touch was hilarious. Essentially reminding Pete lau to not create another one plus legacy.
Yeah cool features until you slap a half decent case on it...
what was the league of legends phone from?
and now we can say one plus has settled down
"I guess it will be large as everything else (but maybe I am wrong)...if it would be 6.1"" max that would be great and going against the crowd...but I expect 6.5+"
tbh im more interested in the ui
😂 sound familiar? And the head tilt. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Why am I getting the feeling that he was talking about Oneplus?
One Plus did that strategy
"has a fully functional phone in his hands ""this phone is not out"""
Sounds way too familiar 😒
Where can i download the ringtone? Thats sound dope
Stranger things vibe!
i would pay nothing to get this...
"Kudos to you for mentioning ""Abandoned"" in the last.. Perfect ending"
one plus PTSD
"The question is, why the hell would any sane person put their phone screen down. That's should be illegal."
You are so attractive 😍 I’ve bee watching you for years now. (Not in a creepy way). But your so cute. Respectfully.
Are the nights only white color? Or RGB?
"Alternate title: ""NOTHING Looks Like This!"""
DAAAAAMN? holy shit
i like it. depending on the rest of the review i could see myself wanting it. can't really afford to spend money on a phone rn though
Xiaomi: 👁👁
I have already decided to buy this phone at somepoint in my life because I always thaught that phone's back has a lot of space to fit many new features.
Ниче себе )))
I love Iphone design and 6 inch form factor.. But their price and restrictive nature of ios never appeal me.... If Nothing is priced reasonably I would surely buy it
I’m not at all a phone guy. But this new lighting at the back n transparent cover looks interesting
Damn. Punch hole isn't centered. That basically just killed the fron design for me
"'I'm only allowed to show you the back of the phone'

*shows back of the phone*"
iphone with transparent back nothing new!
It looks like an iphone 12
"All I heard in the video was LIGHT, the entire video was about the back of the phone, and I think that's what this phone brings the most."
I'm waiting for this phone to come out and grab one!😍
Bo just showed us Dbz phone
Finally thumbnail justifies the video!
Just loved the subtle mocking of OnePlus 😂😂😂
Nostromo ringtones :)
Any oneplus users planned to switch over  nothing 😇
"Love the lights, but the sounds are not pleasant to hear. Will see if there is any updates on that."
Yes sounds familiar..... he's mentioning the 1+
I came
nice phone to have at the nightclub
Who puts down their phone with the screen down though when the screen can give you the exact info on who is calling or messaging you? the LED's seem like a cool feature but when you think about it for a minute its just not that practical as having you phone screen-up. Looks nice though.
Cool looking and features are quite useful cool simple not gimmick :)
I got the last part 😭
LG G2 used to have a RGB led for notifications. Woth a ROM I remember using a plugin/app for changing color by contact notification. That was a less intrusive I believe
Que porquería tan grande se volvió está industria.
Why Wasting money on design we use phones with a case.
You can use a transparent case
'You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.. Prime example 1+
Full unboxing and camera specifications
Sound familiar!!!.......me:1++++ :(
They could make different coloured translucent cases to make the phone and it's LEDs different colours as well
You are a blind iPhone lover
OnePlus ending was so smooth
"Tbh, all I see are gimmicks. Yeah, they're cool, but I'm not buying a phone just on gimmicks. The software is the most important part for me."
Only young mad ppl can buy this fon ...normsl ppl chose decent fons i guess .......well i think its a toy fone dont waste mony on it cz dont think its worth for me ....
Been using OP6T for a while now...Think imma switch..
Mirror selfies are gonna look cool with this one
This guy can't wait to compare any phone to the iPhone when he's not reviewing an iPhone. What a dumb approach to a review
CIG!  it says on the back?
Those ringtones would look super cool in a dimly lit room.
"Intro music is cool. Regarding phone, I will write after watching complete video 😀"
Take my money lol
Taking HUGE shots at One Plus towards the end of the video! I remember when they were super unique and aiming to be flagship killers and now they're just doing the same thing other companies are doing.
Techsci guy er vidio dekha ke ke ascho?
cool 🇺🇦
Basically its main feature is the LED notification. I think it's cool.
You support homosexuality. So you should have unsubscribe
"Couldn't believe that more than the top screen, it's being talked about the phone back"
Good for Nothing for trying to do something unique… not sure I would buy it but who knows?
if it comes with a snapdragon 8gen1 then im buying it for sure dope design inspired from iphone🔥
Lemme put a case on it.
this phone is tough! definitely looking forward to the review..hope its as good to use as it looks
why do your videos always look grainy at 1080p?? it's so distracting
"I have friends who are hearing impaired so these lights would be great for them, if it vibrates while blinking that would be ever better for them."
Anyone else think the lights kinda look like a large apple logo?
matte black????? 😭
"Tron movie phone, maybe ?"
I thought it was the 14 tho
"Nice idea with the lights, but most hardcore users will put a case on it, so defeats the point.  To me it’s going to be the price point.  Needs to be under $600 for me to consider it"
There are two models (nothing phone 1 ) and ( nothing phone R)
"Anything that steps apples foot, is welcome, apple got that god mentality now..."
6:10 OnePlus be like - I wonder who's he talking about?
Damn!! Sure I’ll try this phone
Apple has nothing to worry about
why would I wiggle my phone screen on a surface and scratch it? might as well pick it up but then I won't need the light...
I think most importantly is the spec first then only we talk about the extra features. Don’t think consumers would buy a phone just over some back light led design if it packed with lousy processors. HTC phones proved that when they launch their flagship with bad spec.
"🗿its nothing after all,expected nothing ofc"
Hope dbrand have a skin for this phone
nokia 3220
I think a true transparent back would look much better
all I'm looking for a Good OS and UI that Competes Upto Ios bcz android just really sucks and is Laggy!
"I really hope this company is like Tesla, comes out of nowhere and pushes the boundaries of all other manufacturers and brings new ideas and concepts to the table. And my dreams are somewhat promising! This company is very similar where really they are a software company that happens to make a phone for their software. Let’s just hope there are no panel gaps… wouldn’t imagine that makes for the best waterproofing."
"Great, the only somehow innovative thing will be no more when you out it in the protective case"
even bezzels >>>
really amazing phone i will buy it if i have enough money 😂😍😊
👆👆 Congratulations you won a giveaway❤️
I’ll give it a shot for sure!
Looks cool but that’s an iPhone design thumbs down
The last video you made with mrwhosetheboss was so f*cked up man. Am an iPhone user but even I felt cheated. I miss my Samsung screen and features and customisation
One plus
I understood that reference #1+
I want one!
*Apple has entered the chat*
Just wish all phones had a notification slider like oneplus phones
watching at 21 June  2022 10:32 pm ist 😅
One Plus?
"Marques: ...but until then what i'm allowed to show you now is the back of the phone. 
Also Marques 1 minute later: 'shows the front of the phone'..."
"RIP OnePlus, still Rockin' that OP 7T tho"
we have always-on displays now. so we don't need a notification led.
I just wanted a centered hole punch camera
"I feel like we’ve been here before with the MS Duo.  They wanted the hype,  but wouldn’t let people show the software.  Hope this turns out to have a “different” future than the Msoft Duo."
"Warning headphone users, the ringtones mad loud"
"nothing special, same old story"
anyone going to ask how the use affects the battery life?
Hard pass on anything “Nothing” related.
I don't see how that's revolutionary 🤔
Bootleg dollar store iphone
The Tron Phone
as long as I can access and then lock the bootloader I'm very interested
100% will buy it if the price is right and the software is stable enough
6:32 very familiar
"Looks like they gutted an iphone 12, and made it an Android. Essential Phone part 2 maybe. Looks cool, but will it sell?"
Looks like an Iphone
Some one have to take flag from LG phones diffirent style ideas and grow up. This phone maybe its a start for UNIQUE desings.
Shots fired on One Plus 🔥😂
What a bothing sandwich. Just an iphone X with a dbrand skin
"the hardware looks perfect, i want *nothing* to do with the software design choices... the dot matrix clocks look bad to me. cameras are gonna be the big teetering point now. for me, i would need one of the two cameras to be telephoto, or for them to release a pro/ultra version next year. but i hope whatever cameras are on this year's model are at least decent."
Man this phone is cool 🔥🔥🔥
"If he is not allowed to review it before it comes out, then that is not a good sign..."
Love that OnePlus shoutout at 6:08. Although they probably don't.
"Carl Pei: Apple is boring. Let me show the real innovation.
Carl Pei now:


Guess I'll just die"
I think this new LED thing will kill the battery a lot quicker
Super excited for this phone
"As someone who loves being different and having the latest tech, I love this concept
All I need from it is a good clean pixel ish UX, good haptics and a decent camera and I'm sold."
Me too bro
first time since the S10 i have been exited for a new phone. Definitely thinking about buying this!
One plus reference at the end.. damn 🔥
Amazing concept in this dull world of glass slab phones......Just add a RGB functionality to the lights and take my money
Can't wait to get on hands
Note: he's not tell us about specifications!🙂
"There's something to be said for being able to customize to capture specific segments of the userbase to cater to those needs with different aesthetics at scale, but keep it individualized in a lot of ways. I think the future will be more specialization into diverging designs. Everyone is sick of the same old thing."
Who else thought those lights at back are Marcus's edits??😂
Damn 1+ just got the most passive aggressive burn ouch
I thought this was a case for an iPhone. Really pretty actually!
Finally moving into cyberpunk territory
"Dang, really wishing I wasn't full on in the apple ecosystem right now... That phone looks amazing. Always thought I'd get a google pone if I switched. This is the phone I'd get!"
They just need to have different colors than iphones
"I actually, Realllly like it! Having a father who thinks supporting apple will cause humans to go extinct. This is now on my radar for the next phone to get him."
Feels like what OnePlus used to be. My hopes are high for the future of this company.
@PM find the TechAltar 'Story Behind' video on OnePlus and enthusiast brands. The flagship killer business model is an effective but unsustainable way to build market share - once the brand is recognised you can sell the same stuff everyone else does.
"@PM Carl Pei founder of Nothing was also co-founder of OnePlus, in the early days OnePlus used to have devices with flagship hardware, good price, and the best android skin: oxygen os

tech enthusiasts tended to think OnePlus as the best android in the market, and their design was different than apple and samsung until the OnePlus 5, people even used to compare the speed and responsiveness of oxygen os with Apple's ios, it was really good

Carl Pei left OnePlus in 2020 some time after the release of OnePlus 8t, at that time OnePlus wasn't what it used to be anymore, they started to target more mainstream consumers, their devices design have become uninspired, users started to complain about more and more bugs in the software and the price was matching other flagships but the final product wasn't delivering equal experience

after Carl Pei left OnePlus announced the merge with Oppo (this may be a huge coincidence, or maybe not) and oxygen os become based in Oppo's color os, which garnered a lot of criticism from users and longtime fans, that's the story the main reason i believe many have lost faith in OnePlus is because the price is high and the final product doesn't deliver anything different or better than the competition

and now Carl Pei and Nothing revived once again that feeling of OnePlus early days, he was the ""face"" of OnePlus in the Ocident so people tended to believe that many of the old OnePlus ideals was also his own ideals"
"@PM OnePlus was a good brand at first. They were selling top tier phones at a reasonable (for the competition) price. Their UI was also very fast, optimized and good. Then they started to share more things with their headbrand Oppo. Now even their UI is a ColorOS (Oppo's UI) skin. They were releasing 2 models a year, last year they released almost 10 models."
@PM OnePlus started out as an enthusiastic brand that came out with phones that were different and cheaper while still delivering almost flagship-level power. Alas! They degraded over time and lost their uniqueness by creating generic phones that were no different from the competition.
Can someone please explain what he meant about OnePlus? I have never owned a OnePlus phone nor do I know much about their models. Thanks!
ill stick with my iphone
"OnePlus Shots felt personal!!. But, Whatever! Hey OnePlus, you SUCK lately."
This is cool. 😎
It looks ammmmazing
So you basically told us nothing about nothing 🤷🏼
"Didnt even have the latest snapdragon chip. NOTHING's gonna fill the void that old, OnePlus left, not even Xiaomi. (I know NOTHING's trying to be unique) but I miss the old OnePlus. The REAL flagship killer, with the latest SD chip, and oxygen os that feels snappy and quick, pair that with a reasonable price and there u go, a niche waiting to be filled. So simple yet so hard to do."
"For me, it all depends on how must they customize Android OS. If it has vanilla Android with some additional hardware features, that's great. If they fully customize Android (like Samsung) , I'm out."
When everyone started to buy the phone for LED lights ?
Why the phone company can't chage the border line (bezel ) color of their phones ?
But it's still an Android phone.
"It could be like anything with an RGB lighting. could be great initially, but for day to day use it may not be impressive. People might want to turn this off in most situation. It's cool. And does it come with a charger in the box?"
"It will be like this for 90% of users: Buys phone, looks at back 1 time, then puts a case on and never sees the back of the phone or mind it. 
Because of this i hope they get the software"
"You know, there is another way to look at your phone and know who's calling. By looking at the screen."
did you just diss OnePlus??
The missed the operation out to make a digital/analog clock on the back. But I think they can still do it by having the hour around the cameras and the minute in the center.
"@3:37: “.. ringtones..”
me: 🙄🥱😴
@3:47: *super cool ringtone noises*
me: 😳 “I... love ringtones again? I love ringtones again!”"
Do people really leave their phones with the screen down? I would never even see these lights.
One plus 😅
Thank you! Your the best man
This is a marketing company disguised as a tech company
Price??? $399????
Bit confusing people purchase expensive phone and buy back cover for phone protection nothing phone has back led light what's the use of it people ignore front notification light on mobile phones
very creative design to say the least
"Just a gimmick, kinda hate it. Thanks for the coverage, though"
WOW! Amazing!!! 😍
Trolling oneplus like beast !!
"It's not even RGB though, what If I want blue for a text and green for a whatsapp, red for reddit CMON BRUH EZ Design but not so forward thinking design team it seems."
Lights with ringtone was nokia basic phone feature.
this should be a panel for a universal phone case with bluetooth. A cheap TPU bumper could house it and allow for many devices to fit it.
I love the design and detail. Can you tell me what the price of this beauty in India 🇮🇳
Hope The transparent back is scratch proof...
"Oneplus One was such a great idea. At the time there was nothing like it, flagship specs for budget price, a mostly clean android interface, sandstone back. It really created a cult following back then."
"Real legendary you and Carl pie 
Thanks for first video of the nothing phone. 🇦🇨😍🤩🥳"
Nice design nothing phone!!
The NoBattery phone
"Ok, someone make a LED phone case to attach to any phone (USB/Bluetooth/whatever).. we need those back LEDs 😁🤓"
love it💵
Those ringtones are really bad ngl
There's Nothing to see here.
Why no one is talking about the uniformed bezel width 🙄
The one+ shade is real
First I thought it’s a new case on iPhone 12 lol
"With no Apple in the video, it's excellent."
Dope🤯🤯🤯
Love the 1+ shade towards the end of the video :v
"Carl pei's strategy is changed,nothing phone is not flagship killer is i phone killer....."
"""Sounds familiar?"" lmaooooo"
*This is truly a concept coming true*
"Really loved their design!
But where is the alert slider?"
I sincerely hope this led stuff isn't the biggest talking point for their marketing...cuz I genuinely don't care and most definitely won't have a use for it.
Sorry explain how this is unique looking? Looks like an iPhone with a funky case. I literally thought this was an iphone review
"Looks cool, but who the fuck places their phone with screen down???"
Damn excited for nothing phone1 to release in India🔥💖✨
"This phone looks really interesting, shame if I owned it I would probably get made fun of for not having an apple phone."
Is it coming to Europe?
You said your only allowed to show the back and you showed the screen also.... 2:25
I really love this phone damn
"So an iPhone with gimmicky lights, without the ecosystem that makes the iPhone viable. I’ll pass."
"Yeah, this looks very iPhone to me. No hate on that but I think I'll wait for Pixel 7."
Law of marginal utility explained at the end of the video
Amazed
Can't wait to see nothing 5T
"Anywhoo, I'm gonna put a case on my phone!"
Looks like something Apple could buy and shutdown before it competes with their iPhones. Looks dope
Really cool design! I hate that everything is turning into just a black screen. Refreshing to see minimalistic hardware ui
I really liked the part where he talked about the specs
Soo dope 😍😎
"Those light at back , remind me of old Nokia  phones"
"I was smiling like a child when I saw how that bottom led worked while charging, And that shake to see the progress is just XD"
Don't you get tired? They all the same
Now nothing become something 🔥
I am Seriously waiting for its launch ! But on the other side worried about it's Price Tag 🔖. Hope I get this Nothing and Make me feel like Something!
"Someone: Which phone do you have?
Me: I have Nothing
Someone: :')
Me: :')"
"they are great...



 on spending their marketing budget"
If only all of the greatest features were pulled from all these different phones and were put into one..... **** Coughs in Tesla ****
@6:30 one plus is that you?
"I wish the led could have different colors for different notifications. light blue for Twitter, red for YouTube, pink for Instagram, green for phone, etc"
Nice feature but what about battery usage?
This is something
Remind me of Nokia light up Kyepad while Ringing..😁
I like the design
Very cool thing
Oh my days. No. No. I have had enough. At first the impression videos let the reviews to show everything about the phone except software. Now you're not even allowed to show the front 😭
This would actually make me think about switching from iPhone for the first time
6:32 sounds familiar? ONEPLUS
This is the phone for people with hearing a disability
I think this is one of the LEAST USEFUL video you have made recently . HATE this stratergy of NOTHING .
With this type of phone back definitely yes and front also looks super good without any chin
Hopefully Supcase will put out a case for it.
20syl's music as the intro again yes:)
So you’re telling me that this phone was 100% made by nothing.  Nothing has made this phone.  Nothing has completed studies to show how to make a phone stand out.  Nothing has a phone that’s different from others.  Like actually nothing.  Correct?
"1.600€ 
Yes..."
1:48 - i have samsung galaxy j7 max pretty much the same thing :P
"Mere pass bhi hai , camera ke 4 taraf reheta hai"
No it doesn’t sound familiar. Someone fill me in
"Love those lights and ringing effects, literally so cool"
"you didn't seem very enthusiastic tbh, I'd say rather doubtful."
So this this the Star Wars phone in a nutshell...I love it!!
Nothing has done price cutting over two things 1) by providing 44w fast charging feature 2) 90 hz refresh rate. So this shouldn't cost more than 30k INR (base model). At this price 120 hz refresh rate is an obvious feature available and 67w of fast charging as well. Well I understand only these two features don't decide the fate of any phone. We have to see how will they compensate this with the offering of some other feature. so lets see what else nothing has to offer. Well the design has just sustained the hype so far though. And not to mention that has already impressed me and the rest of us a lot. I would like to see it giving head to head to Iphone.
Can't lie bro those lights got me
"HEEYYYY 
Weren’t you only supposed to show it’s back"
That’s an iPhone
OOOH I want one!!    If the software looks good during their July event I'll definitely buy one!
Sounds familiar 😂🤣
"This is awesome, something that is clearly missing in the smartphone industry of today - the small creative features that are functional. NAILED IT!"
functional is a bit of a stretch
1+
"That actually is one nice phone 📱

(In looks at least~)"
"Does it come in Black?
It would be awesome to look with white LEDs dancing in Black Background and a Frame with Matte Black finish."
"Sweeeet, now I just need Apple to steal this idea"
Overhyped! Like name says nothing but led lights 😅🤙
I can't wait for Jerry to rig this phone apart to nothing.
What happened to nothing earphones? Dont see anyone talk about them anymore
I’m curious for review about performance and camera and etc.
That design tho🥵
Imagine the cases that can be built for this.
Everything boils down to pricing of the phone.
Does it have different color LEDs or is it just white?
"See, that is  an android phone i would buy :O"
The last few words 💀🔥🔥
So you are telling me this might be the new oneplus one?
I like it alot I would so get it cus it's different and one software thing mkbhd shows that I really like Is The clock on the lock screen
@mkbhd the video showed the front of the phone. You’d mentioned earlier you are allowed to show only the back. 🤔
"Definitely getting it, anything is better than OnePlus currently"
"That's unique but everything depends on what interface they used inside. People get bored using the same interface. Also what eco system they offer... Can they make an stand alone Eco system like apple! If they can... Kudos for them. I'm in.
Best of luck NOTHING 😍
By the way if you look carefully they used apple logo just in a geometric shape. The leaf, the body of apple and also the bite shape 🤣"
"Now apple is sort of like😱...
And the new One plus is like👊"
Nothing had me excited until now.
"2:53
I mean, while it is neat, I don’t see how this is any better than just having the phone be face side up. I tap the screen and see the percentage. I also see all the notifications and more. I guess it’s a cool trick for situations where the phone would need to be face down."
"It's Clear,Nothing Can Make me buy this phone"
OnePlus 🤣🤣🤣 ...mkbhd did them dirty 😂😂😂
"those are the most awful, obnoxious ringtones ever"
deathbirth
Thank you
Shots fired at OnePlus! 🔥😂
I like it
Fan based companies will disappoint at some point. Like One Plus did. Beside that why buy a phone who looks like an iPhone when i can buy the real one.
But my question who's gonna keep the phone upside-down???
"In my opinion, the front camera should be in the center and the back of the phone need to be more mature. It was target for under 30?"
Waiting for the camera....if that will put competition to Apple.....then no doubt nothing will be successfull
"one plus is dumb as f, their ceo left and made nothing"
"I know it looks a lot like an iPhone but I really love the design, the LED's are amazing."
Too gimmicky.  I personally never put my phone down face down.  So the lights have no purpose for me.  Plus at night it will be a nightmare.
"Here is a cool idea... Make a black Nothing phone, with the same notification lights inside, but the glass panel on top of be made same like that of McLaren edition OnePlus, hides even the cameras when not in use, but once turned on, everything ... should be dope 🤩😁... Nothing impossible right 😜"
"Let's be real, LEDs in the back of phones have been around since the Nokia days when every other kiosk in the mall sold batteries covered in LEDs. They're just bringing it into the 21st century lol"
"As someone who has to put a case on a phone or it will die, they need more going on. I don’t know if I really want a clear case either. 

Looking forward to hearing more but I’m very ingrained in my ecosystem now."
I'd buy the phone based on the ringtones and lights themselves.
Apple has nothing to worry about.
I will need to do a 3 month course to use this phone
"Dam, Mkbhd sounded like he's getting over a bad break up with oneplus here 6:08"
I love it.
Dbrands left the chat
those lights would be good if you wanna stream yourself with a phone
Finally some innovative design. I’m definitely interested
"Liked the OnePlus analogy at the end! 
Definitely sounded familiar"
"Back lights are a waist of energy in my opinion, change my mind."
What it needs is spiderman using this phone as an advertisement
Back in the days many nokia and sony walkman phones had the same light whch would pulse according to ringtone or music...
Oooo the OnePlus shade
Put a case on it then that's literally an iPhone 12 in the android version. Those who want an iPhone-looking device with android software May go for it..
What is the purpose of these LED's... ?  Will it work as room Lamp..?
"Meh, seems like a cheap gimmik to get consumers attention."
You need a noise gate or a quieter studio. The ringing lights patterns section showed this.
Wow...
Pretty neat. I wonder how it would be with RGB lights
"I have a feeling it'll be the ""iPhone"" of Android."
"lol stupid ass  lights, this shit gonna flop hard"
that is literally an iphone 12 and everyone will think it is an iphone 12
"Looks really dope, my only concern is that it looks like another big phone...
I. Want. My. Compact. Phones."
The led pattern is pretty nice 👍
is the smartphone with morse code! kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I want to say Nothing 📌
Completely mediocre. All hype for... Nothing.
I actually dig the simple minimalist and cool design
Not so 🆒
Perfect Design. It'll definitely appeal to the masses.
No thanks... this looks horrible.
Isn't that background rubiks cube a proper speed cube? Who is the cuber in the studio?
Wow this phone is packed with a bunch of bullshit features. Nothing new
"Nothing builds hype up like last time with the clone airpods pro and only lets you talk about the design and not even the feel... smh same strategy 🤷‍♂️
Edit: what kind of early look or review only talks about the back of a phone?? Well, yeah the back is interesting but a whole video just to talk about that?"
"This looks more like a toy than a phone. 
Well, now the kids will say, I want nothing on my birthday, xd"
iPhone with new brand nothing ! 🤡
"Every tech-Tuber thumbnail: Photoshops themselves ""holding"" the Phone 1. 
Marques: I got the real thing"
06:32 a very subtle blow to Oneplus 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This phone is genuinely intresting
It's really interesting to see how just by showing this design alone many people are willing to purchase the device pre release.
Very boring 😴
"sounds familiar?
oneplus: hmmmmm...."
one plus got targeted at the end though😂
"This phone sparks the same light I had when I was closely watching OnePlus One being released. I bought it asap and I wasn't dissapointed. For that price it was a bargain. After that I bought OnePlus 5 which I have to this day. In my opionion OP5 was the last good phone from OnePlus.. I really love the fast af fingerprint and the OS is still as fast as when I bought it. I would only like to have a better camera and better battery. That's all I want. 
If Nothing can achieve this, they can count with me as a happy customer :)"
@Flaw1k Deadshot It had fingerprint on the back if I recall correctly? I preffer to have it on the front.
No
7pro is the last good oneplus one
5t was the better one tbh
"Well... Idk, light on the back seem like gimmick and waste of battery. And reverse wireless charging even more so. I mean phone is the thing you want to keep charged, it doesn't matter if your earphones or something dies. And phone battery isn't that much anyways."
The answer you are looking for is No. It wont work. In my opinion
"""Nothing"" looks like this 😏"
This looks dope 👍
"i absolutely love that design, and those LEDs but i just simply dont like Android. so as much as i want to support this design and new stuff in the industry, android day-to-day is just not as good for me compared to iOS"
"Imagine liking that buggy dumpster fire that is iOS. If you don't like something in Android, you can usually change it. You can't do that with iOS."
That final line I need an explanation for that .
"Not impressed at all. A transparent back with an internal enclosure covering all components and 900 LEDs means probably an extra $50-$100 in manufacturing cost before they even announce the specs. The rest of the phone looks like a generic iPhone clone from Wish. What is the point of wasting all that money on the back of the phone (which nobody with a case or skin is ever going to pay attention to anyway) if the front of it is going to look and perform like a $300 Xiaomi? Nobody has cared about LEDs on phones since the flip phone era of the mid-2000s (I had an old Siemens flip phone with a much better implementation of notification LEDs than this useless thing).

If this is all they have that's ""unique"", this phone/company is going to fail a thousand times harder than Essential ever did."
"The phone is beyond cool, but for 1,700$ it’s just not affordable to the common person… if it was 1,000 that would be a different story"
"was planning to buy an  iphone but after seeing this,it changed my mind"
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men I like it 👍🔥🍎
5:56 when he roasts 1+🤣
"If you have added LED, why no to add colorful LEDs?? that would be breath taking!!"
"""Looks Like Nothing to Me!"" lol"
Realme x Naruto Look Stunning!
"I support anything that tries to kill Apple.
Might buy it just for LEDs and put rotten apple sticker on back"
It looks like Star Wars death Star outer hull to me
I'm thinking does it have a IP rating??
"Man that LED back syncronizing with ringtone reminded me of a phone my dad used to own, Nokia 3220. If you've never seen that look it up, it's really cool!"
"I hope they have put a Macro camera, because that back LED will be extremely useful for that."
Screen size?
"6:30 I remember a company that tried to be 10+, when all the fans wanted was a 1+."
Mark my words. We're gonna get the exact same lighting effects for Amoled screens as an app really soon. 🤭
Naked iphone
ya i get it it’s pretty sick but we want the specs bro specs!!!
"But, does it have the headphone jack!??"
"""Sound familiar?"" Yeah, sounds like what OnePlus turned into."
"To many people are on apples and Samsungs nutz. 
We live in a generation where everyone follows the trend like losers lol"
"This is some of the most beautiful looking phone ever, i really dig the futuristic look."
"For the 1st week it's face down on the bench, afterwards its usual face up for everyone. For peoples with wireless charger its face up from day one. 😂"
Interesting concept. But who ever leaves their phone face down? 🤔
I am actually going to get this phone over a galaxy fold 4 and hope for a nothing fold in a few years. I'm already wondering what the phone 2 will look like.
Maybe children will like it?
That naruto phone looks dope 🔥
Wow 🤩
Frosted cyberpunk cellular device
This is horrible and useless.
"I hope they'll have a matte version of it, i wouldn't like to take a glossy phone without a case with me"
Nope! This another Android phone that will try to copy iphones looks. Still Nothing compared to iphone!
Screams one plus through and through 😂
Let's hope they learned from their original fanbase...
"sounds familiar, yeah🙃"
One plus: No comment.
Its just a gimmick lets be honest no one will care about these features after a week of usage.
MKBHD or MKBSD
All I can say is stay away from people who put their phone face down.
Is it android or other os
"if i wasn't unhealthily entrenched in the apple ecosystem, this would be my phone no question. would love to see apple absorb them and integrate Ilya + others into the design team"
i'm all for making phones interesting again. did not imagine the future of phones would amount to boring shiny slaps tiles looking devices.  gosh i miss nokia
Looks like an iPhone 12
"crossing fingers this will become a new trend.
So tired of the dumb camera bump trend"
"Quick question,
At 2:27 doesn't he show the front of the phone?"
This is definitely a paid promotion from nothing
Apple has Nothing to Worry about !
Be interesting to see how this company develops overtime. I like this feature
"Dave Lee is the same, my top 2 for sure"
That’s called a gimmick
"Ending Sounded like Carl Pei Ditching 1+1 , to 1+2 and 1+3 after wards versions they launched were all too broadly appealing & came at much higher prices than market to actually appeal the audience"
Impressive ✨
What’s the name of the battery bank in the background?
Was that a jab at OnePlus at the end of the video?
"Yes, oneplus sounds very familiar"
I’m digging the design so much
oneplus 2.0 :0
"you’d think they’d go for subtlety but this really stands out. not sure if that’s what i want in a phone, but it does look cool. had a coworker with a phone that lit up when she got texts and it was very annoying and distracting in the office"
Looks cool but as always repairability and durabilty is a concern
"I actually want to buy one, not gonna lie ..."
"MKBHD: what i am allowed to show you, is the back of the phone
Also MKBHD: ""shows the front inside the first 20 seconds"
The phone looks dope. Looks like someone took an iphone 12 and modified the living shit out of it.
"Ever since 2020, the mobile phone market has stagnated with the perfect things that make all the phones literally the same.
The Nothing Phone is the one thing that took the perfection of the others and improvised on the design we have all been tired seeing.
Next we need a phone that's not just a rectangle, but something that's more than a boring rounded reactangle."
"As cool as those leds are, the white color version atleast put me off, looks too plane. I hope there are different colors which will allow the back panel to have more details."
Finally time to break my Oneplus with a hammer.
mera kaalu oye mera kaalu
It's an amazing tech i ever seen ☺️ it's really good i think this is a one step forward to our future
"If they really want to sell their device, make the necessary deals so that all the carriers support it! An example is OnePlus. Their devices are 5G capable with T-Mobile and Verizon but no love for AT&T. That's leaving money on the table by purposely neglecting AT&T customers."
"Just imagine those led light in black color body, DOpe!"
LTT mouspad!!
"6:22
Sounds familiar?
Nah.... It's just the company he left behind"
Hope Nothing doesn’t end up like OnePlus
you don't want your phone facing down and wiggling it to show the battery charging status and scratching the front..
Recording red indicator and ringtones are not good
I have a feeling this phone will be overpriced as a first production phone.
"I'm assuming the sides are aluminium, but I'd love to see an iteration with polished steel sides."
YES HOLY I didnt even think of that that'd look so cool.
OnePlus when it launched hit a different spot. It wasn't a gimmicky phone but very aggressively priced phone for a base who were looking for top notch Android features on a high end smart phone. Nothing phone 1 is nothing like OnePlus One.
can't agree more
"Launch stock android with this phone.
That will be enough for me."
It would look awesome in Black !!!!!
I was really skeptical of how Nothing could differentiate themselves from other Android brands but honestly that's actually fucking dope. I might consider it. It's Apple-like design with nerdy Android-like quirks that I love.
Does it come in black?
nice try Apple
Whether its trying to build ecosystem or looks like star wars phone. But we all have to agree its something fresh.
"If I was an Android user I would be interested, maybe, but no Android phone so far has come close to getting me to consider ditching my iPhone. It's surprising how un-tempted I've been over the years really. So it's not really a breakthrough from my point of view even though I like it and of course it was always going to take more than a few flashing LEDs to be a breakthrough."
Those ringtones... Ouch
The most important thing is cost of this phone. Around 600$ should be nice tho
The title should've been '' The Nothing Phone Has Something About It''
iPhone Nothing
"They are inventing more absurd phones instead of releasing practical phone with such features as: 1. non-breakable screen (like my Motorola Z2 Force plastic screen), 2. big battery, which can be replaced easily. 3. waterproof 4. drop-proof 5. high-end procesor along with plenty of memory. 6. dual-sim along with microSD slot. I cannot see such flagship phone on the market. Phones made from glass are a joke."
"Shout out to all of the One Plus owners that felt that ending.

I'm certainly interested in this new phone because it is different. Now I just need to know that it is an overall good phone when the reviews start coming out."
"@Toni Ivanov My 8T died suddenly a few weeks back, take care of yours."
"@Toni Ivanov 5T and 6 were definitely its peak, 8T it's still alright but anything after that...... lol"
"Interesting that this happened to One Plus. My 6T has been the Honda Civic of phones still running strong and smooth. Considered going Xperia 1 iv but getting worried with the heating issues... Android selection has been disappointing, I might have to go back to iPhone depending on how much longer the 6T will hold up."
"​@C.D.J that's pretty much what I want to do, but can't really afford it from Brazil..."
"​@BRUCE WAYNE man, the battery... 🥲"
borderline gimmick
3:18 was this shot on a phone? it looks shaky
Cyberpunk vibe.. So dem 😎
"Really like the clear back, but I usually put a case on all my phones! Hopefully, they will have a good clear case."
I will buy this phone
is led back is rgb back\
Pricing will make the difference.
The ringtone feature is dope💯
What about the software?????
dissing oneplus so sweetly.
okay this phone is dopeee AF
can’t wait to get the new iPhone Nothing
"They better be packing in a good transparent case with the phone. Otherwise this ""feature"" will be very useless.
I'll honestly call this a gimmick than a feature. And it isn't a gimmick that'll propel it to great sales."
iPhone с андроід)
мне здаецца будзе дуже цікавы смартфон)
Looks like an iPhone which is good to attract those customers BUT different. Kinda retro but really cool. Love the customization.
This phone is for people who don’t like apple but still wants to buy a iPhone...
That burn intended at one plus 😂😂
Broadly appealing 😂
That Neon White glow on the back has to be one of the sweetest colours I've seen
The way this youtuber indicating about oneplus during video is awesome… raise and fall of oneplus (losing fan base)
i thought it was an iphone 11 cover.
"Of course this design looks really fresh, but I doubt it's gonna be anyone's MAIN reason to switch, that would be a little silly.
Personally, my main reason to switch to this phone (if I do) would be the OS they're gonna use. I'm excited to find out more after the launch to make my decision. I've been using the Nothing Ear(1) for some time now, and I'm really happy with it. Quite a surprising quality product coming from such a new company."
Nice phone! Some say that it might cost less than an iphone SE 2022. What do you think?
"Damn, who would have thought that a bunch of LEDs could make a difference in definitely over-saturated phone market.. Don't own the smartphone, though, but this certainly looks legit :)"
Really like the squared design like on the iPhones
SICKKK!
This is 🔥. Wish it was the pixel
Pointless if I have a phone case
Nothing
🔥🔥🔥
6:17 I already saw where that shade was going. 😅
"It's  very sweet looking smartphone 
  Specially with white  colour"
Looks like an Off White iPhone
Thats a cyber phone
This phone is worth Nothing
Just looks like an iPhone with a thin case.
The ringtone syncing with the LEDs is enough for me to buy it 😅
It looks like an iPhone that has an LED back and the front facing camera in a slightly different place 😂
Regret buying iPhone 13 haha
DAMN that taunt at the end. xD ........ ONEPLUS be crying...
If stormtroopers used phones it would look like this😃
Retro Robot
"Man this has to be the ultimate gimmick phone if there ever was one. Sure, those lights are cool especially the ringtone lightshow but if I am going to lay my phone on any surface, it's going to be display side up to glance on the time/date/notifications and weather like I do on my Pixel 6, those lights lighting up in a particular way to indicate an email versus a text versus any other notification serves me no meaningful function and if this phone does have an AoD, it also renders that useless if the main attraction of this device is that transparent back and subsequent LED's."
looks like a scam.
That dig on OnePlus towards the end!
"coolest phone ive seen in a FAT minute, havent wanted a phone this bad since probably the pixel 1"
"That dig at the end on 1+, crazy"
"Dear Carl... Include at least 4 clear case ( as they become yellow in about 6 months time ) , with proper camera and display lips , with laser cut for the lights. 
Yep , you can add a couple of bucks to the MRP. But make this uniqueness,usefull."
i bet that the iPhone case manufacturers will make a case with this phones features
"This is everything i want in terms of small details, it just doesn’t have iOS haha. 99% of my friends have iPhones, and android phones just don’t work well with iPhone. So I would never switch sadly"
Yeah. Apple is probably going to sue them for design.
Looks a lot like an iPhone 12 to me
"The ""sounds familiar?"" part is a BURN to one plus hahaha"
тут не хватает толко IOS
It looks good from both front and back
Marques was referring to OnePlus at the end
"galaxy display shape and iphone clear backglass edition😉

However.... very good"
Love Nothing. Care about Nothing. Nothing is above Apple
"This is really beautiful 😍, looking amazing"
"I really appreciate how chill you are. So many YouTubers talk so fast and are practically yelling at the camera. It is so grating. But you're just enjoyable to watch. So well spoken, down to earth and without ego."
he’s passionate and pauses when needed which makes it comfortable
Yeah exactly.
It's looks exactly like an iPhone. Even the wireless charger led and diagonal led on the top right make the shape of the Apple logo
Very little info and the info being about a gimmicky feature...
Nothing and TE really just alienated me with their pricing and marketing a long time ago.
Dope dope dope dope dope dope dope dope dope dope dope dope dope dope!!!!!❤️
The Nothing Seizure Phone looks great! /s
sound familiar? yes it does ONEPLUS
Weird you don't discuss reliability. Form over function.
"It’s meh from me. But I’m not against the idea though, seems cool"
Is the Tesla phone real? Have you tested it?
It's not. Just another one of elon's marketing gimmicks.
"This is so sick 



















please be a good phone please be a good phone please be a good phone please be a good phone please be a good phone please be a good phone please be a good phone please be a good phone please be a good phone"
"iPhone 12 in steroids.. i guess so,"
the diffusing lights will actually help in close up shots alot! gotta look how the camera performs!
Needs more RGB
Inspired by starwars r2d2 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤨
In the end...1+ is dead...nice way to mention 😁
"Finally a new start up that copied ""Nothing"" from Apple..."
"Hope other companies bring this kind of LED like in the old days. I still remember, Sony Ericsson with dot LED in back for Next/Prev touch button. Yeah, it's gimmicks, but why not for this boring phone design era.

And once again, Nokia, please bring back Lumia design."
I thought this was a joke now i want one
People who get seizures definitely shouldn’t use the light ringtone feature
6:25 ofcourse sounds familiar... the one and only ONEPLUS!!!
"I'm only interested in seeing the camera test :) For the time being, the rest is OK..."
Nah sorry. They are doing what gaming companies do to sell their stuff. Throw LEDs in it and it's better. 90% of the time you got the phone in your pocket or hand and you won't see anything from that LEDs. Otherwise looks like an iPhone tbh.
"Reminds me of Nokia 3220, for that notification lights!"
This is dope.
"This smells like a cash-grab. Over at my country, they only offer us a bidding process to ""buy"" this phone. Utter nonsense."
iPhone pro Max lite 🙄☠️
I like the flat flush iPhone design. Hopefully it feels sturdy like one and has the haptics to back it up or go beyond.
The last line literally told the rise and doom of OnePlus..
Yeah its a iphone 11/12 clone in the back. Original design my ass. Lol
Those LED lights look like edited in the video 😳
"Frame from iphone
Screen from samsung
Back from iphone

And there you go Chinese shameless knock off"
but you have showed the front to🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Nah people will just buy Samsung and Apple anyways. 
Nothing will follow the footsteps of Nextbit, Essential, Razer phone, and Red Hydrogen."
Oh cool one plus no um im mean nothing .. :/
gotta love that 1+ jab 😅
I just think will white be the only color they offer many people who prefer a black phone won’t buy this I think
It looks exactly like an iPhone besides the back alright… no need to dance around it. It just is.
What's the size of the phone?
Why are all the notification lights on the back? Unless I'm somewhere where I don't want interruption I'm gonna have my phone face up so I can quickly read the actual text of a notification or the caller's name when they call me.
"Actually I am looking forward for this phone now, just whish they make a black one"
that last couple of statements !!
OnePlus strategy. I hope Nothing does not go completely in the same direction
this is what the iPhone should look like
The way you just dissed OnePlus indirectly 💯✨✨✨....true though 😅
"Yes it has cool lights, but you know what it doesn't have?



*A headphone jack.*"
"hey whats different: nuthing, whats similar: nuthing different.....no audio jack...."
Did anyone notice the slight dig at One plus by mkbhd. Seemingly because it’s the same company lol. Nice one there.
And they call it nothing 😐
Strong OnePlus vibes on this one
"Literally felt goosebumps when you ended it with ""sound familiar""
RIP the OG OnePlus"
Can someone please explain what he meant about OnePlus? I have never owned a OnePlus phone nor do I know much about their models. Thanks!
yup good times
"@Justin Wood peak was oneplus 7 pro man dont do oneplus that bad , i have 9 pro rn it aint that bad but not as good as 7"
"This reminded me so much of the Oneplus X, which was peak Oneplus IMO"
Another one plus
"They could give the back of a watch or what percentage of the battery was ছারগেদ😑😑😑

￼"
"Mkbhd: sounds familiar?
OnePlus: Nani!"
I'll wait for the one with RGB
"Wow, it looks awesome ❤️"
"oh my god, so much shade on OnePlus there"
"""Abandoning their fan base..."" Is that for One plus?"
I am switching from iPhone to this one here..
I like it a lot. But it’s android so … meh.
The ringtones lights are really cool tho!..
"Not now but i think i have to buy a nothing phone in future because i think ""nothing"" is going to kick Apple out of luxury/iconic phones battle!"
Keep it coming with the interesting phones!
It literally just looks like an iPhone with a pretty lame case. Also let’s all put our phone screen down on the table and scratch the screen just for a useless notification light?
how to say oneplus without saying oneplus
It’s just a clear iPhone 11
The climax made my day 😂
Let's witness another cool company that launches great products for the masses at very affordable prices get greedy and pushing their future devices at prices competing with Samsung or Apple...
"That LEDs will nicely look with half transparent matte skin on it. And more will depend of course of price and availability of non transparent options from the box, camera and overall quality. 
I think that if ROM will be simplified like Google`s one with some extra usable features like in OnePlus idea - that may work for fans of OnePlus, especially now, when OnePlus become same ROM as Vivo and Oppo and many fans are not happy at all from this changes. Even I declined my look to OnePlus for now and looking over Samsung models, as latest OnePlus ROM don`t make my friends with their phones happy with that changes and some bugs."
Gift me that phone please!!!..
"6:30
""Abandoned the original fan base ""
""Sounds familiar""


(OnePlus)😂 
Marques Brownlee - legend 😀"
A video about appearance. L
"Me trying to record my gf’s feet but the phone starts flashing:

👁👄👁"
I would buy this now
Oneplus got scared so much that they coming back to the roots .... They are releasing a flagship killer with better specs ( snapdragon 8+ gen 1 )  than the 10 pro for a much lower price ... They scared 😂😂
nothing will surely take 5% customers of apple but also 90% oneplus customers💁💁💁
Google someone is trying to buy me over.. and it's for nothing
That's a cool design...
If the iPhone 18 has an led backlight just remember this comment
When phone manufacturers are sitting on stockpiles of phones they can't sell then this will be no different...all marketing and no substance...it an android phone with known hardware and the software will be no different..
Another one plus 😏😏😏
"That last line 
Was so dope 
They literally abandoned the fan base 
I was one of them 
I don't recommend OnePlus to anyone these days
It's just a rebranding of Oppo 
Sad that it ended up like that
Let's see what Nothing has to bring to the table 
Which is really occupied"
"Case+silent mode = every other phone out there
also how come it seemed like at every turn Marques wanted to say"
"So, basically they use apple famous classic transparent plastic design as the basic design concept. 
It's looks cool and feels nostalgic. But....I wonder how long this novelty can hold up."
"I like it, now thats an android i like and want to own one

The question is, is the os really going to be like what they advertised? Smooth?"
"But what are the specs? Looks is one thing, but what do I need a phone that may not be usable?"
I like how it looks like a cassette
My fears came true. It still has a punch hole camera. 😩
This phone looks like a flat astronaut’s helmet and I am all here for it
"This was a ""Nothing"" review
And
I'm interested in Nothing."
Who will alwasy put phone on reverse to see the lights... we always puts mobile display side on top
❤️✨✨💯
❤️✨✨💯
It literally looks like an iPhone 12 😂 why y’all be scared to say that
Its like they are trying to see an iphone with android operating system.
"I wonder why they decided on the ""nothing"" name? It's so stupid. Isn't ""something"" better than nothing? ""Anything""? ""Everything""? Or just ""The Thing"". They're literally calling themselves the lowest and most non existent thing something could be. So why get excited about something that's nothing?"
"Just wondering, what if the back of the phone was all black (not dark grey but black) except the leds... That would look really cool ngl and would also make the leds more visible and feel brighter than they are"
"if anyone tell me RGB phone is coming,I won't be any surprised.Nothing phone(1) maybe have some issues,just like their ear(1) which I used to have a pair,but I still look forward phone(1),nowadays mobile phone market is homogenization,all company is trying to show customers how creative they are and how amazing their product is,but we know only a few of them can make it out."
How amazing you did an almost 7 min video just talking about THE BACK of a phone and it's not even boring.
I would rather buy this than the next slab of glass
So can pay money and buy Nothing 😁
Can I purchase it before the review???☺️
It also depends on the price (which I'm sure you'll tell on the next video).
"If I’m Apple Chairman, I’m swallowing this company. ASAP. WAR ROOM. or I’m going after their whole RD, Design team."
"Now the only things I wanna know are 
Processor
Camera capabilities
Battery capacity 
That's it ... If they kill it in that region I am buying it tbh..."
Yes obviously he is using it for 1 month already
"""unique looking phone""

*literally looks the same as every other iPhone ripoff*

Uh huh, next you're gonna tell me we will go to Mars by 2024."
I like it already !
Only one color of light?
"I like it. 

Might get one and use it along my ios device. Always have 1 android and 1 ios. And this one will be my android fr"
mkbhd breaking the internet 😁
"Dear enthusiasts,
Don't attach yourself with brand.

Love,
From Jay"
Smartphone companies have nothing to worry about
If by different you mean they took an iPhone and slapped a skin on the back then yes. It's different.
After a long period if time we saw a perfect
I am willing to buy it just for the back only. It's Dope AF!
"Love the innovative new takes, but at the end of the day it is just a gimmick that doesn't really add much to the experience"
"Any gimmick that can be put into an add-on (like a case), is just not worth it imo."
What about the software part etc user interface bugs...
"Its basically a transparent iphone 12.

Edit: ok Marques predicted I was going to say exactly that."
they better put a durable screen on the front cause im gonna put it upside down all the time !!!!
"As a loyal OnePlus fan, that story about abandoning a fan base sounds very familiar. I'm still on the 7 pro for no other reason than the uninterrupted screen. Pop up front cameras have gone the way of the dodo, so if I'm going to upgrade, I'm going to look for phones like Nothing."
I want it omg
Watching the video 2nd time coz' I can't stop admiring this beaty.😍
Love the dig at OnePlus
excellent idea implementation 👍🏻 on the back
Just wait for the NOTHING PHONE (1) BLACK EDITION!! 🥵
That OnePlus jab at the end LMAO
RIP oneplus xD (and I say that as a former fan and customer..)
I am closing this video after hearing that you're only showing a back of a phone.
"@Piyush Khushlani He LEGALLY can't, the company will sue him otherwise, companies don't allow youtubers or influencers to show certain parts of the phone before release, this is called embargo."
@Nothing why to create so much hype!
"He legally can't show the OS, not his problem."
If the LEDs were multi-colored 😮‍💨🤌🏾
Wanna see a black variant of this!
ফোনটা তো বেশ চমত্কার!
This looks sick!
1+     you liars..
The design is quite refreshing only if you put a transparent case as well for protection. Otherwise it will look like any other phone in today's market.
"*6:23* very familiar, eemm-hmm _oneplus_ uuuhh-hmmm"
I love the dig at one plus at the end
That notification indicator/flash amazing :o
iphone💁💁💁💁
7 mins of just the back of the phone... Smh 🤦‍♂
Left punch hole... what a dissapointment (
That's a whole shitload of nothing.....
If the price is good I will buy it
Myphone wigle wigle ~
This looks so freaking cool 🤤😱😱😱😱
Sold. I want one. It’s like retro 80s anime tech.
Trolling OnePlus 🤣
It's weird to get only a 6 minutes video from you...
The phone looks like it's out of cyber punk ... which is dope .. wish it had colour changing led instead  of only white !!!
People actually keep their phones on the table with display down?? Why??
"Honestly, if i had to buy a phone this time, i would seriously consider nothing phone. If the specs and software is as dope as the phone design itself, then i might actually upgrade my OnePlus 7.
Edit: just to mention Ajay own nothing ear 1, so the ecosystem integration will be interesting to see"
"Hey Apple-
That's called innovation you heard me?😏"
Imma give this company 2 years and I'm gonna start buying their shit when they have worked out the kinks
"plz plz plz, make a review video soon on this revolutionary phone where every important part will be discussed as camera, performance, price etc. We will be waiting for this"
I'm pretty sure this phone will force people into using their phone without the back case😌
The iphone you used to compare was 13 pro. Normal iphone 12 looks exactly like this phone.
Hey MKBHD It got a few good things going for it but I think it just going to be like any other phone
This is way more cooler than any gaming phone.
That nice OnePlus hint in the end got me
Thanks Marquez for this video ... Literally a cool phone and looking forward to see the software of this phone
Side design could have been like slim like s6 edge
"Being a startup new tech company is good and all, but if the software is rubbish, they will fall off the market, look at oneplus, they used to be the flagship device, now they just release the same phone (nord series) with cheap hardware, and numerous software bugs."
Price??
Let me guess let me guess no one is gonna b able to buy 1 cause theres no chips and they only made a handful !!!!
I would definitely buy this as my second phone along with my iPhone :)
Oh the last 20 sec were intense! One of most coolest moments in MKBH history
Sounds terribly familiar. That's why I'm surely leaving my Oneplus to Nothing as soon as this one is out.
so you're saying it's exactly going to end up like one plus?
"I think nothing is leaning heavily into this, dot projection like look. I would have loved to see a dot projection grid on the back of the phone as well for like, weather or notification counter or something. But man, if the ui and the experience is solid, I’m buying."
"Nothing is created, nothing is wasted, everything's transformed!"
In the end… I guess he was talking about Oneplus?!
"Whoa Sherlock, you damn genius! 😳"
Stop making cell phone anymore Carl pei you guys still couldn't do the camera right After 10 iteration of phones means you guys can't do it stop making dumb phone   you one plus and Carl pei
"It surely sounds familiar, just like oneplus.... After some success, they just destroyed their fanbase."
Left sided punch whole camera
Damn I am surely buying this before some Chinese company buys the company
But does it come in transparent matte black...
tfw a verified channel doesn't get any likes
"MKBHD: I can only show you the back of the phone.....
....*few inches later*....
flips phone over and also shows UI"
leds only in white??? where are the colors? like that would be pretty basic...white is beautiful but still
Oneplus out here catching strays. Smh
We are going to see another mediocre product which is overhyped by company
it is chinese
The design is good. I think the unique thing about the phone is the massive led notification that i believe nobody excited for .
that reminds me my nokia 3220 from 2004
"Boooooorrrrrrring, lol. Android needs the battery life. Drop the lights."
"For whatever reason, the phone reminds me of a movie prop from Star Wars."
Looks like the iPhone Apple should have made 7yrs ago.
"Having bought the nothing ear 1 ,this  definitely gonna be overpriced ,,, it'll be cool if they tag it $1111"
Coolest phone this year so far
"The fact that they have restricted us to let us see the front display, proves that there is something fishey going on, maybe the chin is too big or the display is not that impressive. 
We are going to see another mediocre product which was overhyped"
That one plus reference in the end ..
This shirt is awful
"What is the use of this, if u have to see the back of the phone why can't u just turn your phone and see the screen ."
"Really who gives a shit about notification LED when you have AOD on all the phones now? and to be covered with a case also! And even then who says that camera and/or specs are even half good? that happened with nothing ear 1, a piece of shit quality air pod rip off! Strategy is MKBHD sells nothing HARD and then people pre order this then comes garbage software and shitty hardware. this video literally is about LEDs on back of a phone 6 MF minutes! MKB may have a share of this or a profit in this or something..."
"The led thing is for people who do not use case, put their phone upside down and never use always on display feature. And i dont fit that criteria"
"The 1+ jab there tho 😂 It looks sick to be honest, I carry an iPhone nowadays but this phone made me think about it for a second. I would give it a try for sure if I was on the Android ecosystem."
I don't know when I was this excited for a smartphone. This looks really cool.
I thought it was a modded iPhone for a second
RGB...？
Futuristic phone
"Actually, the uniqueness of the notification and light from other phones might help it stand out. But the phone sure looks sick. ✌️"
I will never preorder anything but i would consider this my new phone if it delivers. I have currently an iPhone XS and want to switch to android again. It would be so nice if they just use stock android with some improvements like they did with One+. It's not even because of the lights (ok the charging light is pretty cool) but the design is just so clean. Thats why i haven't switched to android so far. Only really clean looking android phone is the Samsung Galaxy S22 but i hate Samsung for their bloatware and own stores and so on. I just want clean android. :(
@Rxiya x♡o lol not even close
Its just a IPhone knock off with a few tweaked features
They should get a phone case that would match the led’s
looks better than an iPhone.
Watch dbrand sell clear skins for it
What a beautiful phone
Loved the not so subtle dig at OPPO Plus😁😁 Vintage Marques.
“Unique Phone” Yeah looks like an iPhone 12 modified
But that feels like it abandoned your original fan base sound familiar!!
You had me at lights tbh. Are you going to review the Naruto phone??
Sold!
Pretty disappointing. Just another Midrange smartphone. Putting an oppo logo on the back won’t look weird
Love how that one ringtone(?) is the sound my computer speakers used to make right before my mobile phone would ring.
"So, basically just another phone. Phones have plateaued big time, man. I personally now only look for a big screen, big battery and an SD card slot, that's all."
Does the phone offer an easily replaceable battery?
so cool
Id get one if I used android
Nobody cares about any of this
all good but front camera is not at middle
Nothing phone series will surely get bigger than one plus
You were only allowed to show the back... but you also showed the front...??
"In Android world it's feel like ""EVERYTHING (OS) IS SAME EXCEPT THE NAME (PHONE COMPANY)...
This phone has a unique design, 👍🏻 for that, and those LED light features are cool as well,, and umm ...I don't know what to say ."
😂Is he talking about OnePlus at the end?
The new OnePlus?😌
I see that it might appeal more to hearing-impaired phone users. I'd certainly get one for those LED lights
Sick ringtones!!
Sick design 👌👌👌
"at the end of the day, if the functionality of the device isn’t compelling enough, it’s going to be another average phone in the ocean of average phones. if nothing can release an api and get developers of the core apps out there to fully take advantage of the led lights, i think that can be an actual way to grow interest in the device.  

what i’ve noticed is a unique looking device will come out, and after a while, its uniqueness tends to fade into the background, and the core characteristics of the device ends up being the same as every other device; which is why ppl tend to default to samsung or apple."
Can the lights work in silent or DND mode
Death of oneplus
*With those led Battery life really remains a question*
"And what about the specs? I was genuinely interested but the video just goes ""phone has light. Light cool. Buy phone"" 🤌?"
This is absolutely bonkers
im sold where do i get one RIGHT NOW
"""it's pretty sick."" Also he'll never use it That's his daily driver"
NOTHING new though
Subtle dig at oneplus...
The better looking iPhone. That’s it.
Looks literally just like an iPhone. Wouldn’t be surprised if Apple sues them.
"It seems from the video that they use stock Android but with added features
Which is wonderful 💜
I love stock Android UI

But I wonder will they provide updates?"
"No notch 
Type c 
And iPhone 12 = nothing 
If software and cameras works well , then apple got a problem here 😂😂"
the led thing.... ı want that
Looks dope
reminds me of emergency light
"Impressive, very nice. Now let's see the software..."
"fk it. take my money now! *throws away 11 pro max*

i thought i wanna wait til iphone got usb-c. 
this is better."
"The phone isn't out yet. It looks cool but I wouldn't hold my breath that it's gonna redefine the phone world



I'm hoping I'm wrong tho. More competition is great for everyone"
wait a damn minute. 2:24 is that the front?
Nothing will end up being Nothing or Nothing
It’s all good until the LED’s start failing
This guy is sucked into the multiple embargo model
Oneplus.
6:16 One Plus- I’ll take my leave guys
Samsung invented this thing of light indication in j7max and some mobiles
"Looking good, but gonna wait on the Real Review, Snyder Cut ™️"
Maybe they make a covercase that complement the LED feature? Might look dope
All  these young people dont remember how people would customize their Nokia 3390 with battrties that would light up with the custom ringtones.
I don't put my phone screen facing downward. & Shaking phone seems scratching screen. Notification light should be on front side
i already want it… someone please buy me this and the buds for my bd 🥲
Looks like a flop. You heard it here first 🤓
Wow imagine how great the led would be for deaf or hard of hearing people. Amazing design I think
"@Naru Sorry, I'm quite limited in my writing abilities in english"
@Olle Borgström read my comment again
@Naru This!!!!
"actually they can either feel vibration or literally look at the front screen. The purpose of the led at the back is to get notifications with the phone faced down, which is independent of whether the person is deaf or not"
After watching this... Ive seen Nothing
"I seriously can't believe they would announce just the LEDs on the back. Not nearly enough for me to get excited since those seem like something I would immediately turn off. I don't want everyone knowing when I get notifications, I don't want my pocket to light up while walking down the street. I really don't get it. Besides that, this phone doesn't look unique at all. It looks like something AI would make based on the last 4 iPhones."
Another comment thread full of verified checks… I KNOW this isn’t genuine at this point
Nothing interesting
"Too much for the brain, its really will be bad form  for my anxiety tho.  Its cool gadget but isn't it our goal is to minimize distraction and make it utilitarian more towards our progression."
If its under 30K rupees i am gonna buy it as soon as i convince my family
Slightly more broadly appealing.....even more and even more and even....aaah f*ck it
So he said it comes out June 12th. Did he mean July 12th?
what phone do you use?
If it's under 600 dollar........it's lit
"as usual. miracles on the stick and when it comes out, it will turn out to be something else"
"The area on the top tight, next to the camera is auch a missed opportunity for a good small e-ink display for notifications."
Literally thought it was an iPhone 11 with a nothing phone case or smthg at first 🗿.
"Yeah, but doesn't you always on display do all that way better anyways?"
Keep in mind that NOTHING is a startup company who are playing against all those trillion dollars company
So there’s a screen on the front that can display everything but they want you to decipher everything with led arrangements on the back… cool I guess but how many people want something like that?
Anyone else hear the humming vent?
I think the only way this can really have mass appeal is if they can get a case that also mimics the LEDs
rgb
KCPD man
its nothing new..the 1+ brand started almost like this and it ended up mainstreams years later..the Nothing brand will be the same
"I use a transparent case for my iPhone and never ever look at the back of the phone, so don’t see why notification lights will make me want to remap my brain to start placing any phone on its screen."
why everyone is stilling cheering up nothing?! haven't we learn from their earphones?!
1+
So sick!
i love the lights!!!
nice GIMMICK. i would've found it cool when i was twelve. same with the name... next phone gonna be Phone /2/ ?
"Innovation isn't dead, we thank God!!"
The borders are a bot too big (like on the iphone) and the hole punch placement is awful
Onplus one v2.0
Sounds familiar..???  yes oneplus!!
and what about back cover? you didn't bring that topic in discussion.
cool level 9999
Looks good but I’ll want to see performance and long term support.
this look straight out of the cyberpunk vibes
"I'm concerned about battery life of this device. I think it'll die soon, as it has Always on display with Always on LEDs on it's back."
I think it looks actually pretty dope tbh! I mean you clearly can flex with this phone hahahah
Holy shit I want it so much!
4:03- where’s Perry?
Nothing to say😅just a new different smartphone .
I really prefer the punch hole at sides rather than in the middle. Great phone i really wish it has a flagship level specs with 120hz screen
Legit thought there would be a MagSafe feature on this phone. Guess not.
watching on my 1+7p. yes it does sound familiar
It's nothing just but a phone
"""Sound familiar?"" to be clear for people who don't know. Nothing is made by Carl Pei, previous OnePlus CEO"
Essential -> Gimmick
very familiar
"I think, you are taking about OnePlus, in the end."
"Am digging it for sure but Pei should sign a pledge never to ditch fans like OnePlus eventually did. OnePlus used to actually get views from fans and infuse them in their phones until they got fat and disoriented. As for Nothing, we need a very fast and uncluttered skin, solid reliability in hardware and software frontiers, good (not necessarily great) cameras, awesome battery, long-term updates....and a good sustainability business model (buy-back, for example). We waiting Pei"
super design
“All look Basically the same” meaning look like iPhones lmao they gotta do better I miss when nexus was around it seemed like android companies did differently . But the led lights are cool af
🤩 Another competitor in market place is hugely welcomed by our side!!! Great to see that they are trying something different than other. I would also like to see them directly go head to head with Apple in coming years.
"@catboy oneplus and google has big market share in Asia, what are you talking about??? It has given huge alternative against Sam and apple."
"That’s a nice joke, that’s why they said about OnePlus & Google — now they’re both irrelevant in the global smartphone marketshare with less than 1% meanwhile Apple & Samsung both have 27-28% each of the market."
and i use android 6 year recently switch in ios my experience got better and in my perspective ios is better and yes ios have limitation but i think ios come closer to android yeah its slowly but its happening
if apple stick to their meta strong factor and improve overtime that's apple eventually doing so trust me no one able to beat apple in smartphone market business coz majority off people want balanced phone in flagship category  great camera great battery performance essential and useful features smoothly and lag free performance and 5year plus support also gd build quality and great ecosystem so in this criteria apple way ahead other smartphone company
dopeee
All it needs is a case with cutouts for the leds.
This kind of feels like a renaissance of the old transparent Nintendo handhelds. I can certainly appreciate that!
"Damn, looks cool. Unfortunately it'll all be covered with a case, unless you're into cheap silicone cases that yellow over time."
"If it has good specs and software, i think I'd buy it"
Great review...👍👏
I love how you targeted oneplus too !!
Its a new way a new gen of old phones..bringing back the light for norifications ...cool....iphone..samsung are better with cameras but innovations and new designs are nothing...
Nothing became ❤️
All these features are cool but why would you want to put your phone down on ground with the screen? Putting the most sensitive part of the phone at the highest risk of damaging it.
Glyph design resembles the Apple logo
"It's really cool for ppl who have difficulty hearing. Maybe smartphone can get a bit smarter than now, through these little idea and design show up. Not just trending mass appealing designs."
This might be the most interesting new android phone in a while. It’s great to see some fresh air in the business:)
"Total iPhone rip off. .. with notification lights in the back which is just a gimmick. 
Nothing: We made a phone and it’s different
Customer: it looks like iPhone what’s different
Nothing: it has notification led at the back which dances at the time of incoming call and tweets."
"CGI is what it says on the back. 

""Computer generated Image"""
Nice way to remind the journey of OnePlus at the end 😅
Love the design but not sure if it's the mic but those ringtones could really use more mellow options. They all sound like malfunctioning sounds which can get annoying fast.
"Этот телефон выглядит очень круто, это свежий глоток воздуха в индустрию👍👍👍😍😍😍"
"I will be looking forward to the software experience. If it’s going to be just another skin over google’s android.. then it’s strictly NO. It’s the bad software which is holding back Android in developed markets. When I was a student I was happy with 200$ moto G but when I look to buy 1300$ android it’s just scary to have a phone which will just crash while you are driving using android auto Map. Don’t know whose fault it’s the, hardware or software or a implementation by OEM but definitely not customers fault."
Yes you do sound familiar. That's how I lost trust and love for Oneplus. I hope it won't go that way too.
Am I the only one that rests his phone face up? Makes thoses LEDs useless to me... Also an AOD app (given an OLED screen) gives pretty much the same features.
This looks like NOTHING I’ve ever seen before.
I think it looks promising....i need to see more.
Round glowing led is copied from my j7 max called smart glow🤣
"What phone do you have?
Nothing"
❤️
"I think smartphone companies are losing the point. I mean look at Apple! I was always mocking them…the iPhone is so expensive while so simple. But thing is there is nothing similar concept-wise.

Imagine there was an android phone with flat edges, fhd+ or qhd+ 120hz display with a punch hole camera and just 2 cameras on the back, a 5,8 inch “mini” model and a normal 6,5 inch model, a light ui based on stock Android OS and a snapdragon chip. Asus was going towards that way with zenphone 8 but it was not widely available. I believe Android smartphone companies are competing only in specs, but none of them in real life use"
"The dilemma here is that the LED lights at the back of the phone may consume a lot since it would do much lighting up whenever someone would call you. Just sayin'.

P.S. How much is this phone again?"
Nerd evil is so 2010...we gotta get out of all this nerd evil stuff and back to wholesome good things. Words of inspiration and empowerment. Every human has their own gifts. Why do nerds gifts get to demand all the limelight? Nerds are a thing of the past these days.
It looks clean ngl
if this comes in black colour. I am getting it.
"No doubt, very cool... it's just, not an iPhone, and I don't mean to be that guy, I've given android manny shots, and I just can't. On the flipside there are many android features I love to have on my iPhone too, but I have to pick main usability on the things I use every day vs cool features that I would use twice a year."
just a gimmick for kids
"Did he make fun of ""Never settle"" at the end? Hahaha!"
"Those rear LEDs look cheap and nasty, as does the phone."
"I don't rest my phone on it's face, like ever 🙂, so all lights on back are useless"
Looks pretty cool. But why the odd placement of LEDs. The overall pattern doesn't look very aesthetic
I adore the design of this. Finally someone thinking outside the plain slab.
"Hmm... How many people charge or lay their phone down-facing? When it rings, I'd see the caller's name or photo show up."
Now I am hyped
Definitely interested on this phone. Looks very cool. Neat and different idea concept and love to see what it is able to do. Plus what the price will be for it when it comes out.
No matter how good your phone looks in the end you will end up using a funky case for it.
That's actually pretty cool
I think it's just boring nothing special
Oh thank God finally a phone that has the curvy body of an iPhone! The usual Androids don’t curve as smoothly as an iPhone’s body does..
Will it support North American LTE bands?
Now phone backs are getting reviewed.
"Omg, the diffusion looks fantastic on those lights! I'm actually considering this for my next device. I have the Z Flip 3 but the rumours and leaks on the flip 4 look like it will be almost identical to the 3, so this seems like a good runner up. Now I understand what that image they showed on stage, it was the pattern of the lights."
@Mit Mit  no kidding eh.
@山乇丂ᑎIᑕᕼOᒪ  modern day people get spoiled easy haha.
"@Mit Mit  Ya thats the only reason I switched to it from my 12 pro, I was just bored of the same old design over and over so when I bought the ZFlip it felt like a completely new thing. But like anything the novelty wears off after a few months lol."
@山乇丂ᑎIᑕᕼOᒪ i haven't own flip before might as well get it for my  next daily use phone (also 8gen1+ is really good i heard ) . i mean  folding phone still a new thing around nothing phone only look cool in the back otherwise they are just some  regular slab smartphone
@bob screen protector cracks after a couple months along the crease.
I've only known about this phone for a few weeks but I'm very interested in the Android re-skin and if the cameras are good. if not I'm just going to get a Pixel 6a
Gosh this is gonna be a nightmare sitting next to my bed at night
plot twist: this is an iPhone. iPhone is Nothing.
"All BAD IDEAS.
1) Putting the phone face down on a desk prone to dust. 
2) Wiggling the phone on the dusty desk to check battery status.
3) Wasting previous battery.

I have a legion phone with LEDs on the back and never use it because it drains the battery."
"The ringtone thing, as well as the ringtones, are sick as hell"
Carl Pei cried after 6:08
6:30 hahaha take that oneplus (I currently have a oneplus 7t and was considering the pixel for my next phone yet the nothing one seam very appealing)
Sounds Familiar...🤣
Man what a phone🤩
"Hey Marquis can you test and speak about any possible support for USBc dp-alt mode? Ie. Can this phone display on an external monitor?

This is often overlooked in many reviews."
Really interesting
"If the camera is good, this might be my new phone"
Sounds like one plus but okay
Shots fired at OnePlus lol
900?
This phone looks like a Blade Runner prop. Quite amazing nonetheless!
No
please tell me where is customer care service provider an india delhi??? my nothing ear1 buds is discharge automatically and it's blinking red light.
"What kind of people place the phone face down on the table? Definitely, I have never seen it. Putting LED on back of the phone is just useless."
Looks like a phone Tom Cruise would use in the movie Oblivion.
"Finally Looks Different of anyother brand!!
best of Nothing!!!! 
LOVe From Bangladesh!!!
❤️💜❤️💜❤️💜💘💔💗💔❤️🦧🦧🦧💞💝❤️💜❤️💘💔💞💜❤️❤️💜💝❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
6:22 the shade to one plus hahahaha
"I just hope they nail the software side of the package. In my humble opinion phone tech has advanced enough that there isn't a particularly bad bunch of hardware. If it has anything close to upper mid tier perfomance, it will be all things to most of the people, albeit barring some hardcore special scenario users. I'm excited for Nothing's future in a familiar way. Carl Pei came full circle."
This is called cheap apple aka sasta apple 12
i wish we could change the color of the LED. Orange LED lights would look sick on that white body
an android phone with just 2 cameras is more than enough.. i dont want 100 cameras that costs 5000 dollars
they better make a black version of it
Two plus phone
Ultimate edition of Transparent phone  we all have been waiting for... Definitely My buy...!!
The nothing phone is sick! I want that thing so bad. Can't afford it but it's amazing 🤩
This is dope... I want one
"That DOES sound familiar! 😂




😭"
0:13 phone front
Dope 🔥
Most hyphed smartphone of 2022
The compact era ❤️😍
Smartphones have pretty much plateaued. Nothing interests me except maybe stuff like the flip and whatnot.
"1:12 i get that you can only show the back of the phone, but then at 3:36 you show off the front of the phone? I guess you meant like not being able to show off more of the OS. I just found the phrase kinda contradicting haha. Keep up the good work"
06:31 yes it does  LG......
If internal hard disk had a back camera it would be this phone 😂😂
That front better be some heat cause why can’t you show it lol
it seems difficult to find a good case for this phone
"Wow, speechless. I have nothing to say"
"The design is really cool, especially those back light. If they put compelling hardware and especially solid set of camera system, they might cut a good amount of customers 👍"
"@Gabriel Dalposso The isp is the same as well as the 8gen1 I belive, which really suprised me. Maybe the ai engine is cut down? I'm not sure, but sd has kept making the 7 series more and more capable while pricing it higher. It's now an upper middle range soc, I expect sd to introduce a 6 series or something lower with maybe 6 cores and cut down bits from 7 and 8 series"
"@Cherries thanks for letting me know!I’m not that into the architecture of SD chips, but it seems like it’s fine for day to day use 👀"
@Saito Dosan I’m kinda worried with the size of the speaker grills on the bottom tho (but I guess it’s too soon to make assumptions 😅)
"@Gabriel Dalposso at $499 an sd7 is a good deal. Its essentially 8gen1 without the x2 core, not a very big difference."
"Yessir. The design alone is already awesome. If it has a camera and speakers that can compete with iPhone, and the software isn't complete trash, I'd definitely be interested in switching over."
Reads spec sheet and assumes he knows what he's talking about
but why it look like a iphone
If it's rocking the previous oxygen OS I'm definitely buying this phone
"Noob level: checking your screen to tell who's calling

Master level: deciphering an intricate pattern of light flashes on the back of your phone to tell who's calling

Who's this ""functionality"" for, exactly?"
The new oneplus
"Oof that dig at the end...maybe a bit underserved though, as that's essentially why Pei left OnePlus."
They literally made iphone 14 without the weird pill shape and another punch hole cut out.and not just that also cooler!
too much of a gimmick
I never put phone with screen facing down on table. Always on display >>>>>>>
That jab at OnePlus hahaha
Love from Bangladesh
"It’s a cool phone. Hopefully doesn’t run the same strategy as OnePlus or HTC, 2 good brands with nice looking phones..who somehow dissolved.."
"Looks really good.
Like an iphone 12, just more interesting."
"I find the device you look like an iPhone XS -x mixed with iPhone 11 they came together with the Samsung Galaxy s 22 from which this child was created. That looks damn good. Damn good !!! I hope it has a good battery and reasonable software. I'm really excited about it, I'm happy that Android needed 😂😂😂iPhone 📱+ Samsung 🤳=nothing"
Killer look...
Wow that's a phone I actually want
"One of the glyphs look like Apple Logo, even the leaf and the bite on the same side. Strange... The whole phone looks like Apple prototype"
Message to Nothing Team: Please include headphone jack
Probably Nothing.
"I already like the functional design part with the rear led's.
I sure hope it has mini-jack plug!"
it doesn't have one. How don't you know that?
The slow zoom in at the end though🤣 OnePlus vibes all over from nothing. Hope they don't suck up and get greedy like OP
all i want is the ! section of the LEDs to light up to the Metal Gear alert sound.
"😊😊😊you said they asked you not to show the front of the phone, but you showed us the front while trying out the ringtone🙈"
Excited
It seems that Apple have decided to sell some of their spare parts to other manufacturers.
💀❤️
"Hope v2 has LEDs on the sides & front, with software that only lights up the portion facing the user"
Looks like an apple lawsuit waiting to happen
I dig the look of the phone awesome :)
I mean if it's budget friendly then I would definitely love to get one
"Great looking phone, but the camera punch hole is Asymmetrical, which will be annoying to some."
"I want a company to make a mini sized full screen phone that can be used with one hand at least by average people, doesn't have glass at the back, can take two three falls and is decent and uses stock android or even better Graphene OS. Now people have other devices for several other purposes, a phone should be sleek and good in hands and can take some rough uses with water and fall."
Looks exciting
"This looks so nice, if my phone ever breaks, I’ll keep my eye on these guys. I love the back how it looks very similar to an iPhone, I love the look of the iPhone. And than the front display looking like any usual Samsung Display. I don’t like the Samsung phones, both design wise and interface wise, but I gotta admit, this is very appealing."
First time in a while that ive seen a good looking non apple smartphone
First view: iPhone with MagSafe with litghts.
I think he was talking about oneplussss
"Original? Different? Seems like a transparent iPhone. But with that LEDs, it's like a tunning iPhone."
What’s the performance specs tho
1st time I've been shown the back of a phone more than the front.
"I like how the leds look like the apple logo from the slant as the leaf and the gap as the bite taken out the apple, don't know if it was on purpose, I'm guessing it was."
the future is here
I so wondered how you get this phone? I can't find this with any other you tubers!
looks awesome if I'm being honest
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY !!!!
Nothing really matters 😂😂😂
The lights all on kinda resembles an apple logo.. also the default ring tones sound like r2d2
3:19 so you are telling me now I can't secretly record anyone cuz of that blinking red light
Quik review ❤️❤️❤️❤️
"The LED notification on the back could be awesome for hearing impaired users. And to be able to customize it per app and/or contact? Perfect. If it does well, I'm sure apple will implement the same idea in about 8 years."
I can relate to this!!!
@1SA9090  Nothing came up with transparent earbuds. Apple is also planning to release a transparent version of Airpods...
@Santosh Parvatikar idk much about this what’s happened
"What Nothing does, Apple copies..."
😂
6:30 That subtle blow on OnePlus tho! 😂🙏
ONEPLUS
I don’t know if it’s only me that’s noticing the brief zoom-ins when he is emphasising. These days there are more of them that are starting to become noticeable. At 00:30 is specifically weird though.
So we'll have to use this without cover?
just wait for someone to design a slim case with notifications for iPhone

TAKE MY MONEY 🤓🤓🤓
Ppl are gullible and kinda short minded narrow minded easy influenced. If u tell them this is the best thing to ever came in a phone ppl will listen and buy it even so it might be totally trash. That's why there is leaders and many followers. Because the leaders make decisions and not listen to others. Then there is the sheep that follow and listen and don't make their own decisions. (lot of ppl seem to fit in the later)
"I'm sorry but that's literally just a fucking iPhone, they straight up ripped it off there's nothing that LOOKS different about it. Also not digging the layout of the lights on the back even though the idea is neat, it looks way too random to look sleek imo. The idea of LED indicators coming back rocks though, they should have never left."
The biggest question is the price segment. If the price is appealing and with this design and features maybe. I would prefer a rugged phone for food riders
COOOOOL
"That zoomed in ""sounds familiar ?"" 😂👌"
Those LEDs on the back are fantastic.
just WAOH!
"Well... A phone with a target audience of a) people who don't use cases and b) PUT THEIR PHONE DOWN ON THE SCREEN is *hopefully* very rare, as I wouldn't want to have a phone that gets put down on the screen all the time, sounds like insane scratch haven, and no case means it's guaranteed too."
"I have a fear that MKBHD will come to my wedding and say;
So i've been using your wife for a month now and here are my thoughts."
The light pattern...woahhhh🤯🤯
That OnePlus story at the end KEKW. Nice plug
star wars droid and light sabre time! also imagine if you get a cyberpunk theme going.
yeh still good with my OnePlus 7t..still the best🤷🏿‍♂️that phone looks cute doe
Hey MKBHD wanna know about software and os more
"I mean the light feature is pretty nice, but most people i know put their phonescreen facing upwards. With always-on displays you get the same feature for seeing text notification and battery charging. Its a cool looking phone nonetheless but its more of a sci-fi movie prop than a commercially successful phone."
"That’s basically iPhone 12 white with a LED back and a punch hole instead of notch and runs android lol

And as far as I remember they targeted apple directly during the launch"
okay honestly this is really cool but how often are you looking at the back of your phone for this to be useful?
"""The Nothing Phone LOOKS Different"" is an understatement for this phone"
So $400 for lights because you're too lazy to pick up your phone. Got it.
"ear 1 user here, I like the headphones for what im using them for, and im digging the design as it looks awesome with those LEDs, though im skeptical with the performance, camera, battery and price. If the phone fulfills my expectations I will definitively go with this device"
The end is OnePlus company if you didnt get it lol
Cool but I put skins on all my phones so...
impractical gimmick if I've ever seen one.
Should've uploaded this video in HDR!! The lights would pop on the right display
Looks like a Killer Mid Tier. $699 - $799 would be fair pricing.
It looks nothing like other phones. Now that was great tag line.
"this was micromax tag line back then lol:
Its nothing like anything"
"Looks awesome, but is way too big"
That was a good advice at the end.
Basically you have shown the whole phone structure .. and sure it looks dope 🔥🔥🔥
I think so far this is such a cool design for a phone. I’m ready to see where this new brand goes 🤌😏
Who is skeptic about how much the phone would cost?
"Glass on the back is so dumb, i just cant wrap my head around it. Rubber makes just so much mire sense in my opinion. Glass breaks and you need to replace the whole back..."
OnePlus left the room.
The Nothing phone is definitely impressive and mind blowing 🤯🤯
"It's  21-jun-2022. 10:02PM.  I can say that the next biggest company is ""Nothing"""
The once 'Broadly Appealling' Oneplus.... Which is now totally fucked up imo.
Cough* OnePlus *cough at the end
Pretty sure they’ll crash and burn in no time
Would love the lights on other flagship
Yeah that’s a iPhone 12 bro….
Looks like a naked iphone with tattoos😂
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you❤
Wow they made an transparent version if iPhone 12 and AirPods?
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you❤
as from the front the bezels look uniform and camera is positioned on corner which makes it look even better and helps in satnding out from the competion so far.....accidently revealed the front i guess
"Sry, last time I checked everyone uses front screen on their phones😄. You want to keep this phone upside down all the time to use those led setup. It is  basically a less than thoughtful design. Just to make it look different with very little importance on usage. What this phone will bring at software level will define it."
weather app icon in the background!
Dope design 💥
Cant wait for a debrand clear skin for this
"Apple has built an enitre eco system for their products, so for a lot of people it will be a hassle and so hard to switch to a different platform. People dont like change, so to get them to change, the phone/product will have to be revolutionary that everyone is talking about it, i mean everyone to your 65 year old retired autny Barbra"
I WANT IT
I'm sold
"Run under IOS, no
NEVER"
I would switch… if the messages weren’t green
its the gimmickest gimmick
"Stop it,. That's an iphone."
"I have some questions before the review. 1, what is the performance of the cameras. 2, what is the performance of the Snapdragon 7 gen 1. And 3, is it a price to performance ratio better enough to be one of the best smartphones of this year? That's all"
That phone looks like a circus. I wouldn't buy it.
The accessibility features for deaf or hard of hearing folk with the led design is just on another level.
Wow 🤩
"The NOTHING Phone looks different, It’s glows"
"4:03 Woody woodpecker? 
4:14 R2D2?"
"MKBHD: I'm only allowed to show you the back of the phone
Also MKBHD: Proceed to show the front of the phone from the start of the video"
"I am only allowed to show back of the phone, goes ahead to show the front 🤣🤣"
The word Gimmick was invented for this.
"the subtle shaaaade Marques threw towards Oneplus ... I love it 😂🙈
but this thing nonetheless really does look stunning. curious if that'll be enough 🤔"
"I was thinking what if the back glass broke, from its design, it seems that the LEDs and other stuff isn't attached to the glass and if the glass broke the internals would be somewhat protected.
If this is the case(no pun intended) then I'm buying this phone, cause I really need a new one  anyways😂"
My phone is always in a case and I put it on the table with the screen up. So what for this LED-light?
"The design is really cool I must say... Funny was, when the ringtone used only the right top LED strip, it sounded like Star Wars light saber :-)"
"So, it's an iPhone 12 with a LED in the back. Cool."
I have a feeling this is gonna flop
Can any one tell me about the screensize ? plzz
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you❤🎊
They should have made a black phone so that the LED stands out
wonder if they'll be able to beat the sales to views ratio of sony phones
"a usb c iphone running android, thank god someone did it"
If the software is decent I’ll buy this phone
"I admire the design for its novelty, but credit is due to apple for making flat edges cool again.
I'd love to see a 5"" mini version."
Just need the specs
"Honestly the design is pretty good (Please let there be a black color version), but all I need from this phone is to last 3+ years without slowing down or lagging too much. Like the older OnePlus phones. 

None of the newer phones give me that 'confidence of reliability'. Let's see what Nothing has for us in store."
I want one
super interesting with the right price tag I guess I'm getting one😬
"Ahh, notification LEDs. I used to really love them to the point of customising them for different app notifications. But then it just got tedious and was micromanaging. These days I just have notifications for important stuff like messaging and calls, everything else can wait! 😂"
RIP smartphone backcovers.
Looks like a kids video game 😅
"yes it sounds familiar, You were talking about Oneplus :'("
Sarcasm 😅
"This is different but very amazing. Look at the ""iphone Style"" love this apple design witch is way better than apple did it."
i love it
Not because the camera is like this don't mean it's a iPhone
"Sure that is something new, but seems like a gimmick than a feature to me. Like if I don't have my phone in my pocket, I will have it like on a table, but screen side up, right? And when I have my phone in my pocket and it starts vibrating/ringing, I can just look at the screen to see who's calling or what notification did I get.

This would make more sense, if the led's would be on side or on top of the phone, you know like a ring around the entirety of the display, this way the led's could actually be used for software like in pc rgb hardware, red glow when you playing a game and you're low health and such.

On a sidenote, when will phone manufacturers start making their phones more grippable, I feel like every phone is so smooth and slippery that you have get a case to not have it fall off your hands constantly and so the entire aesthetic of the phone is moot. Sure you can use a clear case, but not only does that look bad and cheap, it will also gather a lot of dirt and lint."
Still waiting for a phone without a front camera...
Why wouldn’t you want a front camera?
That does not convince me. Seems like a gimmic.
At least it has uniform bezels all around unlike most Androids which have slightly thicker chins.
You said you're only allowed to show the back of the phone but you showed the front too 😬
Jerry Rig will enjoy this one!
"Sounds very familiar.... I just hope it doesn't end up like Oneplus who cheated its loyal fanbase by changing their tagline to 
"" BETTER SETTLE "". 😝"
Familiar....s....one minus
@Telegram👉Officialmaxtech wow
"Imagine getting this phone, and then putting a solid black case on it..."
Is it coming global on July 12?
"My first impression of this phone: ""Damn, is that a custom iPhone 12?"""
"And besides the garland, what is interesting about it? Why is it worth buying?"
"I love that LED idea with different notifications and sounds, I love that idea.

I also like the idea of someone asking what phone I have and replying with nothing.
""you dont have a phone""? 
""Yeh I do""
""What phone""? 
""Nothing""

And then that goes on forever 😂"
That just happened now
"alright then, keep your secrets"
allowed to show only back of the phone. Ends up showing screen
Is it bad that I want it?
His presentation skills exceed the appeal of any real product - such a pleasure to watch !
inb4 Carl Pei leaves Nothing in 8 years and creates a new startup just to repeat the cycle
That last burn on OnePlus 😆
the light pattern is actually a feature in old feature phones.
Oh wouahou… LED Iphone 12 with Android… Next
"6:22 More, Moore, Moooore! 

Yeah, sounds familiar 😈"
The Honest Thumbnail 🎉
Can't wait for Zack to bend test it.
Nothing lights
The whole transparent and with lights look is just soo cool like it's really something unique 🔥
I'm going to buy one
With all those lights battery life good bye.
"Marques: ""I am only allowed to show you the back of the phone""
Also Marques: *shows the front of the phone*"
I'm getting this for sure.
🤡🤡🤡🤡
Lighting low key makes the Apple logo on the back :0
I feel like im tired with phones looking all samey. Im sure there's market for phones that dont just look like a slick looking slab.
"My takeaway from this video is that there's a Dragon Ball Z colab phone, and I want it."
"Something completely unique for android. If this is their startup, imagine how far they will take the android near future. Boom Nothing 🔥🔥🔥"
looks like iPhone
I Guess Black varient will be more interesting
Just want that back features on my iPhone. Switching to Android because of that nahhh
"Thats absolutely badass, i want one tbh"
Pretty cool. Wondering what the software will be like/ Did I miss something. Is this android based or it's got its own OS?
What about software
*6:14** to **6:34** RIP One Plus 😢*
That burn at the end 😂
OMG i want it
🚲 ⚡
"Um, i’m excited"
Wait did he just reveal the front of the phone
I think we should all give them a chance even if we find some bugs in this phone(I don't think there will be a lot). Even the first 2 phones from OnePlus weren't that popular and Nothing has clearly aced  the design for me.
"I have the Dragonball Z phone. The problem with the DBZ , Naruto and League of Legends phones they were only for sell in China so no google app unless side load like I did. All great phone but at the end gemicks. The nothing phone 📱 is cool but unless it's able to sell well in the USA and overseas it will end up being NOTHING"
"Wow! Just put lights on the back of the phone and everybody is cheering. Hello, case makers make an app and a case with lights and everyone will be happy as joy."
"why the back lid light become the center of discussion? it is not big deal right now, we are not kids"
"he said 900 leds, right? Doesn't it get hot? like those hyper x rgb ssd that actually harmed their own performance and durability because the rgb leds created to much heat (I really like it, if it's not a heavily modified android, can play genshin, has decent battery and the leds don't hurt the phone... I'm in but, still worried about those leds, I don't care about the camera, I want performance)"
Copying iphone shaped and design :)
that ringtone thing is pretty cool
"FINALLY, an android phone with symmetrical bezels!!! I love that it has no chin. And yeah, the lights and sounds harmony is a very good trick!"
I think we should all give them a chance even if we find some bugs in this phone(I don't think there will be a lot). Even the first 2 phones from OnePlus weren't that popular and Nothing has clearly aced  the design for me.
"I feel like the HTC LED case (remember that!) had more potential and with a matrix LED, significantly more could have been achieved on the back if they wanted to go that way."
Samsung/Apple will hire their design team soon
A phone with the Watch Dogs vibe
I like transparency and the LED but why then color everything under it to be white?
A view from India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
LoL... A Battery Consuming Light
I just want optimization to be great and not so many phones in a year
Cool iPhone 12
"The design and placements seems too random, maybe better if it's ""strategically placed"""
"*Jesus about to bring revelation*

Marques: So I've been revelling in the revelation for past couple weeks and here's what i think..."
I have no interest in this company unless they have commitments for right to repair. All the things mentioned are just a gimmick and useless like the notification lights. I hate it when companies replicate Apple which is one of the biggest anti-consumer anti-repair companies on earth.
line of light = tron
July 12th?? great gift for my 18th birthday XD
Finally someone actually holding the phone in hand and not just a thumbnail !
Wait wait wait so they designed an iPhone 12 🤣
This kind of looks like a toy to me
Pretty sick 😉💫🔥
Imagine buying this phone and using a case
Does it come in black?
*cough* 1+ *cough* @6:25
wow its coming a day before my birthday great
The device for mkbhd
My concern is if the back will turn yellow or not.
I thought you didn't like Nothing phone. It's all hype anyway
"The ""sound familiar?"" got me good xD especially knowing who owns Nothing"
Carl Pei knows buisness very well by creating such hype. It's OnePlus 2.0 /Nothing.Real genius
"Not going to lie, those LED and transparent back looks really good. Hope other companies too pick them up"
Seems like a OnePlus scenario.
Imagine them collaborating with Star Wars
"All of these features look genuinely pointless. Style over substance, just because something new is brought to the table doesn't mean it's any good."
6:32 - OnePlus left the chat.
Excited about OS.....
"""Hey Apple, let me see your homework real quick...""  Nothing"
Love from Andro wide
That glyph feature is tough 😳🔥
i would totally buy this phone but i just bought the s22 ultra on launch so maybe nothing phone 2 or 3 in the future :D
Im 100% buying that phone I don't care ab the price
"As i was an oneplus user ,  i think nothing phone 1 is a bait to aquire customers.However, in the end they will abandon the loyal customers as oplus !!! i'll try to avoid this one . I avoid oneplus devices got myself a pixel 6, happy with it for now."
"As a OnePlus 9 pro owner the ""sounds familiar"" in the end got me 😂"
Sound familiar 🤔 yes oneplus
Gimmick
Ringtone sounds like the phone is broken
"And here is another GIANT android phone... 
Why are there literally no 6"" android phones on the market? Apple seems to be the only company that still makes something  ""pocketable"""
led is cool but i am still looking for a phone with decent heat management
I think if those leds had rgb lighting to change the color it’d be a massive hit
"He said ""I'm only allowed to show the back"" and revealed the punch hole display 🤣😂"
"So they had a chance to grab a huge section of people who want the headphone jack back...
And they just... Put lights on it?

When will companies cater for people that want function over form 🥲

Still may get my attention if it runs well against a pixel, seeing as oneplus stopped being oneplus"
"Amazing Design 
Although white looks great, Why not give the option of colored LEDs to make it even more appealing!"
"i hope that the shipset will be sd8 gen1, software update more than 4 years and a price under 600$. it will be awesome"
Eager to see it in all black 🖤
Nah man. This is some rubbish. It's a shameless rip off of the iPhone. Shame on your Carl Pei. Thought you'd be better than this.
"YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE ALLOWED TO REVEAL THE BACK SIDE BUT YOU ALSO REVEALED THE FRONT SIDE TOO 
🤔🤔🤔"
Need a Rhinoshield Bumper case for this phone
Feels just a smart LED as of now...
"Why would we subscribe to your channel and watch Android Phone reviews when you clearly said outright that you like iPhone and is superior in every aspect to any Android phone. It is alright and good to say your opinion, but implying something in public which is not true is always bad. 

Do you think all the phone manufacturers who make Android Phones are not doing any R&D which will at least make one criterion of the Android phone better than the iPhone? 
Stop making Android phone reviews when you are not at all interested and are only making it for the views and revenue."
This is SH.TPHONE)
Yes its the SHITPHONE
Looks like an iPhone 12 🤷🏻‍♂️ besides the punch hole camera
I like it. I m gonna buy it as soon as it comes out. Looks sick tho!
That was subtle hint. Okay if this has Hardwar to match I'll definitely buy it. Pei should be careful this time
It will come Bangladesh?? 😍
"Nothing has the potential to own the midrange smartphone market. Exited, let's see where it goes!"
Wow 😲
there's nothing like it lol
Dam bro iPhone 12 looking different
"I think it's a really cool piece of tech, but I'm 30 years old, the days of tinkering around with new phones are way behind me. As long as I can read my email, receive and make payments and upload some simple tiktoks for marketing purposes, I'm good man!"
You could say it looks Nothing like other phones...
I like it!
"This is just a gimmick and adds absolutely nothing in terms of useful functionality that is not already addressed in a far superior way by Always on display with an OLED screen. This is just for showing off. And with all those LEDs on the back and the very thin size of the phone, I am guessing there is very little space for a high capacity battery inside. So, this will likely have some poor battery life too. In other words, all the actual features users care about would be compromised just for the ""cool"" factor."
A very unique phone. That looks exactly like one of the phones on the market. 😳😳😮😮
I love your channel mkbhd😊😊
5:13 But that’s an iPhone 13 pro lol
I use a galaxy note 20 ultra but this phone Sims somehow really cool to me and I might really switch if it happens to get a UI as clean as One UI
I could only wish but I’m deep as fuck into the Apple ecosystem I can’t see myself turning back.
OnePlus Roast in disguise.👍
Nicee... Please say you were saying that about Oneplus.
can't wait to move from Apple iPhone to this....
I love nothing
The light thing is really cool dude 🔥 if i didn't just buy a phone totally would buy it
Yeah. Familiar. Oneplus.
"loving this , a real reason to get a new phone a company thinking outside the box and giving us something different"
"if they ever make it black, i'm sold."
If the cameras are good maybe I will get its second gen
Looks like an iPhone with a stylish back case…nothing fascinating
They probably hired ex apple ID team.
Those ringtones sound retro asf🔥
"The last part, you were talking about Oneplus, I guess. 🤣🤣🤣"
Looks dope!
Everything on this video is awesome and cool except your T-SHIRT!
Nice
Teenage engineering vibes
The first Android phone to have actual iMessage 😩
It is 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
"Really interesting, we need innovative design. Thumbs up"
I genuinely have 0 interest in the novelty features of this phone. I could just have the screen facing up and see all this info with no confusion
🤦
I actually really like how it looks. I'll wait a few months and I might genuinely consider it.
This nothing tubelight looks good let's see how it does practically 😏
Its literally an Iphone 12 lol
0:13 dope .. from front bezel less design like iPhone and it’s best in android world..
Hai
The Phone looks like nothing I have ever seen before
Oh god I knew who you were comparing it to immediately
Tiktokers or content creators no longer need a ring light 💡 ⭕️
"This has to be a flagship killer with very aggressive pricing or else, most of us don't give a truck and phone's back.
Please don't be another OnePlus.
If Cameras are good enough, I am going to Join this Nothing Club"
Yeah similiar to OnePlus because the owner is the same right!!
"If they move the cameras to the middle, that would be enough to make it unique in this ""iPhone like"" trend's that we have right now"
"This phone looks like something out of the future. BUT, from a user experience point of view, I'm interested to see how the seamless integration between software and hardware will play out. As someone heavily invested in the Apple eco-system, the ability to work across different platforms (MacBook, iPhone, Watch, etc.) makes the experience amazing, and NOTHING really has to convince users that they can offer something similar. Watching this space!"
The one plus reference in the end😂😂😂
The design is amazing.
"When he’s checking the ringtones, it reminds me of when I was a kid, I’d always spend minutes on my Mum’s Nokia 3310 going through every existing ringtone, and vibe to them like actual music. Ha ha 😂"
Definitely my next phone.
"The Nothing Phone (1) looks like a blend of all Oppo Reno 7 phones. Chinese Reno 7 5G frame. Even some antenna bands are at the same spot along with the individual volume buttons. Also same screen size with 6.43"" along with a slightly slimmer chin like the Oppo Reno 7 Pro and punchhole on the left top. And how the cameras portrude looks like the ones of the Reno 7Z. Also the Reno 7 series brought the Orbit (Breathing) Light that the (1) took to the max! So is Nothing a true indipendent start up? Looks to me like OnePlus all over again! Maybe the ties between Carl Pei and Pete Lau are still there. 😜"
so nothing did something? thats quite shocking
Aight kinda impressed lol
That was a reference to Oneplus
My father gets this much notifications from the business that the phone will light our whole led house by glowing 24*7
Gimmicky enough that android fans will mistake it as innovative.
iphone 11 knockoff
That subtle nod to oneplus👌
Very cool but not for me.
The notification lights are probably the coolest but most unnecessary thing on the phone…. Who puts the phone display down on a table?
"The shape of this phone looks EXACTLY like an iPhone. With a hole punch camera on the front instead of a notch, and a unique but possibly gimmicky back with LEDs. Whether those LEDs on the back actually add useful and cool features that are worth using, or simply turn out to be a gimmicky party trick that you show off once in a while to others but otherwise completely ignore or turn off is something that needs to be seen. I think it falls more under the gimmicky category."
"The way you, in such a subtle manner made fun of Oneplus was nice 😄😄👏🏻👏🏻"
"Make no mistake, the design is strategically implemented to appeal to the loyal apple iPhone fan base. The LED lighting is cool but sort of gimmicky in my opinion, and once you initially get over the excitement within a month or two, you’ll regress back to the more familiar iPhone or galaxy you’ve used before."
Basically its overhype well its their first smartphone release and its not too bad also not really that great either. Still I really interested where they gonna go after this and what kind of product they will release. That back design still look sick tho definitely look aesthetic
"This looks solid AF. All it needs is a solid camera, decent screen, and a stock android like feel and it can take over where Oneplus and Pixel left off. If I wasn’t used to my iPhone syncing with my iPad and AirPods I’d buy this phone. I miss android but am really enjoying the tightly knit structure of iOS"
"Really not impressed. I'm still looking for some brand to build a software first phone. 
Android os is open source and still no brand is able to come up with a decent phone that optimises for software as smooth as iphone does, not even pixel. That's the reason why people use iPhone to start with. Nobody needs huge specs"
"""I am allowed to show you the backside""
2:23: *proceeds to show the front*"
is this from the movie DUNE?
This is the only newly released phone that could get me off of my XR in a heartbeat with just the looks alone
"lmao the ""Glyph"" actually is:
an upside down ""i""
a ""c"" around the camera
and a big apple in the middle *hey it even has a stem!*
so... I C Apple"
"Welcome to ""Videos for Europeans""
I truly wonder how the disparity of viewership from the US and Eu is between Apple and Android videos."
Is is going to be worth not putting a back cover? It's the answer we will have to wait and watch
"If the camera is good, looks decent"
"I actually am impressed… I like the UI and the physical design…

Also some actually decent sounding ringtones that don’t sound like a marimba"
"i like the UI font a lot. its got a cool ""welcome to the future"" vibe that reminds you of like, early internet or the matrix. idk how to properly describe it.

i like fonts."
Definitely what they trying to achieve with this device is great but coming out with rumours of processor display and price range kinda might be a setback hope they are just rumours
When I first saw this phone I wasn't that impressed considering it didn't look as cool as the ear (1) but after seeing the backlight features it has got me interested (only if they release a transparent case)
"A bumper style case would work as well, keeps the screen/back raised to rpevent anything hitting it, whilst providing protection around the outside. That way there's nothing impeding the glow from the back."
Its beatiful with with led and white color
Literally got you interested with leds lmao
Weird to see just your hand and face in 6+ minute video
will you give that scecond phone to someone hu subbed?
"Rather than a transparent one, we need a scratch resistant and shockproof housing material"
It not just looks like a regular iphone 12. It looks like an iphone 12 with broken back glass SMFH
its a shame I'm still gonna have to put a case on it tho.
They are $2300 here in Japan... Screw that.
I’m waiting for Black matte everything review 💯
That indeed sounds very VERY familiar. +1 to that comment.
a bit disappointing expected more
"who charges their phone face down. your videos are repetitive and predictable.  your ""dope"" seal of approval has fell off.
stop letting tech companies buy your opinion."
"Imagine going on a date with someone with Epilepsy, and getting a call with the notif leds."
"Great design ngl, but I always slap a case on my device 😔."
Apple looking at that design like ummm size and shape looks familiar
@Jack Costabile I image other companies haven't been so bold in fear of a lawsuit haha. It is a decent idea - iphone just with Android haha. Add some lights and an custom app.
Bro even the navigation bar at the bottom looks the same
HEY the dig at OnePlus was not needed. 😁
Yellow cable charging cord
Oof
Clear cases bout to come back in style. Need the LED to be able to be different colors.
This phone is so simple yet so innovative. I’m excited to see what’s to come in the future. Love the aesthetics.
"Why would anyone buy anything from the new kid in the block while the established brands are doing the same thing.
This is the USP of the phone like the sandstone back of the original one plus 1."
Does anyone know how much it will cost?
I guess what will really be the differ is the final out the door price 🤔
The default ringtones sounded like R2D2 😂
Awesome videos sorry I’m so late
shots at oneplus in the end lmao
This is too white! It needs coloured LEDs.
"I definitely really like that glyph idea, the problem is Apples software for me at least is far to embedded to justify ever changing…or at least for a very long time. I still want glyph lights though, that’s very cool."
3:18 all the perverts in the world: darn it!
😶
I want a Dbrand teardown skin for nothing phone (1).
glad to see them getting some spotlight
"A pity that they missed the opportunity to name it ""Nothing Special (1)""..."
Space-X of Mobile Industry !  Mark My Words !😎😎
Glyph is nice and all but I will surely use a case 🤷🏻‍♂️
It looks cool smartphone...
Anyone remember LG Lollipop?
6:24 loved the dig at OnePlus
Can be used as night lamp.
omg the last part😂😭
Funny - I love my Samsung S22 with 256 gigs- now I need 512 gigs or 1 Terabytes. I don't need LIGHTS also my phone case is amazing it pasted the 16 foot drop  test.
wallpaper plz
"tbh the most exiting thing about the phone is... well, the branding. NOTHING, name instantly stirs attention."
Looks very cyberpunk! I like.
Its an iPhone without a notch. That alone appeals to me. 😁
That phone looks sick omg 😳
I think they missed the opportunity to put custom colors into the leds… Just white lights seems kinda a waste of creativity of what you can do with the phone
Looks like something from tron
update years?? software wise?
It still looks like a normal phone with a clear case on it. Nothing thinks design alone will compete with the likes of Apple or Samsung 🤣
nice
"This is the type of phone I was expecting, not the generic iphone wannabe"
It's a Star Wars phone 😎
"spent the whole video talking about some lights on the back of the phone and that tells you everything you need to now. if you don't agree with me, read the title of the video again"
Literally just a knock off I phone
I have no idea what it costs but I would definitely buy that if u could!
"I am using an iPhone 12 and this phone is exactly look same from every side and display bezel and swipe gestures also.. looks same as iPhone
And it’s and personally i love iPhone 12 design and now this one.."
I think Carl Pei would be able to recognize the sarcasm at the end 😂
"It's cool looking reminds me a lil of the essential ph1, which I had and loved.. hopefully software is as good as the phone looks.."
Price?
cash or cheque!
This phone brand will most appeal to Oneplus users imo
"The customized led notification alert has been present in BlackBerrys since 2011, I believe. And the customized ring tone? That's so early 2000s."
Booooo 🤟🤟🤟
If I add phone case in the phone than its gonna block all those back design.
Giveaway⚡️🔝🔝
They copy-pasted an iPhone and added some features on the back. They could have come up with their own phone design (they had lots of time do it) but apparently all that time was spent just copying Apple's phone. Not impressed!
Hmmm.. interesting 🤔
Giveaway⚡️🔝🔝
"They did order 700k screen panels, I don't know how many phone they'll manage to sell"
"6:10 He is talking about OnePlus
TBH sad to see where OnePlus is heading!"
">punch hole 

Truly nothing"
Specifications?
Nice looking handset
Giveaway⚡️🔝🔝
"Now, it needs an RGB version!"
Let's do the wiggle wiggle
Giveaway⚡️🔝🔝
What's about the firmware??
"That last little dig for the OG OnePlus 1..... kind of a burn...? lol! But yeah, I still have my OP1."
"This guy always a step ahead when compared to other techies, dams marques... 🖖🏽"
"""until you made a broadly appealing phone but that feels like it abandoned your original fan base. Sounds Familiar?"" 🤣🤣🤣"
So translucent case or go without one since you’ll lose the glyph feature? The overall shape does remind me of an iPhone but kind of let down there’s only 2 cameras. Hopefully the software is dope.
"The led are just waste of battery
It's just a gimmick that everyone will feel good but will never use. Which type of a human keeps their phone screen faced down without a case? Is comprising scratches over quirky led worth your while when your phone screen can just turn on and vibrate. The design isn't all that worth talking about. It's just iPhone 12 with see through backglass that doesn't even show real parts. This phone isn't special for mass media."
Am using S21FE WHICH IS VERY GOOD... BUT NOTHING PHONE JUST TEMPTS ME ALOT....DESPERATELY WAITING FOR JULY 12TH
"Love it! I was just hoping they were going to put a headphone jack on it and an SD slot.  Breaking convention as they claimed, these two features would have definitely set it apart. Xperia is the best alternative to samsung and apple IMO for those looking for a headphone jack and sd slot."
"So the headphones were a fail, the launcher was boring, the reported specs are mid, and their revolutionary plan to get loyal iphone users to switch to android is adding light notifications to the back?"
"Well it's very sad how mindless influencers with connections to ""nothing"" praise and straight up repeat the advertising. 
You including marquess."
"Would be great to see this innovation move into the blockchain. Imagine an Ethereum, Cardona built smartphone for next generation tech...🤔"
"this look so clean, compared to chinese phone with 2mp garbage camera everywhere"
"its like kimkardashan jlo.....more than front...u see more of back.......so i can say j lo, kim kardashan  kick ass phone"
I'd get these over the OnePlus 10 Pro or the OnePlus 11 that coming cause OnePlus has settled
Nothing looks different !
"Yup, clear description of One Plus IMO"
I am more interested to know how much will it cost when the back glass is broken 😅
"04:00 Goodbye my ears 
(Was watching with headphones at 100% volume)"
"LOOKS Different

Just because of the transparency, besides that it has the same shape as every goddamn phone. It looks like your average Oppo, OnePlus, iPhone lookalike. Nothing new here"
പോളി സാനം
Omg definitely getting these now they need a laptop and a pad to design and I am so in !!!!
Put a case on it and it’s not but an iPhone just minus the notch
"""Sound familiar""
I literally cracked at this one xD"
"My rule on buying phone:
1. How much is it?
2. Is it best deal for my usage
3. How is the software in comparison with samsung"
Wow that's something from nothing!
I'm buying this as soon as it comes out
Carl pei oru killadi thanne🌚
It's really shaped like iPhone just like many cars on the road looking alike..🤣
6:35 I UNDERSTOOD THAT REFERENCE!
"Nokia 3220 had this LED lights in both side of the phone which also synchronize with music .. 
😜"
very cyberpunky
Will there be a black colour option?
"As far as worthless gimmicks go, this one takes the cake."
Screen size?
A dark Version of this with black led im down to buy it with my money that i dont have
It’s iPhone 12 without notch and with android which is frikin cool!
We have to wait and see...
"I like how he says ""I can only show the back of the phone..."" but at the beginning of the video he showed the front lock screen. 🤣"
RIP Oneplus 😭
"That last Oneplus reference was as true as mean Marques, clap clap clap."
They are defying the adage that you can’t get something from nothing.
"@TELEGRAM @Brownlee_Marques Yeah, not gonna fall for that. SCAMMER."
Nice iPhone
I mean why would I put my phone with screen facing downwards?
they can add inbuilt pinball game
"Been waiting for this. I know MKBHD is the 1st one who will show this!
DOPESICK PHONE 1! Add to cart! 🤑
Phone 1 will be my very 1st Android back up phone."
I like the design and would like to see a lot more. I love functionality in design
Always on Display: *Allow me to introduce myself...*
Oh yeah wiggle it a lil bit and scratch the screen
Target 201 Subscriber. Plzzzz help 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙂
I never place my phone face down 😬
Already became a fan. Is it come with notification slider?
"So we need to place the phone's touch screen down side to the surface to saw the light indications,Why these guy's doesn't even care about the touch screen. Most Weirdly who wants a LED show in their pockets 😂"
"how is this better than some sort of samsung-like edge lighting implementation, the screen is useless when these are visible"
This dope 🙌
I cant wait to buy it and put a case on it <3
കൊളല്ലോ 😃
Not allowed to show the front side features??
I want it !!! hope speakers screen and specs are good
This is like an android x iphone phone
If this had a headphone jack it would have been an instabuy for me (coming from a beaten up lg v50). Still considering it though!
🤔 that ending
"Yeah, no. It looks like an iPhone, runs Android, and a couple cheap gimmicks thrown in."
First look from the front of Nothing Phone 1. 👏👏👏
Need unlocked bootloader for custom OS. That's the easy feature that is not on enough phones.
"Teacher: you can't make a phone out of nothing.
Nothing:"
Nothing is a startup company that launches product at a high price tag.
It really looks like an iPhone but it is a very dope design 👌 I like it
Some unique deaign ....good nothing😘😍😍😍😍
Phone(stromtrooper) and earbuds(R2-D2) ..star wars era ?
Major shade on OnePlus there lol
Isn't it a transparent iPhone 12 ?
Im nothing to loose to buy nothing
"""I am only allowed to show you the back of the phone..""
2:21 ""👀👀👀👀"""
Those were some of the worst sounding ringtones I've ever heard.
"It even has the home bar to swipe up to go home, ring a bell?"
Back looks like an IPhone and the side looks like a Lumia 925 blended tgt
That's an iPhone.. they getting sued
"it's FAR from an iPhone, since when does Apple own a boxy phone design, they do not"
All that LED stuff could have been accomplished with some simple tweaking of the lockscreen interface and without risking any scratches on the screen. I seriously wish these unique phones actually start coming up with some unique and purposeful designs.
It doesn't have the popup camera.... Ugh...
Can't wait to see the dbrand skins for it lol
"So if someone just flips the phone over, the features are rendered useless? 😂"
"It's pretty average looking. Its just looking ""different"" and to me..different doesn't only mean wow."
Quick question? Who here puts their phone face down? I don’t because of the chance of it getting scratched and I like to be able to glance and seen notifications.
It seemes to me that this is going to be popular with alot of Tech fashion folk.
excited to see DBRAND cases for this phone :)
this a wired led telephone from the 90s lol
but seriously this phone is dope
Its prices should be under 500 dollars
r2d2 type of ringtone 💀
I'm guessing like we can have a back skin of black matte colour and having LED cutouts for that. That will look so dope😩
"Wow, I like it"
😱😱🤗🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️
I hope they have more innovative features in software than just the lightshow - for calling all other companies boring and implying that they've made some groundbreaking product.
"Thanks for sharing Marques, I think the back could be used for one more thing...that is it could act as an accessibility help. For people who have impaired hearing could benefit from it if the pattern informs them if its a personal call or a random sales call. Or just even the light will help to get some one's attention. I wish the whole back was filled with LEDs and it gave users choice to configure on how they want it to be. Hope no one reads my multi-million dollar idea and takes it from YT comment to R&D. Haha. Peace."
"So quirky, I love it"
Wow those ringtones are just atrocious sounding.
"punchhole, I've seen enough, it's dead to me. idc what else it does."
"This looks dope!  Is this running android, or it’s own OS?"
Nice phone maybe i can finally switch from my s10+
"6:20 - 6:33
**cough** 1+ **cough**"
"says: not allowed to show the front of the phone
: shows front side adjusting the back light"
"Wiggle your phone on a surface and don't mind scratching that screen, haha."
So nothing made nothing special
Price?
Where's the headphone jack? I'm not kidding when I say it's more of a seller to me than dope lights.
Remember the movie Oblivion? Looks like this is straight from that and I'm all for it! 🤌
thats just sick
Designs vs privacy. Privacy must win!
if it was from apple then marq would say ver nice phone
I hope it doesn't go the same path as 1plus phones
"Sounded familiar!
Oneplus be  like   : time has changed, now I am old ha ha ."
I would never keep my phone upside down just to see the notification light.
The phones on Watch Dogs
"The back light man, its dope as fuck."
there is a phone which is not made for mass and appeal different.... what they got for diff apeal...... led lights on back
When Luke Skywalker needs a phone
iphone 12 naked
Looks like they are compensating for other things that are missing. This first version is not gonna impress most.
Lol
A Cool Phone and An Even Cooler Video Set!
"Ending of the video...""cough"" ""cough"" OnePlus."
It's just a iphone! With Chinese agenda means privacy concerns.
First live video
How does it cost? NOTHING.
This one's actually unique and cool
So damn pretty to me
i would really love to see a dark verion of this phone
One plus rip
Sounds familiar? Oh OnePlus
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you❤
"Every 5-10 years, like clockwork, a Chinese company shows up and copies Apple to the hilt - adding enough gimmicks to make an illusion of not copying. They get some publicity and a following alright, but they don’t “steal” any customers from Apple. They get Android enthusiasts, whom they abandon after 5 years when the buzz is out."
"this looks so freaking cool, if it would be available in my country (probably won't) the visuals alone would convince me to grab one"
that finnal burn to oneplus users got me hard.
Never heard of this company before. Not really sure what’s differentiating them here apart from some flashing lights that could be integrated into a case?
"Innovate concept but it the back panel actually solving any problems?  I generally am not in a habit placing my facing down if I don’t have to (why do that to your display?) and the notification content that can be displayed on the front can be far more granular and immediately useful.  I’ll never remember which pattern is tied to which notification or caller. 

Also, what if you aren’t a fan of clear plastic cases, nearly all of which show you the grime trapped between the case and phone and all ultimately discolor and turn yellow. 

Again, some props for trying something different but this screams mostly gimmick to me."
idk wtf is the point of this tbh just look at yr front screen for notifications but its kinda cool thou but just quite useless in my opinion.
Still not for me because I like to buy the big brands like Samsung and Apple phones
"Ear One earphones sounded like shit, their products are obviously form over function."
At last he's gonna say rather buy an iPhone 12 because it's a safe bet and iOS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Android 😂
"If it becomes popular, it will shape back to general population of phone eventually.."
"Dear Nothing, you get my attention now👌"
That looks awesome!
so this is basically like oneplus all over again? cool
If it’s android I’ll pass. If it’s something new I want it
The best non-ios device YET!
and next day there are chinese back covers for this available on amazon
"To all those commenting on the great LEDs: How many of you leave your phone resting on the screen? How practical is the notification light going to be?
Unfortunately, this is just a gimmick and Nothing has nothing new to offer. Even those bezels seem huge compared to the Galaxy."
I hate every ring tone you just made me listen too.  🤮
"Don't care about Apple but as an Android user imma definitely buy this phone it's so sick !! And we know it's a mid range SD 700 series phone, all i care now is the cameras and i Hope they're good please Nothing!!"
"Man I really like what teenage engineering with the design, but Nothing seems so shady and unprofessional"
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyooooooooooooo
"Absolutely love the design, simple design of iPhone and different at same with while being Android!, And at front, even borders like iPhone but simple punch hole. 
They got everything exactly right."
Wow. Light is cool))) pretty
Where is the One Piece phone
Wow it really is NOTHING
I am liking it.
The LED idea is way cool 😎
It will be interesting to see the light changes to different colors
Ok let me check
"Pin hole is like a notch, a massive distraction when viewing content. The shape, buttons and so on are exactly the same as an iPhone 12 and 13, damn, even has the annoying iOS/iPadOS swipe bar at the bottom of the screen to get in the way of your lower content/controls/search fields. Just why can't people innovate in industrial design? The rear lights are cool, but the novelty will wear off. Way better to make a USEFUL phone like the Note series from Samsung with the S-Pen and perhaps add some mechanical controls for the camera like Sony do. Again, rear is cool, but, well, uhm, why not do it on the front using the screen? :)"
I hope in future they have like some dark colour pattern on back
"Honestly, at this point it’s the ecosystem that’s going to attract me to a phone more than the actual phone. It would be cool to try a new form factor but I’m in deep with apple. I imagine Samsung owners are in the same boat. 

I used to buy phones, root them, then flash a modified OS but that gets to be a lot of work. I really hope these sell because competition is good. But I’m doubting it."
Pretty impressive you got it on your hands 🔥🔥🔥👍🏿👍🏿
Looks great if you asked me .
In a nutshell use this phone only for notifications purpose
"Throwing shade at oneplus towards the end, love it >:)"
Nothing really new.. A bunch of gimmicks that no one will shell out a flagship price for.
They  already gave it to you . You  crazy mf .
You liked it so RIP pricing 🥲
6:32 One +?
So you made whole video on backlight.
it's ok but .. I won't buy a white phone
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you❤🎊
I feel like Nothing will probs take the same route as OnePlus
That doesn’t look any different besides the lights are nice I like it!
3:37 was it just me or he just showed the entire phone?
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you
Sounds like OnePlus
New feature: 10 ringtones.
This will bomb like their earbuds.
OnePlus goes oof on the last part of the video
The ring tones are dope
"Still on my OnePlus 7 pro. Probably the last best OnePlus phone, and I believe in Carl Pei. So probably gonna get this Nothing phone or wait for the Pixel 7"
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦
If gimmicks are it's forte then doom is it's future.
Nothing phone looks like an iPhone 12 which has its back glass removed
imagine a case from nothing for the nothing phone made out of nothing which gives nothing in terms of protection
Hmm that looks very interesting!
Definitely just looks like an iPhone ripoff with a clear back. I guess they could do worse than copy apple.
Now this is what I need
"4:02 
*Imagine an American student having that ringtone and it rings in the class!!!*"
"The phone has a good design. Kind of gives a futuristic & space kind of vibe. Nowadays, companies have stopped giving those notification leds, but they have taken that thing to an another level."
A Matte black edition of this with red LEDs would be sweet
Apart from look/ design aesthetics .... it’s interaction is gonna be the key factor
Do you want a Android device that looks like an Iphone? Do i have the product for you
"this gonna be anouther OnePlus, just wait couple of years till they create their own Android skin and then BBK would takeover again."
I'm so annoyed they've put a hole punch in it. Was am insta-buy without that. Pixel 2XL will continue on I guess
We don’t really need more phones 🤷🏽‍♂️
Shit dope…
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦
"6:20 as a previous oneplus 1 and current oneplus 6t owner, this hurts"
"Wait, there is a league of legends phone? Since when?"
Even more appealing then even more appealing then finally form a new company with new weird name and weird product..........Man Thats A Cycle Now🙏🏻
"If these color yellow, it will be sick cyberpunk theme 👍"
nice bro
the only phone I wouldn't put a case on
"I KINDA WANNA BUY THIS
i never trust phones that are not huge that huge among everyone. But this-"
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦
Looks iPhone😁
"Those are some goofy ahh ringtones
🤣 







Other than that though, this phone is interesting and I want to see the UI…"
"A refresh of the OnePlus Oppo brand. Essentially they are re-doing the entire concept of Carl Pei's OnePlus brand. Interesting for sure, but also kind of just gimmicky."
The a roll in this video is excellent
Can anyone confirm the refresh rate ? Looking forward to switch from Oneplus 8T
@Telegram👉Officialmaxtech oh really what is it ? Nothing Phone 1 ?? 😂😂😂😂
I like this phone already
The future of apples has been stolen 😋
NO
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦✅
why does It look so much like an iphone 12
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦✅
Very nice i like it ! this is even better than iphone or folded samsung ! i want this !
4:03 ah... Perry the platypus
"why not just have some kind of low power, low res screen on the back?"
Of course if back cases are released it would have cutouts or transperant sections for the leds.
Coolest shit i've seen this year
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦✅
The front side looks like IPhone + Samsung. Nothing phone give what apple could not give us.
This looks very cool
Why does Marques look like a deepfake 💀
"As eager as I am to get my hands on this thing... The box shape concerns me with the in-hand feel. Unless it's narrower than the iPhone, which, in my case, digs into the side of the palm."
Does it have a headphone jack?
This design stole my heart and brain too. Best looking smartphone IMO.🔥🔥🔥😍
"I loved the back design for me way better than my iPhone 13, I would switch right away for that feature but the IOS is so good, that is what stops me  from switching to an other device I’m way into the Apple ecosystem 😅"
so basically its dropping on my birthday
"The Gliff reminds me of the film ""BLADE""."
Next day i am am gonna buy a cheap 12$ case and put it on the phone Covering all those lights 😂😂
a flashing recording indicator is NOT a pro lmao. I'm tryna be slick over here
"was expecting more, not sure how useful the clear back and random backlight shapes will be when most people use a case"
looks like a gaming phone without the shoulder triggers
I really thought it's an Iphone case
@Telegram👉Officialmaxtech ohhh really!!!?
ooo i want this. first ever smartphone I've been excited for - I have a pixel 3a right now.
It looks pretty cool. But it really depends on the cost really
My man has a held a grudge against the one Plus company....
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦✅
In the end you mean OnePlus :) sound familiar?
👆👆Congratulations I got a surprise for you📦✅
if I were an android user I would definitely buy it
"Aliens phone! Looks naked but cool at the same time, I like it."
"Nothing, Impressive!"
The only thing is that the flashing lights might trigger my friends seizures
Is this design also made to change and fix specific parts in the phone? Kind of like Fairephone is doing. The clear back gives me this vibe...
what kind of phone is this
I want one 😭
"Silly inquiry, is this going to be a Telephone ☎️ phone “phone” 📱?? Or is it, the upgrade of that rectangle plastic “fake phone” for people whom are obsessed with not looking at their cell phone every damn second…."
The  old much music phones had crazy light patterns for ring and text.
What software will it be running
"Nobody talking about how all he can talk about is the back of the phone which tells me that at least in its current state, thats the only thing that is acceptable quality."
A black version would look sick! I hope it has a good chipset battery life and camera's otherwise i would be really disappointed ☹️
"I was like, yeaaah I'm gonna buy this phone, then I see the front and I'm like hell no, idk why but I absolutely hate it when the holepunch is on the left, maybe that's cuz I'm right-handed but it has to either on the right side or in the center, on the left just looks wrong"
6:32 mins sounds familiar..... One plus
why it gave me Death Stranding vibe??
Everyone here is talking about the phone while I'm here wondering who MKBHD threw shade at near the end of the video 😉
"The nothing ear (1), also quite familiar. Hmm... 🤔🤨"
An Alien Phone 💯
"basically its a tron themed phone, its unique but pointless, always on displays are cheaper and more battery efficient"
Pismo?
"I kinda feel like upgrading to this phone, but i feel like it's wasting my money. Oh well, pay my debts first"
Hoping Nothing is able to turn this into something great
Uhggh can't wait for Processor reveal 🙂
"lol
-puts a case on-"
Symmetrical bazels!!
"Nice, unique phone. It would be best if the front camera would be positioned at the centre."
Lmao that throwing shades at Oneplus tho
I almost thought that phone didn't came with screen
Nothing but a hype brand we won‘t remember in a few years from now.
This looks awesome. If the software is good this will be my next phone.
Can't afford to buy but review is my innocent mind 🥺
"If Nothing phone has specs relative to a Pixel A phone line+ expandable memory

They'd be compelling to me.  That back light panel is really neat & something to aid in low light on the go videography"
Just dope
This is going to be the Morbius of phones mark my words.
"i have just one word-WOAH!!........................to describe the ""Design"" of this-i hope the price is considerable and that's what is expected from nothing if we take a look back at the pricing of the nothing ear (1)'s"
"As you said, Does the backlight LED effects really match the competition? We have phones which offer in display led notifications with different colour patterns for which we need not even turn the phone upside down!! And often it’s risky to keep the phone screen upside down as it may be prone to scratches or may even slip from hands and end up cracking the display."
Feel the power of nothing 💪
this phone looks fucking sick
I will definitel buy one when comes out
"Ceo said ""rest of the industry is stagnant,while we are the only one innovating"".  End product --Just light on the back. Just shit.
They just hired Marcus to plant the thought of ""we are different"" in our minds."
Original fan base (OnePlus) 👀
Don't be disappointed when they become like OnePlus.
"apple after watching this : "" its just nothing"""
Straight outta Star Wars
Taunting OnePlus in last few moments was too good 😂😂🤌
Looks cool. Like the concept.
Looks like a prototype.
no one going to use it without a case or a transparent one 😅😅
"If app optimization and the processor are good it will be an instant selling point of this phone, combined with a good ecosystem as they claim."
"Honestly a pretty cool concept, but my main takeaway from this video was that Nothing has some pretty sexy ringtones"
Back looks like Temple festival decoration in our country 😂😂
Marques is genius showing us reverse wireless charging some specs in front and many more
"Oh I see. Come up with a dope idea in design no one has thought of.  Say you are ""taking on Apple"" to invite their scrutiny.  Get bought up by Apple for your new approach.  Laugh all the way to the bank."
"Way too similar to an iPhone in a generalised shape. That LED light array is a really annoying gimmick. Who puts their phonescreen down? Who wants to wiggle their phone while it is screen down?
I wonder did Nothing put any thought into people with photosensitive epilepsy with that LED array?
These are just my opinions and I really wish Nothing the best and I hope they do well"
"around 300$ it ja good deal, otherwise waste"
"Smart phone indeed. 
Even if the Camera is Pixel Level, and the performance is OnePlus level. Other areas can affect customers, like the availability of replacement parts, especially the screen if it needs a repair, and the availability of accessories like cases and screen protection."
Awesome mobile
Love the way Marques taunted OnePlus
The ringtone light and sound pattern reminded me of the light scene in the movie close encounters of the third kind.
who looks at the back of the phone all the time? and why such a weird pattern of lights?
iPhone with dbrand skin on the back
Sound familiar?.....coff coff oneplus coff coff
When Marquez can't even show you the UI or talk specs you know we got a problem
"Cool design but after breaking a few phones without cases, now I learned my lesson and wearing a thick af case 😂"
"Back led is such Useless function honestly, interesting tho"
The way I had been waiting for this review…This phone looks dope🔥🔥
Looks like a toy.
"""I am only allowed to show the back of the phone""
*proceeds to show the front aswell*
2:24"
"Someone: CyberPunk style phone design.
Nothing ceo: u r hired!"
If this comes for 25000 rupees in India i am buying blindly
"pretty lights to distract me from the data theft and what about a case/ real world protection? ill stick with my apple. 
now a data policy that says when you buy the product you buy the storage space so its your data all the time we just file it and therefore you maintain your 4a rights(well with all the data sales more like soft privilege)... now that might be able to open my wallet."
⚠️JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON. BELIEVE IN HIM. JESUS CHRIST IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN⚠️
Damn!!!!
"Honestly, the things that would convince me the most to get a phone like this would be the Long Term Support of the product, and the cases that will be available.  

Firstly, I won't be purchasing a phone if software updates last only a couple of years, as I upgrade my phone once every 3-6 years depending on if the phone gets damaged or not.

Secondly, the phone is useless as it is if it doesn't have a case that shows the included features...  I'm not going to drop 1K+ on a phone and not have protection for it.  I like the slim look of many modern phones, but I don't see it unless I'm cleaning the case of any dust and such."
He is very excited and enthused about the phone but also doubts the ...like what happened to OnePlus
I feel Nothing 😁
Obviously needs RGB. Hopefully won't be a 2.0 or premium feature.
"I don't care about the design. I'm OK with it if Nothing can provide that Customer Satisfaction. 
I won't compare it to OnePlus or Apple. It's rather a startup atleast trying to be innovative in some way (Not by saving the environment 😂)."
Wait this an I phone ?
"Oh hey, that sounds like Oneplus.
Oh wait, it was always Oneplus... hmm"
This is just going to turn into another version of OnePlus
That was a dig at oneplus right?
The ringtone part is so sick!!
Dig on one plus is smooth !
Why not RGB?
This will have the same sells as the Sony. Let’s see how that goes.
"So, fancy lights?

Meh..."
Challenging on design and competing with Giant is insane. Can’t win a battle if only had a good armour. Software is the key. I think they knew this.
If the Phone get a transparent black colour and the notification lights in red ♥️ this phone can change the market for sure and it will be dope 💥🔥
Seems useless to me...
The only reviewer who actually has the smartphone in hand and not a click bait.
the design looks like half baked product
I totally had thought it was just a modified iPhone
Full details review
Thats an ad.
That's cool and all but what sort of maniac puts their phone down with the screen down?!
WOW interesting video as always Marques!
The led back is really pushing the envelope on overdoing trying to be different. If I want notifications I turn it screen facing up BUT if I want my phone not to be a distraction - I'll turn the screen down. This totally ruins it
"It surely looks unique and good ,but since it's first phone from nothing ,they really have to make it great at performance, software and photography, to actually sell it... Poco f1 looked bad but it was a huge success because it was a powerhouse of a phone. Hope nothing can pull that out too."
"it's a glass slab, now with led lights ! 
, it is bretty cool tho, probably has to have a big battery because everyone buying the phone will have probably baught it just for the led lights."
The Phone has lights! that's it.
I want it
Oh man the battery!
What about the software tour??? 🤨
I love it already
iPhone.
"Man I love the back of that phone, we need more of that on these new phones. I miss the notification led"
😍😍
Can we talk about the elephant in the room? What about when you put a case on this?
OnePlus left the chat 😂
Alian phone
"I guess a better use case for the Glyph Interface would be to assign a light pattern to contact groups, like Work, Family, Friends etc along with specific contacts, also I hope they make this open source or atleast give an option for users to create their own patterns."
"Just two cameras in 2022? Good luck with that! This is so full of fail, the name is stupendous too, reminds me of no phone, which is just a plastic slab."
iPhone look a like.
Yes sounds familiar to 1plus am I right or wrong they had lost fan base because of appealing to broader
I don't kw about people but fooking buying it!!
You can just flip the phone and see the screen to see the actual notifications without the need for lights
Those lights are for kids. Gimmicks.
"Seems like most people are impressed in the comments, but to be honest those LED flashing lights strike me as more annoying than anything. Like for me, that’s a downside than a selling point, but we’ll see if it catches on."
"If you want to see your notifications there is the always on display feature, much better than a few LED. If my phone is facing down it means I do not want to be bothered.
The phone looks nice but I find the LED on the back completely useless... At least they look cool."
That dig at OnePlus at the end 😂
I would buy it. Depends on the price.
Very happy now but It would have been great if you would've said more about phone 1
Trolling OnePlus!.... Hahahaha 🤣
Mkbhd rocks
"An iPhone with android, thats nice!"
Sounds familiar ? haahaaahaaaaaah✨
"Looks cool, but how about you put down your phone screen up, and use always on display?"
"Sooo Marques I saw u at the airport last to last Tuesday when u we’re going to Newark, and surprisingly, u were in the same flight as me, and I saw u when we were boarding. U were right in front of me!! I was that kid that was behind u with my little brother and my mom."
Yeah sounds a lot like 1+😏
"I love the flat screen and led for notifications, but if this phone will come with permanently locked bootloader and some low end CPU, i wont buy it.  I need a phone than can be really mine, so i can root it and remove all the things i don't need, just like the current oneplus 9pro, 5min job to unlock/root/adblock"
oneplus gene.. hope there wont be any mutation...
"OnePlus fans crying in the corner after Marques' ""sounds familiar?"""
The screen resolution is 1080p/395~408ppi 😂 oh shitt!!!
I'm I the only one seeing the LEDs shaped like a fat cat with the cameras acting as the eyes....
"6:32 , yeah this ""ONE"" sounds very familiar 😂😂"
"its would be great
If this LED would supoort RGB 
I wish they added this 
It would be totally dope, 
But it will not possible now😢🙂"
It's the coolest Android phone till date
"Seems like a gimmick. I always use a case, and prefer a better camera.. not for me."
This phone looks awesome
Beginning of TwoPlus…
Depending on the cost im thinking of buying it
I WANT THAT SHIRTTT!!!!
My old Nokia phone the screen was synced to flash with ringtone
"okay i might be getting this wrong but didnt marques say he's allowed to show the back of the phone only? but there are clear frames showcasing the screen of the phone with the punchhole on the top left of the screen?
and i by the looks of it, this might be running a good old stock android?? (the notification bar and navigation bar)

huh, i dont wanna be that guy, but hey that's just subtle extra info for us??"
"Great for people that like light shows and is unique to customize to callers.  One wonders how all the ""show"" will effect battery life which goes to battery size and if has fast charger with the phone or fast wireless charging.  Other issue with many phones that tempt from companies is if they are compatible with all the bands of one's cellular carrier.  Variety is great to see nevertheless."
Meh....most people will just cover this with a case.
Wiggling the phone for the charging indicator will definitely scratch your screen if there's dust or whatever under it.
If it has a stock android. I am down pixels have sucked lately.
holy shit it looks clean af
That OnePlus hint in the end tho
JUst take my money.
I wonder what phone cases would look like on this phone..
Mkbhd having a mental breakdown about dull phone designs is very funny for some reason
"As a former OnePlus man, I really got hit hard by your ending. Man, I miss them."
Interest piqued.  Can't wait to see reviews around mid July.
@6:31 referring to OnePlus?
If OnePlus and Apple had a child
"Hint from MKBHD: ""it's super different"" 
Meaning there's more cool features, it just that MKBHD can't share it yet.😆 im very curious about its processor. Can't wait for your full review!"
@Falcon 3:16 bruh
I heard it's SD 7 gen 1 .... New midrange from Qualcomm..
Hope camera stability beat iPhone 🙂
My old Nokia phone the screen was synced to flash with ringtone
"First impressions: it's a phone that's based it's marketing around what I would call a gimmick. Don't get me wrong it looks cool but it looks like just a phone with LED lights on its back. Furthermore, usually when someone puts their phone facing down its usually so they don't get distracted or disturbed. Lastly it does not make sense that most features are based on the back, a place where people interact with the least."
This phone is giving me gimmick phone vibes like the 3D and first gen bendable display phones.
Marques is clevery mention that this phone as similar story with one plus that finally abandoned the value that makes people love them.. you can die as hero or you live long enough to see yourself become a villain.. so true😁👍🏻
"The LED idea and design is way cool, but I don't trust myself enough to not have a case on my phone lol"
Bro the case is transparent
"- Motorola edge 30 comes with same 778G+, 33w wired charger.
6 gb / 128 gb - Rs 28,000.
- if you have low light in your office / home, then  ""Nothing 1""  smartphone's back Led lights will be useful.
This is something new by Carl Pei, the Co-founder of OnePlus, the flagship killer. 🤔 😀😀"
I'm an investor and they have made special back cover  for it ! You will see the phone once it's available. The phone was created with that in mind and ex Dyson Head of designs made sure it looks great
and also how much battery it is gonna suck?
"Do you think anyone will cover that phone back..non transparent cover, Transparent case exist bro 🥱"
Anyone got the Oneplus reference?
"I dont get why they basically revealed the phone already ... of course they want to create hype, but there will be nothing left to show on the final reveal ... Its like hey this is our new phone 1 and the crowd goes boooh we already know, BECAUSE YOU ALREADY TEASED IS FOR 5 MONTHS STRAIGHT. Why not come out with big boom without teasing too much?"
"Wait, but you just have shown front of it as well 2:26"
"Finally! A genuine competitor in the Smartphone market. From the perspective of buyer, Smartphones have been changing 0.1% of it every year in the last 4-5 years. I think a genuine competitor will increase this number in the future."
Main issue with such startups that they became oneplus. First releases are cool but then just regular low-mid chinaphone.
I know you will review this Nothing phone. 😏
Loved that ending
"If back glass is only sticking in borders 
Then back glass gona shatter"
I'll keep this in the pocket with my Fire Phone.
"the phone looks amazing. all thats left is software, battery life + charging speed, cameras, specs and price. especially the price..... because we have a history woth flagship killers becoming the flagship.."
Finally something different😍🎉….reminds me of my first camera phone the Nokia 3220😃
I really hope they take the right steps to grow their company. I would hate to see them fail and disappear into nothing.
It’s cool and all… but it’s nothing that I can’t live without 😆
"too bad it costs $1,698"
If it ends like that Essential phone you reviewed long time ago then this story doesn't have a happy ending.
the idea is super cool. but completely useless.
Awesome 💚
Looks like a really cool phone. Just hope that the processor and OS don't lag over time like the regular mid-range android phones.
"Helo
A72  or Iphone 12  
What do you think ??"
That’s literally a iphone with a see through class💀
"that light thing has already been done 10 years ago by Nokia 3220. it had lights which danced with ringtones. and by by phone cases... with those lights at the back, you won't be able to use cheap bac cases."
"How much ,"
"Man i really wish there will be a matte black with yellow led variant. It will literally be my dream phone. Still skeptical about specs and price. If they are fair about that, I will sure buy it"
"I'm for sure buying one. Looks unique, symmetrical bezels, and cool features. Easy buy."
You can flip and check your phone's battery btw
"I love it, and would definitely buy it"
"Welp this is deffo not for people who use phone cases, unless you use those crappy transparent acrylic ones."
I noticed the yellow cable whether it's the charging cable of nothing as red in oneplus
"It looks good on the outside, we'll see on the inside how it is."
One Plus about to have a heart attack in the indian market. 🤣🤣🤣
We don't want looks tbh we want performance at reasonable price!
Are icons packs / themes safe to install (on iPhone)? Which is best in your opinion?
6:30
does anyone know if nothin is coming to the US?
Oneplus got burned at the end!
"Honestly the phone itself from the shape is an iPhone with the rounded corners and flat sides. Front isn't anything different and the camera setup looks like what the iPhone 11 pro or whatever looked like.
So the back can light up, just another thing that can break faster or have an issue...I'm not even remotely interested in this company because it reeks of typically Silicon Valley startup culture of trying to hype, build quick market share and then deliver a mediocre product and vanish soon after."
Alien 👽 Phone 🔥
Some one giving reference to one plus i think nothing will become new one plus beacuse one plus now become oppo phones that is bad 😞
Broadly Appealing!
"Kinda bummed by the screen as i expected the punch hole to be in the middle, this might even make me pass on it altogether. But somehow if i get over it, I'd go for it only if they focus on security and gaurantee atleast 4 android version updates. I know it's kind of a big thing to expect, but it's their only phone and lets not act like it is a small company which lacks funding."
Am I the only one who remembered that he wasn't allowed to show the front of the phone? Am I missing something?
I am really digging the design.
"Same here, Mirror’s Edge vibes. Love the white cyberpunk look."
I feel like It's Nothing special
You already know apple is tryng to copy this phone and make it damn sure that it will be hard to repair and will cost an ungodly amount.
So does Apple.
"Damn, this looks cool. I always liked the iphone square design which this has, but Im an android fan."
"if it has the following
1. wide angle camera
2. ip68
3. dual sim and nfc
4. decent battary with 25w charging
5. atleast 90hz amoled
then yah happy to pay $1000 for it."
if they add as much customisation as i hope they will i will become a nothing loyalist
CRAZY!
honestly looks very nice love the flat screen and squared edges.Potential for my favorite looking android
Sorry Nothing is not for me. Glyph Interface is just a gimmick. A screen can do just exactly what it intends to do. What point in all seriousness?
Nope.
"Okay, so where is it?"
"""Sounds Familiar?""😂👍"
shots at one plus
"When he said I can only show you the back of the for *throws hands up* Me: Wooooo big whoop/ Me: ""sees all what it does"" *jaw drop*"
how do they keep getting away with ripping off apple design?
Those sarcasm for one plus 💀
At 4:03 it was platypus Perry 🤣
Nothing phone 1 looks totally DOPE.
I need a new phone but don't know what to buy. I want micro SD slot with latest snapdragon and a high refresh rate... but nothing has those 3 things.
Imagine recording videos in public 💀
"Nothing: hey Apple, can I copy your phone design
Apple: yea just make sure it doesn’t look so obvious
Nothing: gotcha…"
Keren ancrit
I've been waiting for this one
If they provide us smth like OP3 and 3T in today's standards - I'm OK with that. If they just gonna bait us with lights - not 80s anymore!
:):
"kinda meh, essential phone was more exciting for sure."
I thought you said 🤔 you could NOT show the front of the phone I'm so confused right now 😐
Looks really cool
It's really sad that only new companies are trying new stuff... Cause yeah I would love that back panel... But on my Samsung Note 9.
I am excited about the camera performance!
"1St phone like this 
🔥
🤩 i am just amazed"
"Nothing has refined what Dope Tech means from smartphone view! This being the first phone from Nothing, i am EXCITED to see where Carl is heading with the company. Especially, when he has now free hands and UI knowledge!"
"if the software of this phone is really good, then I am absolutely getting one. I really hope I am not disappointed"
@Fantasytky 😂please no
Then prepared to get disappointed
"""I'm only allowed to show you the back of the phone""... *Proceeds to go into the notification led settings showing the front*"
I use case for my phone.. I guess without transparent case those LED will be nothing useful! Hopefully it won't put s dent on battery!
🔥
"6:32 Carl Pei co-founded OnePlus.... But now as OnePlus isn't 'OnePlus' anymore,
So here with this Nothing Phone we can hope Carl Pei can bring little bit of the OG OnePlus level shit back in the game."
"I feel it's just a phone with some LED on the back. Like LED on back of  ROG lap. 
But anyway it's cool 😎"
I get that you don't want to be the last tech cannel covering something but didnt MKBHD make a huge stink about embargo and marketing phones as an extended advertiser. Hes literally just a part of the hype machine now to help them sell their crappy phone on stockX
also this iphone clone sucks.
"if it works as smooth and good as a pixel, I'm interested"
You also showed the front of the phone. As long as is has tiny punch hole and a good camera in back I am down for getting it.
BUT people wants a good camera and a good performing phone.
Brilliant phone. Horrid ringtones!
.... or you could just place the phone with the screen NOT touching the table and just see who's calling you while on mute...
Seams ideal for people I do not care to know...
I feel like that a phone from Star Wars
what is the size of this phone ? i hope ~6 and not bigger
"At first I thought that they have interesting features but kinda meh, until i saw they collaboration skins…..oh my…."
Not something that reinvents the industry as they promised. It's just an Android phone with some gimmiky. Looks cool although it's not that much impressive. I got more excited for the Ear (1) than that.
"Pretty cool,"
"TLDW: Cool phone bruh, hope you don't become the next OnePlus!"
I guess the “nothing” stands for how much battery you will have left after those led’s go off all day with your notifications.
"""Sounds familiar"" 🤣 OnePlus silently watching this 😝"
The OnePlus reference was spot on.
Cheeky OnePlus callout at the end 😂
this phone is just the fantasy for Indian technical YouTubers... hope they get it by August
Actually a cool concept. Notification LEDs are super nice to have.
"My phone has these light patterns as well, allowing me to see who's calling. It even is customisable with a light pattern that matches their faces, called a photograph. And then the other light patterns write their name. ON THE FRONT."
"The idea of such back LED indication is dope, but the implementation is really weird. It looks really messy with all that entrails stuff under the transparent cover. The image the LEDs form doesn't look iconic or even stylish, hence it can't become a popular trend. Some balanced and appealing pattern would be more appreciated. And the entire iPhone-ish design also doesn't get additional points for the product."
Meh. It’s nothing.
Processor?
they are not allowed to test camera and hardware
nothing 2 c here 😀
So many features on the phone face down where ppl are so used to putting their phone face up on the table now.. not sure how appealing it will be in the long run..
"Well, as an iOS user and Apple fan I have to say that this is probably the only Android phone I really would like to use at least for some time.
It is very clear for me that this design is heavily inspired by Apple, yet, it distinct enough to actually earn my attention.
All other phone look like a toy to me, but this one is a real product."
More ways to get notifications from my phone is definitely something I don’t want so not for me. Still looks cool tho
"I always missed led feature on the front when this no bezel smartphone era begin.
But seems like this is the most perfect alternative to that."
"Problem with this one I see is that *hopefully* nobody puts their phone down on it's screen without a case as that'd make the screen full of scratches in no time, but a case would also cover the cool back..."
true it was satisfying to know many details even when screen is off
6:09 he just secretly roasted the shit out of one plus😂
"It's a little bit ""different"" but they're not bringing anything that's changing the game, but the ring tone thing is kinda neat and who doesn't like transparent phones? I imagine theirs some people don't but more probably do than don't but is it enough to make a little money? Who knows, the phone market is a tough one, but I'd buy it if it was priced 500 or lower, so yeah, I don't see one in my future🤣😂"
"that back so UGLY I'm anyway gonna put a case if I ever buy it, so that defeats 80% purpose of this video"
"Seems unique, however having a weak torch may kill it for me"
Oneplus finally stepping in the right direction
Cant wait for the Black Edition
"I'm already impressed, that's enough...wow, like wow 😲😲"
എൻ്റെ മാക്രി അണ്ണാ
whole time of video it was about back of phone 😂
it looks like a counterfeit iPhone. lol...
Love the ring tones and light options.
ooo preety cool phone i wud buy if the price is right
Didn’t you show the front at 2:25 despite saying you cannot?
"It's gonna adapt the Snapdragon 7gen 1 , I'm outta here"
dang the dig at oneplus at the end oof
Pricing???
Bring back the transparent plastic of the 90s!!!
Looking forward to it
nothing phone 1 would really look dope in black colour!!
iPhone 12 with pixel 5 screen
Please don't suck!
"Yes, sounds familiar 6:32
MKBHD😁
1+ 😄"
1+ 🥺
@orange vs apple OnePlus
What was he referring to
Oneplus😩😩
Okay I have a Question.. what if the transparent back glass turns yellow after few months??? Similar to the case scenario too?
That's some real cool shit right there..!
You can tell who is calling just by memorizing the pattern and looking at the back of the phone…how about i look at the front and see their name?
"What operating system?
Android or IOS???"
Will it become you know yellow ... Like clear case
"Thats so cool ,phones gonna be awesome"
Of course Nothing Phone [1] will see a super dope sale in my opinion
"I dunno. Most notifications I get, the phone is either in hand, face up, or in my pocket. They're really leaning into people who have their phone face down at all times"
The strategy is similar to what OnePlus started with. It's good that they only inspired the back of the phone with the iPhone. It would have been sad if they would have put in the big notch on the front. Can't imagine an Android phone with a big notch in 2022 😂
"Who puts their phone screen-down?
Light patterns are cool and all and can pass different kind of messages depending on how they flash in whatever patterns but this really is nothing but a gimmick.
What easily beats it is the actual phone's screen.
It can fit a lot more information in the same space.
Do you want to know who's calling you? Look at the screen.
Do you want to know the battery charging progress? Look at the screen.
The only real advantage of the lights on the back is for use with the camera."
I feel like i would get bullies for having this phone
Many of the customers (including me) use back covers those are not transperant ☹️☹️ I think the LED feature might be not of much use in that case🥺🥺.
looks like iPhone 12 transparent edition!
"My phone doesn't wiggle wiggle, it glows"
*The next replacement for my OnePlus Nord!!!*
This looks so cool
"So much fake hype on these comments session. All fake hype by these people in the end they buying the same phone like Samsung, iPhone and xiaomi over and over again."
"If it costs similar to the a53 and has snapdragon 7 gen 1, as per rumors, I am gonna cry and how good this is"
"MKBHD: Im only allowed to show you the back of the phone
Also MKBHD: shows the front 2 minutes later"
Nokia back then was a head of time
"As long as the cameras are decent, the battery life last 5 hours of SOT Minimum, and the phone feels sturdy enough to not need a case, I'll buy it. I like unique features on smart phones and this one is no exception"
iPhone 12 with a Pixel 5 holepunch?
It should probably have an ultrawide camwith autofocus for macro and the accesnt led could light up the subject pretty good.
"No chin on the bottom. Wow, finally other than apple and samsung"
I thought it was a iPhone with a cool case😅😂
"No information on processor, OSor display  ?? Why Marques"
"""Only thing I'M ALLOWED to show you"""
"Cool, the lights around the camera module would make pictures better than the standard flash, other companies should take notes"
I have a OnePlus 7 pro and have been looking to see what this looks like before getting a new phone. This makes me want it more
And 85% of people will put a case on it.
Naaah for me
"Um, it should COME with a clear case so Nothing can better market the phone.
If a bunch of people just cover up the lights with a normal case than Nothing loses out huge marketing potential."
RIP OnePlus One
Really like the recording indicator! Should be standard for phones to let people know when they are recorded
I think don't push phones companies that are one day gonna be like oneplus
I have NOTHING to say
Lol the subs at 1+
"6:08 he's talking about OnePlus , right ?"
Yep haha.
"I think its great. No way I can justify spending that much on another phone, but I'll definitely keep an eye out in a couple years and get my hands on a used scratched up one."
Woww i waan
"The back is cute and all, but #1 I don't ever lay my phone face down and #2, I always run with a case.  I know it's the first iteration of their phone, but this seems a little more on the gimmicky side."
If we use case then from back it looks like IPHONE 12🧐🧐🧐
Ram and Processor details?
"In the Android world, if you don't adopt a close-to-native UI interface you simply fail as a company."
I’d like a black version of this.
"i hope it lives up to the hype its getting. Nothing was founded by Carl Pei who was also the co founder of Oneplus. He left Oneplus and started ""Nothing""."
I keep confusion the name with the no phone
"I am actually appalled by the clear copy of the iPhone 12 and up that this phone has! The aluminium frame has the same finish, the display has the same borders, Even the home button UI element is the same size and shape. This is honestly disgusting to see."
def sounds familiar 😂 [6:32]
so finally we got a phone for Hearing Impaired people exclusively...
I phone + one plus ka mix-up 😂👌
"Literally Useless.
but, thanks for covering it!"
Enthusiast brands will betray you.....
Then this is a tron phone?
I must say! I really appreciate subscriber click animations with up to date subsciber counts
"But honestly I've never seen a person who puts their phone screen down/back side up and an always on display in the front would give the user more options and customisability over these gimmicky LEDs.Unless it has a really great camera and the LEDs get bright enough for vlogging, this doesn't make any sense. Besides, I don't want my phone flashing bright lights when I'm asleep."
"Really excited for this phone. It's different. But not at the same time, it's almost as it's... Nothing"
*I just wanna know how Marques T shirts always all seem SO CRISPY & BRAND NEW year after year. . He cant wear those shirts more than once on camera?*
Catch you guys  in the next one... ✌️
"That lighting is so sick. I haven't seen a better implementation of notification lighting since my Sony Ericcson W580i, and I've missed it ever since."
I do like this design. I just hope the software will be just as awsome.
Like my first nokia 3310 with transparent full case? I can customized the light. It gets me really excited at that time. 2005 to be exact
Damn...
Looks like a phone from Oblivion
This phone will appeal to people who have KTM Duke motorcycle.
Nothing has built a phone
Spending money for this kidding lights Lol😆😆
"when you mentioned about the broadly appealing strategy, thats what samsung did. i have been using 4-5 generations of galaxy notes and i have to say, samsung screwed it up. from cancelling the note serious entirely and rebrand it under the galaxy S series is just weak. and they took away the charging brick and the memory card slot for all the new phones. not only samsung did it, but other android phone makers as well. it really pains to see when most android users used android phones because we wanted more customizable features and things that iphones doesnt give you directly, and now the vast majority of new android phones are basically ripped off apple's marketing strategy. if this nothing phone builds up completely from what android phones were in the first place - being different, they can have my money any time of the day."
This is pretty interesting. I’m looking forward to the review. It’s got my attention so far
That ending
This phone is actually kinda cool lol
"its one of the most ""enthusiastic"" phone"
"The design is pretty nice. But my Ear (1) broke after one Year, so I will pass it."
"Wow this looks really fresh..don't know why people are complaining that its design is similar to apple, there is nothing wrong in taking good features from your competitors and implement it with some different and unique features...even Apple may have taken so many ideas and features from Android and other brands  but does that mean it's copying others. Really hope  Nothing have nailed all other important  features or else the hype will not be worth it!"
Naruto :o They should make a pair of Sharingan or Rinnegan eyes around the rear bottom cameras :D
4:15 App UI better than the actual phone back
I thought it was the new iPhone.
the wireless charging LED and the top right LED forms a minimalistic Apple Logo HAHHAHAHAHAHAHA pretty sure thats intended.
Love the one plus jabs
Have phone innovation stalled that we are getting excited by LEDs at back of phone?
"nono that's not the main question, the main question is how good it performs"
I would never put my phone screen down on any surface
I hate corner punch holes.
Marques you should name this video “This is Nothing” and that’s make sense
So I have been using it for a week now...
How many 2 hours of battery life?
The nothing phone looks like there going to get sued by 🍎.  That's not nothing.
0000000000000000000000000000000
"I really didn't like the design, different, yes but not looking good at all.."
I would buy it now! (Have an iPhone12)
I never thought I would fall in love with nothing.
That phone’s styling definitely has my attention.
that dig at OnePlus at the end.. I guess Carl Pai's quest for vindication in that regard is part of the Nothing phone origin and marketing
Nothing cool
"I would buy this phone because of transparent back, for me it is way cooler than screen with billion colours for example. Of course, if price is acceptable."
Nothing is better than iPhone
@Telegram👉RealMarquesBrownlee really? What an honor ☺️
Holy shit.. when did you get to almost 16 million subscribers? I remember the big event for 8 million.
Asus be like we already did this😂😂😂
I'm happy to see that front bezels are simetrical
"This in no way is a flaship phone. I think it's gonna rock. It is targeted towards mid range segment and the expectation should also be what you'd expect from a mid range phone. It will have a snapdragon 7 Gen 1, and if they price it right with keeping the software as stock as OxygenOS and no bloatware, it would definitely attract people."
Not gonna lie this is a big move by carl pei in exposing his ideas.  Very cool idea on ringtone and charging led notification. What left to oneplus then? Hope more innovation from him after this. And hope its cheaper then oneplus. Surely nothing market from oneplus fan based.
"6:31 ""sounds familiary"" Oneplus?"
I dunno.  I'm not impressed.  Big deal - it has fancy lights....so I can't put a case on the phone?  Cool....
Key question is what’s the impact on battery with all this light ?
"This looks to me like a sort of a soul succesor of the Nokia 3220, which I loved back in the day, wouldn't mind trying this one..."
sad dbrand noises
He's chewing gum. 😂
Am allowed to show back of the phone... But shows front side too
I bet it sounds familiar... overall one+ never managed to solve the equation in any of their phone products.
"It might not work in the US. If you go look at the pre-order site for the first 100 units, none of the US carrier are listed. Too bad you didn't mention that in the video...."
And yet...its another Android phone. That's it.
This is sooooo dooooooooope!!! 😭
"I have a nothing phone, I just can’t really see it…"
"Yep, Used Oneplus One, 3T & Six. Then had to go for S21 Ultra as everybody knows how Oneplus 9 was."
I am gonna tryout their first phone. Excited to tryout something unique 😀
I don't know. If the release date is so close and nothing don't want to release frist hand review then it just make me second guess it even more
Did anyone else feel the video quality was slightly off for this video? The audio seemed poor than your regular videos
I want nothing phone 1 with OneUI 4.1 😶🙃. If devs make a port and I'll surely buy this phone
Ahhhhh i just realised that then the light will render almost useless. Damn it 🥲
"We’re at the point where what we want to make smartphones truly game changing requires advanced engineering (long lasting batteries, instant charging, perfect folding, etc) and not just someone putting some parts together."
"Yea, this is just a gimmick so people would want the phone real bad i guess.."
"Am i the only one that wants a phone that has a completely new OS , hopefully with the integrations and freedom of android, and design and optimization of the Iphone. At a price in between the two. I want to believe that that is possible, so we dont have 2 major companies dominating the market"
"Me after broken my phone.
Model: nothing"
"I'm just happy, an android phone with uniform bezel finally existed"
Wish the price was also NOTHING!
"The back of that looks like how we always portrayed phones to be in the future IMO, very space ship. Is it a huge feature? god no, but in the age of boring slabs its nice to see someone having a bit of fun with something new"
you mean Nothing new xd
"Lights and design won't sell phones from a new brand
If they manage to pull a oneplus one and have a quirky design that's a banger
But if they price it at $500+ we might be looking at an Essential Ph1 situation."
"Everything should starts from zero except the inherited son of a billionaire. It was the same with Iphone since Day One, coped with all giant names like Motorola, Ericsson or Nokia. I was so hesitated and even dislike the size of Iphone 1 as small is the first required impression for mobi at the time. Magically, I then was sucked into the Iphone loops after using the Iphone 3g and definitely a heavy Ifan lately. However,I started to get bored with it and desperately looking around to find the substitute along three years now."
So when is BBK Electronics gonna buy this brand and ruin it?
"My phone won't jiggle jiggle, it glows. 😂"
Most people say that this is the new Oneplus which may be true but the real question is will it also fall like Oneplus in a couple of ears
"awesome hope it'll be available in India,oneplus lost gem 💎."
Cool phone
That one plus reference was the best lol
He is paid by apple lul
2:11 why does the lights look like an Apple logo😖😂
Lie
@Mahmoud Jalloh u can see the leaf and apple outline with a cut on right sode
@Mahmoud Jalloh just see carefully just the outline.
No nothing can be said
"I would buy it if it's not too expensive, but it probably won't ever be released in this country. 

Every time there's a phone I actually want, it doesn't exist here. Not even the pixel 6 was released here. So now I got a basic overpriced samsung 😐"
Black phone with RGB will dope🔥
They hyped this a lot. What they've come up with is one USP. USP worth giving up everything else for? I don't think so. You put it correctly at the beginning. It's the notification LEDs exaggerated that's all
RIP Battery
wouldnt all those ligths affect the battery
Lol so the entire tech community just gonna take the bag I see… ight
Now I am interested.
"OK, couple of things:
1. Who places their phone face down while charging? And do you really want to wiggle it with the screen against your desk?

2. The people who put their phone face down on the desk are usually people who want to clearly signal that they will NOT be distracted by anything on their phone right now -- calls, messages, whatever. Why are those LEDs there again?

3. You know there's another way to know exactly who is calling you? Yeah, you put your phone face-up and you see your contact's name and picture when the phone rings."
that's actually a very stupid design!
6:08 - 6:32 Google or Oneplus? 😂
Did anyone else notice that the big C shape and the diagonal line LED's just look like a large minimalist apple logo?
"So Nothing went from making fake plastic phone with no screen to one with a screen, camera, special leds and everything."
its like a stormtrooper or watch dogs phone
This phone is beautiful
It's a Android phone in a iPhone 12 chassy 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"That seems incredibly thin, and with the LEDs and double back the internal space for a battery must be somewhat reduced. So I'm guessing the rumoured 7 Gen 1 SoC makes sense, an 8 Gen 1 would have lasted 3h on that battery lol"
"not incredibly thin, normally thin"
"idk about yall but I usally look at the front of my phone

Nothing to me is just copy apple with transparent products, and spend a shit load on influencer marketing"
I would love to get this phone if I got the money xD
feels Gimmicky
"Another great MKBHD video with amazing edits and an amazing script. Can't tell which was my favorite: the snazzy edit on showing the back & front ringtone lights simultaneously or the (not so) sneaky One+ burn now that Carl Pei is running Nothing, but both were crispy!"
Nothing is so cool (love the ear (1)). Sick!
"I dunno. The idea of certain baked-in LED shapes appeals far less to me than a full-blown LED display (at a very low and matte resolution)

That said, I'm all for better phone flashlights. It is, unironically one of the features that I use the most on my phone after checking the time."
It looks like a iPhone 12 but way sexier
"The ringtones have to be a joke, aren't they?"
Wow for Multiple LED..
"This is a whole new meaning to ""Something from nothing"""
Is that a powerbook? 😭
Cool. Very Cool. But I never keep my phone screen down. So yeah....
"I will love to the pouch design that will make the lights at the back shine through, not transparent cases tho."
Great timing for oneplus users to change phone.
"Marcus :I hope there is a clear case coming from nothing
Me: well gully, I think we gada wizard up in dese parts ere I say I say ☺️"
"Just a gimmick to be different...

I would also want a case what about that.
Just because the background lits up why shall I buy it 😂."
Amazing 🙌
was he supposed to show us the front? xD
Love it...
"I had the original OnePlus One (which was an amazing phone) an none of the other models because they ended up disappointing In many ways. In some ways I think Carl Pei has the right spirit about his Nothing brand but tbh I think he's all talk no action. The Phone (1) back cover is pretty good and interesting, I love the boxy iPhone-like look of the bezel but a phone is much more than that, most of it is about the software and in case of Android Phones, the amount of time they bring updates and (security updates) is very important, in fact, it's the most important thing for me. So we'll see what happens, but I don't expect too much from nothing."
"It's not like you could expect a lot from nothing...

*ba dum tsss*"
This phone is definitely different...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great for kids
Looks like a Chinese IPhone.
"hole punch camera in the front? 
2 cameras on the back?
pffff... PASS"
Lets see apple doing this in 2020 with the LEDS
What a design 😍😍
"I didn't have high hopes, specially after the last few OnePlus phones, but DAMN, this is MAJOR dopesause!!!"
How big is this phone man? Can you give us the actual size
This is a sick looking phone. I'm glad it looks different 😇
Wasted of battery life
DAMN!
"Let me say it for you, ONE+!."
this phone is cool
"these types of reviews are so pointless to me. this company really told this man
“here’s an early look. JUST review the back of the phone tho” 💀💀 like just let him do his thing and review the whole phone smh"
at this point juste sell modified iphone with clear back lol
Is that a Star Wars phone?
Will Nothing phone suffer same fate like Oneplus? We will see
"The black mirror style phone is really getting boring today, we need new UI, a different method. This phone made me think about the yr2003-2005 when all different phone vendor try different design!"
"I like the idea, I just think the LEDs pattern they went for is just ""weird"". We have to wait and see how they actually built the day-to-day user experience around it, but I can't help but think if they had just designed the whole interface around the middle LED ring and gave it some RGB lighting they could make a better experience overall

either way, cool new phone"
6:23 ouch one plus 🥲
I wish it becomes the second phone of my life
"This is one of the most interesting peace of tech launched in these couple of tech
Those lights look amazing"
Kicked OnePlus's ass.. hope Nothing kick's OP's ass too by pricing it right...
People in india 🇮🇳 will definitely buy this over oneplus if it is cheap and smooth
"Looks like the name, nothing. It's a notchless iPhone in the front and sides with a gimmick on the back. Maybe RGB LEDs would've made it a bit more interesting. But still, it's just LEDs on the back. Who keeps their phone face down anyway?"
"6:32 yes, sounds familiar (cries in corner)"
Looks like iPhone 12 without back cover
That is the best idea of back utility
@æ no
you deleted your previous comment?
cool
No chin? Nice!
"""Notification LED has been dying breed now""
That's because Watches and smart bands are around now and all notification trigger goes directly to your wrist :)"
I thought that was the iPhone 14 for a sec💀
"""sounds familiar?""
*onePlus sweating heavily*"
Looks like a iPhone XS Max with square sides I like I like.
"I have these videos. Nobody is above selling out, apparently."
No matter what… I’m getting this😍
Looks like iphone 12 but why he saying it looks different 🤔
What processor is it running??
"A reason why they are in Hypebeast. 😌 Damn, I want one 😭"
"At first glance, this phone looks amazing and functionality of those leds is a really cool concept. If I wasn't so invested in apple's ios, this would definitely be in my pocket when it comes out."
what about the operating system?
They are designed to appeal to the masses. In simple terms  they're mostly designed in Cupertino and copied in China.
It kinda looks like Iphone 11 xD
Processor??
That recording light is an absolute win. I record myself climbing a lot with the main camera on my S21 and I keep forgetting if I hit record or not. I've been looking for a external recording light for a long time now so if this catches on then I would be estatic!
This is very cyberpunkesque
So an iPhone with a clear back and running android. Great hate it
No need to wait for the second gen. This will be my next phone
That dig at oneplus was brutal :P
Price?
It looks like Nothing.
My first thought is Apple might buy this company to get the features of these phones to add to the iPhone.
"it's interesting, but without kmowing about the rest it's meaningless"
Samsung is better than iPhone. don't say iPhone is good
Looks like an iPhone lol looks sick tho
If specs r top line i want one of these!!
One plus sounds familiar
Its very sick love it
"if i'll like the interface and the camera will be good, this is my next phone"
mrkAmmMakMg
if the antenna bands lit up too.. then that would be unique
The light patterns for different contacts is such a cool touch. Would make a nice accessibility feature for the hearing impaired
OG Oneplus users will definitely buy this One.
Meh
I use a case and never get phone calls so a big meh.
Hey Marques since you have used the NothingPhone....if you were to set your expectations (on a scale of lvl 1-10) what could be it's magnitude???
Sick
Everyone rips off Apple's designs...
I never put my phone on its screen. It always leaves micro scratches from dust and stuff.
Daniel Larson ass ringtones 💀
"One plus, the closing statements are for you"
Bruh 😎 I would buy u (nthng ph )if u are under 30 k Indian rupees
Finally something new! Looks cool!😳
Nothing is new here bruh 🙂
new! looks like iphone 😂
@Jerry Kosloski It looks better looking than iphone cuz it doesn't have that weird cheap looking notch. Sure Nothing new
Yes something NEW in the iPhone 12 body.
It's an iPhone design with some cheap gimmicks. Nothing new at all.
"I thought this was the new No phone... Yeah, their name isn't very good for branding."
Dont need any notifications led anymore with te always on screen displays.
Apple is definitely suing nothing.
Finally someone made it
@TRLEGRAM @Brownlee_Marques too bad you are not Marques
nothing to say 🤣
"I don't care about the back, but the front looks amazing."
so plastic back then?
It's actually glass.
"I think the LEDs on the back that tie into ringtones and alerts is really cool, interesting design too. I agree that it looks like an iPhone 12 on the back and the front looks like a pixel. Kinda an amalgamation of whats out currently with the LEDs added. I see the usefulness of the LEDs but also seems kinda gimmicky IMO. Also I’m thinking with the motion to bring the charging battery LED back on, you wiggle the phone, I’m thinking that could cause some scratching on the screen over time. Excited to see how they market it on release."
It looks like an Iphone for nerds 😁
Wait What
RIP DBrand
No! Marques! No earwax sharing!!!! That's oversharing buddy! 😂
"If i wanted something that looks like an iPhone, I'd guy an iPhone"
Brownlee always surprise us!!!!!
6:33 yeah oneplus
If someone would have came to me saying it is a cistomized iPhone i would have believed that..
The future is now old man 😎
"Backcase makers: we got good business coming up, more transparent cases sold, yellowing issue in short span, more business again 💸💸"
It's amazing when it's comming in market
For me this phone looks really cool but the look is not all. It all comes down to its performance. It needs a camera that is good enough and it should handle tasks as good as the competitors. And god please I hope it has a 120 hz ltpo 2.0 display.
Прикольно 🙂 Только ради подсветки купил бы🥺 😋
Im not gonna lie it feels like an iPhone gimmick
"Is it unique? Yes it is. Does it look cool? Yeah kinda. 

But is it everyday looking phone which a consumer would wanna use in sophisticated environment? I guess not. 

You said it right, it’s a product to attract customers at first and then later on things will change. 

Hope they make good quality phones and we get an option to choose from, apart from samsung or one plus. 

Although it’s a nice step to choose iphone 12 looking design, still from sides and all it looks neat and clean, thankfully they didn’t make it like Tesla did with cyber truck. 

FYI - I am an iPhone user and will buy iphone next. But will be happy to have an option in android as well as secondary phone or to recommend someone else"
omg this is sick af 🤯
I’m just waiting for a new op on a phone or and android that protects my info from Google and third party apps
Should of skipped the wireless charging and make it cost less
Cool let's just add a bunch of things that don't actually improve the user experience lmao
It's time to prove the real Power of this phone. Software & Hardware is way more important than Design. Let's see
"My first impression was. Yup they stole the iphone 
12 design"
you are saying like they copy pasted it lmao cant see all the mod
Cool.  But nothing will differentiate it if it has bad specs and performance.
"I just want to remind everyone that this is a mid range phone... You don't need to overhype or expect so much regarding this one...

If this Nothing phone can do what the Old OnePlus is all about, a very affordable price for a flagship phone, then you can hype all you want..

Anyways the design is a fresh one in my eyes which is nice"
"The Glyph interface is really cool, if I were in the market for a phone I'd definitely give this one a look"
Definitely gonna buy this sick phone 🤩
ultimate flashlight 🔥
But why? When you could literally do the exact same things on your front display without putting your screen on surface scratching and making it dirty? Literally no point other than to build hype.
@Doge still same. Why putting display facing down when you can put it facing up doing all the same things with aod or led indicator at front.
do you use your phone on concrete lol
Samsung will release this phone and the Samsung cucks would be like “aPpLe cOpIEd oUr dEsIgHn”
I'm gonna get this.
"Okay, wiggling the phone to show the battery progression is hella dangerous.
Just so you know (although glass has gotten tougher since the Galaxy S3 days), if there's a grain of sugar or salt on your desk and you wiggle your phone on it, your screen will be scratched."
Uniform bezels. Nice
"now that's a phone. it's nothing, i like the ringtones and the led lights but honestly, never mind"
Very cool feature
i would use if they can support upto 10 years update
Why should anyone care about this…
Even more broadly appealing phone.... Abandoned an original fan base.... Sounds familiar .. (OnePlus)... On Target  🎯
"This looks really interesting, currently on a S21 Ultra wich i do enjoy. But this entices me."
@Telegram👉RealMarquesBrownlee cool :)
"You can already tell that the next logical upgrade would be RGB lights. Question is, how dedicated is Nothing to their whole Glyph concept? I don't want to see this idea abandoned quickly."
It’s like if you painted the components of an iPhone and put a clear case on it. Pretty unique.
I'm wonder how visible fingerprints would be on that glossy back and how the LEDs would show the prints
This looks really unique and 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
"It got a Tron vibe.. imo looks dope af, if the performance is flagship level, I would buy it."
should make with different color for device and LED lights.
Yeah OnePlus
I want the alert slider from OnePlus
Missed opportunity to be the 🍐 pear phone.
Wheres the RGB ......!! haha
One plus sell outs🤣
I like the phone
How much!?
Distract them with the flashing lights got it
I like u I of nothing
The led design on the back although it’s cool would have a massive feature for deaf people as it would allow them to see if someone is facetiming them or such just like a red light on a fire alarm which is really unique and very cleverly thought of
You know who's calling just by looking at it ...😂 Don't we have that feature already since the beginning of phones .
@Telegram👉RealMarquesBrownlee congratulations to u too bro
As far as looks go I think this looks amazing. It has a kind of futuristic industrial look.
I hope it won't fluke like Hydrogen One
My first impression…I feel nothing. 👍🏾
"Lol be ready to ""replace"" the back LED every month with that much flickering during ringtone..🤣🤣"
oppo vivo gonna copy
Definitely getting rid of my OnePlus
Iphone 12 with punchhole
"I know that almost all phones look the same from the front but I like the fact that Nothing Phone has the hole punch camera in the corner and not in the centre as it will fade in the peripheral vision, and I think the back design looks good☺"
Those ringtones tho😫
iPhone copy and also performance less than A15
"Can't wait to see the kind of case dbrand makes for it.

😂😂😂"
oneplus be like: Did you mean me....
I think speakers are boom
That's actually cooler than I had expected. Nice to see some serious thought going into the notification system.
I want a clear skin from jerry rig everything
খারাপ না 🥱
I am going to by nothing
"As long as it has an amoled screen and a decent battery I'm gonna get this, looks good!"
"Damn it's dope! People gave too much flac on the UI but now it all looks cohesive and still, pretty clean."
"Not bothered about the led strips lighting up for notifications as I don't ever place my phone front side down. As you could accidentally scratch the glass off something on the table etc.

Much more intrigued with the Led strips acting as a camera flash. I had even replied to Carl Pei on Instagram a few days ago. Asking if the curved led strip would be used as a led ring flash 📸 

Turns out I was correct!"
"The strip on the back is too small to be an effective ring flash, so who cares?"
carl pei is doing a really great job
"Such a cool features, the back light LED could be protentially a notifications or messaging features for the deaf"
4:05 reminding of old Motorola flips phones with LEDs in the front
i dig this.
I would love it if the corner or bottom LEDs light up when i get a notification and NOT the whole LED back panel thingy. Hope it could be done through software update.
It looks & sound like watchdog 2 phone 👀
This 1st phone with gimmick will work bt the next one the team really need to think hard to stand out more.
"Your videos have gotten so much worse since your ""Don't believe in EV start-ups unless they're Tesla"" video."
Cool design
am i the only one who thinks this just looks tacky
"Nice pot shots at OP, the best part of the video, if I dare say."
"This phone looks really cool to me. Always is nice to see some company trying new things, giving a bit more of a niche package for people that just get bored of the regular Apples and Samsungs. I'm pretty sure that as you say in the video, if Nothing is a success they will lean into broader appeal, but that's a problem for the future. Hopefully then, some other company is bold enough to shake things up, as Nothing has done now. As long as the phone is functional and doesn't have glaring issues, I'm willing to give it a shot just for the awesome look!"
This phone has a vybe....it's something!!!!
"Nice phone design👏
.
.
.
Anyway, I'll put a case on it."
Intro song????
The lights on the back are gimmicky. Reminds of me when people would jazz up their Nokias in the early 2000s.
OnePlus.... Right?
Do we know anything about the selling Price?
Those ringtones are actually horrible
"It looks cool and has definitely generated interest, but the software experience is going to make it break this nothing phone imo. If it’s glitchy and buggy or the screen is really dim or it quickly overheats and throttles or charges slowly (I can’t imagine it having long battery life with all those lights) etc then the first purchasing wave will be the only purchasing wave."
Awesome
Ugly... No headphone jack no buy. Another phone hardware startup that'll disappear after the first generation.
"if they price this phone decently, i'll definitely get one!"
We want camera samples
Seems like such a miss to not make the LEDs ARGB.
"No matter how unique and different it is now, at the end of the day, this series will become expensive and common looking, just like OnePlus."
I ABSOLUTELY WANT IT
sounds familiar ... yeah ofcourse you meant the oneplus ye ? haha
Size?? Cz this ain't compact
Ngl the back led lights look ugly as hell.
"Now I miss my Xperia U, used to have a led bar down for the notifications"
Can’t wait for The Studio’s reactions 😀
"such bad name for a tech equipment!!! who wants to buy a phone named ""nothing"""
I might switch from my OnePlus 7 pro to this fingers crossed on OS
"UI Design will be Sci-Fi Black themed and Different, and in future they will create more laptops, tabs and other stuff to create an ecosystem like apple,  And will be lot's of cool features around NOTHING ecosystem."
OMG definitely i gonna buy
Perfect iphone replica
Anything about specs or performance?
best of both worlds I'd say ...
Sick! ❤️
"6:08 Hahaha....  OnePlus. 
😁"
I know the video was about the nothing phone BUT THAT DBZ AND NARUTO PHONE !!!!
as long as it got sd card slot and 3.5mm headphone jack i will happily buy it
1+
Those LEDs would be annoying
I want one
its so sexy❤️ its like my dream phone design .
6:33 obviously OnePlus. Shame though.
Now im hype
Watching one plus 7❤️
"I really thought it would be just another typical smartphone, nothing distinctive, a simple copy of some another phone. However, right know I see what they made, and even though the shape is similar to the IPhone's, it's something really cool and different. I hope the OS is good and usable, and if so, that is a success"
man i am buying that instead of some shitty phones
If nothing really wanted to speak to a niche market they would start with a foldable.
Imagine if those led were rgb....
"If they can deliver a stable stock android phone with decent pricing, Nothing is the new Oneplus! As a first impression, this sure turns heads."
Finally become another OnePlus. ✓
History repeating itself flagship killer material is now ❤️
Might as well put the video title: Nothing Phone one! Cool Lights!
"That subtle dig at OnePlus at the end is genius. For those who don't know, Nothing phone's founder was also the one who made the OnePlus brand."
"Hey what phone do you own?





Me: Nothing"
I love the little jab at Oneplus at the end XD
A nothing phone for a nothing people
"6:33
Yup... Oneplus did that 🙄"
we demand RGB!
Does it come in black tho
they should change the name of the phone..nit interesting or appealing enough
It's gonna rock
6:10 one plus?
it looks dope
"Jesus, phones are becoming anything but phones..."
Looks familiar
Imma hate whoever has this phone next to me in the theater
This phone do target some set of users who tend to dig deep I genuinely think that did attach some unique as they are starting fresh and will be a deciding factor when the launch sets up
Impressive 😀👍
"I was so ready to clown this phone for looking like an iPhone 12 but honestly, that LED array on the back has sold me. It so freaking cool and seems genuinely useful, with manufacturers ditching LED notification lights years ago"
i need alert slider in this . 😿😿😿😿
"Damn, that OnePlus reference in the end hit real hard, I'm sure the true fans shed a tear."
I am shocked at the enthusiasm over this.  it's an iPhone clone with lights on the back.  Who keeps their phone face down that much to make this useful?   Always on display made notification LEDs obsolete a long time ago.
"I am also extremely saddened by Oneplus, as a Oneplus One original user :("
cool but useless
"I'm already sold man

Let's see how much it costs"
Wow. Love those LED functions. It looks so different. Definitely it brings a fresh air to the smartphone brands. Design is also dope. Love that futuristic design.
I love the tongue and cheek OnePlus reference 😄
"It was 2022, where we watch a 6-minute review of the backlight on the phone. This is the reality we deserve."
"Don’t be onePlus, nothing."
Looks like dope utopian shit
I dig the iPhone-like body with a transparent-ish back
Different design but not for me
I will buy the phone 📱
6.07 - 6.31 yes sounds familiar... it's oneplus legacy which is just ruined.
"I’m gonna be buying this as soon as it comes out. I really like what Nothing is doing in the space, and I think this phone is going to be one of those products that will be a huge turning point in the industry."
"Common sense and critical mind, pretty please ffs."
"I was going to do the same, till I saw their website and it directed me to Japan sales and saw the price...  I have better things to do with $2300"
Bro who paid you? I'm trying to get that bag too
This is just another essential phone. It won’t last a 2nd generation.
Looks awesome! I would mod the software so you can have daytime running lights on your phone 😂 why not
I don’t hate it it’s actually pretty cool
Wow...just wow....
Which processor it has
"@creamycoconut seriously, it has a score of around 6 lakh on antutu"
Snapdragon 7 gen 1
"Not hating, but it looks like an iPhone 12 with a Dbrand skin."
Good to see something different although for me  I can see the flashing and flickering lights on the back getting old pretty quickly. 🤔
"I really wish that nothing succeeds, the market needs a refresher"
"I came here thinking It was going to be a basic phone with some design on the back for people who like design. Boy was I wrong. Lights on the back of the phone like this seems so right! I dont know if theyre going to be like the new LG who makes crazy new stuff that other companiss pick up on because it just makes sense, or if theyll actually be able to compete!"
"Bias
It doesn't look different, it's an iphone with a cover on the back
About the LED? I call it a gimmick
Others can do the same with always on display on AMOLED screen if they want to.
Check your Samsung, it does it already.

Who put his phone on that side when charging it? Who put his phone on that side to rest on the desk?
You will end up always having to flip your phone for each and all of your notifications, such a hassle...

Get an iPhone or a Samsung and forget this one, try again OnePlus- I mean Nothing"
I guess you could almost say that Nothing phone looks and acts like Nothing we’ve seen before……get it? Okay I’ll find my way out
I am expecting a video from Arun too!
Looks like an iPhone
"6:20-6:30 👌
Sweet"
"A naked iphone 12 that runs on android with led lights, a total rip off"
"Getting tired of people complaining about ""the hype""."
Reminds me of a phone you'd see in Bladerunner or some other dystopia sci-fi film. Pretty cool actually.
This is a Death Stranding phone.
"The front sells me on this device. Hole punch in the corner, barely any bezels, nice curves. It looks great!"
😵‍💫
Welcome back the original Oneplus
Alert slider missing!
Oh my sweet baby Jesus this Nothing Phone looks sweet! Can’t wait for a full review fasho!
"Considering that most people put their phones in a case, I'm curious to see how it's going to appeal to them."
You can always buy silicione case tho. And im pretty sure they will produce their own cases as well
Black + rgb led = you can have my money
it's just android's iphone
Need battery durability test
they talked trash about apple and yet made a phone that looks like an iphone
Imagine if it was RGB
Is the phone actually so different looking like you make it lol
"""Nothing has impressed me with this phone""
Me: Visible confusion*"
2:05 wow!! That’s pretty cool.
isnt it the same as many other phones out there. It is not as smart as it think of itself 🥴
Who did MKBHD shade? Pixel? Oppo? WHO?
"Meh, just another gargantuan 6.5 inch phone :("
You could just have said OnePlus and not sound familiar
I'd buy it if the price and spec. is right. Looks good. OnePlus 7t owner who wouldn't buy a new OnePlus.
"Personally, i think they went overboard with the back design. It just looks tacky imo."
Iy looks like a iphone without back glass but it's dope🔥
From the outside it won the match let see what is inside for me UI will play a major role here if it behaves like oxygen OS then nothing can make their noodles...
"Being diffrent isn't necessarily better, I'm talking about look of Phone! How is this better or cool?"
Wheres the mate black version
"yes it is enough for people to buy this phone, take my fucking money"
"I call that the ""stormtrooper design""."
"""Sound familiar?"" was pretty hilarious"
"Hey, couldn’t find that t-shirt in the MKBHD shop. Need!!"
6:31 I've got a strong feeling he's talking about OnePlus.🤔
And then when you put on a case...
The LED feature is a great stuff out of the box but I personally didn't like the so called transparent back and am more into a matte or glass back with a premium colour in a premium phone
will wait for black color cuz those backlight is gonna look dope in black panel
Reminds me of a step up from the HTC front dot case that came out a while back.
"Their Design is amazing. 🤯
Now it just needs to run iOS …"
Idk but it looks way to much like an older iPhone but the leds are sick
I’m definitely picking this up to use as my secondary phone. Carl Pei is gonna do what essential couldn’t. I’m all in on this when it drops.
"Sony Xperia also did the LED stuff for Xperia U,P,S and so on... Its cool to see stuff back"
Why nothing? It should be called useless. I think they really missed a chance here.
You got it again at first time ☺️
"Not for 1,600$ nope."
"the OnePlus was not hurt in this video. 😉
6:08"
That’s more exciting than folding phones.
"Design is dope, if pricing matches the performance then definitely going all in for this."
They are keeping it at $599
0:00 i love the design
👎🏽
"In my opinion it should have 3 cameras. That makes or breaks the deal for me. Besides clean, un-bloated, fast and optimized software. Then again, in a market where everything is saturated with the same cameras, this would be their opportunity to shine. Apple does it, why is there no Android phone with that setup? 3 cameras, all having the same resolution but different lenses (wide, ultra wide and tele, the golden trio). Any Android i buy has BIG numbers like 108MP and such, pixel binned from 12MP. And the other cameras are added just to suck to say they have 3. Like how many times was it the case where the main camera is the best, and the zoom or wide sucked. Apple's camera doesn't suck like that. Shouldn't it be time Android stepped up it's game?"
"lmao, that closing thought reminded me of that “Enthusiast brands will betray you” you video, which i highly recommend anyone to watch."
Would be way cooler if we can change the colour of the lights at the back too
Will surely get hold of this...
I love how this has the shape of an iPhone with the squared off sides
If Black Mirror was a phone.
"Well i look at my screen every 2 - 3 hours to see if anything need my attention, but most often there are nothing indicating that i am not sick
I do not have ring tone or any form of notification on,,,, again i am not sick."
Sounds familiar with oneplus hype
"So basically we have yet another small, agile, creative anti Apple company, and use their market position as an excuse for every uncomfortable question what might come up. Just to betray the original fan base few years later. Khmmm 1+"
The Stormtrooper phone 🔥_🔥
6:30 yeah Oneplus
those frames and hole punch is what apple should have done time ago.!!!
Case manufacturers:🥲
this looks good
It will only work if its software is working perfectly on launch
I’ll get one
"Yea.... Let me just set down my phone on the screen side. Ope, screen scratches galore."
"Given it's primarily ran by Carl Pei, NOTHING is on their way to be what OnePlus once was. Kinda reminds me how OnePlus started with CyanogenMod, for the niche market of power-users. Only if they stick to their demeanor through and through, unlike the mess, that OnePlus has been since the past 2 years. Very intrigued to see the road these guys take. Also, I'd definitely switch out my phone for this, if it comes with a decent SOC and a great software support."
How cool...😁
"I feel like marques does not want to say what he truly feels, so he won't upset the nothing brand"
This phone is nothing but cool
That ringtone feature is pretty dope!
"OnePlus, Nothing
They are the same picture"
The way all the bezels go all the same feels so cool to see.
Sounds familiar.
"Leds are nice, wish they got an Android instead of iphone looks, it looks nice anyway, curious to see the full review and if the leds take too much on batery"
Gonna be interesting to see how third parties make cases for this phone
"All that just to put a case over it. And yes, I know a clear case will prob be ideal, but those get scratched up pretty quickly. Cool idea though, I like the phone but I still wouldn’t switch from Apple. Not just yet."
"It’s one thing for the phone to look interesting but the software needs to bring something new as well. 

So is there room for a non-Apple & non-Andriod OS? I feel someone needs to break away from these two OS and create something open source."
It's not going to make it for the backpannel lights 😕 it's different but it is not going  to make it. It looks odd but not unique. Bt without the backlights it's dope.
I'd definitely buy that!
"nothing new, nothing done, nothing special, and nothing worth buying."
i feel this phone will be on my hands pretty soon... looking so great having taht iphone finally kinda looking borders in hand of android. i mean when we see what is gonna be the software inside we will see if its amazing or not but for now seeing that iphone body and frames with android in is for sure coooool and we need to see it
Excited to see where they go! Hopefully this doesn't bomb like the hydrogen! I was so excited for that one and it was such a fail lol
Sound familiar??? Hahahaha
What a cool phone
"Write my words: Nothing gonna betray you in  the next 6-8 years again. Never Settle, remember? I'm gonna pass this time"
"If it comes with stock android or the old school oxygen OS, or even lineageOS, with google camera .. with software support - then I'm sold."
Give it a black and white cyber punk ui and I am sold
"Hell yes, I will buy it in a heartbeat 💕

-so tired of all phone's looking the same, miss good old Nokia from the nineteens 💕

-bring back unique please!"
"Meh, no alert slider and no RGB"
yeah.... the last part sounds pretty familiar..... 🙃🙃🙃
"Nice dbrand teardown skin you have there Marques!



For those who are clearly not old enough to understand irony, this is a joke."
"I would not buy a nothing phone,
As my money needs better than nothing, 
Mind can say it's worth nothing, 
Wallpaper, icons are nothing but nothing.
The one plus Era is over and nothing left for nothing to reuse it"
dope 🔥
The lights is a nice gimmick..for children.
"I'm watching an hour after posting, it has 455K views after an hour , mind blowing, that YouTube money must be paying BIG"
It looks like a copy of an iphone with bazaar like features. It seems gimmicky to me.
"fairly unique approach. if the phone's battery life, overall performance and display are fair enough then I would love to own one."
This is such a dope phone. Damnnn. Every cyberpunks dream
You can't use cover 😕
"Yeah if this doesn't come with a clear case out of the box that is optimized for it, it's... well... useless."
Looks like a really good phone for someone who is hearing impaired
I'm pretty intrigued about Nothing's future.
"Looks like an iPhone with some childish back, the thing is not even useful at all lol"
Nothig for nothing
Nah... Not this time Mr Pei. OnePlus was the one and only competitive phone.
He was talking about OnePlus right ?
I would say NOTHING Looks good here!!
"The lights on the back look awesome. Reminds me of my old Sony Ericsson flip and slider phones that had similar effects on the sides. I don't think this is gonna pull me away from the Note (or I guess now the S22), but if the price to power ratio is right, then they certainly have my attention"
This phone looks straight out of tron and that has me excited
Do people generally keep their phones facedown all the time ? 🤔
One and done like the Essential PH1...good phone tho.
"Great gimmick and phone overall looks pretty good. Means nothing though until we know the full specs of this thing, price and software experience etc."
6:03 That's 1+ he's talking about XD
But normally you use a case for a phone…
That led on the back literally looks like an apple. And btw why on earth do you need led lights when basically the entire front screen is a huge led notification. This is just pointless and a gimmick
I buy would buy over iphone
The Ringtones are so sick!!
Lmao I love that shot MKBHD took at OnePlus at the end
"Looks like an iPhone 12, but way cooler"
I miss the led notification light
"I want this phone, hope it got a flagship specs."
"What the 
Evryone thought it will have centre punch hole but side punch hole leaks went wrong hmmm😂😱😶🤔"
"I Love square phones so they already got me with the design, and the back gimmick is a good addition. Will see specs and price, but this one is on my next phone list."
I'll buy it even if it is priced at a price point close to Apple 14 pro Max....
If it ruins iOS I’ll buy it
"All these unique features are just gimmicks, i don't see any practical real use for these so called extra unique features. 
Heck, I am not buying a phone for some LED light shows. I need real features that are useful. 

Sorry, not convinced."
🔥
We want a performance phone with back that works good with attachable radiators when we're gaming to reduce the heat
abandoned original fanbase 🤣🤣 you killed it man
The question is what is the SAR value of the phone for body and head?
Ear one earbuds still super buggy. I cannot imagine solid software on this phone.
"A video all about lights, on a white Background??? Imagine the same video in a much darker room."
03:59 Nice! Either you have two review units or this is some lowkey smooth editing. I'm betting it's the latter! :D
"@Shon John V. Yup, and you can see his hand move slightly between different ring tone selections. Very impressive though."
It's edited. You can see it clearly when be flips the phone on the right. The edge cuts off.
"That side by side phone vid was actually one phone shot twice orrrrrrrrrr? another great video as always ... if this had ios id probably get it , it looks sick"
"Let's just hope it's better than OnePlus software, it's become awful as of late"
I wish they added a different set of color LED's apart from the default white which could have boosted the brand more. 🤔
No way why woyld I buy this phone for what my money is a value of nothing ?
iPhone 12 with a hole punch :))
Yes sounds damn familiar 🤣
How can I buy this case ?
"Interesting Phone
Like is a iPhone 12 but veery different in design, almost if it was maked with the laser machine
But either way it looks soooo cool and weird than the other phones."
"- What kind of phone is this?
- It's Nothing
- Okay, then don't tell me about it 🙄"
Love the lowkey shot at oneplus at the end. LMAO
"To be honest, it looks like nothing..."
Would love to own this phone if it cost me NOTHING!
Sounds familiar !
Sound familiar? Definitely talking about OnePlus. I remember getting the OG OnePlus One back when you had to join the forum and get an invitation. I was in a facebook group and people were BEGGING for those invites.
How about the next nothing phone having rgb instead of the frost white light
They kinda revealed front of the phone...before launch...😂😂
"I really like the design. I have an Asus ROG phone 5 and I love the giant programmable LED logo on the back of my phone. Unfortunately, this Nothing phone has a hole punch camera in the front so I would never consider it. I honestly have no idea how everyone gets over that. I tried a Galaxy s21 and the hole punch made me hate the screen every time I looked at it. Pop up cameras, flip up cameras, or just a small forehead bezel are all far superior screens."
One of the rarest review wheRE phone never switched on. Classic MKBHD.
I bet my left nut they got the lights idea from the Zephyrus G14
Tbh i was hoping the front will look like s22 this looks like it has a little bit bezel😔
"From far it look like iPhone,at close its 🔥"
This phone is beautiful
Does that light pattern says CGI
since this will most probably impossible to buy in local stores in my country (Czechia)  I don't really care. All these niche devices are always being sold only in US.
This is so genius and different. Love it.
Wow! Powerbook G3! My first laptop and still my favourite😍
"Yooo... Is that an iPhone?? Slapped LED strip and called it revolutionary. The LED lights light up according to the ringtones?? Nah, old brick dumb phone did that before. Just Google it if you people don't believe me. 🤦🏻‍♂️ for this NOTHING phone."
This looks cool. Flagships nowadays look boring
Doesn't interest me. Honestly
I want Nothing to do with this phone.
One Plus shade at the end lol
That's a really nice iPhone........ might get it
"Didn't expect this already. I looove how the lights look, but for me it would mostly be a gimmick, since I never place my phone screen down"
But maybe you would if you bought one of these?
Awesome 👏
nearly 7 minutes to see the back of a phone...? Damn....
"Haven't seen you mention or comment on Vivo x80 pro which seems to be a camera centred phone , seen a lot of hype around it."
هاذا لهنا الزايد
"so they want us to keep the phone facing downwards all the time
reminds me of the early sony Xperia series with glowing transparent bottom
you quickly get tired of it and stop using it"
that did sound very much like oneplus
"This is cool and all, but how successful were those specials editions? I don't think they would have sold all that many phones in total. And those special editions were just skinned versions of regular phones. Nothing is pitching this as their ""regular"" phone. Unless it comes in at a super cheap price point, I don't think this phone is going to do very well."
"Looks impressive. If nothingOS is close to stock, I would buy it in a heartbeat"
Entering the smartphone market is idiotic.
Paid review !
Oneplus reference 😉
It’s beautiful 😍
iphone12
All that extra is unnecessary!
"""revolution eats its own"""
"The whole “we’re going to build hype by not telling you much” thing doesn’t really work when there’s a hundred other functionally identical options out there.

Also, if those are the actual ringtones, they all sound incredibly annoying."
"“I’m only allowed to show you the back.”
Repeatedly shows the front."
"Nothing: NOBODY INNOVATES ANYMORE !!!!!!111
Also Nothing: Look at my led strips glass back breakthrough design that's 90% same with an iPhone 12; and also you cannot show any other feature on the phone while we are at it.

The mental gymnastics needed to market this as something innovative by Marquess is comical."
I am only allowed to show you the back of the phone 1:12 also MKBHD 3:40 flipps and shows the interface...
Their launcher is a mess from what I have heard. If they fix it (the UI) and have a decent camera I will buy it.
just iphone look with transparent back and without notch
This is out of the box innovation and will definitely buying this! this start up company will definitely kill all known smart phones out there with their unique features.
"Seems like Nothing people are fooling us by revealing its product before its launch...they have revealed quite a chunk of its features, jst wonder what mi8 b left to be revealed on the day of its launch...They might hav planned a bigger surprise n a better product for us"
"MKBHD needs to start using that voice isolation in final cut, the constant fan noise in the background is driving me insane"
I'm already waiting for the black version
Porsenly i like the phone 📱 all the back and front I love it disine is best I can bye thise phone
it looks dope
"I think led notifications is one of important feature on a smartphone, but many manufactures missed it."
@DEATHSTROKE I don't think it is right to call barely 50% of smartphones as “most smartphones”.
i think they can easily implement this back with software since most smartphones are OLED. and they can simply light up a small part of the display to mimic the front notifications led
I miss it on my samsung S10
"How about, the notification lights using an always on display? You’ll have endless possibility to customize the lights and the most important thing is it’s on the front. You don’t have to put your phone upside down on the desk and while charging.

The transparent design is insane I gotta admit but all the hype are *nothing* but gimmicks that reminds me too much of nexbit robin and essential phone"
Will be an average gimmicky phone.
This mobile back is useless if you use a case. Most of people using a case unlike YouTubers like you who use mobile for a week😄
"6:30 yeah, OP, OP, OP!!!"
Now if it could fit in an iphone 12 CASE that would be awesome
imo its not worth more than 350 USd
6:30 that's you OnePlus
Just visit the chinese phone market. Their startup's phone are pretty god damn cool
"front of this device though
feels like dream iphone"
The best notification light was in the Sony xperia SP. It looked cool and with some software trickery could have been even better.
Sorry but the best one is Xperia u
The Nothing Phone kind of resembles the iPhone X tbh.
"That ringtone match the lights sound and looks soooo cool, it's been a long time not seeing a interesting phone."
This nothing phone sure has something..
I just watched 7 minutes of .. Nothing
The Cyberpunk phone is here!!!!
"make an atomic purple version, you cowards!"
"Marques describing the downfall of my two favorite phone companies at the end was heartbreaking. I wish HTC kept it's original One design aesthetic, same with OnePlus. Two amazing companies that stood out at the beginning but kept vying for the average customer and giving up what made them unique."
we are waiting for launch in India🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
So it is solving a problem I never had. Nothing new.
sounds familiar? he meant one plus by that
Looks cool but who cares.  We all put cases on our phones unless you are unbelievably rich or a YouTuber that gets free phones.
"Yeah the ringtone at 4:05, um… maybe don't use it when you're at school in the U.S."
The earbuds look cool!
Back iPhone front android..wow what a strategy
I see an interesting device in the background 👀
If the software side delivers im willing to give this a shot out of sheer boredom with apple. Nothing is a good reminder that design can be serious and still playful
Gareebo ka iPhone 12
I think this is super cool. I hope that the cameras are competitive though
OH MY GODDDDD
"So basically, I would be buying nothing phone for some gimcking LED lighting!!"
"Damn tron took this long to bring a phone out?
Wtf clue!...you been slacking in the grid!"
Looks futuristic in terms of design and i believe it's gonna satisfy and justify the hype and we believe in Carl Pei he can do the impossible in smartphone industry. 👍
Pretty much looks like all other phones except the LEDs on the back.
How much is this different phone
I’m not switching from apple even if Jesus himself build a phone. No thanks!
Yeah it sounds like oneplus lmao
How much battery it will consume for those LED lights 🤔
They copy iPhone by the camera iPhone is good but also not good phone Samsung Galaxy S10+ is better phone compared to iPhone XS Max
When iphone and andriod make a baby
So basically they will become too broadly appealing and it will be ONEPLUS.
If the performance and things like camera are decent then they should do well on their first try. Oh and also pricing. Hoping its priced well when it comes out
"If the video was about Samsung the title would be "" Not that much different"" xDDD"
Oneplus fans were having PTSD at the ending of this video
A mini version will be very cool
"If its not my beloved Apple, I ain’t touching it bruh."
Like an Iphone XS and the new line of Iphones meet and get Android.
I can already see the lawsuits coming from Apple..
"It just remind us, how boring nowadays back phone are"
"This phone is stupidly futuristic with actually beneficially and good features
Not ""bendable display"" or ""dual display""
🤦🏻‍♂️"
Nice iPhone copy
Defenatly not a unique phone
Will never get through an airport or a flight with this ringtone and backlight feature.
"There is already such product which shows notification, for example like notification on your nails or ring. It lights up your nail or ring on notification."
"Gotta be honest, I'm getting tired of hearing about nothing phone and still knowing nothing about it that would sell the phone to me."
So it's iPhone with Android
R2D2? Is that you?
I like it. The price will be the deciding factor though.
Leds are pretty sick tho ngl
So you can look at the back of the phone and see by the led pattern who called… or just look at the front of the phone and see the name?? Don’t get me wrong it’s cool and unique but still
Nice 1980s Atari sounds 🤣
I hate that I want it 😮‍💨 It's giving Eve (from Wall-E) vibes 😂
"Basically … the whole idea of the company is to generate as much as possible. Nothing else. Nothing…

Oneplus 2.0 😄"
LEDs look dope
I love it!
Nice. I’ll pass. The novelty will wear quickly. There will always be some reason to want more from it. A nothing watch with leds would be nice!!! 👍🏽
Iphone 12.1
is it on android?
That's one chunku bezel there
Is this an android phone?
Is it android or they have their own os?
Kinda wanna buy it
"Love the design, can't wait for the full review!"
"If this Phone has Stock android and a great camera ,in 5 years this phone will be better than Samsung, mark my words 21.06.2022"
"Now is a good time to watch ""Why Enthusiast Brands Will Betray You."""
"After seeing the last part, One plus is like: Is that a personal attack or something...."
I can see this phone is gonna be a failure from miles away. Gimmicks + hype is a recipe for disappointment
"Meh. I see nothing special. They teased it would be ""clear"" but it's not as transparent as the headphones"
So its an iPhone 13 with some tweaks.  Exact same squared off design
"guys, its a ringlight"
Very excited
Software experience is the ultimate thing. That's where OP is losing out. They were awesome couple of years back. OP isn't upto the mark now.
Really dope
Hope this new start-up takes on a different direction than its former OnePlus
That left side puch hole sucks 😞
"though the led lights feature looks cool, what is its actual purpose & how much it is helpful in daily use"
"Looks pretty cool, reminds me of cyberpunk a little, nice to see companies trying something new."
Nothing special about the design … looks like a Lego iPhone 12 ?
"Love the design, hope the software lives up to the hype"
Marquis is the only guy who didn't clickbate us in thumbnail.
That sounded familiar but for everyone in the comments section.... What brand were you referring to????
No RGB? Guess it won’t be the fastest phone then :)
Is it running snapdragon.
One plus much.
What lunatic puts their phone down face down?! 😂
The back of this phone is something jerryrigeverything will love....
Infinix phones r better den this phone I think .. looks doesn't matter what matters is software optimization... Infinix has it
I am curious about its battery life.
Surely we are at peak smartphone if blinking LEDs are what are getting reviewers excited
"My thoughts in looking at ""the 900 LEDs"" is that it's simply unnecessary, and they simply don't have any idea about what's actually required to make a phone innovative.
Sort of disappointed 😑"
Battery after 1 yr be like : I feel so old yet so young
That is.. a toy
They maximize the use of backdoor LED better than all of gaming phone.
I always love Xiaomi because of the LED notification light.. i have the redmi note 2 back then and liked the LED light its also have so many light choices from white to yellow and red .. but nowadays xiaomi dont put that features anymore.. just give 1 single light.. but poco f4 gt have it Which i currently use ..so now i hope nothing phone will keep this led light to their next phone..
Smile on face for sure.
Lol the one plus sneak diss
Again a phone which looks likes Brick. Nokia was way ahead of time in terms of design of the Phone.
Dude the LEDs on the back look great
@TRLEGRAM @Brownlee_Marques ja na lomde
video 04:03 that ringtone 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Apple’s lawyers are picking what neck tie to go with their shoes.
4:17 phone looks nice whats the price
Looks cool
Annoying
Impressed🔥
lamp CGI
"yes, that sound familiar. apple ;)"
Nothing I love more than putting my phone screen down on surfaces that could be covered in particulates. Spicy
"""nothing"" to be Interested in imo, no headphone jack means nothing that's really any different other than aesthetics. It's an attempt to replicate the original One Plus enthusiast phone formula now that OP has prostituted itself to the mainstream market. However this has none of the actual enthusiast features and trys to pass it off with aesthetic gimmicks."
Legend says you start from nothing then live long enough till you become ONE+
I like it tho but the software will be the key aspect!
is this the oneplus we missed
I love this design. . awesome
"White back with white LED sure is a weird choice, if the back is grey or black, that might actually really good.


Or just slap a skin on it 🤣."
No 3.5mm jack = No buy
"This phone looks so cool idk what anyone says its so sick.

Ringtones need work though 😌"
Reminds me of a essential mixed with a iphone. I love the progress light when charging via USB.
"that phone looks really cool, I might just have to get one when they come out"
Looks like a toy.
Super bro
I need one. Bt money issue😩😩
i like it.
wow that looks dope
This lookkssss sickkk
broadly appealing fone that ignores the original fanbase sounds familiar? definately samsung
Old phones took too long to finish their battery but new cell phones finish too fast old phones' original designs but new call phones are not originally phoned that why finish too fast battery 🔋
Nothing looks like an Iphone. Except Nothing.
"nice, those are some fun features! if the rest of the phone isn't completely mediocre and/or overpriced, this does give it an edge IMO. 
have you noticed all the blatant symbolism in the LED patterns Marques? maybe its just me, but i can't help but see them.
1. grey (ghost/faded/dead/boring/pale) apple with a limp(d***) stem in the centre
2. surrounded by a glowing, modernised G(oogle)/apple logo mashup (iphone of android, as carl put it)
3. G/apple logo transcending the borders of the phone
4. exclamation mark to punctuate its loud design and energy 
5. 'C' around the 'camera', but perhaps for 'carl' (yes he spells it that way)."
Let’s make a video together
"Punch hole display* 4:16
Just focus on the phone"
The earphones were absolute garbage for the price to be honest. Im keeping my expectations low to not be dissapointed this time but still excited to see what its FULLY about
There is no way I would *ever* use those ringtones unmuted. Horrible harsh sounds that would make me hate anyone who left them on.
need more than a ringtone to get me even thinking about thinking about going elsewhere
Looks like an iPhone 12.......
With a bunch of leds.....
loves the subtle JAB at OnePlus at the end ((((:
"very interesting & unique, really dope ! I hope the trend goes to other brands and make something similar to it."
1:14 man the tripod is still a thing
"Love how you edited your logo in the same LED styles like the phone. Really looking forward to that review, cuz I base my purchases on them :D"
@M.J you should try to not purchase stuff and use what you have.
"@vacuumcleaner3000 ""purchases"" dont necessarily have to be phones"
Just get an iphone
"Can't believe they didn't do these LEDs in RGB, that would be so much more useful for differentiating people or apps."
Pass from me
"haha, battery go brmmm"
OnePlus 2.0
"OnePlus shout-out yay..!!
Oh wait..."
Gimmicks trend continues
"I'd be down for this if the price is right, this isnt going to available from carriers so its going to have to at least be affordable"
"Now hear me out, what if you just looked at the actual screen instead of the back of the phone?"
STAR WARS!
"I can look at the back of the phone all day
And just imagine if it was RGB 😶‍🌫️"
"Well the phone looks cool , but i do have the feeling like this is very similar to the Microsoft Duo where the hardware was amazing and that was what was allowed in the first media embargo but the software sucked…I hope the software is good …"
Kinda useless unless you have a clear case or a Nothing Made case
"Clearly, they won't steal the most loyal customers from Apple, Samsung, or Google with this phone..."
"Thanks, I hate it"
It turns out we want futuristic phones like this.
I guess the camera won't do its job that well in the dark.
That jab at one plus at the end... ouch
I see nothing
how do you fit a case
"Those ring tones sound like they've been produced using  old 70s era synths that were physically huge. I love those sounds  Overall, the phone is giving me a good first impression, especially since it's coming from  a start up-albeit Carl Peis second start up kind of."
"""when nothing is done"" haha"
Was surprised by the fact how MKBD didn’t explicitly call it a typical iPhone design at least from back? 😟
Seems my next phone.
It seems familiar like One Plus or MI
Just saw the front.
I thought you were just allowed to show the back of the phone.😂
Those ringtones sound so horrible.
Its a gimmick
"I love this phone back, but it will only be cool for the first few seconds before you put on the case and hide it forever."
Amir lok ke amir batein iPhone 12 bolke iPhone 12pro max dika diya.
Nothing like iPhone 11 🤣
What is the os anyway? Is it nothing?
As a Samsung user I hope nothing succeeds but I don't plan on switching phones any time soon and I'm quite loyal to samsung
iphone replica. lel.
"Nothing has managed to get our attention, let's see how the technical part and performance ;)"
You got me lmao
"@ॐ ࿗ The Priest of Varanasi ࿗ ॐ You missed an ""/s"" there buddy."
@ॐ ࿗ The Priest of Varanasi ࿗ ॐ lmao
It's crazy how nothing has got our attention so far. I hope something in the future does.
Nice looking
Really hoping the hardware/software doesn't miss with this phone. Would absolutely love to get this.
wow thats future now
man that's so cool ❤️‍🔥
WOW such a revolutionary device! Lights in the back of the phone!
6:20 OnePlus RIP. 9Pro Global still has no latest update. Last update was on april.
"I really like the design.. i always wanted an android phone with iphone like body. Take my money.. i ll for sure buy one. 
I think this is good competition for android world. 
Price and software will decide its future."
"another product like essential phone lol, wonder how it turned out 🤔"
I'm not sure if you're being facetious
Other way around for me. I like the futuristic design of most android phones but I also like the software of iOS
I agree. I'm definitely buying it. Just shut up and take my money...
"@Environmentaly they we're referring to the flat screens of the S22 & S22 plus which makes it look like an iPhone 12 or 13. Although both S22 feel in the hand is better (and more comfortable) in my opinion, since their edges have a slight roundness"
Carl pei know how to make his brand stand out.
I will never switch from my iPhone. I need iMessage
"Great, except I never put my phone face down on a table, let alone shake it on a table unless I really want micro scratches 🤦"
"From the looks, so far is okay. One must say that is a clever idea, my hopes is that the battery life and software are decent."
"I have bad news for you, dude. 900 LEDs on the back by default means terrible battery life is pretty much guaranteed at this point."
Who will keep their phone with display down always?
Hahaha… I love his subtle shade at 6:30
"sounds familiar .... ? Yeah It was Oneplus cheating on their loyal fans, who supported the brand since it was a startup, with an invite system ;) shame on them"
"The ringtone led were insane well that is enough for me to buy, the most happy you can be to get a call even if its a bad news 😂"
Nokia 3220 did it better.
Might just be my new favorite phone design.
Get me the ability to unlock and relock the bootloader and I'll buy it. I know it's a very specific thing to ask but Pixels have it
Were the nothing ear buds any good?
6:28 One Plus it is...😐😐
"I’d say this is innovative, but not something the masses would use everyday."
"If in case people forgot, Nokia has done this sync of ringtone with LEDs way back with NOKIA 3220. It just retro is reshaping"
"Meh. A ""phone"" (a micro computer w/ internet, phone, and camera capabilites) is now just a ubiquitous tool, like a fork. No one cares about the latest fork innovation.

People just want an inexpensive tool that allows them to not have to think too hard about mundane tasks (putting food in your mouth or sending/receiving information).

The lights on the back are like the screen on the back of the Flip3. It's more a gimmick because if it wasn't there, it wouldn't negatively effect my life. 

Now if this new phone folded, had 512/1T of storage (or took a microSD card), and less expensive, it would be mildly interesting."
The back of the phone looks like something out of Tron
what a ripoff
"Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, will come close to the pizzaz of a Nokia 3220 receiving a call with Electric Eel set as ringtone."
finally someone uses the empty backside
This is honestly the only thing i am really excited about to be unveiled. Bc its either you heard about it/not. No one really cares that much about it. And thats uniquely freaking 🔥!
Front design need to be improve 📱for more uniqueness 📱
i wonder the battery consuption considering the led strips back on it.
This has uncanny similarity to iphone 12 and 13 models.. I think they have copied iphones for the most part
I hope for the best for the Nothing brand.
you don't know design if you think everything looks the same....
"If that much care and thought goes into all other aspects of this phone, it'll just need a ""good"" price to start building up a fanbase much like the OnePlus One did."
പൊളി ഐറ്റം
"If this was done by a Chinese company, people would have dismissed it as a gimmick. Don't waste ur money on this........."
Looks actually really nice bit i think it is a big missed opportunity not having RGB LED for notification purposes would be awesome. Still nice design.
"Just for the Iphone look I would give it a try if it is stock-like android, but this smells like OnePlus all over."
But where is the alert slider they were talking about ??
"I literally thought that was an iPhone - Apple logo and all, re-imagined. Is Nothing going into the 🍔 business as well?"
"At 3:50 the way it lights up it really lights up apple  you have the stem at the top corner the apple body with the bite in the middle 
Have seen other comments I dunno if anyone else caught this nod to apple"
Has it got the LGBT lights?
Such a interesting design I can not decide if I love it or hate it
"they sould name this phone as ""star wars"" or ""matrix"" bcuz it kinda came from movies!"
"Wow. Finally something that looks new rather than the usual glass slab.
If the phone doesn't come with compromises, definitely worth a look."
Does it come in black?
"I will never put my phone's screen on any surface. And then what, you have to wiggle it so show the battery status? Like, wiggle your screen on your table? Yeah sure, either I'll have to change my screen protector each month because of how scratched it will be, or I'll just ruin my screen if I don't use a screen protector (which I don't, because I don't put my phone upside down...)"
Isheep
Nothing's gonna change my love for you~
"Been using a OnePlus 7t since 2019, was thinking of shifting to a pixel the moment i get the android 12 oppo update. But I guess now I'll wait for Nothing."
Would have been better if the lights could change colors!
"Damn I've been waiting to hear about this product, glad to have the news come from the best tech youtuber"
"Should put ""this phone looks like NOTHING in the market"""
Ohh. Interesting. We'll see how they'll fair after 2 yrs when I'm ready to buy a new phone.
Where is the phone ???? I see Nothing !!!
It should have been called THE GIMMICK PHONE
I love the last attempt at PLEA (Or JAB at) to Oneplus. Lol
What a weird name
"Like the design just one thing either it need to be though or it needs a hi quality super clear case.
Be cause every modern smartphone is to fragile for my taste. One of the reasons I'm keeping my eye on fairphones(cheap easy to replace spare Parts)"
Interested in what the battery life is gonna look like
"Another brand that will go down the OnePlus route? Start by making interesting phones at competitive prices, then slowly kill all innovation, slap on a Chinese ROM and sell close to the price demanded by market leaders?"
He showed us front too
1:12 and 2:23 contradict each other? 🤔
so these are the phones which cannot be attached to a protective case.....almost the only hindering factor of this DOPE phone
Is there is  black color❓
I feel absolutely nothing for this phone. You get it? Nothing?
"Definitely something new and different from the competition. I think the more you are into tech, the more likely you are to buy such a phone. NOTHING itself seems like a brand name, especially for the enthusiasts out there while also doing something better than others which would also appeal a regular customer. And since they are not a part of a bigger parent company or anything, also with a cool CEO; I think they will not be totally mainstream and still keep features on their devices that will be for the original fanbase. This phone though, I loved it and can't wait for the other specs and price...!"
"It definitely looks like an iPhone with those metal borders on the case. Otherwise, still interested to learn more about their Android interface."
Bet you it's shite
This phone has already shown that it has a practically working and distinct design among all the phones out there. Kudos to the makers.🔥🙌
I like the idea of backside led's but I really don't like the shape they chose.
That ring-tone LED back is an Amazing feature for People with sound impairment ! 💙
Does anyone noticed that when he unlocked the phone there is a UNLOCK SYMBOL is slightly higher than usual that might be the finger print sensor PLACE😍
they took that notifications led thing from Asus M16 😂
Extremely gimmicky for a company that boasts heavily about challenging Apple and the entire phone industry.
Shots fired at one plus lol ahahah
"What happens when you put a case on the phone and the features on the back effectively become useless? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for innovation, but the true appeal to me is what's happening on the front. I love the look of my S22 Ultra, but I only see the back of my phone for like 1 minute every week while I'm cleaning it. You could use a clear case, but they are just not attractive; They always look so cheap."
Different like iphone xs with few gimmicky led’s.
"Glad to see that innovation is not completely dead, but I fear that this will only appeal to a thin sliver of enthusiasts and not be the commercial success they need for their first phone. Here's hoping though. 🤞"
Well... Only the transparency is unique to me... Even the LEDs themselves look like an Apple logo...
India m isko chhapri kehte h 😂
Who is the target audience for these hyped marketing initiatives? The mass?! I doubt if they care or even notice. And nerds like us would follow regardless.
What a disappointement
But how hot will the back of the phone get?? 🤔 With those lights
Dattebayoo 😛
Any Naruto fans here?
Interesting concept.  You would definitely need a clear case or else it makes no sense.  Price point will be a key factor too.
idk man looks like a phone to me
how are those ringtones not annoying? its a good tech product but not something someone will like in general
"99% of the people I know uses a case, its really looks like a normal android phone"
Wow looking first chin removed Android phone
I'm ready to go on a OnePlus journey all over again
"The real question here is, how long do we keep our phone face down during a normal day?!"
"Can a better grip, may be shape which fits my grip with curves not a rectangle can be a new things in phones"
"Damn, these Robot Ringtones"
It looks cool but to buy it i need to be reasonably cost and good specs. No point if the screen looks like doodoo
THIS PHONE!
Over rated phone. Who cares about a transparent back?? It's just a marketing GIMMICK.
"Dbrand has left the chat

A good looking design by the way !!!"
This is so cool
"Oneplus be like : "" पता नहीं ऐसी डेंजरस सिचुएशन में मैं ऑटोमेटिकली आगे कैसे आ जाता हूं""😂"
roasting oneplus:)
"MKBHD: I'm only allowed to show the back of the phone
also MKBHD: Shows the front of the phone anyway"
i hope they learned from Essential 🥱
Love the not so subtle shade at OnePlus 😂😂😂
I don't even know why notification LED's were dropped. It doesn't have to be all complex like this phone. One simple LED is all that's needed on the front or back of the phone.
they made cool version of airpods pro now they did with iphone 12
"This is what no one ask for and not worth the hype , instead of this give toy with phone thats all 
."
"I’m getting orgasm seeing this phone. This is like the best OnePlus-Apple hybrid design it could ever have been. Just give some aesthetic pastel colours plus Oxygen OS like UI and I’ll buy one for the design itself!! I love my OnePlus, I’ll love this one too.."
Nothing phone 1 👍🏻
Looks cool and they make clear cases so it just depends on if it still looks as crisp under a case because I'm not not gonna put a case on an expensive ass phone.
6:31 sound like Oneplus to me.
"This is the epitome of a gimmick for the sake of a gimmick. Does it look cool? Sure. I'm still going to prefer having a Spigen case around the phone compared to a few more lights to distract me.

Nothing should be focused on making a non-ugly phone that performs well, has relatively unobtrusive and bloat-free software, has a headphone jack (this would be an actual value-add for most customers), and is priced competitively.

If they're relying on gimmicks like this, then they've already lost me as a potential customer."
"buy the phone, put a case on it XD"
"This phone is actually really cool, out of ordinary without going too crazy like those custom designed Realme phones"
Nice bamboo to the one plus
"The backlight setting illuminating the subject of camera sounds cool, but is it worth it? The different patterns of lighting for notifying different things and customizable looks unique, again is it worth it? What genuine problems would this phone solve? I can't seem to understand the whole idea! Unique and being one of a kind is cool but there should be a definitive use case. Do most people keep their phones with back on top? Clearly this light settings would need that!"
Sound familiar = One Plus :P
Bro that's a cool custom iPhone 12
why can't apple just make a screen like that...
cringe phone...
But u still vote iphone 🤭
It was the NoPhone now it’s the NothingPhone wired huh 🤔 when your friend asks you what phone you are using. What do you say?
If this phone can stand next to my Oneplus 7 Pro. I'll go for this in a heartbeat.
I could feel the shade being thrown at OnePlus.
oh well the last few seconds describe OnePlus 🫡
I need that wallpaper!
Iphone killer
"for me a glass slab is a must, ditch those hideous buttons.  I still remember some phones, Samsung notably that have 3 physical buttons for the three basic navigation functions on ALL android devices"
Intrigued and skeptical at the same. More intrigued about how it will perform overall against the plethora of competitions. I'm a sucker for new innovations!
I WILL BUYYYYY. I WILLLLL. MEEEEEE
children phone 🤣🤣
"Don't konw why but this phone remind me of the old google's ""modularized phone"" whitch try to make smart phones more like a desk computer."
I'm using a realme 5 pro from the last 2.5 years and it's working perfectly smooth and the battery is great. But to be very honest. This Nothing Phone finally feels like a worthy upgrade. So I might buy this as soon as this comes out.
The LED ringtones look like an epiletics worst nightmare.
At 6:28 that was a OnePlus reference right?😂 I'm not sure
"Yes familiar 😂 OnePlus, iPhone  and every other disruptive phone idea 💡"
Just don’t feel that happy having my phone face down to get scratched all the time
Love that not so subtle dig at OnePlus at the end there!
"hope this turns up to be a good phone, i would like to have one"
"I like this. I'd check it out if has high end specs with competitive performance and price. Otherwise, I think it will be just another cool niche phone."
"""Nothing"" new."
Anyone knows the approximate screen size of the phone? i know marques has a big hand
When I first saw it I thought it was a iphone lol
It doesn't look that different my guy
Love it. Not sure if I'd go for it just yet. Still rocking an OnePlus but a second gen of nothing phone....
Nothing has impressed me more on a smartphone than the pop up selfie camera from the Oneplus 7 pro. Nothing. :/
Now this is making a Smartphone fun 👏🏿
*It's like Oneplus all over again!*
You can't tell me this is not an iPhone 12 of the Android with better hardware upgrades!
Nokia 3220 did it wayy better!!
How big is it?
I Thought It Was An iPhone Because Of The Back & The Shape Of The Phone
The Boring Phone... kinda makes me yaaawn
I never put my phone down with the back facing up so the led lights are pointless to me...
I feel this would have been a cool gimmick 10 years ago.
Then what is it now?
"They should give all users a rubber edge ""case"" with this phone.
Just so it has a protection by range while you put it on a flat surface like a table.

It looks really nice id say and that led functionally seems to very usable."
"I like apple design
And Android UI"
a case with cutouts for the LEDs will be good
Front revealed 😍
I don't respect copycats.
It looks exactly like an iPhone 12
I wish it should have snapdragon 870 or 865 instead of 7 gen 1 🙄
"Ok, it has my apple attention. Mmmmmm."
One plus *cough*
"For some reason this phone reminds me of the essential phone. Has the same spirit and hype. That was my favorite phone ever, might consider getting this one."
Ya. And it will remind people again like how essential phone died.
wow much unique such innovation
Damn
Sponsored by nothing?
They've taken the back panel to the next level! LED looks veryyy coooool! Someone is finally getting creative!! I'm bored of looking at the same old phones with same old design O.o
"Caption should be
""Nothing looks different"""
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY! 🙂
"Will this sell at HAMLEY’s ? 
Bcoz it sure looks like it belongs to a toy-store"
"Neat extra feature but the price, the specs, and the software would probably be more important imo.
 
It hard to get excited over an extra light on the back."
iPhone X camera setup and iPhone 12 body the design is a copy except back plate
If it's cheap will buy
I want to go into space with that phone!
What are they selling it for?
clear iPhone 12 with no notch looks wise
Expecting dotted case from nothing.. for that LEDs
"Sound familiar?... Yup OnePlus. Most of the original fanbase was brushed aside for a more mainstream device. Gather a small and loyal fanbase, make money, drop said loyal fanbase to appeal to a larger audience, Make even more money. I doubt there's a business out there that isn't orientated this way. growth is king."
"Definitely cool design aesthetics.
...could see myself admiring the back while my mind wanders. Question is, do most people place their phone face down?"
Yeah I guess most would do if they’re in a work place to remove the temptation. However I think this phone would “allow” people to face it down because they would usually have the face phoning up to see notifications since notifications are coming on the back now they would probably put their phone on the back now
아래로 향하게 될 겁니다 ㅋㅋㅋ
The subtle closing OnePlus reference was lit. Not surprising because this is coming from same school of thoughts.
Yeah sounds familiar:p
Reminds me a bit of my sony xperia sp from 7-8 yrs back
Nothing More Than New Design
Haha I see what you did there at the end. Very familiar indeed (:
Reminds me of the Tron Legacy design.
We can say it looks like nothing we have seen before...
"The phone looks like an iPhone only that it has a punch hole camera for selfies which is not symmetrical by the way, a USB type C obviously, an interesting design on the back,  equally sized bezels and chin which is more of an iPhone,  non curved display,  and circular rear  camera cutouts which is heavily inspired by the iPhone. 
I think they're trying to divert apple's market to themselves.  Lol"
It looks kinda like a FairPhone but also an iPhone
Oneplus standing in the corner...
Definitely i am buying 😊😊 all out for carl pie 👍👍👍
Awesome👏😊👍 📱📱📱
Reminds me of my Nokia 3220.. which i still use!!
"This proves that Apple just don't want to improve their design bc if Nothing can be this creative, Apple can be too."
It's Android phone with light mods.
"I hope it runs stock android, that would make it 10x more interesting for me"
"It would be sweet if a worker''s name at Nothing were Nobody. It would make a great joke: Who makes Nothing? Nobody.
That said, Nokia and Motorola did these things, was pretty neat."
"Useless 3rd class Phone, how this look different than other phone? Using led makes it different lol. Under the hood may this one also is rebranded phone from oppo or vivo. Design seems copy from apple and vivo."
Useless and annoying.
iPhone.
"I miss OnePlus when they used to make good phones so I hope that they'll do good with performance and quality with Nothing.
 I'll probably wait for the second iteration so they can smooth out all the problems they might have for now. Plus my OnePlus Nord is still going strong.
Oh and I NEED  the notification slider"
How does the battery hold up with those LEDs on the back?
I love the LED customization and uniqueness. This is something that Nothing should absolutely keep going with each iteration.
"I think the ""sounds familiar"" is OnePlus xD"
sounds familiar - Yes Oneplus
"I m gonna buy it
1. Unique design
2. Clean software experience
That's enough for me"
I don't think a light bar on back is a great highlight of this phone which will be nullify when a back cover is used
The sound of ringtones is like Nothing is trying to create a watch dogs phone
The phone looks like something straight out of a cyberpunk movie.
New feature: LED lights which will be covered with a case - nailed it
that lockscreen.
"sounds like 1+
🤣"
hi isheep
oh wow this is an interesting phone
It looks like an Iphone with the lights on the back stolen from the Samsung cases XD
i disliked the video just because of the shirt
"I whould buy it but the hole punch ruins it

The screen is a big downgrade from my OnePlus 7 Pro"
Чеее)) оч круто выглядит
When we thought there is nothing more to innovate in phones here comes one with multiple LEDs
Great....
Makes me think of the game mirror's edge. If they put some really small red elements on it....
To me it looks like an iPhone 12 if it came out in 2077 and that is not a complaint in the slightest
"Many people say the lights are a gimmick, but they work exactly as intended. They get everyone talking about the phone, and in public, they’ll also bring attention to the phone."
Front camera position isn't ideal should have been at the centre
"Question: is that a new phone, or is it really a 'designer iPhone'? And, what would be wrong with that?"
"I hope The pain they went to make it look neat in the back that is being transparent, will also reflect in their Software and Hardware too, But what scares me is that with all these additions, wouldn't it be hard to become a VFM product??"
Last portion reminds of OnePlus!!👀
Soo much effort put in the light and people are going to put a opaque silicone cover on it .
"it's an old style iPhone with a clear back and flashy lights, fking silly as shite"
I'm a simple bitch. I love the lights🤍{ ;)
Horrible. Just my view obviously.
6:10 you f'ed up 1+
Question is who is putting their phone display down?
I'm only allowed to show the back of the phone. Goes ahead to show the whole screen
Any emotional damage to OnePlus was purely unintentional.
Never really interested with the nothing until now.. thnx For convincing me!
"@Zarco i wasn't aware of the prices, but that sounds nice"
@Daniel What do you mean? Midrange in specs or price? Because price is confirmed to be between 300 and 500 USD. That warrants midrange specs.
"@Zarco I highly doubt that this thing will be midrange, not even Samsung bothers to offer cheap wireless charging on their A-lineup"
"@Zarco yeah Carl said that it's powered by 7 Gen 1 instead of 8 Gen 1.

They could squeeze more battery performance by putting a Snapdragon 600 series in there."
@Daniel Xperia pro I and 1mk4
"Just another Android phone. I can not see how they will compete with the Apple ecosystem, the iPad and watch are class-leading. The only problem with ios is the inability to block websites and apps in an app like Cold Turkey which is available for Mac OS."
Honestly their technology is awesome. Love it 👌
Paid promotion I guess 🙄the guy was trolling the shit outta nothing on a podcast 🤷🏽‍♂️ money baby is a weird thing..
"I'm more interested in knowing the overall configuration and performance of the phone. Keeping safety in mind, breaking your phone by accidentally dropping it, wouldn't you use a phone case?"
"MKBHD: sounds familiar? 
Oneplus: 🥹🫠"
So no 3.5 mm jack
The only phone review where the back of the phone has special section
Just reminds me of the origin set from valorant
so... leds. ok.
ahh .. the One Plus wibes
I'll buy
"They spent much time to make the phone's back look cool! I hope they spent even more time on making the phone's OS unique too. I personally stick to my iPhone 13 Pro Max, but great to see new manufacturers."
As OnePlus goes away from oxygenOs to shitOs... I want nothing phone to fill that oxygenOs gap with its software approch.
bet. Apple's wishing they made a glowing logo on their iPhone after seeing this video
Looks like _nothing_ else on the market! haha
They're definitely selling a transparent case which synergizes with the lights.
My favourite is the Battery led bar.
"The design of the lights on the back look like an apple with a bite taken out of it, plus the leaf"
"I wish the LEDs were RGB, so we could set-up a different color for every application. Might even be cool for colored flashlight photos? idk xD"
Who else is gonna make their ringtones spell out dirty things in Morse code?
Is it supposed to spell out coil
sounds familiar indeed
I think you meant to say ‘awful’ instead of ‘different’…
Back of the phone 😂
Sounds like One Plus?
Is that an iPhone 11?
That “sound familiar” at the end was a reference to which company?
I want it
sounds fimiliar to oneplus🙄...
You forgot to show the front of the phone
Shut Up and Take my Money!!😍
"If they launch below the price of OnePlus it'll straight up eat the market of OnePlus 
Atleast in India"
"Lel that C shape with the line up top is just like a minimalist apple logo, including the bite out"
Taking a dig at OnePlus?
"Whoa those LEDs in the back are super cool, I’m definitely in love with this phone already. Hopefully it won’t be a $1000 phone"
This is what a person in the 60s would imagine phones being like
closest we're gonna get to USB C on an iPhone😭😭😭
looks like a android iphone lol
"Yeah they are building the hype again, same OnePlus vibes."
5:53 Shots fired
I don't see an innovative functionality to those LEDs at the back. Users will get bored of it within days. Apart from that i don't think this phone has anything going for it now.
"Dang, oneplus took that last jab personal."
I don't get the design of the LED. Shouldn't it be N for Nothing and it's sort of symmetrical?
Most of the people use back cover on their phone so this is a bad strategy for a long run
That’s some dope features nice showcase
I want one...I'm sold for the design...and those lights...
The lights are cool but what about the battery consumption?
Taking shots at OnePlus
"I'm sure dbrand will still make a teardown skin of it.



I also can't wait for its teardown too ¬‿¬"
"Why to look on the screen who is calling, if you can just memorize a pattern of LEDs flashing on the back of the phone?"
it looks like an iphone
This phone with that stupendous looking ui replaced with custom rom would be so much fun.
Wow !
"If I put a case on it, it just looks like an iphone 12, nothing spectacular"
This is the nothing phone and what I'm allowed to show you is the back...immediately shows the front with the display on.
"No excitement, believe it will have moto kind of UI."
"Never thought I will say this, I want that ringtone"
"I'm actually awestruck! I've been thinking how phones have evolved to a point they look alike to the last generation. But DAMN, that's some smart design. No one's getting the phone just for the lights, so I hope to see new tech from Nothing soon. If the phone outperforms the others one in the price segment, in terms of basic smartphone performance. That'll be a switch for me."
@tatsukialmologist 👍
"@anjan Facts don’t care about your feelings. I’m telling the truth, it’s DOA."
@tatsukialmologist why be pessimistic when new tech basically means good for us?
Prepare to be disappointed!
daaammm. I love the look on this thing
@arifjay7 matte black with Sith lights 🔥🔥🔥
It's Nothing
"I wonder if Dave2d got an early copy, too."
Don’t hype it. It's just another iPhone clone with some minor changes.
wtf why you like this iPhone clone?
perfect phone for Apple design but android OS lovers
the back of it looks like the iphone had a baby with a dvd case
We would need a see through phone case for this one
Finally somthing cool... intresting
I had a flip phone that had led pattern lights on the outside.
iphone XS look and flat sides ...
The whole room will know when my mom texting now.
I kinda want one
"""Sound familiar"".... ""Never Settle"" but they did😅😅😅"
Rip back case
ok i am one step away from buying this phone. I really want to change amy current phone for the new samsung A53 but design wise i have fallen in love with the nothing phone 1 the only plus point samsung will still have is a better OS experience (4 year OS update vs 3 year OS update ) and i am not how stable updates Nothing will give. Yet i feel if the price is right i  will go for nothing phone 1
In my opinion it doesn’t look different at all. It’s an iphone with a clear back. A rectangle with a screen.
I am like don't we cover the back  off the phone  -_-
Am I the only one who was thinks that the ringtones sound... like absolute shit lol
All I see is an iPhone
Shots has being fired at you 1+
This feels like the OnePlus One of this decade. A new startup ready to create waves from ripples.
That was his dig at the end....I had a OnePlus One and a OnePlus X ... that was it...
@InSaNe HuSs31n carl pei left bbk because to get freedom on what he decides.
Only to abandon their fan base for more sales revenue. Permission to say Cancel Nothing? Because that's a confusing phrase.
Was OnePlus a start up? They're owned by Oppo from the start.
"@NonLegit Nation 2 you missing something. That niche ""Fan Boy"" is the reason the company still running, and when they left? Who gonna buy that phone?"
Software will decide what happens with this company
i love the freaking design
"""Different"" is the word that summarises the phone, be it the name or the thing itself."
Nothing?  What a name never heard of it before
"Certainly does have the shape of an iPhone 12 and the cameras look very, very similar. But, it also means I think it'll be the best designed Android phone imo. At least for looks. And if the rumored price is correct, it could be quite the deal."
apple is better ryt ?
What animal places their phone screen down??
"Title should be ""this looks nothing normal"" 😂"
"Oneplus is like :
🌚first time?"
"How big is the screen size though?  
It looks like it might be 6.4"" approx but if so it's a dealbreaker no matter how cool the phone is..."
cool and fresh idea
"This reminds me a little of my second phone, a Sony Xperia SP. Back in very early Android days (like, it getting an upgrade to Android 4 was a thing I remember) it was a budget-ish phone, and it had a small block of clear plastic along the bottom edge, with the frame wrapping around it, and multicoloured LEDs on the inside. It worked as a notification light, and as a visualiser when you listened to music on the preloaded Walkman app. 

In essence, it was just a gimmick. But because of that gimmick, I have fond memories of that phone, and I was very disappointed when Sony stopped selling their phones in Australia, making it really impractical for me to try and get my hands on one. If I was in the market for a new phone right now, I would be strongly considering this one, as long as it held up in the other departments."
"Did not say nothing about the nothing phone but LEDs

Just to be the first to show it. I espect much more from your channel."
There were already videos on Twitter. It wouldn’t be the first.
"So with this phone, you'll be needing to put your phone face down in order to see the notifications light. Not really a fan of that as I don't want my screen to be touching different surfaces."
A very unique and truly incredible phone!
Nothing has something interesting
"I thought it would have the same design as the nothing ear 1, the black and white one. Kinda disappointed in that."
"I love how Ringtones and Notification Lights have been finally given some life. FINALLY! But hope that the software is stable and familiar to use because I won't spend my money over just a REALLY good looking, aesthetically standing out back of the phone"
at least he shows the front in the start.
It would be cool feature when playing music and light bright up like disco lights with the beat of music.....not a great difference but in dark room it would work like a strobe lights...👍
Thanks Marques
I've got the buds. The software is absolutely AWFUL. I'll wait for the second version of both if I do need new buds/phone by then
Can they please make a bumper case?
"Very cool if I want iPhone designs but using android I can buy this, hopefully not that expensive"
Did he roast Oneplus in the end?
The lights are just a pointless gimmick. How about just having the phone facing screen up to see how much the battery has charged or who's calling you on the screen.
Sponsored  content.  And useless  hype. This company is not gonna last very long.
"I love the imagination and thought put in to the development of the phone, But the glaring question for me is....Will it come in ""BLACK""?"
Hopefully
The one plus satire bang on.
The LED Lights look fine ... but what about the battery with this feature?
Rokr e1 had led light stereo speakers that light in to rhythm of every song you throw in... Not just ring tones. In 2005
That subtle roast in the end🥲
This phone doesn't have 900 LEDs on the rear panel. Theres a maximum of 20 LEDs. Nowhere close to 900. LEDs are only so small.
"I'd prefer a single LED that had different colors and pulse patterns.
Not a huge fan of the transparent look, but I prefer it to other phones.
The LoL phone is actually nice, LoL branding aside."
"1:00, 1:50.  Alas, doesn't look like there's a headphone jack. Guess that would cut into their earphone business, but unfortunately that's a major turnoff for me. Hopefully they would have less-gaudy ringtones, too."
if it's under 600 i'll buy
The 🥊 at one plus. 😂
The ringtone called _coded_ (4:10–4:14) sounds like back in the day when you left a cell phone close to a speaker and before the phone started ringing the speaker caught interference when someone was calling
I wish they put colour led up at the top right  so that whenever there is a new notification it shows. you the dominant colour of that app eg blue for twitter red for YouTube and so on
take my money already.
Gimmicks... just give me a bigger battery
"I like that, it has the look of an iPhone, but the OS of Android. I'd buy that"
If they moved away from the iphone-esque design elements I'd be more itnterested
What a cool iPhone knock off
At 2.14
I am suddenly excited for this phone. Hope the camera is on par with the best ones in the market.
"......Doesn't sound familiar, can you remind us?"
I think that transparent back will go yellow after some time
Has a cyberpunk vibe to it
Nothing looks like NOTHING!
Cant wait to get it with a phone case!
Now thats something
@TRLEGRAM @Brownlee_Marques sure
"I think with what Oneplus did and eventually had to happen to them, android users have become more aware and in a way more cautious than ever. I think it's definitely a cool strategy to differentiate one's self from the crowd sure but it's never going be enough for where we are today. People will just gravitate towards a Samsung or a Pixel or go extremely reasonable with a Xiaomi. The expectations from a new entrant is unbelievably high."
Oh it’s an iPhone 11 but glowy
Gimmicks
Was that w tt table? 👀
"6:32 
MKBHD: Sounds familiar?
Oneplus: Did you call me? 
😅😅🤣"
I mean those ringtones and light displays are enough to get me to buy it
Fantastic job it looks amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Have anyone seen iPhone 12 without a notch..???
"Sounds familiar??
Laughs in OnePlus"
One plus no.2
They sent you one with cracked glass on the back?
It all depends on pricing
Nothing looks good
I’m interested in this. I think the light concept is awesome and love the diffused look. Considering grabbing one as my new dedicated Android companion to my iPhone.
"pure gimmicks, cool but total unnecessary. Do you know how else you can tell whos calling you rather than looking at the weird flashing lights on the back? Simply look at the screen 😅"
"Quastion is, is there a matte black?"
Apple :- I know you like….you like my shit…..
Hoping it's not a big screen @least 6.1/2 inch
"Yeah it looks cool, but that's it? I don't think one cool light system is attractive enough to urge people switch. Looking forward for more unique features and more ""Geek-like"" phones."
"Companies should be taught to launch compact phones 
Phones getting larger is of no use 
Customer are forced to go with it"
"So Nothing, the company that bought out Essential, finally made a phone. Awesome. Shouldn't it be called the Nothing Essential Phone? All those lights on the back are definitely not Essential."
It looks like iPhone
"Is it like a full-featured phone? I would buy a phone that has all useful app such as maps, calculator, etc but doesn't support any social media apps. I need that for dopamin detox"
Android X iphone
please be less than $499 please be less than $499 please be less than $499
and rootable!!
I feel when you have NOTHING to impress with you hve such GIMMICKY feature.
The design is basically Samsung + iPhone with a Xiaomi skin
so carl pei was behind the success of one plus..now he's doing nothing
"Nokia had a phone long ago that had disco lights around the body and it was attractive, and exciting but whats the use. Its just fancy and becomes boring very quick. Quick rise and quick fall."
"All I care about is: can it be rooted; how good is the camera array; what's the performance like; does it have a headphone jack. 

I don't care about wireless charging, waterproofing, fingerprint readers, high refresh rate displays or any superfluous feature that bumps up the price. I just want a phone that takes great pictures, runs smoothly and can be rooted, so that I can fully deGoogle it."
🤩
finally
@TRLEGRAM @Brownlee_Marques no
6:09 he is talking about OnePlus 😉
@TRLEGRAM @Brownlee_Marques hello mr spammer
Funky 90s vibe 🤣. Dope though
"I wanna see the flagship of nothing phones! 
After my OP 6T I might give it a try"
It would hav been nice to hav seen more colorful LEDs
"I can only show you the back of the phone.

1.5 minute later shows us the front by showing the software of the LED's... 😅"
If it comes under 30k I'll buy it 🥸🥸
"Question. Instead of them having like an LED indication like many android phones have at the top, Do they have that same glyph pattern on the front screen?"
software and chip and camera optimization is something no one is beating iPhone
"Love what they have done with the Rear panel and the LEDs. Giving them some actual functionality such as the battery level indication also seems like a good step. The ringtones on the other hand didn't seem like anything I would use, but would absolutely love using the lights for notification. 2:24 based on the UI, it looks like Nothing is indeed sticking to close to a Stock Android experience much like their Nothing Launcher suggests except for their ""dotted"" title fonts (hopefully that's customisable)? 

Minor details like the all round symmetrical display bezels and a rather convenient radius of curvature is also appreciated. Looking forward to what they have planned for the UX now."
"We don't really need those features 
But different from the rest 
Kudos for that"
"how did they manage to get away with this design, they basically made an android iPhone with a unique but not for everyone back."
6:32 Oneplus?
"what about color options ?
Is dis mobile phone safer to use without any case ?"

All these see-through things make me think about prison TVs.
So they stole JerrRigEverithyng tranparent back idea and skins...............
Yea cuz we all want the phone with full back flash light on it can't wait to see nothing lmao
no i will not buy it lol
"Sound familiar 🤣. 




OnePlus OG fans crying in corner"
"This is probably gonna be the next phone I get, this is actually so insane"
IT'S A FLASHY MOVE FROM NOTHING....
6:33 definitely OnePlus😅
6:32 OnePlus!
"""Sound familiar?"" **OnePlus flashbacks**"
DOPE!!!!
I already love it
How do I set the camera?
It's dope 👌🏻
"One Plus ,,,,,, Sound familier????"
Bakwas gimmicky phone
that dig on OnePlus though.✨
it's an iPhone with a holepunch camera
I will get this phone if it is made for me
The new 1+
"""I'm only allowed to show the back of the phone""
*Shows the screen, front camera, and the vessels*"
"Overall, it looks exactly like an iPhone. But with some lights."
Nostalgia feels like OnePlus
This is what happen when an iPhone and a OnePlus phone gets left alone in the same room
interesting.
"Yeah, the clear back is really neat, but a serious question now. Why do so many people talk about missing the leds? How could an led be possibly better than an AOD?"
If I had money I would get every one of those nice looking phones. l really like the Naruto one... The league of legends brings.... memories.
the last words were such a thug life moment.😂
Those are fairly thick bezels.
Software experience and camera that's what i looking for long term.....
"Lmao. Another gimmick phone. Custom light patterns to let u know who's calling you. How about flipping the phone and u looking at the actual screen instead?
All these features are on the back of the phone like wtf."
Definitely the coolest ringtones ive heard. Really cool phone. The conveying info with the led is a winning idea.
iPhone 12 Clone
At least they giving something new 😎 boring apple .
Will this phone have a matt black version
iPhone 12 with a clear back lol
Nothing new I guess.
This is the most interesting new phone I've seen in a while.
"I like the hole idea of the ""Nothing phone"" but software is the most important part"
I love the way it looks but not enough to make me buy it. I'm currently rocking the OnePlus 9 Pro
No fps ?!
This phone looks like a whole machine
Nice shade on OnePlus
"ehhhh, to me it's a bit useless. I'm never putting my phone down upside down, I don't want to scratch the screen if the table is dirty or something. 
I like the look, but the functionality is meh."
Did you really make a whole video just to show us the back of a phone?
I guess he's talking about Oneplus at the end
Man. This company is interesting
Looks like those Transparent 3rd Party controllers lmao
"”What I’m allowed to show you is the back of the phone”
* shows the entire front and screen while demonstrating the ringtones😂
Cool phone, though"
"""A new feature"".... Mfs with their Nokia lights sounding loud AF"
At 3:10 those LEDs made your skin look a little green. I hope they're 95+ CRI.
"I'd buy one for my kid, but i just remembered i don't have kids 😂"
Is no one going to comment on how the Nothing phone quite literally looks like a transparent iPhone? And didn't Apple have a patent on rounded bezels?
"I would love to get this in black color, if the other specifications and software experience is good, atleast competitive."
"Imagine buying a phone where the most distinctive feature is LEDs on the back, that will be covered up by a case anyway"
That screen will be trashed in a month :S
No oneplus was dissed here
is this phone the same dimensions as the iphone 12 ?
"If I had a phone that has a notification light, I would either turn it off or hate the phone"
Phones are getting way to good these days that i'm really intrested in more fun stuff like this.
"In my opinion, the only thing they've gotten wrong with the design is the side rail — it's too iPhone-y. And Carl Pei had a much better design with the OnePlus X's grooved side rail."
We’ll the case company is brainstorming the idea right now how to build the case without covering those light…
"2002 is calling, they want their 10 built-in polyphonic ringtones back."
"Maybe they could have given it something I wanted, like a headphone jack."
This looks promising.
Why did I think this was a sequel to the nophone
"Another gimmicky feature, i don't see how it matteres or make the over all experience any better, now we have to decode a lighting pattern to know who's calling just flip the freaking phone there's a 5 inch screen displaying the name of the person right there on it because thats what normal humans  do. MKBD would sell shit if he was being payed for it."
Lol yeah totally need a phone that has LEDs on the back. That's exactly what was missing in the smartphone market.
"I think I'm ready for a new operating system, an alternative to ios and Android, something different. It's time."
Looks like a combo of iPhone (back) and Pixel (front)
literally looks like an iphone with an aftermarket transparent back
"Ahh man! ""This phone looks like NOTHING else"" would've been such a better caption 😭😭😭😭"
Powerbook in the background 😩
Just looking like an modified iPhone 12
"New phone highlight: ringtones.
What a time to be alive."
Ya... let's slap a cover over it and use it.
Android companies still copycast Apple… 🤦🏼‍♂️
Its looks awesome
"Here's the thing, AMOLED screens can light up individual pixels. Why don't we have notification lights on the screen? Even if it's the old school BlackBerry notification light... It's something possible with an AMOLED Display. 

Also nice one Nothing. Let's see how people receive Phone 1."
Loved the bit on OnePlus changing their ways 😅
That take on OnePlus at the end….. Sick burn 😝🔥🔥🔥
"If this phone has stock Android, it's going to be a tie between the Motorola Frontier and this for me. It's time to put down this Google Pixel 6."
Awesome phone
MKBHD is talking about OnePlus in the last 30 seconds 6:00
All the features are gone when we put a case on it
"6:07 to 6:32, he referring to One Plus, right?"
history repeats itself just like the oneplus
Phone is dope.
We will anyway put case on a phone! Unless they give options for cases too...
6:07 *oneplus* 🤣
Nice phon but price kya aspect kre
With the recession coming they might be as popular as the red phone was
i am just having fun watching these type of videos even knowing that i wont be able to buy something like this atleast not in a decade
Sounds very familiar 6:30 ONE PLUS
"Will people really fall for this led gimmick? Is this a distraction to cover up for actual issues on the phone? 
I will be shocked to see people really falling for smart led phone overlooking the actual product."
this is what the iphone screen should look like ..
Btw I was just marvelling at their smooth Android version... It looks so smooth..
Can't wait to look at the OS and camera system.
Really enjoy the LEDs on the back. Nice glow
Now anyone will buy a phone that have powerful chipset and fast charging and good quality cameras
"The Backlight thing ""900LED's"" is all gimmick, they could have made this feature in display itself, OLED is capable of it. 
Sad to see an startup company coming with dying concept
Nothing Phone1 got ""Nothing New""
I'm sure deep down you too agree with my point Marques"
I dont interact with mobile to its back pannel !
"One thing the Android guys or for that matter any smartphone user will be wary of, is the fact that the lights at the back shouldn't be a battery geezer in which case most will shut it down. I don't use 70% of my Samsung phone features for which I had originally purchased the phone like AOD , CUSTOMISATIKN ETC battery issues later on."
"The phone is interesting to look at, But I like your  'Sound familiar' part😅✌️"
"Looks good , would like to see the camera"
"""Nothing is done""
Feels so weird when Nothing comes up with a sentence.."
One plus trigged
"With the founder of Nothing being the one behind OnePlus too, I'd say they already have a headstart in the startup market. If their software doesn't have bloatware, and the hardware is premium, I'm straight away switching from my S22U. Because, tbh, no matter how expensive, and powerful your smartphone is, it can't break the laws of the OS, which will always be limited. So a cheaper option with some much-needed premiumness would be my pick."
gimmicky at its best
"Well, that's one(plus) way to do it."
Love this phone design !
I thought we are only allowed to see the back of the phone??
900 led's? Bye bye battery life
Definitely looks amazing 😍
"I would not be surprised, if customs seize imports of this phone for being an iphone imitation."
Couldn't you turn on the phone?
Definitely an interesting idea that probably just serves for a unique group of audience. Anything game-changing? Nothing
Awesome phone!
if this has good software and good battery life im getting it
hmmm if there's 256gb below the price of 128gb iphone se 2021 im in
Sound familiar 🤣🤭🤭oneplus yes @MARQUES
"Like most of android, gimmick after gimmick that’ll be around a year or so."
"I am excited for the potential for customizing notifications for deaf customers, especially for integrating with apps like ring or nest. I will also be interested to see how the lighting impacts photography. Awesome video!"
@April Marie nah they can literally just do the same thing by only turn on part of the oled display when notification come in and achieve the same thing as the led light on nothing. The power consumption would at least almost the same as using the back LEDs
"@Fantasytky Current iPhone user here who relies on their phone all day for work. If I used AOD, my phone would make it probably only an hour. Not everyone can be plugged in or connected to a power bank all day. And also, I can’t stare at my phone all day. I need a way to know when I’m getting a phone call or text at any time. The current flash system works for that because I can see the flash from across the room or out of the corner of my eye. But it is blinding if I forget to put my phone face up for example. 

Please keep in mind that existing systems (including accessibility features like the flash I described above) may not work for everyone. Or at the least they could be improved."
Lol you literally have the whole front display to do that or through aod. Literally pointless to add the white colour led at the phone back
"@Sergey Zakatov he did say there will be a couple other colour options, they could even change the colours of the lights eventually or just have ones that are capable of changing colours, thereby increasing it's usefulness and application."
@Sergey Zakatov I suppose they chose white cause it fits the Monotone Design of the Phone
A headphone jack would have made me concider this phone.
Nice 👍
GIMMICK PHONE
It's Carl Pei. Marketing is his Oxygen (OS).
6:07 -> 6:27 divide and conquer 😑
"Nothing, in a few years might just end up being the flagship killer oneplus was. The oneplus we all loved and adoredd!"
🙄 I noticed something abnormal I unsubscribed
The UI seems preety clean
"All they show is the back so far. It's cool, sure but remember that they overhype stuff like crazy. Wait for proper detailed reviews and then decide."
That light at the back as a fill light is a brilliant idea
Loved that rant to OnePlus at the end.
Hope it doesn't flop. It looks lit and I'm really considering buying it whit only knowing the looks
"6:24 Hinting towards OnePlus was great, considering Carl Pei is the founder of Nothing as well.

If it pulls away some customers then surely it’ll be another OnePlus."
If its not owned by a chinease super corp and the android is minimalistic with no sucky bloatware apps and if the camera and specs are good i will buy one
You just showed the front too lol
This one is kind of fire I can't lie
The one thing bothering me is that the punch hole camera is not centered in the corner of the screen... For me it's ruining the otherwise very symmetrical apple-like front. 0:13
"This is literally the marketing strategy used for children's toys. It has to have lights and sounds and all of this ""cool stuff"" that appeals to a kid, and then for real its just cheap plastic and literally nothing new, just another throw away disposable toy. That at least, is what this looks like to me."
Sounds damn familiar! RIP original oneplus
This is worth the hype we've had for all these months.
Marq there is nothing appealing with a phone that looks like an iPhone with lights!
It's a class apart ❤️
"The nothing ear 1 buds had terrible qc, I had and returned two pairs that sounded like there was a mosquito in each ear bud. This complaint is all over reddit etc, very disappointed with reviewers for not picking this up. Not going to trust their phone!!"
Doesn't those LED lights take a toll on the battery?
This is cool
"Highly on ""the nothing looks different"""
Phone of the year goes to ....NOTHING
Shiit hope you guys dont have photoepilepsy ;)
"Honnêtement quand j'ai vu la photo pour la première fois, je pensais que c'était un technicien qui avait déguisé l'iPhone 12"
"""I am only allowed to show the back of this phone!"" 🤣🤣🤣"
SUPA DUPA
this phone is really great for people who use droidcam for webcam
I didn't think I'd see any phone innovation until...
Wow 😯 something new on back side …. Cool 😎 need to hand on experience
If this phone actually performs well with a good camera.... I kinda need this
2:01 remember the HyperX RGB SSD that overheated because of the LEDs? That had 75 of them. Imagine the heat ouput of those NINE HUNDRED LEDS.
"Sounds familiar?
yes sir, The one plus reference."
"tell me who's going to use without a protective cover anyways its gonna hide the appearance it has, how will 'nothing' encounter this?"
Sounds familiar?
"Alternate title: 
Nothing Phone: A Differently Familiar Phone."
i just saw to insta posts and 2 yt videos about this phone. Does that mean the embargo has run out?
iPhone 12 china copy
"there products look way too close to apple... which makes it familiar, but kinda bad that they copy"
rather have a cover with led
"The real question is, will this phone be enough to convince me to not throw my One Plus 8T in the trash where it belongs and buy the iPhone 14 after 10 years of continuous Android use over the course of 6 phones?"
"Brilliant brilliant video this time. Most people will comment. I will write why I liked it better than most videos of MKBHD ( he certainly doesn't need my validation, anyways)
A) There was no fan boy drooling
B) The most distinct feature was given lot of screen time 
C) That split screen render of the ring tone must have been hard work but was super dope
D) That veiled Oneplus disclaimer at the end 
E) He also in a veiled manner told us that apart from these, the rest of the phone maybe slightly underwhelming"
Looking cool but wht is the price in India ?
Always wondered why they've left LED notifications behind.. also the LED on back its way too good for recording or photography :)
"@Fantasytky I'm not even talking about that. LED notifications used to be in front side of the phone at the top, I've had a couple xiaomi's with that, but then they just gave up. The back LED as a notification led its not that useful because as you said phone needs to be laid down with screen facing down, but, in a photographic manner it looks great. Especially if you can change the light instead of being completely white.."
Because it literally pointless to put led behind the phone when you have the whole display or area at front for that without stupidly put your phone display facing down and scratching it
What is the location of the Punch hole front camera ? Center or Left ?? 🙄
I like that OnePlus reference at 6:30 minutes. 😂
iPhone 12 with transparent back 💀
Can the LED change colors ??
"cool, but I don't see the point because most of us will put a case."
Wow. Love the multiple LED design. The Ringtones with the LED effects look so good. Even the charging effect looks good. Can’t wait to get hands-on with this.
What if I told you there’s millions of LEDs in the front part of your phone 😝😝
"all of this is cool....but one question...

WHY ARENT THE BEZELS UNIFORM"
@Shellyman Studios That would have been so sick right!!!
@Shellyman Studios i think they wanted to keep it minimalistic
Right? Now i wonder how useful that is lmao or just bigger gimmick ever
"for me this is an iPhone with android, I would buy one."
I look forwards to nothing from this phone.
"nice features and nice design, curious about the event"
Is it just me or  do you guys also think the camera at the back looks like the iPhone 11/12
"This phone is ""nothing"" to sneeze at.






Don't cancel me pls"
"6:32 Sounds familiar?  OnePlus😁
Really sad many companies do that they forget their fan which leads them to uncertainty. Also sometime sticking to same also disappointing but what really matters is how the fan are reacting. I have seen people disappointed and no one cares so, it also play a part in falling of a brand."
The phone looks so tron-ish
"I hope there are some better ring tones cause those are all awful. The light show is cool though. Kinda reminds me of Samsung's edge lighting customizations, but for the back. But I like having a case so it's all rather worthless for me. I never put my phone face down either cause it's basically useless that way if I want to actually use the phone. Looking forward to see the rest of the phone though. Hopefully the back isn't it's only trick"
"Ok the uniform bezels look impressive, finally some other phone doing the Pixel 5 look. Hopefully we get a black Nothing Phone as well"
Look Like similar iPhone 11 but Design is So So Amazing
RIP Apple and Samsung… yeah sure lol
The clear iPhone 12 looked so much better. This looks tacky AF.
Nice taunt to ONEPLUS. 😂
Lit back light 🔥 but is it me or does it look like the outline of an apple with a bite and a tilted leaf at the top? 🤔
Interesting. An actual clear case that actually protects the phone from drops like a Spriggan case would complete that. I have a missing finger that helps me drop crap a lot lol.
They finally mixed Apple and android
The nothing phone looks pretty cool tho ngl. If it ships with stock Android or something similar to the OG oxygen OS and is priced properly it makes it a really compelling purchase.
We want RGB LED Lights !!
"Its the coolest phone I've seen in a while, BUT are people actually going to place their phones on the table screen down with all the scratch risk? No."
"Well, I  must admit the design and the originality are really dope. Good job Carl Pei and Nothing."
That design is really cool I must say.
"I'm a two phone guy. I've been on annual iphone upgrades for about five years (it's my main device) but I tend to stick with my androids for a while, because I'm a lot more picky with those. Right now, I'm still on the oneplus 7t pro, the mclaren one, and honestly, I really love it. Wish it had wireless charging, but overall, I love it. Every new phone that comes out just... doesn't really seem impressive? I was really looking forward to the pixel 6 and considering that for an upgrade, but that was obviously a mess of a phone. I just like that sort of stock android experience.  Oneplus has just been so disappointingly normal lately. They're not unique anymore. But this definitely has my attention. Really looking forward to reviews of this. Might be my next step up."
I want this
"Easily the CyberPunk 2077 official phone. The style, ringtones and leds are inspired or influenced by this style. 
Also it seems like a new Essential PH-1 era of 2017 all over again. Modular connection with unique features and add-ons but didn't lasted long... I hope this stays and evolves."
I miss the phones' light indicator.
"I would get this if it was a middle ground between Apple and Android. I love my blue messages but Apple has been so conservative lately with new *useful* features, it’s all just aesthetics. I think it shows how conservative they are when we’re all freaking out because we can finally change a font on the lock screen."
"Surely people would just use  MP3 file to set their own ringtone. Plus battery percentage is better than a flashing led on the back. 

It's a tough market if it's midrange handset, as Samsung seems to have that covered with the A series which I believe is their biggest selling range"
This in a video about nothing.
Literally nokia 3220
A good paid video which is without disadvantage and without opening the phone and using it 😹
"The new oneplus, but not under the BBK company, so i wish they will stay as they are promising"
4:10 - 4:13 Goddamn! The anticipation of an incoming sms or a phonecall during the early cellphone days
TLDR: use a clear case for this phone
When will  companies stop advertising entertainment and give us real new technology with phones?
Who is from India 🇮🇳 ‼️
"BEAUTIFUL drop of tech right there 👌 ..i think we're soon just gonna have screens on both sides though 🤔 ..and if the industry goes that way, it'll certainly kill off most of the hype from them customizable back leds. 
All the same though, I hope there's many more versions of this to come 💪"
Nice oneplus jab at the end
"also, the LED layout looks like a modern and simplified version of the apple logo"
I saw an article about this phone on Phonescoop. Glad to see content coming out about it! 👍🏼
"Wtf?? I really don't understand how it is even a ""breakthrough innovation""?? Too much hype..but the product itself is meh.."
"That is cool, a Tron phone.  Finally something new in a smart phone"
"“I’m allowed to show the back of the phone”. 

1 minute later, shows the front 😆"
"I don't think it will look that cool with back covers. 
Also I personally prefer the Specs and features over appearance."
One plus 🤣🤣🤣
That ending felt like a warning lol
""" Oneplus was not harmed in this video . """
My first thought 0:07  what he just did it he showed the front 😍😍😍
Those notification sounds are pretty rad ngl
Just like the Nothing Ear 1 black version of this would be more dope as those lights would be more prominent. Icing on the cake would be if those LED's can change colors.
When you see over engineered phone
Pixel 5/S22 front + iPhone 12 back🤷. But let see how the software experience and support hold up.
"Very interested. One Plus's management has demonstrated plenty of times that they know the market they are going in, and I've always come so close to buying their phones. I'm a pixel fan, and I won't switch ever as long as the ecosystem isn't at least at the same level (Headphones, phone and watch) but I'm very hopeful towards their develpement in the next years."
"2:25 hm, i thought you said we could only see the back... (p.s front cam holepunch in the corner = no sale. why?)"
"i want to buy it just because the design is the ""correct"" iphone 12 design"
This thing looks DOPE! I’m not putting my iPhone away for it but I like it. Looks like a clear iPhone.
I like how you are hinting towards one Plus by saying sound familiar
"3:03 ""whe"""
"They literally just looked at the iPhone 12 and probably thought like ""why the hell do Android manufacturers put like 17 useless cameras on the back?"" and so they also only do Dual cameras an made the bezels symmetrical - like Apple did with their very first bezelless model in 2017...

Your comparison to ""what a clear iPhone 12 would look like"" is also off since the Nothing phone also looks like this from the inside... they simply put some white stickers on top of the components and you could easily do that on an iPhone too."
I thought that was a new iPhone at first
"Not the smallest Bezels, but they are uniform at least🙏"
An iPhone 12 without the back glass…but the Led & its features looks cool….
"please let nothing know that if they'll provide or sell a clear case, don't let that case turn to yellow over the time. this is why love/hate clear case."
At the end talking about 1+ ? Hahahahah
could you do a review on the naruto phone. it looks interesting
"FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS BROKEN AND REPAIRED IPHONE 12, LATER I READ THE CAPTION. SOMETHING UNIQUE AND NEXT LEVEL TECHNOLOGY NEVER SEEN BEFORE"
"In real life, this phone is legit mesmerizing on the back, I can see the appeal, but it's still a risky move for which that specific product is made, but also I kinda wish there will be a black version of the phone(1), that phone is really a different class of it's own right, mostly I dig it with the software front since I'm using a Nothing Launcher installed on my phone. This is early OnePlus vibes that I witnessing right now.

I don't have high expectations around the hype, the company should make it or break it from the launch of this phone by next month, I needed to wait and see how the company matures overtime."
Looks like an iphone to me lol.
if they don't f up the battery and the camera and if it's not buggy I would buy it.
Nice to see something consideing the fact NOTHING has done..
"To answer your question on whether people gonna change to Nothing ecosystem is that i cant see it , since Carl Pei himself make the phone exclusively available in the market , it'll be hard for people to grab their chance to experience the whole thing to be able to change to Nothing"
it looks fantastic
Enough of watching front… now it’s turn to watch back of the smartphones
🤑🤑🤑
Isn't the nothing phone just some second company oneplus has?
Got the OnePlus reference
This will absolutely kill the iphones 😂
It's an iPhone 🤣
I see we're taking shots at OnePlus huh?  good one LOL
"Looks like iphone 12, but better"
my ear1 automatically paused it by itself and there is a huge difference battery on both the L and R buds(like 20% diff)...now ive lost my trust on nothing
That looks like cyberpunk kinda shi
Hmm 🤔 not interested in this ! Unless 💀🙏
"Is this going to be anything more than basically 'bells and whistles' though? And are consumers swayed at all anymore by cool extras over getting the basic fundamentals right first?
Let's wait and see!"
6:29 Sounds familiar? Yes! OnePlus
"If this Android records videos like iPhone, I'm buying this!"
This kinda gadget exists to give journalists and reviewers something to write/talk about every once in a while.
Take this back in time with you and you'll be a god
"I like this phone, i will buy this noo doubt"
Something wrong with sound at 3:02
looks clean
wait is that just an Iphone 12 but android?
First thing we should appreciate for build quality like iphone no other android phone did it before i like it👌🏼👌🏼
The offset punch hole ruined it. DOA phone
"Hey the ringtone lighting might be good for the deaf i guess.
BUT it is kind of a gimmick otherwise."
"so now I can be distracted from the Notifs when it's upside down, great."
You're the best Marques!!! <3
This phone is so sick! Really love it. I'm waiting for the review...
"How about we get an everything phone? 
Top notch specs, amazing aesthetics, amazing camera quality, and it’s own OS. Let’s get something different from android or iOS."
"""Sounds familiar""? - I loved it
Sent from my 2014 OPO"
Dude i will set some of those weird ringtones to give flashbacks to my vietnam veteran grandpa
"@3:44 How did he control the other phones backlight using the phone in his left hand and yes I have thaught of the idea of opening the settings at the same time but still it's worth noticing the accuracy. Was this a glimpse to nothings ""ecosystem"""
case manufacturers 👁👄👁
The shaking of the phone while is charging with the face down is so stupid.
"My concern is it's After Sales Service and Updates
- 🇮🇳🇮🇳"
no lightsaber ringtone? come on
"1:11
What I am allowed to show you, is the back of the phone...
2:23
Proceeds to show the front.."
00:12
What oneplus was at the start...and what it is now...The same will happen with NOTHING too... There is nothing wrong about it... The cycle would continue with new companies taking the said direction... We as customers do need to make sure we are not a FAN of a particular product to make sure we do not get hurt or disappointed with the strategy of the company. BE A FAN OF THE PRODUCT INSTEAD OF THE COMPANY. 👍
Dbrand😛
Looks like a cheap chines phone
One plus is crying in the corner 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Reminds me Nokia 3220
An iPhone-looking phone loaded with gimmicks.
Nothing is different.
"Good looking phone. Deal-breaker for me is. Can I replace the right tones? I've been using ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" ring tone since 2004 and i'm not relacing it with anything."
Does it really matter how a phone looks? Anyone who buys a phone is going to have a case on it
"The design is interesting, but to be a player nowadays you need camera. Essential phone came up short with the camera, even though the phone was interesting and unique. Camera depends on a high level software team, the Pixel series proved camera hardware is very secondary to image processing software. So if Nothing gets the camera into the top tier at a reasonable price, they've got a shot at success. The design factors are a bonus, but not anything completely new - just exaggerated versions of features already tried out by now-defunct makers like HTC (remember the quasi- see through back on the blue U12+?)"
Sounds familiar ONE PLUS ?
this thing looks like it's from Bladerunner and I'm into it
I wonder what's the ratio of people putting down their phones like that. I never put down my phone like that so this feature is useless to me. Give me a single notification LED in the front and I'll be good. So many things lost and compromised because of the screen-to-body ration stupid fad.
"Oh yeah, rub the front of the phone against a surface to check your battery. Seriously who even places their phone facing down? Isn’t it obvious that it is a bad idea?"
that phone is so hot
I thought this was an iPhone 🤣🤣🤣🤣
"What is the price?
Mkbhd"
"I am getting mixed feelings about this phone. On one hand, its something unique, but on the other hand, it is just another phone running android"
"Are the design and ""gimmicks"" enough to sell this??"
They copied iPhone
Honestly ... just ... Meh!
I'd consider this but as a phone case
"Honestly I don't care how my phone looks. Probably, I have the most average looking phone in Samsung S20+.
But, the software and the user experience is top notch. No problems whatsoever. 
Enough of marketing, tell me what's inside and how good it is"
Dual embargos suck
"looks insanely cyberpunk, i love it"
"I'm going to be brutality honest
The display is disappointing.
The display killed the device
I thought I'll look like an iphone 12 with a center hole punch"
One thing i know. would definitely buy one when it comes out
Do people charge their phones facing downward? 🤯🤯🤯🤯Or is it just me who always don’t wanna ruin the screen? The back of this phone is cool tho.
It's nice but damn. The squared edges make them look like they are trying to be apple so bad.
I feel like the nothing phone is to the iPhone as the Eve tablet is to the surface
can't use this phone when I'm about to sleep
So you saying you are dumb enough to not put it into silent mode or mute light notification ?
"If you're after a small phone, get a Jelly or Jelly2 from Unihertz."
"looks awesome, I would definitely be interested in buying one if the software is clean and the customer service is ok"
Is it all about light? Hype is real
IPhone X with transparent back and fancy LEDs.
"Looks super gimmicky. Also, most of those ringtones gave me a headache."
most annoying ring tones of all time
C3PO!!!!
They are just copying Apple shamelessly.
doesn't matter🥱
"this just remind me of some first Xperia lineup that's so unique. and They just made it bolder and sexier
this is a very good first impression"
trying to promote a piece of shit🤣
Transparent iPhone lol so original
❤️❤️❤️ just
Just showing me the back of the phone? No thanks
"The ring tones are so alarming and robotic sounding, it isn’t pleasant."
I've got the earbuds and I'll be buying the phone love the look of it.
thinkpad in the back is prolly the next replacement of the mac studio.
Can’t for 2050 where phones would like tpains phone in 5oclock.
Would be nice if u could make custom light patterns for your custom ring tone
This phone would look so sick in black!
"what a ""nothing"" review, pun intended. like who gives a crap about the led notifications even one week after purchasing a phone, I mean it looks cool but does it warrent a video on the subject? come on man you're better than this buzzfeed level reviews."
Definitely looks a lot better than the iPhone 12. The punch hole should have been in the middle to appease android warriors tho.
i feel like this is an embargo
This is iphone 12
cool another android that looks like an iPhone
Amazing design
Love the look just need it in black
So its literally nothing to care about.
Abandoned the original fan base 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"It doesn’t look different, it looks annoying af."
If cameras are good and os is also good like their earlier oxygen OS it will be a hit
it’s nothing like the iPhone
I wondered if the lights was rgb or colour customizable🥲 but still unique
Omfg for a startup phone this is amazing 🤩
Ironic as it sounds but I'm expecting a lot from Nothing.
"No pop-up camera, even though they acquired Essential's pop-up patent 😥
Until the pop-up comes back, I think I'll stick to my OnePlus 7 Pro"
Seems like transparent iPhone 12 without iOS inside with (lets say) not pleasant ringtones. Why?!
lol at the last part
That cool LED back is something a fancy feature phone back then would have. And finally. I thought it's gone for good.
i love my ear 1 and i would definetly buy this if they offered a black version
0:20 MKBHD in Nothing's dotted font 👀
"_""Nothing.""_

The cheeky answer to ""what's that device in tour hands?"""
All of that lighting can be achieved in an always on display. Plus I won't have to always flip my phone upside down to use this feature and flip again to operate the screen. Its just extra work and will eventually make me not use those lights at back so that I can access my screen quicker.
As they give more phone cost will also increase every time 😂😂😂😂😂😂 OP strategy
i believe in carl pie ...this nothing will be next oneplus
I think the most important part of selling this phone is promotion. If no one knows about and it's not readily available it doesn't matter what the phone looks like or what it can do.
"im trapped in the iphone ecosystem. 
im bummed about it too, i used to love my unique and innovative android phones."
July 12th is my birthday
"Damn, It looks really cool in my opinion."
"It has LED lights, cool."
I had rear LED notification on my LG G2.. sad they don't make phones anymore.
The Nothing Phone Mini would be dope
so it the light are only white colour or you can change the rgb of the back of the phone i have asus rog phone 2 phone so it allow me to change the back light colour so i dont know about this phone
I'm holding out for the Qphone.
I would LOVE that t-shirt design as a wallpaper
3:47 ❤️‍🔥
Do you mean ONEPLUS at 6:33?
"This is a great phone, considering the refreshing look and the cool LED display which is all the rage these days, even though it looks similar to the 12 it’s still unique in its own way and I say it stands a chance 😂"
The OnePlus reference tho🔥🔥
can't wait to see the aftermarket cases for this phone
"Design aside, I personally believe the only thing that matters will be the camera...
I don't think people see any other reason to switch their phone nowadays unless another model has an amazing camera or under display tech. otherwise why bother. I could be wrong, but if I were nothing I would put everything I've got into the camera performance, it's already a let down to ""only"" see two cameras instead of three (I know this makes no sense to call it a letdown, but I do believe that people see 2 cameras and automaticaly subconsciously think about the  ""old iphone 12"" stadard...and  3 cameras as the ""new pro"" standard. Like I said I could be wrong but I think that descision alone could leave the phone seeming (not actually beeing) but seeming subpar to newer models"
sounds familiar   ‘ one plus ‘ phones
The final verdict was dope.
"Sound familiar? 6:32

Yep. OnePlus Deja Vu"
"looking at you right there, oneplus."
Sounds familiar?
The LED feature is definitely unique 💯
"Well basically they made the whole back ""unique"" in order to make the phone less of a copy of an iPhone 12..."
This trash won’t be good enough to be a poor man’s IPhone 😹. They need to tone down their marketing and actually work on developing a decent clutter free ui and a decent budget phone that delivers
Like me if u feel nothing
I would probably buy one just for fun
This actually seems pretty good
Yo the back is really intuitive imo i dont get the hate
"This is definitely an ray of light for people who 1. Android fan. 2. Disappointed with recent android phones in terms of performance and innovation (oneplus 9 range) . Really looking forward for camera, performance and software review"
No alert slider 🥹
We should probably mention this is from the ex co-founder of one plus 😉 a hell of a lot of experience built in to being a brand new range from a brand new company
OnePlus has went does this exact path
Shots fired at the end there 😬
🧐
"""What I am allowed to show you now is the back of the phone..."" *shows the front of the phone with an actual native app*"
"I've been on a journey with Marques since he was a big fan of Oneplus until he hated it a lot. 
I wish this brand wouldn't be another BBK."
Great looking phone! Would definitely love to see case designs that incorporate the LED pattern on the back and lets them be visible even with a case on. Now that would be cool
"It's a StarWars phone, and I like it for that, but if I was a potential buyer I would be concerned with things like long term software support. Remember the Essential phone? You see with earbuds it is a bit easy but a fully fledged smartphone is a whole other kind of beast."
one plus nothing equals (1)
I can already see a start wars Storm trooper edition coming.
Looks interesting. I like the iPhone-esque aesthetic. NothingOS uses Android as a base right? I’m very curious as to how it would look on the phone.
The lighting thing is useless to me cause I don't really put my phone face down
That is why Android space is so cool. So many cool ideas (even though most of them suck).
"Definitely interesting and different. But cannot just be gimmicky, so hope there are real features behind it."
"When you are just making  another android phone, The major scope of improvement is Battery optimisation. And instead of dealing with that, I am wondering how these fancy looking back lights are going to make any change except draining more battery power."
3:18 That camera with the light on looks like Wall-E from vertical view...
"Hey OnePlus, MKBHD just called you out :) (6:07)"
"I own Nothing ear for about a year now but they still didn’t sort out the connectivity problems with the IPhone which is such a shame , the best looking earbuds out there."
6:32 One Plus???
Marques just lets people onto things subtly as to show the people what's going on and not break the embargo at the same time. Looks like there's going to be a nothing phone plus of a larger size.
6:31 screaming ONE PLUS
Waiting for your review
Goofy ahh ringtones
"First impressions - really cool, loved the glyph"
Nice roast of oneplus lmao
Can't wait for people to ask 'hey do you stock nothing' 😂
I really hope the Nothing Phone costs nothing
Is it just me or do some of the ringtones with the leds give a Star Wars and/ or Star Trek vibe to it all? Skins or Partnership I think should happen!
"whoa! that really is something MARQUES,
                    PRETTY DOPE !"
Do you think it'll work on Verizon in the US?
I would buy this phone
"it all depends on the price because it looks cool but if they pretend to charge the same as a lovebrand, there's no way that's gonna work"
It looks good. I’ll preorder it. I’m tired of iphones.
"The word gimmick comes to mind. Love the design, think it's clean, but like, to what end?"
No one uses their phone with ringer on. The lights are useless. L.
"Marques: ""I'm only allowed to show the back of this phone.""

3:37 Goes on to show the front of the phone..."
Looks cool
I don't like the punchole design. I would like it if they try a modified tier drop with dual camera.
Your last question after the strategy you mentioned reminds me the OnePlus choice after selling OnePlus One and Two… which scars me a little because of the same cofounder… 😅
Sounds familiar ...? Huh. Who would that be now ? 🤔🤔🤔
Then Samsung comes out w a clear back limited edition .. don't do that Samsung
"Sound familiar? 🤣
Yes indeed"
I think it will not equipped with Snapdragon flagship processor...it will come with probably snapdragon 7 gen1
They need to add a button to turn off those notification lights for like safety instances.
I think A Star Wars phone should look like this..White trooper
Hahaha got you oneplus @ 6:30
The transparency could be done in a better way.
this looks amazing
Black color would been more beautiful ❤️❤️
It looks like a dbrand skin on an iPhone 12
Now add MagSafe to it
ios
matt black colour would be cool !
Blade Runner 2049/Cyberpunk 2077 vibes
I have never said about any new smartphone in a while but damn. I want it 🥺
"I'd buy this if the
- Camera is good
- With a 12/8gb RAM
- 256GB HDD
- 120Hz + display
- OLED
- Gen 1 CPU
- 50+W charger"
Nokia 3220 with touch screen
Loved that oneplus scrcasm
if only it had flagship components inside...
Yo if this is available my carrier I will sell my pixel 6 pro
Sounds familiar !  One plus 😁 not mee !
This really attracts me for sure 😍
malayali🙏
OnePlus 💀
This is how 1+ started !
"""Hi guys, so I've been using this phone for the past 3 months"". -MKBHD"
"So I need to wiggle the phone to see the battery charge instead of double tapping the screen to see the percentage?

Makes sense to lay the phone screen down to scratch it better and actually try to interpret the stupid lights instead of looking at the display itself? Not really"
"Who noticed back botton same as iPhone at 3:50 on the nothing phone screen 
Nothing phone 1 is just a copy of iPhone now that’s a rip offf"
It would be even cool if they added a alert slider in this but it's a cool looking phone compared to other phones out there which are not premium
Nothing Phone 1 looks more like a high school cardboard project rather than a polished premium device.
"After seeing to what happened to OnePlus I ain't going to trust any ""innocent"" ""helpless"" startup ever again."
"why not? if it has fast charging, big battery, 120hz refresh rate larger sensor cameras and can record 4k60fps on the front and back, then im sold. it looks unique but it has to have the best features."
0:12 finally phone without chin ❤️
This phone is CRAZY >.<
"Well, this phone has the same construction as a iPhone 13, so its not really new look"
I love the design. Especially since I do like the desinfiziert of the iPhones. So hello to my collection nothing phone I guess. Still depends on the price and actual features. Since nice design and cool led it won’t be enough for me to buy it. Especially if it’s really expensive.
Trying to be different.... and than selling out and being broadly more appealing? ..feels like a Oneplus do-over
"I think more people that we think will buy this phone, because in a market where phones are becoming more and more saturated in performance for a price point, especially budget and mid segment, its feature like these that are the differentiating things."
It’s an iPhone with the back panel replaced and an android OS. Or at least that’s what it seems
Gimmick
OnePlus
Looking forward to the camera review of this phone.
OnePlus Users might be switching their phones in near future. 😂
No matter how much apple is criticised they somehow still become a benchmark for other companies in terms of design😅
Their marketing is a bit cringe
iPhone design with a notification light on the back that will be covered by a case. Seems like a lot of NOTHING ;)
"Nice design but not sure if that counts as different enough. People have all kinds of regrets with phones - no SD cards, no jacks, no stylus, no LEDs, no privacy, closed software, closed markets, child safety, repairs ... different design and re-adding LEDs is better than nothing for sure, but ..."
It is nice to something different from the boring slabs being sold. Differentiation is why i bought a Sidekick
İts reminds me iphone 12
There is a possibility of clear cases as well as cases with cut outs in just the LED parts..that would be really cool to look at especially during night..and trust the name CARL PEI and understand why One Plus is having lots of issues to deal with after he left..
cant wait for the full review hopefully it is not too expensive
One plus ptsd :( Reached their peak with 6T and 7T Pro and then it all went to meh slab.
Depending on how it performs I think it might be something to get in the future! Kinda gives me starwars vibes
That subtle reference to Oneplus at the end XD
"That looks sick, now imagine them on collab with something iconic like anime, movies, game, etc and giving them unique color design on them. If the phone internal and software does decent job on top of it, i would get one myself cause that phone have identity, differentiating from the ""boring"" others"
This is like a very cyberpunk-ish phone ive seen. Definitely a bold ass design choice. Very iphoney and android mixed
That one plus reference at the end though.
just another over priced android with a shattered glass back
3:59 did you guys use green screen for this shot? Greast production as always guys
"Loved the idea of the led...looks great and also full of features.

And talking about the case...people can always use a bumper case(yk...the case just on the edges of the phone)"
Looks different than what ? It looks exactly like an iPhone lol
Buying this Phone day one.
So you want to tell me… that he had.. A NARUTO PHONE… but decided to show this tiktok ringlight of a phone?
"It's an iPhone. Stop being a sellout, lol"
No one is going to buy it. It's an expensive crappy phone.
"pretty sick phone, imagine the colours could change as well"
Next video will show us a the box o f the phone
Phone awesome 🤩
They worked on the light a lot
It looks like a IPhone
"good luck to them, but i almost never hear people complain that all phones look the same these days. it generally doesn't really matter."
"I really like the design but I also feel that it's heavily useless.
The whole new ecosystem thing is a great idea but for now we've seen a gimmick with a light that won't be used that much.
For sure it will be really noticeable if someone has one, but it's gonna be too different and too gimmicky to buy I think."
The LED on the back side looks like a gimmick to me!
6:08 That was a good one.
"I don't know, I just don't tend to spend that much time looking at the back of my phone. It does look cool though."
It appears that everyone was waiting for this video.. The number of views hitting 3 lakh in just a few minutes 🔥🔥🔥
It's pretty much an iphone 12 design
"5:41 Minor detail: that's Wild Rift, not League of Legends."
@E Corp Kinda yeah :p
"The LED gimmick is such a stupid feature. But aside from that, the design is very promising! I love the block-ey rounded iPhone look. Don't even care if anyone shamelessly copies that design, it's gorgeous."
"You are right about your predictions if it works xD it's the same strategy with oneplus , disrupt the industry in order to make a name and  join the list of the big companies  and when you make it  ,  well now settle xD"
If an iPhone was an android
4:10 reminds me of those light up cases of old Nokia phones
This is kind of jaw dropping to me. Finally something new!
"That's really cool new feature after a long time in phone industry, but what about the battery life because it has more LEDs than any other phone in the market?"
"Forget the back, the front looks dope af."
I just hope the lights won’t be their only selling point
"I’m sure they’ve checked, but flashing lights, could it trigger seizures in folks with epilepsy??"
"1:10 : ""what im allowed to show is the back of the phone""
2:25:  *proceeds to show the front*

Am i missing something? 🤔😂"
6:08 I knew the endgame was 1+ 😂😂
Technically it’s not transparent because they covered everything then add transparent glass… I wouldn’t say it’s transparent
Nothing phone looks killer bro 👍👍
Yep... I knew the swipe at OnePlus was going to come and it did happen.
if this has a flagship chipset them I'm buying this.
"The phone is really appealing, hope the processor, performance and camera does match to our expectations and as well as the price"
OnePlus? The camera going to be underwhelming
"Come on dude, 20 second unskippable ad?
And that too on all videos?"
This was a great concept but why put the LEDs in this ridiculous layout? Like they did too much. If they just simplified the led layout and made it more usable in different ways would probably not only allow cases with places for the LEDs to shine through easier to make (or just clear back cases I guess) but I would be more customizable
"Didn't you just show the front too? Hahaha 
Looks ok"
1 +
"I have nothing ear 1 , so definitely buying this one asap😍🤘"
Crazy 😧
looks gimmicky
It's looking different.
RGB phone when?
Lol That last line throws shade at oneplus
"If google pixel had this design it could have been a perfect iphone competitor with stock android ,stock camera , and it look so minimalistic"
"""You know hows calling you, just by looking at it"" 
Hey! I do that with my phone!"
"This is just stupid. Why the heck would you keep you phone turned the other way around on a table? Makes no sense to me. It' a gimmick so that people don't focus on the fact that they have shamelessly ripped off Apple, it's not even a slight resemblance, it's literally 90% the same phone. Just a gimmick, NOTHING more."
This is more interesting than I thought it be
"I told y’all, he’s already using it"
You were taking about oneplus phones at the end of the video right !
Headphone jack?
6:30 yeah that sounds familiar one 🌝
This thing looks absolutely awesome I would buy it
We just saw Nothing 👀
3:29 What's the name of that laptop?
Nothing is getting moreover than iphone....😂
those lights on the back of it is enough to make me want one already
I'll pass.
So they just stole the iPhones whole back design and shape? Smart. If people think it looks like an iPhone then they’ll be more likely to buy it. Maybe more companies should follow
They could bring back the HTC dot cover as a case for the back
Wow brother I appreciate you
@MarquesBrownlee trying to indicate the footprints of Oneplus😂👌
New OnePlus is in the Market
"Looks cool, but I can't be the only one who never puts their phone face down onto hard surfaces(Tables, counters) Sure maybe on the bed or the couch but even then usually face up to avoid scratches. 

Won't the constant want to put this face down in combination of shaking it, lead to tons of display scratches? 

I like the idea, and look, but feel I would still have my phone face up 75% of the time."
You revealed front design too....
1+...
At least they could copy the notch too so there is perfect blend betweend the iPhone X and the iPhone 12
Sounds familiar with Oneplus like they start with flagship killer low costing phones.
Price point needs to at least compete with the Pixel or it’s gonna flop. They set an affordability precedent with the $99 buds. The phone can’t be expensive or they’re done.
"dafak, iPhone ripoff lol"
daaaaaam it look good
ok guys i just want to say one thing *NOTHING* 😎
What phone?
"The biggest issue with today's phones is stagnation. They look the same (as in each main brands phones look almost the same from generation to generation), they all have almost the same performance, and now Android 12/13 and IOS are almost the same....it's gotten to the point that we really need something more than the same old, same old. I honestly don't want to upgrade to the next gen phone simply because it's not bringing anything new to the table. There's simply no point in the upgrade except to get the latest OS updates---which are nearly the same as last years ""updates"". THIS is at least SOMETHING different, from a company that looks stable (that can't be overlooked), and I welcome it. I look forward to your review Marques!"
Can we get a review of the power bank in the background?!? Please and thanks
Lights 🔥
Take my money 💵 I want that phone.
I like it's features. I would buy it if it was a little bit more slimmer
I love these lights A LOT. I can't wait to have them on my iPhone in 6 years.
The only phone for which the back is more dope than the front
I appreciate the shot he took at OnePlus lol
"No jack, no buy. Is it too hard to make a more complete flagship phone?"
Android lol
Android inside…IPhone outside🧐
killer ডিজাইন✨
It is good to hear Nothing for the calm it gives.
The nothing phone matches exactly what type of brains people have these days.
Looks amazing. Bored with the regular stuff. Can someone introduce a camera on the sides ?
My god this thing is literally an iPhone 12 😂😂
Another hype phone to wow people but no one will buy after thinking and comparing phones in gsmarena with a cooler head.
"Don't care, I just want epic specs for a little price and crispy clean software. Just like the OG Oneplus."
I was wrong... good job Nothing..
This thing is going to impress the youth i am sure i will buy this.... Its so fancy
I should you this light pattern to ignore my wife call.
"This iPhone copy looks quite cool, interesting design for sure. The only negative is that front display, looks like every other default copy-pasted Android phone."
i am on the Samsung Note9 currently and i would totally switch to that.
"It's cool, but never going to really exist in a meaningful way and support will be extremely limited. Looks cool though. View this as one of those prototype cars that car companies put out but never exist."
"5:55 - That broke my ""OnePlus from 2015"" heart, man"
"Curious person: what phone is that you're holding?

Owner of phone: oh it's nothing"
It's just an iPhone with fancy transparent case with worse ecosystem. Nothing special
Looks like an iPhone 12.  I mean it looks cool but you can’t not make the comparison
"Nothing has to nail everything with this phone to have any chance of being successful. Pricing, performance, software experience/support and marketing; all has to be done right. Otherwise it will be another case like the Essential PH-1."
"Cool things, but do you really need even more distraction than phones already provide?"
"If Nothing created its own ecosystem that’s non-Google based, I’d pre-order now."
"Am I the only one that think it looks more like a needless gimmick that complicates the phone's build even more?

Don't get me wrong, it has it's charm and could be useful in SOME usecases, but other than that it seems like a useless feature that not only is another part that can break (and might make it harder to repair).

The fact that creators are also not allowed to show it in use and show the software until it launches makes it an even more questionable product.  It's at the very least not marketing strategy that gains trust. Just hype."
What
I can see other companies copying the light strips right now. Because that’s the only thing that has real functionality: they can double as circle light for photos.
The Stormtrooper Nothing phone official
"I like the ringtone, it reminds me of old cell phones, symbian phones"
That’s it? A whole “New” phone with a bunch of LEDs in the back? The name seems appropriate. I DO really like their aesthetic though… but… more of a nothing burger.
"Me: **sneaks phone into class**
Teacher: **sees that i bought a phone**
Me: **hides the phone**
Teacher: *What is that?*
Me: *NOTHING!* 😎"
"goodbye OnePlus, welcome Nothing"
"Looks interesting, certainly different but I guess at the end of the day the key feature is gonna be the software. Light+Clean a la old Oneplus with the Nothing design, or a bunch of redundant apps and unnecessary changes like Oppo/Oneplus of today?"
at least someone is trying to experiment with the design
A Matte Black version would be SICKKKK
Looks fun and unique. Remember those days
Tron
Stop encouraging Chinese theft and spying by reviewing their products
problem is the name of the phone
Your enthusiasm about the device is blinding lol
Iphone from wish
This definitely looks like an advertisement 😬
Please please please add some background music 🙏🙏🙏
"The phone looks cool though I'm not a fan of white, hopefully it gets darker colours when it releases. One thing I'd like in it was if you could set different led notification patterns for each different app."
Nokia 3220
This is just... Obnoxiously silly.
What a phone 😍😍
"I've always been an android fan, but I am in love with the iPhone edge design. Something about that sexy rounded glass screen with metal borders. This is like the best of both worlds. If I was looking for a new phone, this would definitely be a contender, but I love my Fold 3."
"So they made the entire back panel a flashlight With all those LED-s and with all of them to dance with different user activities... The battery would also be ""NOTHING"" ...."
"For a video which was only allowed to show the back of the phone, you sure let us see a lot of the front design 😂. Really like it though, love the LED design on the back."
Bruv why is mkbhd making a whole video to show us the back of a phone?
6:29  1+
"If this phone had a high-end camera unlike a tipical OnePlus 

I would buy it over an iPhone"
This phone kinda gives me Transformers vibes.
"The price will make this or break this.
It can't be 700$+ because google delivered a good 700$ experience with the Pixel 6.
But with these specs I just don't know if the Nothing phone will be priced low enough to compete"
"I'm sure it's selling point will all depend on three things, 1. software, 2. camera and 3. battery performance. The look is beautiful and familiar."
Fully thought that was a modded iPhone
"OMG, did he just start the video with ""Hey, what's up! MKBHD here..."" I swear, I haven't heard him say that for a while! Nice!"
This glow will distract my sleeping.
"The name is so weird, and I won't be so surprised seeing them struggle with it in this very turbulent market.
Or even at the worst crashing!"
Looks neat
I'll buy it.
"Hi Marquees, I think you have to make some decisions regarding making videos about products when you're only allowed to show 10% of the product. You complained about this brand when you couldn't say too much about the headphones in the sneak preview video. You made an entire video saying how you don't like these sneak peak video's and how it's distorting the view of the phone, yet you keep making them. Just feels untrue to your word."
There's Nothing quite like it.
Margues give me Mac Book Pro
That's just a knockoff iPhone
It’s all going to come down to pricing and software support.
"honestly, while the lights are cool, they have zero actual new ""features"". you can check the battery percentage (and way more precisely) by just lifting up your phone. you can see who's calling, again by just lifting your phone. the lighting up when wirelessly charging is nothing but a gimmick, what actual value does that add to the phone? the red recording led also adds no value. this is all just cool looking gimmicks, but i think for most, it certainly wont be anything worth switching for."
iPhone stripped
"I love the design, but I think the chance of it having a killer camera is slim, so I guess it will be a pass… 😏

Is the screen size confirmed?"
"""recording indicator""--- rip perverts"

"Ahh oneplus. Still can't believe they fooled me, I really thought they cared about us tech heads. I was preaching to my friends saying ""get a oneplus for years"" . And they were good phones from oneplus 1 to 7. Got a oneplus 8 pro, it was great initially but oneplus have really slacked off on their fast updates, the software isn't as slick as it used to be, it just kind of feels like a a generic android phone and I'm now regretting my decision and wished I got an s20 at the time. They got greedy as a company."
"I like the design but that's not enough alone to make it. Look at Essential phone. It completely failed as a phone (ignoring the marketing aspect) because it's hardware was let down by poor cameras and mediocre performance. 

Put simply, I don't think they stand a chance. Smart Phone start-ups never go well. Many will argue OnePlus did but they weren't really a start-up, merely a branch of the mega-company BKK."
"I'm already impressed, at least with the initial start."
But they don't have alert slider. 😕😟
"Most of the people use some sort of protective cover on their phones. I've always used casing on my phones. Also, I've never put my display on the bottom while resting or charging."
Just for the desain and those thin bezels... defo 10/10
"When more than half the video is about lights on the back of the phone, it's a phone that has nothing truly worthwhile to bring to the table"
oneplus left the chat
Damn that's a thicc laptop behind you
But what if is after some repair work 🤠
These simple lights do matter in these boring mobile trend
Look like a fake iPhone design
I like it!
"I hope that blinking red light for indication that you're recording a video can be disabled. For many reasons, being able to stealthily record without others knowing is good for your safety."
6:32 nice One ;)
"Can I have the latest legit iOS put in this phone by Apple?🙆🏽‍♂️🙏🔥

This phone is dope, so different straight out. Only Apple can do that but to see them do that is impressive!!"
Pretty cool. I’ll wait til Apple rips some of these features off and buy that iPhone when it’s available
I would pick nothing over the other's
i cant wait for the full review! would love to try it out if i could see all the software
"Actually iPhone 12 copy body design - very bad, no have innovation strategy this Nothing Phone (1). (-.-)"
The way he roasted OnePlus at the end made me chuckle
"Apple on their iphone 20 series : ""Introducing the most beautiful glowing apple logo yet"" 👀"
coming from nothing
"Is this one made by Oppo trying to pretend to be another ""enthusiast"" brand like OnePlus and RealMe?"
💎
The thing looks dope 👌
Please Give me. Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
no 3.5mm headphone jack. disappointed.
I’m confused. I thought he said he can only show the back? Why are we seeing the front too?
I could be wrong as we don’t know how it is as an actual phone but this seems to be falling down the trend of Nothing being a design company before a technology company. Their products always look cool but in the case of the earbuds are mid at best
"So cool. I just hope the UI is as good as the galaxy for me. Some things when I switched to the one plus for a bit stood out to me, when I realized only Samsung does live locked wallpapers or a customizable always on display"
I had an Alcatel phone 15 years back which blinks according to ringtone
Sounds familiar. OnePlus.
Those last lines killed someone😀
I love the back it's a reason not to have a case but I also love the pixel experience so if the camera and everything is smooth it's a very nice option. Price
"Honestly I'm not hyped at all, need to see the full review to judge anything. These pre-release videos seem artificial imo. Just remind me of all the great reviews cyberpunk 2077 got originally."
"I wish I could download those ringtones to my dinosaur s10+1TB. No point upgrading anytime soon, but those futuristic ringtones are sick even without the lights."
I miss metal phones
"Naaa not falling for this, it's good but hmmmm 
Kinda feels too much of light light...
Yup it's different too different to be frank 😅 
I looked custum phones of Naruto and DBZ 😁 

Let us see will this sticks or not 😌"
I'm sold
"If anyone didn't get what he meant when he said ""Sound Familiar"" He meant Oneplus 😂"
"I was interested but then they don't actually sell the phone but instead have it on a trading platform that handles everything on it as assets instead of products. 
That basically already removed all the interest I could ever have had in this"
"No frills symmetrical bezels, I'm intrigued. Pixel 5 still doing well for me, but if they can nail the formula in the right way, it looks compelling!"
"Wow... That's unique! If they can match the special features with some cool specs, I bet this phone can be the hot cake."
Nothing phone looking like nothing I’ve seen 🤝
That ringtone is pretty cool
That’s so cool like a phone from blade runner
I saw the thumbnail and I tough it was a custom iPhone 12
Does it have alert slider ?
I thought it got no screen 😢
Very excited to see how OnePlus2.0 will fare in this highly competitive market.
u either die a hero or live long enough to see urself as a villain..
yes sounds familiar to oneplus storey
"भाई बहुत पैसा मिला है तुम्हे सिर्फ फोन के बैक पार्ट का रिव्यू करने के लिए।

लेकिन मुझे घंटा फर्क नहीं पड़ता, मैं कैसे इस्तेमाल करता हूं, मुझे सॉफ्टवेयर और डिस्प्ले से मतलब है, प्रोसेसर वैसे भी ठीक ही होगा।"
"im solddddddd! im down for this one! sucha dope drip! well yeah, history repeats again. impress us in the beginning and then trap us with ""no so good"" os later like oneplus. but for now, this is actually a good one"
Phone looks nice.
I'm interested!
Best was SOUNDS FAMILIAR hahaha
i will buy this in a heart beat
That swipe at OnePlus ouch :D
I want one or 2 I will support this company we are tired of the same concepts this is different.
It looks cool 🔥🔥🔥
"Does it come in black?
preferably matt black"
"""Sounds familiar?"" Of course it does because that's what happened with Oneplus and why this new ""nothing""  company exist, is it ?"
"nice touch with the led's on the back but .... damn... i love my 13 pro max .....nice short, informative video though even if the embargo blocks the rest of the features... look forward to the full review 👌"
it is the best looking android smartfone!
sounds familiar??? that was bold👏👏👏👏
@Shaurya Parasrampuria oneplus
for whom it was meant?
Rip 1plus
I think I'm gonna get this thing
Where can I get such ringtones?
I love that shot he took at OnePlus at the end.
"May be it come with apple A16 or other apple processor.
May be possible 🤔"
It’s a better Alternative Samsung fe fan Addition &apple se series
"The transparent back and the LED were so sick! 
Okay, hopefully Nothing takes good care of the software updates and gives us a very good camera and videos then I don't mind switching to Nothing Phone. 🙂"
"I’ll be buying nothing
😆"
"What phone do you have.........






I have the Nothing phone..."
finally something new on Android side
iPhone 12 lol
Either become something or nothing
another android phone its nothing😂
Who the hell puts the phone face down on a table ? These LEDs are so useless
It looks like a iPhone with a transparent back and no notch
5:08 how much dollar made you to say that
I read that the Nothing iPhone
If it was full RGB i would buy immediately tbh.  This reminds me those stickers back in 2000s that blinked like crazy when someone called
Nothing 🔥
I'm pretty sure Nothing requested not to talk about the spec or software almost like surface duo situation. Kinda sketchy ngl.
Wow it looks cool! the Nothing transparent phone should have like a R2D2 or Star Wars design lineup
"Marques : Sound familiar?

Me : That's ONEPLUS!!"
That phone looks dope.
Useless phone.
"Just the lights is going to make me buy it. That’s it, ima buy it.
Only if it’s under 40k"
"No matter how good the back of phone might be, it will never account for more than 5% towards why you would buy the phone. The software experience on the other hand is incredibly important and will dictate the success of this phone."
"@Daniel G im 30 and it appeals to me, what the heck are you talking about aimed at teens?"
@Some Random Gamer Which phone will give you more for that price? Xiaomi 12 Lite? Samsung A73? I have 25W charger on S21 btw.
"@Air Max 90 Let's see... 470 Euro, 33W watt charger, ??? year of support, Snapdragon 778G+.

Sounds really mediocre and *really* overpriced to me."
@Unknown Gamer 9 It's an overpriced piece of midrange junk. Xiaomi makes miles better phones for the price. Nothing is only good at making hype.
"@JK The_NF I mean if you see a phone as a tool, the bells and whistles should be irrelevant"
Oneplus left the chat
Not really impressed
"For some reason, the first time looking at that phone I thought it was a broken iPhone 12."
"I feel the features are so,.. unnecessary? Like how often does a user put their phones face down? Its a gimmick feature. Ill be bored after a day. I want exciting features in hardware or software that makes using the phone a powerhouse, not led lights."
Will there be a black version of this phone ???
It’s a pretty looking phone
"The omission of head phone jack is a big turn off for me. I get it, that they want to sell more of their wireless buds, but I didn't like them one bit. The lights look cool and all but as someone who wants to use their phone lesser and lesser, they look nothing but a gimmick to me."
But it looks like no fingerprint.. in display and also on back.. 😳😳
Cool!
Beautiful phone 😍
"Iphone 12 copy ! Looks like Apple design with clear plastic both Iphone 12 and AirPods pro... really? Oh, right... the LED's!"
SIIICCKKKK
"The Siemens CF63/62 Phones had this same exact concept. It was a really cool phone at the time, and definitely stood out amongst the other phones out at the time. It had 2 light bars that went around the entire perimeter of the phone, and had lights that would dance and flash when you received notifications and alerts. It even had a setting where you can create your own custom light show, and you can make custom light shows for individual alerts and notifications. It was really cool!."
"I have my personal Samsung ecosystem & apple ecosystem.
I want to try the the nothing ecosystem, too"
NOTHIFICATION
6:28 Hello One Plus!
Tips and tricks for this phone: Turn off the glyph interface to increase battery life.
Did OnePlus dirty at the end
"2:25, not showing the screen!! 😂"
I thought you could only show us the back👀
Feels like a paid review even marques know it looks exactly like a iphone 12 with different back .. seems a bit partial
At the end. Just a regular android phone with play store and 2-3 updates.
"This is super cool for a first impression, wow"
"Hopefully they have a black variant like what they do to Nothing Ear (1). It's really cool and that battery indicator is really awesome, so there's no need to check the phone's screen. Looking forward to what Carl Pei and his team has been up to with that phone."
wohohhhaaa!!!! That light strip showing charging Progress is amazinh!!!!!
"Allowed to show back of the phone, 2:24 wait a minute 🙄"
Nothing is Everything
These guys are really nailing it
Looks like a futuristic iphone 12
"If it didn't sound familiar, its 'OnePlus'."
lool umm I donk know...maybe for 16-year-old kids...
why would I ever put the phone down the screen facing the surface. That's how you get scratches :D
Will the transparent back go yellow with heat like the transparent case ?🧐
Fst to watch😹😹🏃
Outstanding
Sooooooooo do the lights change color? 🤦‍♂️
And then the RGB................
"If you look closer, you can almost see an apple, or maybe nothing?"
6:25 Shots fired!
the logo or sign is like a minimalist apple logo. the bite one the side and the twig on top
The back is unique but overall it just looks like an iPhone. Also these features are quite gimmicky
Cool
one plus flashbacks .... we all know what the other future versions of this phone gonna be like
Its cool but seems a little gimmicky.  tbh the doesnt look much different from an iphone 5s.
Loved it for what I have seen so far. The ringtones are🔥
Looks weird to me. Looks more like a paid review
Now that's one handy flashlight
"Honestly, was the video really worth it, all you showed us was the back of it marques…"
"I haven't wanted a new phone for a long time now. They are mostly uninteresting as devices. For me if the current one works then there is no need to upgrade.

But this. This is something that I want. The first phone I truly find interesting in over 10 years.

Too bad I don't have any money.
*Cries in oneplus 6t*"
it have snapdragon 7gen1 this is bad
Dope design.... Loved the whole LED thing🤩🤩
will drain the battery
Hmmm... sry i use back case
"meh,  i need my apple logo and premium feel. Even though it's been several months... i look at my 13 pro max and i just love it. It helps skipping 11, 12 so this 13 pro max feels like a new thing for me."
This looks SO much like an iPhone
The vibe is like OnePlus back in the days.
Those Lights ..Yeah a New feature  but it just seems to make the phone A Toy with That blinking tone .
"I haven't wanted a new phone for a long time now. They are mostly uninteresting as devices. For me if the current one works then there is no need to upgrade.

*Cries in oneplus 6t*"
Your reviews are very bad and misleading
"Love the design, its tempting btw ❤️"
I think this phone will discourage people to put on a phone case. The chance of breaking phone goes up if they don’t put it. But it looks cool though 😁
@Thorn clear cases with tempered glass or certain hard plastic backs don’t yellow. It’s the soft parts that do and they can easily make cases with colored bumpers for the sides
@Corktail yeah I know what you mean. The case are not nice to touch and hold
@Daniel Mondéjar Clear cases are expensive as you need to buy many of them at once- they all go yellow and piss colored after a few months/years from the oils in your hands.
@GHMR one more thing is if the phone is slippery you can consider a case else no point to use case(This nothing phone has solid grip so no point here)
@GHMR this is right even technically its not good for battery since heat gets trapped in case
"I think the pricing will tell everything whether It's flop or top.
At the end youn surely meant One plus (IG)"
That's nothing
What really makes a phone different these days? Even when attempting to make something different you end up making something similar to the competitor… the light is cool but is that really enough to make people switch from a brand their use to to give this a try? 🤷🏽‍♂️
"Again just like therir first product. This phone is pure hype, and ""Nothing"" else. The idea sounds appealing. Make a competing eco-system. But the pace of the world has changed since the first iPhone launch. Companies are not sitting on their laurels waiting for companies to catch up. Apple spent years building their eco-system. And as much as Google and Samsung try, they are not there yet. And Nothing WILL NEVER be there. Because their whole market plan is hype, and the problem with hype is it dies down.

Sure it may end phone being a good phone, but it will be one in a sea of many. Basically amounting to thier namesake, ""Nothing""."
it looks like something out of black mirror. seems sick as hell!!
Nothing impresses me. I was expecting a full exposed components. Not covered with white plastic.
Ithing This is the Most Viewed And Liked Video... Never before Ever After 😍🤩😍
10000000$
I don't like it. I don't need it and I am very sure no one else too. Just copying Apple and few tweaks.
Design by different
"But I don't look at the back of my phone, like ever"
Yes sounds very familiar of good old Carl Pie strategy.
This kinda reminds me of my sony xperia U... good ol days when designs were soo unique!
iPhone on steroids
This reminds me of Nokia 3220
I love stuff like this. Android is about making weird stuff and to see new things I always think is a positive. Looking forward to seeing if the phone side of things has as much thought and polish.
Totally agree. Android is for everyone. Love it or hate it.
"Weird stuff? That's a brand thing, not an OS thing."
I'm in literal love
"ITs cool, gonna give some people seizures lol but Id be more interested to see when they can do RGB :)"
They should have gone for flagship Killers segment
"the ""unique looking"" phone:
literally just iPhone XR or something, Lmfao."
"Like onplus 2.0 
Same strategy 
Same personality 
But a new name.. way of getting attention 👍"
🤭 I have Nothing to say about this phone!
i love it
"Looks kinda like an iPhone 12/X ngl.
But the LEDs look kinda weird imo.
The OS is cool, real K E W L
Still dope though."
nowadays smartphones features  had reached to a plateau and nothing has done something unique
Easily the ugliest phone recently what a waste of our earth resources.
This is dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lol Lights....only 10 year old kids will be attracted to this...super flop me thinks.
I can't believe I'm watching a video about Nothing!
Yeah.  Looks like garbage 🗑!
Its looks like i12 customized back cover 😁
Marques brownlee slowing become an iPhone Addict.
Why is he pretending like he's holding something
It looks good but most of the people use a back case so there's that
the shade towards oneplus lol
#1 consideration is price
Regular phone with some lights
Your collaboration featuring MRwhosetheBoss was shit. He's certified *iSheep*
"Hi, is it bigger than Iphone12 screen ? I mean tell us what's the screen size ?? Is it big enough to play games"
Love this.....especially that OnePlus burn at the end 😂🔥
"@miska knapek haha, of course!! 😂
I had forgotten that information. 😉"
"very fitting burn.

speaking of which, maybe this is a bit obscure, but the founder of Nothing is the original founder of OnePlus :)"
I literally clapped.
"that soundl like """"samsung"""""
Yeah i watched it on repeat lmao
“We live in an age right now” 🤣
Sounds familiar? OnePlus 🤣
Ready for ar glasses. Tech is so boring right now. But this is unique
"i'm sooo hyped, can't wait to see the price of this one"
Shots fired in the end @oneplus 😂
Finally RGB lights coming to phones too for enchanced gaming performance...
"obviando que es claramente un iphone, es una idea interesante. De todos modos sería igual o más importante saber como es por dentro más que por fuera..."
"I’ve been with apple since the very first iPhone. I’ve not owned another brands phone since apple, but I’d get this!"
"I know this is beside the point, but I appreciate your Powerbook G3 in the background. 😍"
cool
"He has some balls to speak about the Oneplus sad story, during the video of the Oneplus killer made by the old Oneplus CEO."
It looks different...finally seen a phone with different and unique😍
thanks for showing the front side of the phone
3:36 I thought he said he's not allowed to show front of the phone earlier 😅
this is the future! 🦾
Cheap light work.. 😆
That phone is dope!!! 🤍
I wonder if they were inspired by mass effect when they called it Glyph
So it’s a 2026 looking iPhone with light communication. 😎
"Id love to see franchise branded phones. I would totally buy a phone where the back is all Halo themed LED patterns like Master Chiefs helmet, Elite helmet or a Halo ring"
Nice
"""I'm only allowed to show you, the back of the phone.""
Also Marques : 2:24"
Its not ready yet you can see
Didn’t show the ui though
I know right? I was really curious to see the front of the phone and was looking for Marques to make a mistake and let it slip but he just starts using it 😆
"Looks sweet, I'll admit."
Let's hope NOTHING doesn't Disappoint.
Lol. Trolling OnePlus at the end.
what's the durability of back led s 🤔 .. After certain time u have to replace them ?
"Nothing phone has something, compared to my life which is nothing 🙃😂"
😴😴😴
"6 from the IP68 will play such an important role to keep up that amazing transparent back.. 
Great review as usual 😄"
*One plus one all over again xD*
Wow.....this is dooope. I have NOTHING to say
What is Nothing Phone? A Transparent iPhone 13 With LEDs.
"I want it to be enthusiast focused phone, not an iphone killer but an OnePlus killer"
Finally something that makes a phone stand out from the rest! Impressed!!
"Am very eagerly waiting for this! Everything Looks Great especially that Screen Only thing in my Mind Is the price of it comes anywhere around $350-$380,I would be their First customer ❤️❤️"
"@Fearnoid Dude! Are you mad or something It's having a sd 7gen 1,With those specs it is definitely gonna be under 500 bucks secondly it's also manufactured in India so that would make it a lot cheaper otherwise they would fail"
"Lol. Think twice and a half times that price, minimum."
But does it have iMessage? No? Pass. — Apple Fanboys
Waiting for the Black phone with the sweet lights... That would look dope!
aprils fools?
I want it now!
I want to see what the Black version of that phone would look like
"He says he’s only allowed to show the back of the phone. But then shows the front at 0:13
A nice symmetrical front that!"
I want a black colour in it . I hate White colour matte black will be ❤️❤️
Sound familiar 👍
It's always a good strategy to target the tech enthusiast niche before going broad.
🤩 ❤️🔥
Actually the first phone i am really excited to see detailed videos about in years
idc this phone looks sick
I do like it.
"some shade was thrown right at the end. Love when Marques does it, given his usual ""kindness"""
Looks like a Noname phone 😂
"I suppose it looks cool for many people, but that's it, it's basically useless, and cool things don't last long, revolutionary things do. It's pathetic that nowadays people have to try so hard to come up with something that looks kind of cool, because the current technology limits us from doing something truly revolutionary."
They definitely struck that familiar but different look with the design. It kind of looks like a modified iPhone from the back.
Looking forward to seeing what award this wins in The Smartphone Awards. Is there a fresh design award? The lights are sick!
Will it be available in South Africa?
"""I am only allowed to show you the back.""
Proceeds to show the front 3 minutes later lmao"
Nice promo by Nothing via MJBHD!!!
It looks like nothing
im wondering if apple cases can be used in this phone...
Take this . .1+
This is the first white phone I really like and would buy
What if I put a case on it for safety?
"1.Create something horrible
2. Pay influencers all over the world to say that is cool
3. You have a place in the market
Nicely done"
It looks like nothing...
"those notification sounds made 
 me want to throw up."
I will buy it because I feel this could be amazing alternative for iPhone.
"""Sounds familiar?""
This is literally mind blowing"
"Imagine its phone case being transparent and having color overlays over them LEDs , like only on the LEDs. A black one with purple/blue would look pretty sick."
OMG that dope
"Some features of nothing phone 1 give a cool vibe let's see in real time how this nothing phone 1 perform and attract users?
🤔🤔🤔
waiting for launch 🎉🎉🎉"
"Ngl I'm impressed, my next phone for sure! 👍 Just because looks like it has iphone level hardware and with Android"
oneplus on repeat
Not me seeing a lot of the ads for the phone with the bird online thinking it was an ad for an iPhone case. I think it looks a little too similar to the Apple device...
i really like this phone .not gonna lie .
The OnePlus reference at the end *chef's kiss*
That foreshadowing though. Just maybe this time it'll be different. Maybe. Honestly leaning to probably not.
It's a pity they still have to put that rubbish text on the back
I liked how the Nothing has made use of the LED lights that's a out of the box 📦 thing and it looks dope.
Nothing but cool
"if this is at the same price range of the phones which offer similar specs then it is something worth considering. else, I'll just call the rear light an expensive gimmick.
we'll have to see what other software features and ecosystem they build to say for sure tho."
Where's the matte black version?
C G I
That ringtone-backpanel light sync was very satisfying 👌
"The phone has Iphone 12 and made it cooler and transparent as well. Still a cool looking phone which i will maybe buy but only if it preforms good in battery, camera, performance and display and then maybe i will consider this phone."
Another gimmick phone. Can I have a battery that lasts a couple of days instead please?
"Does anyone leave their phone screen down for the notifications on the back to make sense?

Maybe people I know are in the minority, but myself and everyone I know tends to leave their phone screen facing up if it's on a table or something."
can we get a case company to make a case that has the functionality of this phone?
"3:59 Good luck getting a call on a airplane with this ringtone 😋
Sh*t sounds like time bomb and AK47 combined"
Plz release in Korea too..
Cough cough iphone.
Bro I am subscribed please give me a nothing phone
"I dig the look of this phone a lot, if the software is good and the pricing is not too crazy then I will definitely consider getting it."
Black version please
"Cool, but I NEVER put my phone face down…"
Just another company that won’t be successful and won’t have much recognition for it . Only YouTubers will hype this up with their reviews but you know well they won’t be using a phone like that since they are more attached to Apple or Samsung.
Its gonna be fire 🔥
Very nice
"Hey man, even before seeing the  os, I just love how symmetrical the display is. And how iPhone 13 it looks without the notch"
Now cheaters can leave their phone face down and still have an idea of who is calling. Golden!!!
Call me crazy but can we appreciate those beautiful symmetrical bezels? They look so sick! And the camera hole being on the side just makes it look a lot cleaner!
"Just the iPhone X and onward (though they have that ugly notch), and the Pixel 5 have no bottom chin"
"I know that others have done an impressive job at minimizing the bezels, but just a couple of phones have the bottom chin the same width as the sides and upper bezels, it may be insignificant but details are details. That's why you can call me crazy 🤣"
It’s almost like plenty of phones have done that years ago or something
Exactly bro
Needs 56k dial-in tone  – this is very cool!
Middle Punch hole is Better 🥲🥲this is side
this is an iphone body !!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally some good looking & functional thing ❤️🔥
4:00
Case? I assume they have realised most people slap a case on their phone. My level of interest in a video about the back of a phone was low before this video and remains very low....
"Its an Iphone 12 with a glass back, whats the appeal?"
A phone full of gimmicks.  Groovy.
I looks sick. Finally an android with more apple style
"200k views in 28 minutes, yeah I’d say it’s going to be pretty successful at launch"
yess phones are fun again....
"“Sounds familiar” 


Oneplus 🙂"
A black version would make those lights look insane
I was expecting a Rip oneplus Easter egg
Reminds me of the phone that asked us to never settle 🤔
Who put their phones upside down on a table to take advantage of that LED at the back?
Also I really like those ringtones! Finally some default ringtones that don't sound 10 years old lol.
MKBHD misses the old one-plus as much as I miss them :)
Are all the uses of “actually” scripted? Sounds so unprofessional using that word so often.
Wow finally some real innovation . I can see other companies running to copy this
Those default ringtones are definitely not annoying at all
"THINK. ABOUT. THIS. 👇

for years, everyone has been happy with iPhone design and we all take pride in it.
with that in mind, isn't it actually a genius move to just have a replica with a different OS. 

Why are we humans even complaining, when everyone gets what they like or prefer. All of our needs look like they're fed. what even is the problem? lol 😅"
The front looks like a iPhone without the notch and extra bezel. Very similar but different
"Ngl this phone just makes me want to buy an iPhone 13 more lol. When I see that design I think “man, apple has really nailed their smartphone design”"
Meh
"The Last Pun may not pan out as that super accessible, recognisable, top selling phone will be made under a CEO name Carl Pei! 
Not Dumb Deaf Pete Lau!
I have a strong feeling that because of Lau, OnePlus is now in this Crisis on Identity situation at this moment of time!
If Carl Had Been Here,
OnePlus Would Have Still Retrained It's Identity AKA Oxygen OS At Its Most Pure Form & Prices As Well As Features Would Have Been Up To Expectation!"
"Damn this is really shallow and just a parlor trick
My brain: yoooooo I need this!!!"
Wish it didn't look so much like an iPhone
"Anything made clear runs the risk of looking like it was made to use in a prison. They managed to avoid that, I think. It looks really futuristic to me. It looks like something on the set of sci-fi show like Foundation or something Aloy might find while delving in the ruins of Horizon."
"Only 3 years of Android updates... 😏😒🤔🤨 That's meh...
 
And it's a noname phone....😏 Even if MKBHD and other top-dollar bloggers are  marketing it."
"Love the design for sure, if it comes from the guy who worked on OnePlus and their first model was crazy good... Then this could be a great buy. We'll have to see."
"It works until......... 
...............................
..........................................
..............................................................
You put a case on it.... Oops... Now it looks like Nothing."
why not a second small screen at the back?
"Super hard pass on this. Got the Nothing Ear (1) on launch day. Til this day, i find it very finicky and just overall MID."
"Absolutely sounds familiar. No point supporting these guys, when they choose to abandon their original philosophy. 

If they choose to be unique, they've go all in and let their fans do the job.

That's what worked for Apple. No matter what people's expectations with a phone are, eventually, they feel Apple is the best. All that didn't happen over night."
I feel bad because I love you and wanna support your channel but at the moment I am just not in the market for a phone and so I brush past a lot of your content even though I want to support you
Why would I put my phone face down on the table so I can view notifications when the screen itself can give me that same information with more details? Why???
"I guess we would txt and watch stuff on the back, might as well.."
"If this phone would be with a iOS I would buy right away, I’m all about minimal and clean look no logos no nothing"
"Going by the performance of my Nothing Ear 1, I'm expecting some good hardware and software performance from Nothing."
"the recording indicator is a deal breaker, sometimes I just want to film people and not let them know"
"Dude did you just show us the front of the phone, single hole punch at the left top corner. 😅😅"
wow
Dope will feel like having a personal dj in hand and at last what u said 🤣
Price wouldn't be sky-rocketing since their main focus is on Indian and Chinese market.
The front also looks very pretty.
This is remarkably gimmicky and unremarkable
"What this phone needs to nail for me;

(1) Price; I'm not buying a phone from new company when for the same price I can afford tried and true 

(2) Performance; it better be fast, Snapdragon 870 at minimum.

(3) Don't give me slow charging. 65w or more, and support stuff like USB PD 45w or above.

If they tick all of these boxes I can see myself upgrading this year, but I don't think I'll get everything I want."
"im wondering why don't you guys switch to hdr workflow, it would look fantastic with all your fancy REDs"
That's was like old nokia 3220 phone with led on the side of phone.. its been long time since that age we dont have phone with some uniqe design.
Super from India Rs  24999 starting in INR
"Just dont be the PH-1. As far as the earphone and the ""OS"" aka skin, it's has been kinda meh"
just dope .. if the software is good then i am gonna buy that definitely
iPhone 12's back and chassis.
Finally an iphone with type c
"Couldn't care less about this gimmick, waiting for the real deal: specs os and price."
"1:12 and 3:46 sounds pretty opposite to me, atleast now we know where the punch hole will be"
"I think with compelling pricing, people would bat eyes."
How am I supposed to put a case on this phone while maintaining the notification light usable?
i think using a clear case
Basically showed only a phone talking about the back.. show us the software please.
OMG it really looks different... Mah man marques holding it should have given chef kiss for the design. ☹️
Nothing is done nothing
Honestly innovation is bringing back the Jack and an SD card slot now. how are fancy LEDs more useful than those??? Isn't this a waste of space/ materials/ cost?
Actually this looks cool af. If the price is no more than 550 euros I could buy one to replace my old redmi. I was skeptical around the hype but they actually did something original
Is this coming to the iPhone 13 or what?
At least we have something gimmicky after a boring 4-5 years in the industry.
Cool fitches for one day if use) overall it should be reasonably priced with above average cameras to get some attention in the overcrowded market
"The ""sounds familiar"" at the end though ☠️"
He was DEFINITELY describing one plus 😂
"Just hoping they dont go the Oneplus way , being a flagship killer at first then ""de-volving"" over the years to become just a regular brand in this huge market . Although as of now it looks promising."
"What's the operating system, Android?"
Now glowing Apple logo Please 👀
"And what if those back led got off
I mean we all see sign board with one or two led off in time"
Looks HOT!!
Everytime your phone rings you can give someone in the restaurant an epileptic seizure
iPhone 12 copy
"This looks nice but it's useless for everyone who's already used to an always on display, which is mostly everyone who doesn't have an iphone"
How they are gonna work upon their back covers is what I'm seeking forward curiously !
I want that phone Marques!!!
This looks good tbh!
"is that the final front? if yes, then i am kinda disappointed. they announced a no-chin display, didn't they?"
mixed emotions for nothing lets who rock the well inside
I hate white phones hope they come with a black one.
At last we should look back of the phone 😂 for everything
"Cool phone, really like the look! Making decent use of wasted space/visuals"
I'm totally sold on the design front. I pray to God that it functions just as good. 🙏🏽 And comes under ₹30k 😅
Symmetrical bezel 😍
If it was running iOS  I would definitely get one!!
You know it's going to be a good day when you wake up to a new MKBHD video!
Well said @Marques 😂😂 reminding (OnePlus).
"How to pay double for a Galaxy, without owning a galaxy."
I don't know it's only me or not but that led lights kinda looks like apple logo
Feels like a Star Trek/Tron theme
"How many people put their phone face down anywhere? Lights just a gimmick for me. 
I never see the back of my phone."
"Wearing smartwatch or bands makes this feature useless. Even if we don’t wear smartwatch , this feature is not worth buying this phone."
Reminds me of OnePlus
one plus entered the chat
I kinda hope they have black back with white led one
Don't know..need to see the other specifications.
Hypeee😱😱😱😱
I would actually buy this if it was affordable..
Oh man... Should have been a centred punch hole camera.
That quick one plus burn at the end 😮😮
This phone is amazing
Camera hole on the side. How much time would take for these companies to realise that it looks like shit. Lord...
"I think that laptop was also from a start up
And that dyson is also a start up"
"it would be cool to be able to customise the look and colours, like a black phone with blue lights whould be sick"
"The light ""show"" that the LEDs produce reminds me of Nokia phones of yesteryear."
I thought those led's were just a lookup thingy but man their functionality is insane!!!!
Carl is seriously a one good mind and a great CEO.
I need these ringtone
Futuristic phone: use back of phone more than display of the phone 😂
well for me... IT IS FULL OF FUTURISTIC MECHANISM... and I want to buy it... I'm an android user.. sooo it's okay for me
That uniform bezel on the front
Can I get that skin for iPhone 12 ?
"I don't care, a wear cases..."
Looks like an android iPhone lol
I wonder how much that will be $2000
Cool but it still runs Android so what's the reason to get it?
why review android phones that are worse than Iphones in any way anyways ? lool
I'd buy it but I bet 10 bucks it won't be available in my market
one plus be like : is mkbhd talking about us ? 06:30
"This is too cool, I love how they brought functionality to the lights. Love the originality."
"A transparent back with some ringtone lights, I'd care if I didn't already own a Nokia 3220 15 years ago."
"Its called using software to run the lights. NOTHING NEW, get it?"
"Front is bad bezel is thick, i was hoping for center punch hole and narrow bezel"
It looks like the iPhone 12 Pro wallpapers.
OnePlus left the chat 😂
You mean to tell me that isn't an iPhone? LOOOL
I need those ringtones
Did the embargo prevent him from talking about the OS? Or is it just another generic Android version with nothing specific to the brand?
6:32 it’s oneplus isn’t it
"I like it,at least they are trying something different with the back"
The phone for people who are too cool for an iPhone
"Light synced Ringtones.....


Wohohoho Dope
Thats Dope..
.
Carl. Pey💕💕"
I really like the concept.
Unhappy with the display aspect ratio.. would have preferred a bit narrower for easy one hand usage.. Also coming from one plus carl should've known the importance of an alert slider.
It looks cool
"6:08 damn that really gave me an existential crisis even though I'm not the brand in question, OnePlus"
Nothing PR is on next level
"I understand why they do it but I really don't like when companies give a product to influencers and make them only able to talk about the single feature/gimmick they want us to hear about disregarding the far more important stuff like specs, camera, battery life or price. Feels disingenuous."
"longer you use your phone, you forget how the back of the phone looks like. i even forgot if my phone was 12 or 13. Because the contents in the front display is much interesting and important. back led is different and fun but.. for how long?"
"Front looks so good with symmetrical bezels so now it depends on camera,SOFTWARE ,BATTERY LIFE AND PRICING"
"Looking at this phone, I can tell how badly I want it."
Wouldn't buy that.
"Reminds me of OnePlus, which Carl was a part of, so it fooled me once but I'm not gonna get fooled twice because at the end of the day, every company is built for profit and there won't be anything different for this one in 3-5 years time from their first launch.What is he gonna do 5 years from now? Jump ship like he did with OnePlus and create a new ""revolutionary"" company that just buys qualcomm chips, slaps on android and call it a day?
It's the main reason I even switched to iPhone, they offer stability and future software-wise, unlike any android out there, except maybe Google and ASUS."
One of the best thing about this dude is that he never takes creadat for him self when he achieve something he allows respect us.
"Well I have to say, most of us were going ""meh"" when they only showed the glyph instead of the phone.
Now it does make sense and is actually impressive."
If its priced like a OnePlus one? Give it to me. If its priced like an iPhone? Hell naw.
Te front 🤩 symmetrical bezels! Aww very excited
"If the front design was not similar to any other phones, I would love it."
😍😍😍
Nothing is amazing ☺️
Am just sold on it but i will wait to see the software and other thing bt the first impression amazing 👌🏽
My 1st impression is this a custom iPhone but not but also a utter battery eater. Me like it
"Nothing, you son of a bich  im in!"
The front of the phone 2:24
Looks really cool. But interested for the pricing
I love this phone
I hope they make a black one with RGB lighting
Waiting for price
making cases for this phone will be interesting
Game over oneplus
.. The Oneplus burn at the end😝
"sure ya sounds familiar...the primary goal that Carl Pei brings with this Nothing team is to surpass one of his best, the OnePlus"
"""Looks Different because it Nothing!"""
i think Marques is talking about oneplus who abandoned their original fanbase
It’s cool but looks like a gimmick more than anything. Just have to wait and see.
"Looks cool, way too much dumb hype marketing, no headphone jack."
No one is going to switch ecosystems because the back lights up. Period.
"1+, 2.0"
It looks like an iphone
Oh it's the new iPhoaawwot is that?
They are basically copying Apple. The buds say it all
Inspiration from iPhone 12
I thought you're only allowed to show us the back of the phone? 😅😂
"MKBHD: sounds familiar?
OP: *chuckles *"
6:30 felt like a clear shot at one-plus lmao
"Other than the sharp corners, I really like this design, kinda cyberpunky, and god the LEDs are beautiful like fr it's insane"
"It looks really good, I like it a lot"
TAKE MY MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
mmmm ..from apple boy perspective 😉
IPhone with LEDs on the back? Meh
The layout of the leds kinda looks like a stylized Apple logo.
These ringtones make me physically ill
I was really hoping to see inside of phone through the back glass. But this looks nothing like transparent phone. I would rather strip off the paint from my glass back OnePlus 6 like Jerry did
Did he show us the front of the phone!!!
Im curious about the price they will announce. If its not to high i would consider it escen though I live deep in the apple ecosystem
"I feel most of the general consumers out there put a case on their phones (myself included), as many drops and cracked screens have taught us to be wise and protect ya, well erhm, junk. But I’m sure Nothing/3rd Parties will make cool transparent cases that maybe even intensify the LEDs when they shine through. Definitely super intrigued by this concept!"
I'd put a seizure warning on this because of the flashing lights. And I dont understand why they didnt allow the led color to be customized and changed\
It amazes me how people are angry with the ones who use their flashlight as a incoming call marker on iPhones but this version of basically the same feature is considered dope. It really is quite decent-looking however
iPhone 5 with a clear back and some lights 🤔 and a regular android phone on the front?
Coming from the same guy who did OnePlus. Im pretty confident that this phone's specs will be alright but is it good enough to be the option that everyone goes for? That's questionable but definitely looking forward to it
"Looks pretty good, I like it.
We’ll see if this is style over substance but so far I’m intrigued."
This is so unique and honstly super cool. But I have some very mixed feeling on Nothing. Soooo..... yeah idk if I'd buy this.
Gimmicks dont last.
Hope it does good than Oneplus.
"the only thing that matters is price. looks and all that come second. if nothing offers a budget phone with flagship specs, itll be successful. anything else it wont sell. thats what made oneplus so good. best value for buck. until oneplus got greedy."
looks like an iphone 12 but cooler.
Looks like shit
"This phone was over hyped and retarded.

The only five people will buy this niche-fuck phone."
whoever compose those terrible nightmare sounding ringtone should honestly get fired
Nothing to see here.
Will there be a black version? 🙂
Nothing is a buggy pos.
"The lights are kinda gimmicky, Helps deaf people probably but for most of us it might get annoying"
"I must say, those are the worst ringtones I’ve heard in a while."
It will be 1199 $ 🙄😐
The design of this looks very cool. Need so see what kind of features it has and price.
"#6:32
OnePlus"
"It's not jsut the shape and layout that makes it look like an iPhone, but also the LED strips. If you look closely, it resembles the Apple logo a bit. The fact that on the right side there is a bit of the LED missing (the Apple bite), and the diagonal LED strip looks like the twig of the apple."
"shite phone ngl, i'd rather buy poco f3 any day of the week"
LMAO at that dig at OnePlus
"Lol, one of those ringtones reminds me of the interference you used to get on your tv a second or two before your phone would start ringing back in the the mid 2000s."
Good for them who have needs good battery backup 😂😂....
It would be better when those led's in the back of the phone can use the mors language pattern
Does it run on stock android though?
Mehhhhhhhhh
Interesting. Love the design! If it’s within range i guess it’s a good phone to turn peoples heads and act as a secondary device. Let’s hope the OS is good!
Well it's Android. So it can only be either bad or average at most. Let's hope it's at least average.
Gimmicky feature. Rest of the phone would most likely still be the typical chinese shit.
"Wow 😯, this video is 🔥⚡"
This phone would have been very cool in 2010....
"wow the ""             "" is really cool."
I really hope they can pull this off because it looks awesome
"Number one rule of not getting your screen scratched us to never put it screen down on a table.
But those LEDs are cool. Shame you can't show UI too."
6:00 that future is inevitable
"Yes, it does sound familiar lol. Never settle, they said but they did settle."
"Looks really really cool, but the only light i would actually find useful would be the charging indicator.
Seems to me it's going to be a Sony case scenario. The videos will have tons of views (especially Zacks durability test) but it will sell few phones."
coolest phone ever seen
"Achoo-ONEPLUS-ooo 🤧🤧 
very familiar."
6:00 explained the downfall of oneplus in seconds.... Nd nailed it!
I didn’t care for the look but that light gimmick has me wondering if that’s something cool enough to have me try it. Obviously camera and display need to be great but price is the biggest factor.
dope
"0:12 , 2:24, 3:38 he said he's allowed to show us only back of the phone till the release but......."
hows the battery consumption?
That is so cool !! Sooo Cool !!!
it should of bin multi color would of bin more nice
U got it on 16th june 🥹🥹🥹
The back look cheap? 🥲
Looks like my iphone 12 but slightly uglier 😵‍💫
6:32 One Plus
I don't keep cases on my phones so I'm interested lol. This looks really cool. I only worry about dropping it and busting the LEDs. Maybe Nothing can make a bumper case like the Nexus 4 had.
Carl pei already confirmed it about getting the customers covered with providing a case that's suffices the need
it's actually a cool looking phone.. cyber feeling stuff
Does it have the headphones jack ??
Better have good and long software support
Marques said in somewhere in the last part “sounds familiar?” Who/which company is he referring here?
"It nice..but nothing call for ""Interesting"" to the most people.."
"Great to see OnePlus, better, re-branded."
wooooooh!!!
Back of the phone is dope.!!!
1+
Looks so sick! 🥵
rgbw lights would have been much sexier..!!
Totally loved the equal borders across all sides on the front display. Finally an android phone with no ugly-ass chin (except Pixel 5).
The price will dictate whether this succeeds or not
"It looks ""Nothing"" like I've ever seen before 🤣"
"Well it'll be the performance that decides it for me. Since OnePlus turned trash, the market is open for disruption"
"Imagine Nothing in the next 5 years. I smell competition for the big tech companies. The Ear1 buds were so cool, plus the aesthetics of the phone."
Yeah it’s cool but I don’t wanna have to put my phone face down. Gimmick for now. I’ll wait until the full review to change my opinion.
😲😲
Feel like it’s the LA gear of phones.  I lights up and kids will think it’s cool for about a year and move on.
"Ah shit, here we go again"
from what I understood. He is only allowed to show the back of the phone 1:10. Up untill He showed the front 😂. Opsies?
"""I can only show the back of the phone""  Immediately shows the front of the phone for the Glyph app"
Cool but overhyped. I don't see it lasting or even reaching mainstream.
"Damn, shots fired against OnePlus at the end 😅
My thought at first glance was ""That's an iPhone"" and I'm still kind of scared whether this is a lawsuit waiting to happen. I hope I'm wrong. The design of the back looks really nice and the LEDs are super unique, but I wonder how their software update policy will look like. I usually don't really care about phones looking all the same, that just means it's easier to support them with custom ROMs after the manufacturer has stopped providing updates... with a custom element like this, you're more likely to be locked into the original ROM."
I am still waiting to see the specs of the phone. The lights are cool but performance and other specs matter the most.
"I mean come on,the design is far too similar to the iPhone."
Were u talking about OnePlus? LOL
This man says a lot without saying a lot. Absolutely amazing how he summarised the journey of 1+ without even mentioning the name
He purposely did that the CEO of nothing was the cov founder of one plus 🤣 but stepped down to create nothing.
"Thanks for givingway,"
Carl pei what is this guy
"Interesting!
But was expecting more😡"
From Nothing to Something
"It looks awesome, but I'm the kind of person who immediately puts a case on my phone for protection so I'm not sure how much utility I'd get out of it. If the price point is good I'll consider it, otherwise I don't think it's a fit for me personally."
"Mrwhoisthe boss:Best phone with backlight.
Mkbhd:iphone"
"As an s22 ultra user, I'm a sucker for flat screens and boxy edges like the iphone 4,5,12,13"
They listen to the people iPhone 12 type C by nothing
Yawn. 🥱
$599 to $699 seems like a bit to ask for this phone
WOW THATS LOOKS VERYYY DIFFERENT. I NEVER SEEN LIKE THAT BEFOREEE
"Ok come on MKB. You're sugar coating. Two things. 1. It's an Iphone inspired design, just say it, lol. 2. I'm never putting my phone down screen first so those flashing lights based on who is calling is a gimmick, you can say it lol. The one cool thing is that those LEDs at the back does make for a great light source for photos. Not hating or anything, I just found you were, oddly, tip toeing around this product."
They gave him the phone and said to only show the BACK of the phone? Ngl that's super lame. The back looks cool... but seriously?
"How is that lame? When the folding phones came out, they were only allowed to show the hinges. That's what happens when a company has a new concept. Makes total sense."
Clearly I see nothing
So the nothing laptop or computer next year then?
The ringtones sound like R2D2 on crack.
Meh. You’ll put a case on it and won’t see any of it.
"Like the phone, but I think Nothing promises too much. They present themselves as an alternative of Apple, the company who has reinvented the concept of smartphones. So I personally have high expectation of it, and this level of innovation does not look enough for me.

Tbh, with their ambition, I think Nothing should work on a ""new device"" that can reasonably replace the smartphones we all know too well today since smartphones have come close to their peak. They are a startup, this will be a great opportunity for them.

In fact, I believe Apple's AR devices around the corner will be their answer to potentially replace smartphones. If Nothing does want to compete with Apple at the same level, I would like to see their answer to the question."
Thinking of buying Poco F4 GT or waiting for Nothing phone 1 to release
An edge protector or edge only case will look great with this phone.
Title should be -- there is nothing in my hand
So pretty much a phone with built in some lights and that's the uniqueness?
After decades Different Phone is ready to Launch
Imagine some idiot buys an iPhone 12 case for this phone 💀
Okay. That is dope. It's like something out of Blade Runner 2049
"It looks awesome. I never thought I would get hyped for a phone with a hole punch,"
Lol how can you possibly say it looks different??
"If I were on android I would totally get this phone. Or, you know, wait until they make that super broadly appealing phone and have to go back to their roots with the Nothing North or something like that"
"Looks sick
03:15 Unless that is your LUT, those lights have a lot of green tint (probably missing some Red/Orange in the LEDs)"
"If they put triple embargo like the ear 1s, it's not worth it"
"Look closely to the LED, you can see the Apple Logo right there, Yep I know you can't ignore it now."
why does it look like an iPhone?
"Sorry, it looks exactly like an iPhone, especially the back and the side rails. Only difference being the notch on the front."
"Dbrand: the back on the phone is DOPE, anyways here's a skin you might wanna put on it."
First I thought it was quite ugly and meaningless but after this demonstration I still think it looks ugly but it seems super useful. I really wish that it gets super successful so that other brands also start implementing lights on the back. I know that there are some gaming phones with LEDs on the back but they don't do much.
Wow . Looks cool 🔥
I like the 1plus diss in the end 🤣
Sounds familiar
"It.. looks like an iPhone. 

Yeah, that's an iPhone"
Poof
Cool but gimmick
Idk. I don't think lights and sound is gonna differentiate it.
I am HOPING that those LED's can change color based on what app it's receiving notifications from. Now THAT WOuld be sick!
It's the dig at one plus for me hahaha
"U've been kinda quiet on the main channel this year, hvntcha?"
I ain't gone lie thats a beautiful phone fr that clean snow white
"6:30 That's OnePlus right there...
Yeah sounds familiar..."
Is it just me or the lights look like an Apple logo??????
"If I would buy a phone just for its design, I would buy this phone in a heartbeat"
"As cool is it is, those ringtones sounded pretty annoying to me 😅
Anyway, my only hope is that at least for a while they'd have the same spirit that oneplus originally had. Clean, stable OS with good features. Good build quality with great QA (device won't start having hardware issues after only a year or too). And at a reasonable price.
But maybe a better camera this time"
Cool phone but goofy ahh ringtones 😂😂😂
I’d give a benefit of the doubt. Also one plus is not what it used to be. They really settled and they are a mess compared where their vision were when they started. I can see ex one plus user going for this.
I missed widely coloured and themed phones for years! Realme really did a good job with those anime and video game themed phones. And the Nothing phone is looking good.
Everything is cool but why corner punch hole? It looks old. Wish it had a center punchhole. But let's see the pricing now.
I have it is good
I almost never put my phone face down. Hm.
If it ends up being expensive it's going to crash big time 🤣
6:32 OnePlus 🥴
oneplus 🤣🤣🤣
nothing to see here
"Squidward: “Nothing? We can’t just sit here and do nothing!”
The Nothing Phone: “Watch me.”"
I cant say ive ever seen a phone with a notification light on the back
that ringtone is f amazing wow
Hype train 🚂
❤️
those lights.... hehehe make it RGB
Awesome 👍👍👍👍👍👍
yes
Nothing impressive
Feels like ONEPLUS's story all over again🙄🤔.
"Honestly, i feel like nothing could really explode. I still want to know how the software is but i feel like this phone could really be a hit"
I'd be down if they just used Samsung's One Ui
looks like a phone for ten year olds
0:13 that chin 😱
Like my comment if you have bought Nothing ear 1.
Please tell me that's not the official look from the front of nothing phone 1. The bezels doesn't look good at all.
"I am going to buy it the moment it hits the market. OnePlus was the coolest mainstream tech company till Carl Pei was around before morphing into nothingness (heavy pun intended), but that guy has vision and he knows what he is doing. The phone looks like a clutter-breaker and I have been waiting eagerly for an awesome android phone for a while now which isn't Chinese or Samsung."
"This has Teenage Engineering all over it, including the ringtones."
Cool lighting!
No case required this back is awesome
I honestly like my phone on silent mode…
I really do miss having a notification light. ridiculous that companies got rid of them.
How much money we talking here ....
The missing alert slider is disappointing..
i thought that was the iphone 14 for sec
"Gimmicks…not compelling 
Love the symmetric bezels tho…"
The true Nothing Phone that lives up to its name is the NoPhone Air
"frick iphone, frick phone case am getting this phone"
Welcome 2022 we look at back of the phone more than the front of the phone
Took a dig at oneplus in the end 😂
"I also think the lights are pretty cool and would be a feature that I would definitely use; however, there's no way that I'd actually switch phones as I'm thoroughly embedded in the ecosystem."
Missed opportunity not making a kimpossible ringtone for the led's at the back
The only Unique phone right now
cool is the definition
What phones was he talking about at the end? One Plus?
"That casual, yet blatantly obvious to core users, dig at OnePlus 😂🤌🏻✨"
"Normal phones-> you buy them to look at there screen forever.

Nothing phone-> you buy it to look at back of the phone forever."
"the bad copy of various versions of the iPhone, 11 and 12, behind they wanted to do one thing but it seems to me when you break the glass of the rear iPhone that you take it to change before you put the I expected a lot more, not to mention a processor not even top of the range"
I would buy it if it doesnt have a bunch of pre installed browsers or system apps that end up useless like samsung and apple and google end up having that you cannot delete or turn off. So if it has that id be switching to nothing brand phones for a long time etc.
That OnePlus reference wasn't subtle at all.
the scribble was so cute to hear
"5:14 nothing’s phone, looks like nothing at all.. missed that pun there 🥲 sorry that was a bad pun"
"Just like iphone 💯💯💯🤣🤣
Copy copy apple"
"Okay, the Glyph LEDs are pretty cool ngl. But I’d say that’s not enough to pull me into buying a Nothing phone. That could change depending on implementation and how utilized it is, but it took a folding clamshell to get me to go dual phones and pull me somewhat back to android. So I’ll keep an eye on Nothing, but not holding my breath"
lovely 🌹💐
1:13 is he's only allowed to show the back of the phone then why showing front of the phone afterwards 2:26
If it was rgb..the picture quality will be improved by 20%
Will this phone be available in Bangladesh?
The Nothing phone is absolutely Something.
What’s the purpose of blinking red light for recording videos??
i bought the ear 1s and they are really nice but have slight errors and inconsistencies sometimes (like random disconnects and charging) which isn’t much but it does worry me as they move to making a whole phone. i’m no doubt excited and will def consider it but I also hope they can iron out those issues because a phone is an object you’d want to be fully polished
If their next phone has a pop up I'd definitely buy. Kinda sad that since 1+7pro there weren't any
This is what I want in an android phone. Experiments. You're not going to beat apple with simplicity.
"Also, until there is iMessage integration... it's a tough sell. Still not sure why this is the thing that has taken 15 years to catch up to."
6:27 Looking at you OnePlus.
The shade at One Plus 🔥
This is an iPhone replica even the gesture line at the bottom of the interface
Top left punch hole camera 🤔
apart from flashy LED lights does the phone really up to the expectation?
iPhone 12 lol
Who puts the phone upside down while charging?
should have an epilipsy warning at minute 3:47
"Looks like a very promising phone, I am a huge fan of the futuristic/cyberpunk design of the phone."
Oneplus: Thanks for the shout-out at the end Marques!
6:32 OnePlus
"Thanks God a company did not put RGB lights, especially in this month..."
Ok it really is cool but that font is soooo ugly how could anyone even think abt releasing something like that
where's the headphone jack 😢
"If they price it right, I am gonna buy it for sure."
useless
Nothing Phone  = modded iPhone running android
The clean design is so good
This is one cool looking phone i like it infact i love it
walking around in the public with that phone in your hand is definitely gonna make you stand out from the crowd.
"Let's w a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his contact to entertain,❤️☺️"
The og is here 🚀🚀🚀
those ringtones give me physical pain lol
Other smartphones companies are taking note about those light indicators.
"I love the design, it looks super cool and minimalistic. reminds me of a mix between the iphone and those clear wii remotes with lights inside them"
"Searching the whole internet for that thing.... Nothing 😜
Moving towards future 🤞"
damn! it looks amazing. it’s like the i phone i’ve wanted
"I actually like the design, it's both normal and somewhat futuristic"
Nothing special here
Looks like a broken cheaply made chinese iphone 12 clone
जो प्यारी प्यारी आखें कोमेंट पढं रही है ऊन्के सारे सपने पुरें हो और ऊन्के माता पिता के ऊम्र लंबी हो ये है ईश्वर शें प्राथना है मैरी 😅
are you a iphone promotor
"Clear cases do exist tho. And not just the cheap tpu full clear cases... Nice, bumpered corner, better material clear back panel cases exist"
.
"Really nice.. i guess definitely this will mark the complete end to Oneplus and a new beginning for Nothing, just love this idea.."
"The ringtone indicators are preety dope. They said they'd bring different, and maybe.....MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!"
Imagine that LEDs changing color........... mindblown....😎
So they only let you show the back of the phone? Getting flashbacks to the Surface Duo
I love the back lights
Sounds familiar: oh trust me I do 😂
C A S E🥲
Im sorry but main stream phones all just look similar basically....and calling it an iphone is basically unfair coz its simply based on the wireless charging and camera placement... Other than that you can't say the phone doesn't looks sleeek and definitely new in terms of design
man that was a good way to talk about oneplus
"I'll believe it when it comes out. It's all hype at the moment. And while OnePlus got off to a shaky start, it was impressive. Nothing has the same thing going. 

But the key is price. If it's expensive, then it won't last."
Nice clear glass iPhone
Tell about specification
"Looks ugly, maybe back in the 90s would be a success next to the transparent Gameboy. :D"
This Phone is actually a fresh breeze  In the Garden of Cell Phones 🌈🏵️🏵️🌠
This is so cool omg
Cool and all but how many people leave their phones face down? I remember on my old Note 2 it had a notification dot next to the front camera and there was an app where you could assign it different colours for different kinds of notifications
"And yet, no SD card or aux functionality...I'll stick to my Xperia 1 IV, thank you very much."
Nothing should make space for alert slider. 🙄🙄
ভুয়া নাম। মার্কেটে ফ্লপ খাবে শিউর।
Like the subtle dig at one plus 😀😀😀
sound familiar(dot)
See-through iPhone 😅
The ending 🔥😍...
Give it to me 🤭
While I am thinking as to what does this design actually mean. Would someone explain? :)
"Honestly, I'm pretty doped to see what this phone has to offer. But please don't be over priced."
"This sort of remind ls me of Danger and the Sidekick. Once the iPhone was out, it was only really trying to grab a certain demo. They might have something honestly if enough people become interested. People love the iPhone but people love more options more than anything else."
Really really really nothing
"there is absolutely no way to be able to tell after a certain distance the difference between that and an iPhone. it looks exactly the same. it doesn't look original man, come on. I like it but it just isn't a unique looking phone. you could get a transparent wrap around your device since forever. 

I legitimately thought it was an iPhone mod at first"
This is crazy Awesome 🤩
Now give me a nothing phone in black with RGB and a RTX 3090 slapped on the side of it
Meh..
That Looks Like An iPhone 12!
"6:33 *sounds familiar?* Dude, that was a cold one 🤣"
I'm getting oneplus one flashbacks!!
Teardown Teardown
"Listening to the video through my Nothing buds, which are awesome. Looking forward to the phone now."
Android 12 on iPhone 12
A pretty unique glass slab...
flexing their table tennis in the office
"The design looks sick, the led ringtone is a great idea. And most of all, the bezels is the same size all around. Props to Carl Pei, good job"
YES ILL BUY IT IF ITS UNDER 30k MAX!
I think it's overrated.
This video is just a 6 minute advertisement.
"same old story,unique look that gives its own identity with may be attractive price but below avg camera.Beginning of another Oneplus in the making"
Oh look a piece of junk.
does anyone know how much will it cost aprox?
"1 point for design so far
Let's see what else they have in store"
"I want NOTHING to be the next NOKIA
In smartphone era"
Nothing New in the market
"the only issue is that they are trying to dive head on into the whole iphone for android dream, but at this point its more like, why bother, you simply cant do what apple did without sacrifising the fundamentals of what makes android ANDROID!"
iPhone 12 😳
"I thought it was iPhone 14(Thumbnail). 😂
But Nothing (1)❤️"
thats the best looking phone out here
"Looked cool, then you flipped it around and I saw the hole punch camera, it was at that point I felt nothing."
Finally a phone with only the essential stuff you need in a phone and Nothing more.
Im just here to comment on the amazing hairline Marques have...pretty jealous xD and the video was neat also hahahaha
so only transparent covers then
"My biggest wish right now is for Nothing to outdo the OnePlus 7 Pro, then I'm hands down 100% in favor of Nothing"
"This looks pretty intruiging. 
If the camera is good, has a smooth OS/Frame rate and headphone jack for a fair price then I would be really curious to switch to it."
my nxt phn <3
"I feel like it was designed by someone looking at the back of the phone and forgetting there's a screen on the other side... The main reason I don't leave my phone screen side down is not that I dont have LEDs on the back.... It's that I don't want to scratch my screen... Same issue with shaking my phone while it charges.... Great idea, poor execution"
Why all the ringtones feel like villain backtracks
3:47 Took me a while to realise this was 2 shots stitched together. Great editing idea !
The power of technology
🙆🏾‍♂️
"Realized watching the hand movements,that's a good catch :)"
Holy shit I didn't even realize but yeah. Damn well done Marques!
Just noticed thanks to your comment!
Wow! First a transparent AirPods Pro clone and now a shameless iPhony (1) that's saying Nothing. 💯🤦‍♂
The dual embargo in full action 😂
"MKBHH: ""A transparent iphone 12 looks like this"".....shows us a transparent iphone 13 pro 🤣"
What a horrible shirt...
"Bravo, Carl Pei! This is mindblowing 🤯"
this are all useless stuff. keep it simple. thats all
"Useless features that will only drain more battery, nice"
"People don't mind paying extra for cool stuff only to the brands they trust. Like Samsung or oppo, vivo. Not some upstart"
"I really love the phone, but i will never buy it because of carl pei. This guy talked about innovation so much and then comes out with a phone that design is iphone 12 even the buttons placement are the same. This is not innovation and i can bet that os is the same fork as the rest of the device. I wouldn't have mind it if he didn't target apple so directly."
"i love boxy phones and it pains me that apple is the only one doing them currently, mildly hyped for this one"
"Looks is like 10% of what makes a phone great, though."
I have absolutely NOTHING to say about this phone!
the last moment was like explain OnePlus without mentioning OnePlus.
If it has good specs and they make the glyph RGB then I'd buy one in an instant
"I wish it was ""different enough"" to not have a notch or hole punch display. Why can no phone do what OnePlus 7 pro did with the pop-up camera? Not even OnePlus themselves. Zenfone got close but their 1080 screen is way too little PPI for my liking."
@Alex00712 exactly. I held onto my OnePlus 7 pro for dear life waiting for another full screen phone with high PPI. Upgraded to the Xperia 1 III. I really like this phone but I still want the futuristic looking all screen in the front look.
Cause I would go all out on getting Nothing Phone (1) if it had a pop-up camera. It's literally the only feature holding me back from getting a new phone right now..
"A fellow OnePlus 7 Pro user I presume? Yeah, I really hope Nothing recognizes the group of people who love the 7 Pro in a future Nothing phone and incorporates what was so great about it, but then also included the Nothing design language and features into it."
This looks like a Chinese toy
I'd love to see some iphone clone style android phone with the original OnePlus values
"Wow, that’s really cool! That’s what Apple should do with their phones lol!"
This phone is so beautiful. I hope t will also sell in south Africa too.
"I've been using Samsung phones my entire life, but this phone right here makes me wanna switch to it."
imagine this phone in black
Damn they wanna make this like an iPhone so bad
"I just there to be phones that don't run iOS or Android. It's become so boring.

I wish Windows Phone was still a thing because there need to be 3 platforms for things to be interesting... Maybe Linux phones that can also run Android apps in a seamless containers that only talk to other things when you allow it. Privacy doesn't seem to sell well but I'd click on a video of that, maybe even buy one."
"Very good looking ""not iPhone"""
"Hahah.. very impressive gimmics at back which is completely useless. I am sorry but its true. How many people keeps their phone upside down? Just gonna be a upset like sony used to be and gonna be purchased only by the very tiny group of enthusiasts. You gotto know your customers before producing..solve a problem, dont just add up useless features."
"Again embargo why? Why? You tend to show it. If you can't show the SoC, screen battery. Why for money you tend to show it if you can refuse the unit?"
It seems Iphone 12 from Caviar
"So besides the lights and being transparent, what's so special about it?
If this is the first thing they brag about releasing their first smartphone then I'll be impressed if it will even sell at all...
Feels like another gimmick to me right besides curved displays and pop-up camera's."
"Depending on the rest, this phone looks insane"
Hey @mkbhd How big is it compared to iPhone 12 or iPhone 13?
we want rgb
I often put my phone screen-down on the table so it doesn't distract me... with this LED back I'd have to leave it in another room. (it does look cool though).
So bad but this will go into a case..
Legends say this phone is nothing.
"""I can only show you the back...""

...shows the front too. 😅"
"So cool, I'd buy one"
"I don't know about anything else but I feel the lights are ""FANCY"" that's the word . The transparent back feels kind of a little odd tho . But I'd appreciate the trial of the thought and trials behind it :))) hope it comes out fine🙂"
The ringtone sounds were 🤮🤮
"I have to pass if going by this.

I want NO ONE aside from myself to see or recognize notifications from my comms devices.  ONLY ME!

I want more privacy."
Looks like an iPhone in WestWorld
Interesting 🔥😱
"""Sound familiar?"" Very much Indeed😂
OnePlus: left the chat"
It looks like a prototype of iPhone 12. I don't buy from copycats.
Matte black with white led plzzzzz
I'm 50% convinced to buy this.
"We have reached a point where we call an android phone in body of an iPhone except with some random grooves, unique?"
Oh yeah he didn't meant OnePlus
Man the timing couldn’t be more perfect 😅 I’ve been scouring the web today to see what new thing I can find about this phone .. and I can’t put into words how excited I was when I got the notification for this video!
So the power button acts as fingerprint sensor?
That's so fckin cool
What a design 🥰🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
It is not something different. It’s just an Android phone in an iPhone body with a transparent back-panel and without a notch on the screen. 😉
The led strips are a very sexy  touch
"ehem... ""oneplus"""
Looks good🤠
Notification lights are osm ♥️🤍🤍 and design 🔥🔥
"""sounds familiar""
Marques pointing to  OnePlus"
the whole phone is just a gimmick
This is so dope 😍
Nothing to see here.
Matte Black version with the lights = Win
"The no in nothing is for no fukin thank you. Buy the best phone at the time, keep it for 5 years and repeat. Trust me I've had the OnePlus 6 since release and that was a midrange, and other than battery and cameras it's holding up"
So it's the iPhone with the back skeleton
I would have bought if it had a god damned headphone jack (and sd card slot?)
"haha yep, I want one of these!"
How durable of those LED ?
"I think how long the battery lasts and how good the cameras are will define how big of a hit this phone is. If it has meh cameras and meh battery life, people would much rather buy similarly priced Oneplus/Samsung/Mi phones"
Cool!
I guess 95% of people really wouldn't care much abou the lighting at the rear of the phone as it's glass and they are gonna slap a case on it or at least a skin for additional grip.
I hope software situation is good
The light notification shit is highly unnecessary.
Because the phone learns from it's mistakes... 🤨🤨🤨😂😂😂
I just wished the hole punch camera was symmetrically centered.
"Ok I haven't watched the video yet, but this is absolutely an iPhone ripoff, design wise"
this is a gimmick thawears out after a dayt
2:02 ooo that cool
The nothing that looks different is the way my ex-girlfriend described me
"""Sounds familiar?"" 
Yep it sounds exactly like OnePlus. The recent update from OnePlus made my 8 Pro look partly like an Oppo and partly like an iPhone, and I don't like it. Plus it's full of bugs."
it's more likely... nothing phone back review.. 😂😂😂😂
where is the parrot though
Nice
"""can I look at the back for science""
~cultured weeb"
That totally looks like a repurposed iPhone 🤣
Lightsaber noise and star wars reference is apt.
a cool smartphone i've seen
"Those ringtones + light effects are the most Alien the 8th Passenger phone vibe I've ever seen! As a big fan of the franchise, gotta say... It looks actually dope!"
Also that some real 2012-13 sh*t with that light and ringtone
"I don't know. This strikes me as yet another bog standard Android phone with a skin slapped over the top of the UI, more than a little ""inspiration"" from the iPhone chassis, and a gimmick in the form of the lights on the back. If they'd said ""hey, we're going to release a neat looking phone with a decent number of years of support for an Android phone,"" that would have been one thing, but ""we're going to disrupt the industry and change the world"" is a bit ridiculous."
Really looking forward to buying this
is the hardware cool? yes. is the software cool? well.. not really because its android. So billions of people will never switch because of that. I'd like to see a company completely reinvent hardware BUT ALSO make their own unique software.
sick...dope...the language of adolescence
It hits different
"This is just oneplus all over again, by the same creator too…."
Different is almost never better.
"They should release a CYBERPUNK version of this, that would be crazy!!"
900 LEDS.. i can hear the battery crying haha
W
D brand be like this is out of syllabus
"This looks so dope, stylish."
"alrights, now I know what kind of iphone case I want to make wahhaha"
"It does sound familiar, sounds like OnePlus lol"
the ring flash reminds me of some 1970's or 1980's sci-fi vibe.
the shade lmao
2:02😁
no alert slider :(
6:32 one+
"It will be interesting to see the price range. If they could make it with a base price of 500$, that would be an actually new flagship killer"
Just looks like an iPhone to me
Samsung and LG did these gimmicks way back and never worked out
uhmm can i borrow it for a while? i need to make a call uWu
"""yo bro what phone you got""
""nothing"""
And no headphone jack :/
Deffs talking about One Plus at the end 😅😂
I was gonna switch over to an iPhone soon but I think I might wait for Nothing phone to be released or the next generation of it
I thought MKBHD would be the first to do this and it just so happened  🤩🤩❤️❤️
Only allowed to show the back. Shows the whole phone front. Lol
"I watched this video two times and the novelty wore off already, meh"
Feels like the Essential Phone that he dad some kind of a hype and died off 4 years later
Star Wars phone
'Nothing' sponcered video
Not a phone for the epileptic community for sure.
Damn those ringtone sounds and lights effects sounds amazing and cool
Wow 😳😳
It's simply amazing
"loved the video and i loved the design.
As  along time naruto fan i would say that Naruto phone looks sick too. hell yeah."
only if it had 3 cameras everyone would think it's a customized iPhone
This is a real cool phone but looks like an iphone 11 for some reason  🙂
We all will love these features but soon they will die just like pop up cameras
?????
"This will be an hypebeast phone that people will buy to look different, other than that it will change NOTHING in the industry."
Interesting phone but comes across a bit gimmicky and yes it looks like an iPhone 😁
Bro it looks so much like an iPhone lol 💀
Really like the design of this.
Resemble apple logo a little bit
"Marques: It looks familiar
me: it looks like an iPhone"
Does it have slider??
Will definitely fail
Does it have 120 hz
If the camera is good. Then its gonna be a hit.
Bezel symmetry is appealing too
"Actually I don't care about the LED on the backside. The internal features, performance, and camera that only matter to me"
The similar sound was 'Oneplus'. 😂
He was talking abt one plus ryt!
Bias Indian tech channel @TechnicalGuruji won't be happy watching this video 😁
When I saw the thumbnail I thought it was an early design model for the next iphone
can't wait to get this in a couple of years
Wel... It looks like Nothing
Enthusiasts don't want this light BS. They want good price to performance ratio with a smooth UI and timely updates. Gimmicks
"I am all for more different designs that have some personality to them, instead of just being fragile hunks of glass, all looking the same. I love the design of ROG phones and I also like where this one is going, I would like to see more of them."
NOTHING might be at par with PIXEL...Cause I feel both of them could be sort of on the confusing side.
Looks SICK!!!
Did they put an embargo on him showing the back in a dark environment ? That's what I was waiting for the entire video.
"But why??? Why? Just look at the screen. For the iPhone, there are 5Million “LEDs”"
6:08 OnePlus 🌝
"My only gripe: They chose very ugly patterns. At least they could have made somewhat aesthetically pleasing LED patterns. Nothing too crazy, just little ""complete"""
As the OP is dying this is gonna be my future phone of course it depends on the software and I'm sure Carl pie will do justice to this phone like he did with OP when they started.
The eye appealing back light design is dope but as a user it all depends on the price range and the specs. It will be good if you could just go through it as well.
Wow
6:33 damnnn no oneplus was harmed during the filming of this video 😂😂
if you want to know more download Nothing launcher
The way he mentioned OnePlus without mentioning OnePlus ;)
Something Fresh
damn an android iphone
Westworld phone
"once people slap cases on that phone, it will literally be. . . Nothing. . .  special anymore"
🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥🫥
"That ending was...
Just nice."
Woah wait...CHIN and over all side was supposed to be minimal right ???? It's thick!!! And yah....where's the alert slider?
"The price matter!! If i am getting an expensive phone I put a cover on it and tge back make no change to me . And if i am buying too expensive then I don’t buy new brand , i will get an iphone! The price matters"
"This channel once didn't kept ads before videos, atleast for the first few weeks but...
How fast time make people do things different 
No hate*"
The lights on the back might be really good for def users so although it might not being in a huge extra mainstream audience if they are smart they could work closely with various disability charities to make it even friendlier for that market.
4:03 perfect ringtone for airports
💀💀
💀
💀💀
💀💀
Looks good 😃
Whatttttt.i thought it has center selfie camera
6:29 OnePlus shaking rn 💀
What iphone 12 with lights is this?
It kinda looks like an iPhone 11 or 12 on the back.
"Strategy sounds familiar? ummm, perhaps by a loyal one plus customer :)"
It's giving TRON Legacy vibes.
Only issue i see about this design is that a case company can copy that idea with having lights on the back of the phone. which is exactly what i would want for my iphone. I would love that subtle glow when taking pictures
"Little one plus tackle here, love to see it"
The case for the Nothing phone would have to be... well... nothing!
"Overall there are collaborations, it doesn’t appeal to me at the moment."
"Well, you also gave us the screen there, at 0:13"
"Its iphone 12 design with transparent back and using that transparent back for some unique lighting and sound effects.
More over you are allowed to use only clear cases if you want to make use  of those.
Thats it"
Nifty. But a bit gimmicky for my taste.
"Design team: do you want some Led for Notifications?
Management: did you say *LED?*"
"Not sure if it's worth the hype, but boy this look soooooooo good! Straight to the design of the year award 🏆"
"@INSTINCT22 Or, hear me out, you can buy an iPhone. The standard model is literally not that expensive lol."
@Fiji Will223 then what It's coming in the budget segment who would not want an iPhone looking phone
@Fiji Will223 no one asked
It’s literally just an iphone ripoff with LED lights on the back 😐
The led is really sick ⚡
Will it turn yellow? Like transparent case?
Cool design
The noise of when the speakers buss before a call comes in!! Ok I really hope they take trade-ins
I'm actually a big fan of the design. Would be interested to see if the rest of the phone is any good.
"Design is ok. I can understand them. They are trying to be different. But if the software is not buttery smooth, the phone may fail. I just hope that it becomes like HTC phones phones from 8 years ago. And not like Essentials…"
Really interested in this but just need to see if it's actually any good
trash
Current bid on Stock X is $803
Update $1786 👍🏻👍🏻
iphone 12?
"Firstly he said he’s allowed to show only the back of the phone then after few moments boom 💥 
He showed the display as well 😂"
"The words are so carefully put together and you'll never get a definitive answer anymore, even biased opinions. I miss biases."
this phone is cold cant lie id get one for sure. maybe as a second phone
That looks great for LEDs lovers. Ain't a fan. It's cool though
"The entire video is about a back of a smartphone, what a useless video. 90% of people don't even care about that."
I'd buy it just for the LED's on the back
It's just to save cost
"Nothing phone looks exactly like:
Rear and sides: iPhone 12/13 design
Front: Galaxy Note design"
"only drug dealers and snapchat 12 year olds use LED notifications nowadays, it looks cool but i think most ppl now go for a more subtle phone and 8/10 times its the UI, specs etc. that ppl care about on a phone. But its too early to speak since its not out yet"
Why are they placing all these gimmicks on the back? i look at the front of it 99.99% of the time and place it face up on a table...
"The back thing looks really cool and all, don't get me wrong, but this looks like the kind of feature you'll be very excited about at first, but completely forget it exists after two weeks. I hope the software experience stands out as much as the back, because that's actually the most important thing on smartphone if you think about it for a second."
"Believe in the Son of God 🙏. Read the Bible. Our Saviour Jesus Christ died so that we will live.
Jesus said, ""I'm the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me"". ""If anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”"
"i think you're spot on. Essentially it is a gimmick. It's not gonna change the industry. Nintendo does a ""gimmick"" right in that it actually revolutionizes the video game industry as well. Wii, motion controls, Switch, mobile AND console gaming in one. These fundementally changed the way people played video games around the world. Sorry but this is just lights that look cool for a few days then you'll want normal notifications etc. back."
"@Gare ya literally pointless and purely for hype purpose. We have people saying traditional led light is pointless when you has oled display to be customised for notifications, but when this even more pointless single colour led come in at the back of the phone, suddenly people buy this hype saying it's so usefull"
"@Kojisan1 I love having a notification LED, but there's a difference between a simple RGB LED on the front of the phone, and an array of (supposedly) single-coloured LEDs on the back of the phone. The former is something I find infinitely useful, and the latter is something I find completely pointless."
@SamJackkk what does that even mean. Most android phones use very appleesque software design.
Dude oh my god I use a freaking Galaxy S7 yes S7 for this reason alone.  Having a gd little flashing led to let you know you have a text or call is so important that I wont even join the current century.
why do you have a weather icon back there in the studio?
Cringe
"Damn, didn't mention anything about the phone experience or whatever. Embargos are quite annoying."
The video quality is too dope.
6:33 one plus
"I am interested in buying this phone because it's a flat display with flat sides no bezels, it has wireless charging and reverse wireless charging I love the led lights in the back I am definitely switching to this and leaving my Google Pixel 6 Pro behind Because I hate curved displays"
Nothing Different “ 😉
Most Important Question: Will Dbrand case come out for this phone?
"All ik is, I love unique things and this phone has my attention. Now I just can't wait to see the specs for final decision 🙌🏿😤"
"1 question 
Do you use your phone without cover?"
"Really disappointed to see a holepunch. Was thinking they'd try underdisplay or pop up camera, like the OnePlus 7. Really turned off now."
"I'm balls deep in the Samsung ecosystem and don't consider switching, but it's nice to see companies bringing new competition because it always pushes the industry forward. I'm loving the aesthetics of this brand so far 😍"
"You should be smart about it. I don’t put myself in any eco system. 

Always use apps and stuff that is cross platform. 
For example I use fitbit which works both with iphone and android. I also use MS 365 for backup since it works on mac, ios, android and windows.

Don’t give up your freedom mate."
is the ending is OnePlus story?
iMessage iykyky
INVEST!!!!!!
4:03 Ptsd ringtone
4:03 would scare the shit out of me if i heard that first thing in the morning
"Here me out, what if they make a full led display back. Then it lit up based on carved case."
"If Nothing got the basics of the phone done correctly, no one would be scared to try it provided they put android into the phone. Most android users won't mind trying if the software experience, camera and battery can keep up with whatever they are currently using. Otherwise, it would be a tough sell just to have quirkiness as a feature to bring people over to a new brand / ""ecosystem""."
IT AIN’T FAMILIA
6:20 Marques sounds like a person talking about their ex who had broken his heart but has returned with the promise of never leaving him again. (OnePlus)
The LED lights are sick... But I would turn them off to save battery life
"Don't mind the iPhone like design and I'm glad the lights have actual purpose but it feels like the first phone is more about the hype than anything else and if enough people buys in it, the second version will be the one to go for. Or is it just me?"
How to rant about Oneplus without taking its name? It's nothing!
"1:12 I’m allowed to show only the back of the phone. 
2:25 Shows the full phone"
"Review an upcoming oneplus nord(nord 3) decice  and give a final decision ""does nothing beat oneplus"" ...."
colorful leds
"One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates..🟥"
"I love the body design 😍,  I can't say much about the software interface lol.. its looking like an old android phone"
This is awesome! I'm watching it for the 3rd time lol
Ill get it to add to the phone squad.
I am definitely gonna get this if the price is great.
"People will buy this for only 2 reasons:
- Transparent back
- The chance to reply ""Nothing"" when others ask what that weird phone is"
"At first glance, it looks quite similar to an iphone in camera layout, but the back glass design and the software really separates from the pack!"
Camera bump failure :)
🔥
I would love this phone!
"The question is, should I buy Nothing stocks?"
It's interesting only if it's 500$
The question is how much will it cost??
"Cool ideas, even cooler look, if the cameras and screen will be the top I think I will buy it instead of Apple or Samsung flagships"
"meh, i put my phone face up"
I guess nothing is bringing nothing new to the table just looks like you copy iPhone 12 … oh but we have a light show on the back … what about when I put a case on it … uuuuuummmmmmm
That last dialogue. Perfect
"The dig at oneplus at the end though....

“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” batman. 

OnePlus became what it sought to kill. Wonder that was the reason Carl left oneplus..."
6:30 watching this on my OnePlus 9 in sadness
"Imagine the close encounters of the third kind, lights and sound as the ring tone."
6:32 *emotional damage*
A case would cover all of what makes this phone unique
"I do wonder if some company will overtake apple or google or samsung for 'Most selling phone company'. 

Who am I kidding? That's not gonna happen. These world owning companies are more than just companies at this point..."
"If this phone has a good price and long software support, it surely will be a winner"
I love the subtle digs Marquess takes😂
I will buy this phone if price is affordable 😁😂
It looks like the iPhone with a skin on the back….
“Nothing” new but copy “iPhone”. 🤣😜
I actually want a new phone as I'm still using a 7t pro with an android 12 rom but I think I'm sold on this
*coughs OnePlus
Definitely an eye catcher. I have Nothing Ear 1 and I love their design. I am planning on upgrading to iphone 14 pro from OnePlus 6 this Christmas. Hopefully they nail the software in this. Clean and Simple
"the question is do you really need a transparent back cover, where you can get it from a transparent skin from dbrand teardown or a transparent pattern case like the oneplus nord"
Nice looking I phone 12 clone 😂
Sounds familiar c'mon 1+
"I think it will boil down to pricing. At under $600, i’d probably buy it. I don’t normally spend a lot of time staring at the back of my phone and I don’t think a bunch of lights is going to change that, but I like the fact that this looks like an iphone actually but more “tech-y”"
ty
Oneplus: or loose what you are
6:22 “even more broadly appealing”…. And finally ……”an AMOLED display on the back”😂
Oneplus 2.0
This phone looks like a naked iphone at first glance
"The back with the light design looks good, but I don't like the way the whole phone looks so close to an iPhone. 
When Carl said there wasn't ""enough innovation"" in the android space, I didn't expect him to counter it with light on the back. A foldable phone is radically different, but this is as different as the pixel back is from other phones.
Anyway, there's surely a market for this nothing phone."
You showed the front part!
"A great name for the video could be: ""nothing made something!"""
It feels like nothing is into it.🗿
Looks like an iphone and an early generation pixel's lovechild
6:31 oh the -1
We won’t see a truly original phone design till a viable third operating system enters the market.  Very unlikely though.
When I first saw the thumbnail I thought it was an iPhone 12…then I saw it was a Nothing Phone and was a little disappointed but still is super cool!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️LOVE IT 😍😍😍😍
I think it looks sick.
Listen to him. This guy knows things about design.
Call the doctor then 😂😂😂
Nope its totally fine & healthy
Yeah
Wow
I'm sold on the body.  Now it's up to the OS and camera go see if I'm officially moving from OP7P to Nothing Phone 1.
Really .? Really.it’s feature?🫣🤭
"He said, ""Sounds Familiar?"" hinting ONEPLUS"
The dig at OnePlus at the end though😅
First
2:25 punch hole camera.. Looks the same from front.. But still its good
Of course he has it!
If this phone had iOS I would buy it immediately.  The lights look great.
"Great design, just have to wait to see about hardware and software..."
Those Puns😂
Only white light?
"The LEDs on the back look kinda like an apple logo, with the circle in the middle, a cutout on the right and a line on the top hahah"
Man now this is something to purchase
"definitely a decent design, but not much of a shocking factor for me"
"Basically, it’s a Chinese, LED back,iPhone-looks android phone"
ONE+²
YEAH BABY!!! I NEED NOTHING MORE!
"Unexpected surprise by *MKBHD* *&* *NOTHING* ❤️‍🔥

And we are loving these Small surprises 😉"
"When he said ' giveaway '
I was expecting something more😂😂"
"Me in 4/2014: I'll get the HTC One M8 because its different
Me today: I need this one too."
I guess we will soon enter the RGB era of smart phones
I’ll just put a Dbrand Icon Skin on it.
Giveaway please 🗿🥥🌼
Left upper corner punch hole?
charging indicator is really cool
❤️
6:18 who he meant?
"Yoooo the Storm2 lmao
Loving my massive, see thru battery"
Wasn't the front facing camera supposed to be on the center?
Anyone know a price yet? looks pretty interesting I would love a secondary phone to run Android on
6:26 Sound familiar OnePlus?
"FInally someone saw the multiple generations of Samsung LED back covers and decided to actually integrate it into the phone itself. Why did it take us this long ? And more importantly, why is samsung not already doing this ?"
"Nice, they make smartphone nowadays fun. Like the phone in 2000s"
"It is designed by former Oneplus vice CEO, but this phone won’t sale in China."
"Coming soon in a theatre near you >.<
Also, were you talking about Oneplus?
And wasn't this a trend back in the times of old when PS controllers, GBA, and that little dongle attached to the corner of phones?
Damn, I'm ancient..."
"i was super super super sceptic of this company 
but this is COOL, like i can't remember last time i saw a phone this cool, EVER"
Sound familiar? One-plus : Don’t look at me!
it looks really AMAZING
"Its cool, it's dope, I'm definitely going to get this one .."
Das good Shit.
Can't wait for jerry to destroy the phone.  Want his point of view on that back panel and the lights lol!!
Amazing troll of OnePlus 😂😂😂
lmao marques hit the iphone comparisons with a 'ok and?'
I always lay on my phone on the back rather than on the face which basically kills off anything unique for me about this phone
IPhone copy.
Holy shit they got me at the back LED
I'm down with this for sure. We finally get something that's actually different.
"imagine a different timeline, where the nothing company had the same advertising etc, but they sold only nfts of their products, idk why but i think it'd be hilarious"
"You really captured the feeling of disappointment of 1+ fans. 
Hope this doesn't go the same way. Hoping Nothing !"
Hope this phone have a flagship chip..
I'm definitely buying this
"The shape and look are so good, I love the somewhat sharp edges. The price and performance will be very important, along with the durability."
we saw the front
This could be the coolest looking smartphone of all time 💯
"Why you keep doing this ?

18:9 and 21:9 aspect ratio videos cannot be played correctly on the YouTube app when using an iPhone.

This problem has existed for a while and has never been fixed. User experience is degraded for iPhone users watching videos:

- In 18:9 videos a piece of the notch protrudes onto the screen

- In 21:9 videos it is impossible to zoom out

Please upload your videos in Classic aspect ratio (16:9) like other youtubers"
that oneplus reference lol
There’s a Naruto Phone????????
"boy this will be a huge let down/disapointment... That's the only thing they are good at, building interest.. but then??? nada. If you talk the talk then walk the walk"
"For the amount of time people been waiting to see what is in Nothing, it's literally nothing great, or maybe I should say nothing great in what we have seen so far.
I hope there will be no disappointment in the performance and camera section. 
Looking for something out of Nothing in the coming videos"
جميل
A like for the phone ...this is really a dope phone🥲
Those have to be the most obnoxious ring tones I've ever heard
Nothing is filled with surprises and I hope it's hype holds up true 🤞
🤣Those loghts mean battery drain
Cool design!
Would be better if it was multi-colored.
I wonder if more people would buy it if the back led were rgb🤔
I like it a lot (the nothing phone 1)
"This reminds me of Huawei's smart innovations and their little stuff that made them very unique; For example, the pulse glow for notifications on a special finish of the P50 Pro, or the eye-align and awaken feature of their Mate 40 Pro. Or the knuckle drawing/typing all flagships from Huawei had.

These can definitely be a selling point of the nothing phones. Especially if they can fulfill the promise of making a phone that doesn't cut any corners despite being relatively affordable."
Think of how many people will throw a case on it and the LEDs become useless..
All that stuff on the back of the phone and I don’t remember the last time I or anyone else I’ve ever met has put their phone down face first.
"I hoped for a transparent sided phine with nokia 3220-like lights on the side.... if we spoke about notification LED....
At least someone should do one where the volume, and on-off buttons are transparent, or the antenna bands all around, with LEDs behind them...."
Me with case that holds my cards.... :?
OnePlus is definitely not roasted in this video.
this phone is actually very cool!
so COOL.
They could have made the ring tones better all of them sound like when some futurustic machine making noise when it damaged
"I would absolutely get this phone, however, I am trapped by the Apple ecosystem due to my wanting for an Apple Watch."
NGL looks like a gimmick
Looks cool and interesting. I’m tired of the boring smartphone designs nowadays.
I wonder why there is a PowerBook G3 is in the background…
I am sold for the notification lights alone!
"Carl ´´smartphones are getting boring´´ the  nothing Phone Ironicaly introduces NOTHING new that makes their phone different so far this is just another boring phone.
putting a light on the back of the phone doesnt make the phone more exciting rather put a screen like xiomi did a lo more usefull IMO.

Not Impressed so far."
Nothing to see here
Can it fit on iPhone 12/13 case ?
1:10 You might want to watch the video again. There's places where you showed the front
Same thoughts! Funny how many times he showed the front of the phone.
"Was looking for this comment, I laughed and was shocked at the same time because I knew they were only showing the back in photos."
Nothing is nothing but a over hyped gimmick 😊
I will buy it as long as the camera is good.
"The design helps bring attention to the new phone, but I think the software experience is going to either make or break this phone."
"It looks great. I can't wait to see their next models with RGB LEDS. Ngl, I'm going to wait for the black edition."
@Jayden matte black with them white LEDs. It'll make really POP
matte black everything 😁
"I’m sorry but when I first saw it, I thought that it was a iPhone 12/13 without the back iPhone layout ……."
Imagine having oxygenOS or stock Android in it...🔥♥️ immediate buy
Honestly most people will be like the phone definitely looks apart but will stick with the traditional phones.
"Should they get aggressive with pricing, it could grow a steady audience.
The main issue is that this seems to aim to the niche, like there's a market for a nicely designed phone that's easy to use, but nothing is not a mass market company. So my initial reservation is price. How can you sell this at a cost-effective price point.
Or should they go the OnePlus approach and make it super affordable and accessible to get traction and saturate an already saturated market."
"Hey Marques, 
You may review the solar car ""lightyear"" from netherlands. I am sure you'll love it"
The LED lights is special edition only for 1st 100 phones sale
"Apple going like that in the future, giving us a nothing"
Looks like a iPhone XS and 12 bastard child.
"""I'm only allowed to show the back""
Me: you showed the front too😂"
Yooo! A Stormtrooper and an iPhone had a baby.
"Best part of the video when he said : sound familiar 
Audience be like : that's OnePlus"
Only if they placed the selfie cam in the center rather than corner 🙁
"And entire video dedicated for LED'S 

well that's a first"
Of course Marquess will not miss the chance to hinting about OnePlus. How they end up abandon the vision that make them gain more customers.
depends on OS and updates. looks nice though
"The OnePlus diss at the end there, lol"
It looks like an iPhone with a dbrand skin
Nothing Smartphone 🔥🔥🔥
"Man if I ever go back to Android one day, and if Nothing can thrive on for that long, I'll probably switch to a Nothing Phone. It looks so fkin cool."
Sounds like OnePlus 😂
"Ok, I'm more interested than I thought I would be 😳"
"Well, they really put some outside the box thought into this. Cool. Now, will people buy it? That remains to be seen...
Me? I won't buy it. Doesn't appeal that much. A lot of other things are more important in my life: software quality, stability and support, top cameras, top screen etc"
I'm sold so far! I just wanna look at the UI..
So an emu iPhone
Do you think there'd be a dark colored version? The leds would look even great on it
"This Has nothing to do with Apple and Pixel right?  
RIGHT?!"
NO RING/SILENT SWITCH?!!
Hope this company won't end up been like one plus.
"I now watch marques videos consciously checking for hidden gems in the back , like the MKBHD text in the back  or that staple looking thing on the desk"
"Imo, apples gonna copy this led scheme in the form of a case using the w2 chip"
Looks like an iPhone 12 lol.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
THE ONEPLUS DIG HAD ME WHEEZING- DAMN.
Dude if they make this in black with those LEDs I'm going to buy it as soon as it launches
1:12 : I'm allowed to show you the back of the phone and he shows full. Am I the only one wondering about this?
I don't need it but it just looks so freakin cool..
"I just wanna remind people that Nothing is a startup company. We're witnessing their first steps into a huge market with extreme competition. What they mean by ""taking on apple"" and such are their future vision so give them a few tries and a little time and then everything will be clear how Nothing will turn out.. keep your expectations at a fair level so you won't be disappointed, nor cricticism will burn em to the ground when they actually deliver :)"
@MrUnknown Nothing is from the founder of Oneplus btw
@DanteXPD If you have used both phones you should know.
@139 what's the sensible choice?
"@Levy Roth ""near perfect"" 💀💀💀💀"
There is a reason why back lighting was gone - no one will put the screen side on the desk.  The funcction is fun but not practical.
"My first thought is, can you change the colors of the back lights? But then I was thinking, if not, imagine how dope it would be if they came out with some cases that had strategically placed channels on the back to allow the light to shine through and maybe those channels are tinted to give you a different color. Honestly now I really like this design, like alot"
@æ what if its a single color LED just like on POCO F1
Great idea!
Wow !! Even I thought whether the LED could change colors. But your solution is actually cooler. You can personalize the phone with a single color instead of a RGB light.
RGB will be the next gen and cost $1000 lol.
@Adarsha Nagateja I It might be possible on a custom ROM (unless the LEDs they chosen only display white colors instead of RGB) if Nothing releases their kernel sources.
"If this'll be the android phone you daily drive, would you switch back to using ringtones?"
I know your phone is always muted 😛
So this video is all about nothing. I never thought I would say that.
"What all we have seen of the Nothing phone 1 till now, the back design, LEDs, front display, the features,etc seems on point and just enough to draw attention of the customer.
I think Nothing is going to be massive hit in India. People are looking for a good 400-500 dollar phone. Oneplus used to fit that criteria but its in shambles right now. Just hoping that the software experience is also great. That would seal the deal for me atleast.
I have the ear 1 and I have not been disappointed by them. So hoping for another great product from Nothing"
Nothing to see here ..
Looks Clean!
"Finally, something different. Or should I say nothing's different 🤔"
As an Op-1 and Op-z user I'm really excited to see what they've done interface wise. I hope they live up to the hype
He talking about oneplus? When saying left the original fanbase
What kind of maniac sets their phones glass side down?
This reminds me of my old Nokia with the rubber sides that lights up! I miss this feature! NICE!!!
If this was the iPhone the droids would go: “ugly” but if it’s a copy (intentionally) “wow looks cool” applying double standards and once u see these idiots then don’t waste your time because most of em are little pieces of crap using a sub $100 scamsung phone who know nothing about anything except hate because their parents won’t buy them an iPhone
Basically an iphone but android
Superb! Love this.
OnePlus 😆😂😂😅
Why did I immediately think of One Plus when Marques said “sounds familiar?”
very dope!
Going to get this for sure 
"Thi# looks exactly like an iPhone, is this how they were going to differentiate themselves from Apple??? C'mon!! Be original atleast or else stop making ground shaking claims!!"
"First impression looks wow, eventho it quite generic, but looks cool for an android phone!"
"Shut up Apple sheep, you lost all your credibility a few days ago."
Coooool
"I think the design is appealing, but design only helps you so much. Performance wise I'm sure there's little to worry: Nothing's phone is probably best placed at a lower price point, which means that they have good and fully sufficient performance stats compared to entry level phones by the big dogs (or better). For the normal user, this is all fine.

I think the differentiating factor will be software and service integration. It's the main reason why I won't switch away from Apple anytime soon. I wonder whether they will build their own OS instead of doing an Android clone... this would be real interesting then."
Watching this video on that familiar phone 😂
I would buy this in a heartbeat
iPhone 12
"Marques: I’m allowed to show only the back of the phone 
Also Marques: Shows the front side of the phone
Neat😑"
I feel like the Nothing Phone's iPhone-centric design was deliberately designed to lure those who would have wanted to switch to an iPhone but didn't want to pay the extra money to actually switch to one.
This is dope
Super Impressed...💯
I used to have a phone case that lights up when you receive a text or call. IT WAS HELLISH ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE A TEXT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT! 😅
Take your “I want one” ticket here.
"No headphone jack, great shame"
This weird ambargo is pulling youtubers away from most of first imression ideas. Thats a red flag for a company!
Damn so weak
Am sure dbrand!!! has goat moded on this one
6:23 One Plus! :/
"Dope features , Futuristic phone !!"
"MKBHD at 1:09 , meanwhile at 2:24"
Yeahh... Nothing has done something😁
"If ""HONESTLY NEVERMIND"" was a phone."
Honestly looks great!
It literally looks like Samsung and Apple had a baby
Wait I want that Naruto phone what is it
Everything is cool but what about the battery  with all led lights on? If that's not efficient then having those lights are pointless!
The ringtones are dope
"Why does the glyph looks like an apple? With the leave and a bite missing...
But looks kinda cool and cool functionality"
So cool
The last shade tho!!! 😂😂😂😂
Flop
"Overall quite a polished phone, while still pushing the boundaries of your average phone it still remains in the expectations of users."
Agreed
What is the price  bro?
6:36 ONEPLUS 👀
Would love to see those dragon ball and Naruto phone review
Unpopular opinion: This phone looks like a NOTHING phone
Will the glass get tinted yellowish overtime?
was that a one plus reference at the end?
"If I used android, I would definitely consider it. I would have to look into their privacy policies, but the phone itself looks like a solid 8/9"
damn you didnt even show the screen
I've missed dedicated notification LEDs.
"If the front looks mundane, look back!"
Nuh roo two phone. 😭
"Congratulations guys iphone and oneplus just had a baby 👶,  its called i1plus= nothing 😅"
It looks like an iPhone with a clear back
definitely some Teenage Engineering vibes.
Can’t wait to have one  ☝️
"Nobody wants to put their phone face down, that’s just stupid"
long time after something important on channel
"Okay... So all i gotto say is i see nothing becoming the next OnePlus in the next nine years. Remember folks you saw it first here... Subscribe! Shameless plug. 
Peace."
"6:33 
That subtle Oneplus Diss 😳😂"
"6:33 Reminds me of One Plus. They started off as the flagship killer and gained a loyal customer base, but with time they started appealing to a broader customer base, to the point where they are indistinguishable from most modern flagships and their pricing."
Thanks for stating it! I was pretty sure he meant OnePlus but haven't been paying attention to the market for a while so wasn't certain.
@Atasna143xx I don't know why I feel all this is staged and nothing is secretly funded by BBK or even some Chinese investor. I have been following since oneplus 1 and used 3t and current 7t. After price increase and worst software bugs I was about to get s22 ultra. But with 8gen 1 hating issues I just put that on hold. In my country iphone 13 and oneplus 10 pro cost same 😂😂.. I might try nothing if it has good camera and price is low. Still we don't know about soc
"same can be applied to samsung.  they started with niche phones:   a camera-phone-camera,  a  pico-projector phone,  etc etc.  then  they surrendered to the average consumer."
A company can’t survive selling thin margin electronics to a niche set of users that don’t upgrade very often. The goal of the start up game is to eventually be profitable.
Thanks Captain Obvious!
I like this channel :)
looks like a transparent iphone 12 without that camera housing
I would totally buy it if it comes with like the original untouched android software
"if the price range is dope then i am down for it,the back looks dope"
I have one expression/word for this - *WOAHHH-*
I was expecting center punch hole 😏
"Flat, even bezels are a trend in the right direction 👏👏"
It just looks like the back of an iPhone but unfinished
that glyph is sick. would love to see a black version with coloured led
The ending scares me
"Portland, JAMAICA in The Building !!!!"
"6:15 - 6:32
Hopefully that's not true but is there any other way? The more the company progresses, the more they likely to loose their roots."
This gonna crumble even before reaching Samsung and apple. It's gonna get beat up by another Chinese phone lol
Haters gonna say it looks like an iPhone OwO
The Cyberpunk phone!
The phone looks 🔥 wish it was in red
"As much as the glyphy interface thing sounds gimmicky to me, This is the most interesting phone in the world for a very long time and my imperession for it exceeds the iPhone X!"
I'm just here with my oneplus 7pro waiting for companies to release another full-screen phone. Can't stand these punch-holes
5:22 he wants to review this so bad lol
"the back with the whole light up things is pretty cool, would be cool on pro iphones"
Review the new macbook you coward
Hitting OnePlus right in the strategy
Really though I wouldn’t mind buying that phone if it’s cheaper the any of the newer flagships the way they branded their earbuds by selling them cheaper then completion and having new design language it’s smthin that’s revolutionary
Lol referencing one plus at the end there made me sad. My OnePlus 8 pro is the last OnePlus I'll buy but I have loved it ngl
I wanna see the black color of nothing phone 1.
As someone who drops their phone ALL the time....
Nothing = iPhone
Sounds like OnePlus
Finding Phone Case for this phone is really a difficult task(exception for transparent covers). Let's see who comes first.
@SAIYAN PLAYS hmm but most probably transparent hi hoga let's see
Nothing hi layega acchey back covers ...bola bhi hai
6:31 OnePlus
U maku turu love ❤❤
✌️
"Had the One Plus One and the One Plus 3T, great amazing phones. Shame the brand became so generic. Hopefully Nothing rekindles that flame."
I’m here a little early tho
"I never keep my phone screen down, all this this is completely useless to me. A fad"
Definitely has my attention and I'm watching the launch next month to see Carl Pei vision come to life👍
"so oneplus ends up with nothing,
and nothing starts as oneplus !!!"
90% of buyers will actually slap a case on it .soooooo.........
"If i dowload r2d2 or other droids sound and use it for phone call, it is actually perfect for star wars fans"
"iPhone user here.
Damn this is cool."
i am sold
That's how oneplus was born. Sounds familiar 🤪
I want it.  I hope they keep the launcher very much Pixel like.
not RGB 😕
Onepluss lol
It’ll be so disappointing if Nothing ends up being another OnePlus. 🤔
"Gonna wait 7-8 years, and see people come into this chat being sad on the fact that nothing has abandoned their interests…"
"This isn't just different. This is FUN! 
People complained about phones being boring so I think this is another way to go. It's just intuitive in the software to hardware side and I hope Nothing does a better job at letting people know this phone exist and not an afterthought so they can make better products in the future. I think they should go forward with this idea and the next step should be RGB."
Looks like iPhone made by that russian company Caviar
The phone look good I have to wait till the launch to see anything better than iPhone and Samsung I'm hyped for it tho.
Really hope we don't see this go the way of the Essential PH-1. Loved the design of that and really thought Essential was going somewhere but then... Now you only see the Essential PH-1 on commercials sometimes when they need an unbranded phone as a prop 😂
"'Nothing phone has this much discription about the back'. 
You got that ??"
"I'm a child at heart, so the crazy lights synced to ring tone already has me wanting it."
Those ringtones sound *annoying* AF
“I have been using nothing for the past two weeks now”
6:28 (coughing) OnePlus
This is a pretty nothing phone if ask me……………….
It looks like a phone from Watch Dogs
should have gone with a greyish coloured insides of the phone would have made the white LEDs and phone look classy and stylish and  definitely more different looking
and then you put a phone cover and forget about it
Thanks
"hahaha, the last bit of reference was neat!"
That’s not nothing!
Getting oneplus vibes
Killer looks
"For me the Nothing Phone 1 based on looks is what Samsung should be, a phone without a curved display cos to me the curved display  just flat cos the whole ""bleeds to the side"" is very unnecessary and gimmicky"
I'll be disappointed if it's Snapdragon 7 gen 1. Even the Snapdragon 870 is still a better soc.
"Boxy design, selfie camera on LEFT side, barely noticeable bezels.... The design is DOPE !!"
This looks pretty awesome. Hopefully they also come out with a black version to match their headphones.
That last statement hurts my soul as a OnePlus fan
"It has an appeal for sure, reminds me of the one plus 3t in terms of quality but tbh I am done with android. Got burnt hard by the op8pro. Lifelong android user finally gonna switch to apple."
"If Nothing is reading this, now that they're starting is their chance to take the path of the Framework, Steam Deck, etc. and collab with ifixit or just by themselves provide parts and, maybe even schematics. That would be a major selling point for me and a lot more customers who would love to see more repairable phones becoming mainstream."
Only if he could reveal the price 😂
I want Nothing Phone as soon as I can get my hands on it lol
It just looks so incomplete and look just like an iPhone except for that hole punch on the side
more like Nothing new
It is soooooo F.U.C.K.I.N.G. SEXYYY
6:32 🤫 OnePlus
"Holy shit, exclusive look of nothing phone 1 from mkbhd!"
"Given the issues I'm having with the Pixel 6 Pro, I might get the Nothing phone. Biggest factors for me are Camera Quality, Battery Life, and Storage"
"If I were to switch back to android, the Nothing phone is the only one I would buy. Otherwise, I am fine with team iPhone."
roasted oneplus like a pro 🤣
Always ready to keep us updated 👏👏👏
this is so futuristic
"Type of phone
Stormtrooper would use 😀😀"
damn i want one
Looks cool 😎
Those days when playing with ringtones was a time killer. So much fun.
Case manufactures crying right now
The LEDS are pretty cool
"cute gimmick, very cyberpunk"
The fake iPhone 📱
"I was ready to hate this thing with passion but after this video, ain't gonna lie, I'm quite intrigued."
"""but that feels like it abandoned your original fan base, sounds familiar?"" Exactly what I had on my mind too 😂"
"@ 6:30 we know u r taking about one+,  And we get Get It."
alternate universe title: *this Nothing phone looks NOTHING*
I want it
Gimmicky
Its cool but I keep my phone back down so it's just a waste for me.
The phone is too🔥🔥🥵
I hope they don't get sued for nothing ;)
"I feel so mixed on Nothing, the Ear 1's were pretty good and the transparent phone looks great but their hype marketing puts me off a little"
@GHØST Even for the price they weren't.
"Yes exactly, launch the phone, release the specs. People will get to know and if it's worthy they buy it. They are giving all these hype as if the world is gonna see a smartphone for the first time"
ok
The real question: Can it run Terrraria Mobile welll?
A rarity to see a company desoftwarising features. Good.
Those LEDs are really amazing 🤩😍🔥
Can only show the back of the phone.... Proceeds to show the front along with the apps... lol.
All depends on what software it’s running  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"I like this phone the more I'm hearing about it, Nothing has some pretty cool ideas"
TAKE MY DINERO
That is an iPhone lol
This phone has done NOTHING new. 🙂🙂
え？え？え？
you said in the beginning that you're only allowed to show us the back...then at 2:23 we see the front too?
Looks nothing 😂🤣
Are the lights RGB or just White cuz it would be much cooler if they were
Limited Edition 100pcs
I thought i wouldn't like this design but hey i kinda like it 🙆🏻‍♂️
If i was hyped for the LEDs then nah man i don't want it.
Embargo is shit
"HOLY SHIT.  LOVE THE DESIGN. 

Make it pure stock android. Instant buy"
The shade on one plus in the end was real xD
"so much effort on the back of the phone which nobody care to use and most people put cases on their phones, I'll be flop idea by the nothing"
nice👍
"> Looks different
Is this from talking points provided by OPPO?

Literally looks like iPhone 12"
aahhh !! star tropper phone
"Very clean phone, love it"
"Sound familiar? Oh yeah, just like Oneplus."
What a stupid idea. Put your phone screen down and just wiggle it to have it light up. You have nice lights and even nicer scratches on the screen.
I really don't trust in this new brand. The presentation looks like a classic scam
It's dope  Marques
Gives the star wars imperial troop vibes
"I actually don't mind the design similarities with iPhone 12...
This looks dope 🔥🔥"
Nice little dig at one plus in the end.
if society is ready to accept 4k 30 I think 7 gen only support up to 4k 30
What are you talking about?
Yes the mass phone company is gonna copy this.
The design is absolutely spectacular 👌
Ending note is OnePlus 😄
Design looks cool
it looks really cool !!!
"The ending words, ahemmm one plus"
Does that light remind anyone of the Apple logo?
That is the coolest feature that I've seen on a cellphone in a long time... But... How is the software?
Nothing I've seen before.
Not knocking the great ambitions of other companies but it’s really hard to take the market from Apple. There’s just something different about Apple’s products.
Wtf is up with that front facing camera placement gdamn that shit is ugly.
Why do you waste my time?
You waste your own time
I'll wait for the black version of this!
Good morning and peace ✌🏾
You just showed the front of the phone. Isn't that not allowed by Nothing's of now? We ll if it's side hole punch display like older op phones then it's great.
చాలా  రోజులకు.. మొబైల్  బాగుంది☺🥰..
I found 'Nothing' on this video.
When everyone busy making screen great... nothing tasked to take back 😂
The design is very...human
I feel like Marques is rrrrrreaching trying to make this sound interesting 😅
The symmetrical bezels on the front look great as well
Lol the OnePlus dig at the end
Its so freaking cyberpunk. I love it
Looks like an iPhone 12 with a transparent back.
"5:38...
If you mugged me and took my Naruto phone...you better take off with a Naruto-run.





Wow that was bad."
I thought it build like a modular phone. That i will definitely buy.
If they made this phone with a Tron theme would be so magnificent
Definitely a interesting phone. I am just worried about the repair cost of that panel.
yikes i don't wanna know
A transparent case with slots properly arranged to view the LEDs would be sick....
Better not drop it
Very good point
It's also beautiful from the front
So what you're saying is Nothing phone 2 to 7 is a safe buy.
"I love it, looks great and I really like the company and what they're doing. got the ear one myself actually. but this won't make me switch from iPhone. 
maybe with a very good OS, but I doubt it."
Maan that is dope🥵💥
Brilliant video keep it up !
Thanks for showing us the front
It looks like a blalant copy of an iPhone.
"Sounds familiar?

Yes...OnePlus"
Back looks dope
The front looks sick🔥 Nice symmetrical bezels like an S22.
"@Jack so there is nothing a new company can do now right!? all these big companies spent so much money in researching on their devices Design and it shows their designs work. 
But a smaller company tries to do with the SIMILAR design as they don’t have money to research and create a totally new design for it,but doing that people will call em copycats. And why is this thing only in smartphone industry what about other products why not do the same with all of the products we buy, almost all of the companies copy design but it’s the smartphone industry that get most of the heat."
@Brujy lol angry samsung fanboy
Agreed. The trend of curved displays has passed. This sort of design looks just as good and is way more practical like on the S22 and Pixel 5.
S22 front and iPhone 12 back 😵‍💫
"50k views in 4 minutes. Carl Pei left oneplus, but he still knows how to hype up people 😅"
That photo is very cool
Put a case on it and you lose 95% on the selling point
That last comment😗👌🏽
"I think that the first couple of phones will be rad. The subsequent ones, we have to wait and watch if it goes the OnePlus way or Nothing really sticks to it’s core fan base."
Oneplus story 😅 great vid as always 👏
Geez the amount of user customization on that LED backlight is INSANE
I think the back covers will have precision cut shapes for the lights.
"go, girl! give us nothing."
This thing reminds me of the iPhone 12
"Based on the look only, I would buy it over an iphone."
"If we only counted the look of it, the general design, then yes it is appealing to some extent.
But part of me is always skeptical when we are shown these products without knowing their performance and general details, and most of all, the price and availability.
Guess we'll have to wait and find out cause I'm sure as hell not going to pre-order anything without a full view of the product."
cyberpunk 2077 theme wold be nice with that back glass. bright yellow with cyan blue light.
THE VIDEO IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
"That ""sound familiar?"" At the end. OnePlus, someone hasn't mentioned you."
That blinking indicator for video recording is a bummer. Can't secretly record someone anymore.
It looks sick 🔥
Great to see this lvl of competition.
"So basically you have to put your phone facing down all the time to see these annoying light bars instead of facing up and simply see the caller id, charging %... etc."
I will buy one
Wow ❤️
"6:31
MKBHD: ""sound familiar..?""
me: ONEPLUS 😶"
Give it to me already I got my 13ProMax to give
"I'm a fan of the phone. Usually with the first device a company makes, you are paying for the privilege to be a beta user.  

I'll hang back and see what becomes of this one."
I'm buying this!
Let's see how far Nothing goes with its core values.
The oneplus taunt had meee!!!!🤣
Back light is really cool
"Sighhhh, no software"
The subtle taunting to OnePlus at the end was pretty sweet...
Wiggling the phone to see battery status sounds more like scratching the screen
oneplus lol
That ending sequence 🤧💯
A Matte Black Version would be SICCCCK!!!
"@Danny Martial I loved Black variants even before Marques started mentioning them. 

Now I can't even have my own choice without getting corrected lmao"
No it wouldn't. Marques brainwashed yall into thinking matte black is actually good looking on everything.
Nothing is interesting..... May be young people may prefer this
I think this is extremely cool. Having the flexibility to put all these different features on the back of the phone without making it clunky or prone to getting dirty is a great idea. The possibilities are almost endless for what you could put back there and I'm very interested to see what they do in future.
"Its useless, its just a gimmick
why would you even put your phone with screen facing down? Always on display exists, it can do many more things, you dont need to look at LEDs to know who s calling you with muted phone... you can just look at the frikin display, cuz the name is written here pretty big..."
"Really, 6 minutes video on the back of a phone? Could have been a Short."
"It’s a cool concept, but I don’t see this doing so well in all honesty"
iphone 12 with android OS and punch hole= 1+  sorry Nothing...don't mind
Am i the only guy that thinks of the Apple logo looking at the middle light strip
If they want to really go full out with the lights I think rgb would be nice to be able fo choose what color we want each light to flash
"this is a new gen of phone design, lets see what the software brings"
The design is amazing 🔥 👍🏽
Anyone else notice the LTT mousepad?
"lol shots fired at the end!
I love the back, wish this it could do different colours so I could have app notifications personalized, like Twitter blue, WhatsApp green, Instagram purple etc"
@NeonD00m OnePlus
@Hisham Fazeel that would be sick not gonna lie
Just imagine getting all notification together and it look like pride flag in public.
"@NeonD00m Obv, OnePlus"
@NeonD00m OnePlus
"Hey Marques, Like this comment ❤️"
Case manufacturers will have a hard time.
finally.... a phone built in with S.T.A.L.K.E.R notification tones
Those leds are next level
"Lol, this ain't the future of smartphones but it is what it is. 😅"
Not a fan of the lights pretty annoying
If they want to really go full out with the lights I think rgb would be nice to be able fo choose what color we want each light to flash
Software update is the one that's going to stop me for now
"love it.    will buy it.   but.. I do need a transparent cover which is as tough and effective as Spigen or Ringke  when it comes to saving my phone.. 
3 - 4 times every day x ( 365 x3)"
Should’ve called it the “Gimmick Phone”
There was a OnePlus roast in this video 😂😂
👀 MKBHD @ the back…saw what you did there 😁
"The way they were giving speech about their phone, I genuinely thought they're gonna ship their phone with a custom non android operating system or at least something like Ubuntu touch or Mobian"
"3:03 video/sound editing mistake, it is interesting because, you know this is your video hahah"
This is what iphone would have looked like without the notch
It's more like TicToker's phone 😂😂  let's see what the battery capacity they will come with because these lights will take lot of juice. Overall promising
I like the body
The next OnePlus 1?
"Yup, it’s absolutely worked on me. Give it to me now please."
"The lights are cool, but an Android with that iPhone slab aesthetic is actually dope. If I were to switch back to Android, I’d cop"
One plus is back
"DRL for phone
Very dope 💯💯"
Sounds VERY familiar
I feel bad that I was so prejudiced when they said a 7 Gen Snapdragon Processor. But this is actually changing my mind a lil bit. Not gonna lie.
"1:12 : I am allowed to show the back of the phone
3:37 :"
I love the OnePlus shade at the end there haha
6:32 One Plus
This is cool af
The light indicator ring tone is a great idea for some one with hearing loss like me! I wish more companies would do that!
Hi jasmine
"Just add ur own lmao, not that hard"
❗Believe in Jesus – the Son of God.
"@Skeptic Sam 😂. still i guess for text alerts. but also, many phones have had light flash indicators when a text/call is coming through so not sure why this phone is getting so much praise when other phones have done it before. Even on iphone you can do flashes for texts im pretty sure."
"@literallyjustayoutubecommenter I had it on my S8, awesome feature. I could choose the color of the led depending on the notification."
నమస్తే  అన్నా🥰🥰🥰🥰.. బాగున్నావా..??
The middle part of the light bar literally looks like an abstract apple logo lol
6:33 you are talking about one plus
This is nothing from impressive
There's NOTHING like back cover.
"To be honest, I was expecting nothing XD"
Will there be a black version?
It's gonna be soo cool when someone calls 📞
will nothing be the go to for android users instead of OnePlus?
Sound familia OnePlus 🤫
So the back is the new front?
Damn this looks sick
Copy of i phone 😐
Apple has nothing to worry about
"imagine recommending this phone to someone, ""oh yeah i like nothing! nothing is good"""
Love from Bangladesh
A case would ruin the whole aesthetics
Cool
Big hinted on what oneplus has done with their mobiles .. from budget to flagship price and now partnership with oppo😰🤮🤮
"It looks ""NOTHING"" like other phones. 😂🤣"
The next OnePlus may I say?
That conclusion literally had me 😂
Damn i wasnt liking the design at first but it’s growing on me man 😍
"Here for that iconic MKBHD "" Peace ✌️"""
A new looking phone looks 👍
I liked how you took a dig at One Plus. Subtle yet so loud. 😂
Looks like nothing 🫣
I hope this doesn't release with a weekly release schedule just like their earphones . It kind of kills the buzz and feels company is over hyping mediocre product
"The nothing phone is probably going to be a solid phone, but it still carries the problems that the nothing ear (1) that Arun (@mrwhosetheboss) highlighted in his review. It won’t sell, despite being a good phone because they’re trying to be different and unique. Oh and the reason we don’t have a video from him is because the dual embargo rules are too strict for him. Watch his manipulate the media to understand. Great video!"
You know you’ve made it when nothing shows up in the mail
Reminds me of those light up Ninja turtle and power ranger shoes we used to have when we were young 😂 the good old days 🤣😂
meh
The LED feature is useless for most ppl since they keep their phones with the screen facing upwards.
"Okay, I gotta admit, this speaks to me. It seems freaking cool!"
Nothing in this video. I mean it
"Interesting design on the nothing phone, pushing the boundaries of phones while still staying comfortably in the expectations of users."
For those who didn't catch on he's talking about OnePlus
"6:22 ""OnePlus"""
This phone is designed for the folks that put their phone on it's front side
10/10 on the One+ dig
It looks nice
That jab at Oneplus 😂
The sides of it looks iphonish
Are you sure thats a ringtone? Because it sounded like top gun incoming missile alert to me.
it doesnt look THAT different
I saw the notification and immediately clicked it. Yay
The OnePlus shade at the end LOLOLOL
Hope they make a nothing laptop to join their ecosystem
i think it just feels like an iphone running android
The big question is. Are they going to settle?? Lol
it would be nice if there's notification light on front of the phone. the light on the back of the phone is pretty useless for me since i never put my phone face down.
Add some RGB in there nutttt
Lights are Dope 😍👌
"These back lights are basically the Z Flip 3's cover screen, but worse in every imaginable way."
Now that's a phone that should not be put in a case.
Oneplus teasing never settles....
shots fired at OnePlus!
"Wow, Nothing have done good on this phone.. Dope!!"
Nice 👌🏾
Awesome job marquess
The ringtones are literally so cool zomg
It's definitely unique..
Now jerry-rig everything with the teardown skin
"Feature or gimmick, that is the question.
Besides of course full specs and review."
6:32 OnePlus
Was looking forward to the UI and software .but the design is beautiful 😍😍😍
One plus slander at the end👀
A nice design. The first image that comes to mind is an iPhone 11 for me. It looks like something that Iron Man might use. The back looks like unfoldable gadgets.
6:31 yep
Looks 90% like an iPhone.
"Wow, i really like the design. This phone looks dope. I can't wait... :P"
This actually looks pretty good and I love the LEDs on the back
"but like.... you can  just flip the phone and keep it the normal way, i can't be the only onw who thoought of this"
​@Rudra Newaz but you can turn off in settings
@Rudra Newaz can you turn that off in the settings?
i dont like the recording light though
Sounds oneplussy 🤫
"Yo, that phone looks dope."
"If it has a good camera and great battery life, I might be sold."
The phone looks so UNIQUE. I hope that NOTHING makes it big.
The design is unique and apart from other Android mobiles in the market. Surely gone try this one out
6:32 TWO MINUS
definately for a nerds like me.
I use a 13pro but I’m gonna get that one and see how it is
Love the wallstreet Macintosh in the back
that's really cool 😍
"I think hes talking about one plus, not sure though..... >.<"
"those ringtones sound like complete garbage lmao

the lights themselves are cool though"
"Awesome Video, I love watching tech videos like this!!!"
"Oh shit, i did not expect those LEDs to cover so much of the back of the phone 🤣"
"Price point , features , and how well it operates is going to be EVERYTHING!!! .. interested though"
@lilmoris1 I'd rather have a phone that has more than 50% battery capacity after a few years lmao
@lilmoris1 only on the s21 and s22 series unlike apple giving 6 years od os updates since iphone 6s
"@L. G. Samsung offering 4 years now? Man that's is great, last time I checked you were lucky to even get support after a year. Crapdroid phones are catching up finally"
"@Ghost 4 years of Android updates, 5 years security updates"
That looks insanely good !!!
4:17 rip to headphone users
"Hello, if it's not difficult for you to share the wallpaper from your desktop, you liked it very much"
This is all one big gimmick
Back pattern looks like MagSafe charger
"it can also play as a ring light I guess for vloggers and tiktokers, etc. which is pretty cool!"
Can some company just make this a case for iPhone? (Or whatever your favour Android phone is)
WTF is this a Sick phone 😂
Ohh damn that ending statement. Hit me  in the face.
I am excited for the very early oneplus days where loyalty actually meant something so i'm eager to see what this phone can deliver.  Just have to wait and see. I hope another larger company that doesn't care about the end user isn't hidden away like before. Fool me once blah blah.
The main thing here is the pricing which will make or break the phone.
Can't believe the back of a phone can have so many features that warrant a 6 minutes video.
i’m buying this just for my techwear outfits
I thought it was the sequel of no phone
Looks dope. I always look for good different. And this is good different. Just don't be over-priced.
"@Gautam 40k+ domain is ruled by SD888 phones. Phone(1) won't survive in the Indian Market above 40k. With a SD700 series CPU, it'd be wiser to price it at 35k-38k. They're definitely gonna launch a Pro model during December."
@L. G. Lets see im expecting it to be above 40k
"@Gautam Its a small unestablished brand, they have to price it aggressively in order to sell them"
it will be overpriced my friend
OnePlus be like - dude what did we do to you?
First of first on hands
The powerbook on the back
Nothing looks different.
does anyone put their phone down with the screen facing downwards?
Man those lights make it look so futuristic. I hope we get more designs with lights on the back. One step closer to Cyberpunk!
I will put cyberpunk 2077 skin on the back if possible.
TOY!
The most interesting phone till date🤩
"looks like Nothing (no hate, just a pun)"
😮🔥🔥🔥
Cosmetic
what if the back glass break?
Love the look of it!
sounds familiar...
"This is why I respect Pei, he’s about innovation and coming out with products instead of complaining or waiting for others. Even with OnePlus they absolutely are the best Android phones I ever used and I can’t stand Android."
"Sorry but OnePlus mostly copied others. They used handed down tech from their parent brand oppo , and sold it with good branding, and most importantly a good software experience at a good price. They were good but didn't innovate anything, apart from 90hz oled"
ok coolest phone in years
Goddamn the design is good
When you have a not transparent case you can‘t see the led
i m going to buy this
Lovely mobile 💕
"I would never buy a phone that looks identical to another, famous one. If I buy a product, I also look forward to buy the creativity of the designers and the blueprint decisions by the engineers. If I wanted to buy an iPhone-looking phone, I'd buy an iPhone"
I can hear JerryRigEverything breathing over the transparent case..
Did they grab an iPhone 11 and just throw it off a cliff and call it a phone?
How about a broadly appealing blade runner edition with neon colored lights??
Nothing has cool features...
This phone looks  nothing like any other phone
Black colour will be dope
"Where is the chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin?
Man this looks amazing 🔥🔥🔥"
Crazy how many views occur after 5 seconds of posting 😳
"👍🏼 Impressive! Like SpaceX made a smartphone! Hey, Elon.... 😎✌🏼"
Finally there's a unique feature outside a phone recently its only been the same things and nothing new.
5:39 time to FLEXX babyyy 🤣🤣
Can those notifications LEDs can light up in other colors or just white ?
It ain't special.lights and  a flat  side
"I would just like to thank MKBHD for being the best tech youtuber ever .😭this guy is amazing ,I want to be like him when I grow up,that's a promise.🤞🏾"
"Those ringtones are HORRIBLE! Not the lights, the sounds are horrible"
wiggle the phone with the screen facing down 😬
Obviously similar & familiar look 🧐
"""Even more broadly appealing phone...""
""Even More...""
""EVEN MORE...""
""But then you realise you dumped your original fanbase. Sound familiar?""
No, which brand are are you talking about Marques?
(Commenting from my OnePlus Device)"
those ringtones💀
freaking love it
Yiff culture
"Yep, the ringtone is feature is so cool"
OnePlus deja vu!
Nothing is a stupid name for a company.
"OMG the Phone looks exactle like an Iphone with USB-C, a not dumb notch and a cool backglas."
software?
the ultimate rave phone
The most tantalising is the phone's design.
iPhone 11
please giveaway 😭😭
"The best thing I can think of to prevent people just putting a case on it is offer up cheap bumper cases

It's almost a case + you get to see the back!"
I'd like a matte black case with cutouts for the led would look sick
"""Nothing"" 
The Postcursor to One Plus"
When you think companies can't put new stuff on phones.... boom! The nothing phone comes out with sick features.
"The LED light shenanigans is a cool party trick at best, important are specs and pricing"
"I like the light features too, but the fact that this is considered a new and unique feature says enough about how undifferentiated phones are these days."
More like gimmicky
"Apple probably gonna steal the idea and make the “new” and “innovative” iNothing which will just be an empty box.

*charger sold seperately*"
finally a desirable phone thats brand new
Where can I get this phone 🥹
The ringtones are more like static noises than ringtones lol
"Who da FAK puts a phone facing down?`o.0 
You are just asking your screen to get scratches wtf :D"
It's a great time to be alive
"unique maybe when you look closely, at a glance it's an iphone 12 with maybe a skin on the back... the shape is identical to an iphone"
"Nice design and everything but my concern is that unless nothing have access to the expertise or are collaborating with a multi million dollar camera imaging R&D department this phone will be dead on arrival if the cameras can't compete. And I find it hard to believe that they will be able to tbh. Not with the likes of samsung, apple, xiaomi, BBK etc."
"My first impressions were that it has the general shape and back look of an iPhone, but the front display and selfie camera of a oneplus or something. Interesting design, and I like how it ties into that transparent aesthetic."
@Romeo ThePLUG oo o
"does sound familiar, one plus one equals two..."
NOTHING special
Hey you're a pineapple guy! Hello
Nothing's Embargo is so stupid. You're allowed to talk about just the Back of the phone? That's so dumb
Legit love love love the look
this looks so cool though
Design ❤️
Futuristic design
Nothing is nothing looks different than iPhone 12/13. I think they had approaches to same OEMs who supply pcbs to iPhone to save time and cost by not doing RnD by themselves.
Back notification LEDs can only light up in white ? Or can use other colors like neon blue etc ?
"Mhmmmmmmmm, What design is it from again? I think 🤔 Samsung?🤣🤣"
"I like the shape, it's clean and fairly simple like an iPhone but has its own unique spin on it. Pretty interesting."
like number 194😂 really tried today. love your videos MKBHD
Nothing Gorgeous
"an android in ""that"" design... nice. And yes, it sounds familiar (゜-゜)"
I don’t care about this phone
r.i.p dbrand
It needs a headphone jack and sd card slot. I would have bought it instantly.
"Nothing allowed mkbhd to show only the back of the phone.
mkbhd : 0:13 with screen on"
The price of this will be soooo important. I do like the design of it. The notification lights are nice.
"@Clips so what thought, i think it's a bit better"
@Sagar Patel its not gonna have an 8 Gen 1 tho most probably the new 7 Gen 1 which is great too minus the thermal issues plaguing the 8 Gen 1.
"@Clips has a ""transparent"" back, a punch-hole for the front-facing camera. ""LoOKs liKe an iPHone"". It's a phone. 🤡"
@Andre_Victor Gonçalves 🤞😑🤞
There many information already in the internet. It's going to be $450. Running a mid-range chipset. Probably the 7 gen 1.
Aren’t you NOT allowed to show the front of the phone??
How come he uploaded a video before the launch?
"Oh no, I was hoping less people would know about it before launch so there's a better chance of ordering one lol now I'll probably have to wait till next year before I can get one in stock :P"
Aka the knock off iphone/Samsung phone
"What did you copy from Apple?
Nothing!"
"LIked the video only for MKBHD.
But honestly, this looks a waste phone to me as its name ""Nothing phone"" 🤣🤣. These LED notifications is like a police lights alerting. ha ha .. Completely unecessary. And Will consume the battery soon as well"
If they price this to compete with the midrange of Samsung I’m buying it.
this is some cyberpunk shit 🔥🔥
"Nothing.
Lol"
What's the Specifications of the Phone
Those were the worst ringtones I've ever heard. Same level as a dog barking on the iPhone. But the lights are dope.
Nothing iPhone 12
"Holy shit, those ringtones gave me anxiety"
Just a another asthetic complement. what the real world production benefit. What this feature can give real world value.. Yeah the Engg did pretty good job puting lighting.. but anything valuable..
what a dope kind of phone 😲
Finally I see Phone front side
Love this . Great review. Nothing left out 😆
"Oh god, it's not a review. He LITERALLY said the phone didn't come out yet and this is just his impressions of the design."
This phone is unique and cool.
"I have mixed opinions on this to workout, because nothing has definitely made a unique looking smartphone but how unique it is in terms of pricing, overall specs, performance,etc is a big question! Afterall Karl sir is directly targeting Apple 🙌"
"Matter of the fact is, ""All Brands"" targets Apple. But in reality, nobody succeeds in it."
Optical it‘s an iPhone
"It has cool looking functions on the back and all, but i wouldn't place my phone face-down, screen first onto any surface, for fear of damaging the screen..."
That's why you use a screen protector. And back down will scratch the lenses.
">snapdraggon 778
Lol, just lol.
I wont switch for that."
When looking at it I had many moments where I thought it was an iPhone
"Well obviously the embargo made this video somewhat useless, but other than that, great video! Super excited to see the full review!"
"Nothing to see here, guys."
I want one
"Love the design for sure, if it comes from the guy who worked on OnePlus and their first model was crazy good... Then this could be a great buy. We'll have to see."
@Sunil Nathani yes.. I am calling you a kid.
"@Bacon Wizard the ""Nothing"" joke is so overrated to the point that it makes kids dumb"
@Bacon Wizard Agreed
its basically an iphone without a notch ...
That little dig at One+ at the end 😂
Love the leds 😍
@Luis Pellot true
I am HOPING that those LED's can change color based on what app it's receiving notifications from. Now THAT would be sick!
Wow
screen on time probably 2 hours lol
"4:03 really cool, nothing also included something you'd hear in an American school!"
LOL
So they took all the good design bits from apple but maybe a bit too much
"for a phone coming out in a few weeks, it’s highly suspicious that he can’t do a full review"
"Why suspicious? Google did that too right? And companies do this already…Get a life
Before the official launch how can he show all of it"
I think we can all agree that Carl Pei has done a phenomenal job with the marketing.
Such phone are only for watching and not buying
Damn I've never been so early
Coming July 12th. Well that's will be my 23rd birthday.... 😉
LTT desk mat
"Damn, this phone is sick"
"Bruh, it straight up looks like an iPhone 12 with a clear back"
they've done nothing
Nothing to see here
Nice
Why is the punchhole camera not in the center. I hate that on phones
I first thought it's an iphone 11.
I clicked the video thinking it was the second essential phone
The ringtones are kinda creepy
Great design
@Authentic it’s not a bot. It’s a German YouTuber.
Too much Gras
Du hier?
2 uninspiring bot comments
@Mishan 🅥 no
Nice🔥
I’m allowed to show you the back continues to show us the front lol
These are some crazy good looks
"Carl Pei just knows how to copy Apple. He  is a Chinese and they know how to copy. He did with OnePlus so many times. (See OP 5 and iP 7 design, alert slider etc.), now he's doing the same with Nothing. Nothing is trying to compete Apple without making their own processor, OS and Appstore. Lol. They're calling NothingOS as a OS, which is just a UI (skin).
They're talking about privacy and security by being on Android, Lol. They don't even have hardware level security (Eg. Knox). Just creating fake hype by using Apple's name so many times in the launch event."
the better looking iphone

"Wow , i am excited for that phone . Its kind of between apple and Samsung. 🤞"
This is a really cool looking phone!
iPhone 11 with broken glass
Early!
I like nothing in this phone...
"someone: what phone do you use?
me: nothing..

This should be fun"
nothing
same as apple 😍
Thank God for uniformed screen bezel!
Hello Marques  😉
"Mkbhd- The Nothing phone looks, nothing, as a part of the savs environment project, we are removing the phone from the box!"
1:43 thang
Dope Light. Nothing has SOMETHING in store.
3 mins very early this time❤
It's look like iphone 12😅
Okay but how does this affect Viksstar123 and his legacy?
This is a hyped phone and because it's different it may perform well in the market
@getpid is genius 🤩
It looks like modified version of iPhone 🤣🤣🤣
😮
I'm a huge fan of the look!
D.o.n.t r.e.a.d m.y n.a m.e..
Looks like an iPhone 12 with a transparent back 🤣👍
“i can only show you the back of the phone” proceeds to show the front
i can only show u the back.Then proceeds to show the front.🤣
Love from 🇮🇳
very excited about this brand
Allowed to show only the back of the phone... Shows the front as well
"Good touch having Live Sub count on that sub reminder thingy, not just slapping on the same one from 3 years ago, thats attention to detail in my eyes. just a small very not needed touch. but still."
"The day has finally come when we watch Marques review ""nothing"" 👀"
"I don’t agree with what Nothing is saying about apple’s ecosystem, Samsung also has an ecosystem and so does Google, I see all and use them. And also, the bottom of the nothing phone looks like iPhone 12/13"
Something new in mobile world.
Wow looks like iphone 12)
"Interesting design on the nothing phone, pushing the boundaries of phones while still staying comfortably in the expectations of users."
@Chazzy is it though
@FOneCringe He will remove the spam accounts soon
@NonsensicalVids you ain’t gonna see any other companies with a phone like this. To todays standards it’s as wild as it gets while still remaining neat and polished.
@marques brownlee bruh you don’t even have anywhere to message you 💀💀💀
@marques brownlee aight bet
JerryRigeEerything : You took everything from me *NOTHING CEO*
Great video
I can't think of a reason why someone would put their phone lying screen down. It just causes scratches on the display from the surface so the whole notification led on the back is kind of moot
Maybe rich people with a lot of smooth surfaces in their home😔
"I mostly lay down my phone on a table, or something flat like that. Don't think I ever got a scratch from that"
Most people have a screen protector :)
I do because my case goes farther out than my phone and I’ve got a screen protector so my phone is safer screen down
I do it and honestly I feel safer doing this than the screen up 😅
We are here for you brother. Thank you for always sharing with us these informative videos about tech. Keep them coming.

Too many puns coming with this startup"
He says ‘what nothing has done’
@Don't Read My Profile Photo ok
YOU ALSO SHOW THE FRONT?? IM CONFUSED
It looks like an iphone
Interesting 😁
Can’t help to feel like the wrong word in emphasized in the title 😅
Looks like Apple 12
"The bezel on the front reminds me of apple borders, expected it would look like samsung s22 and s22 plus front..."
"Meh. Phones have reached a peak already and the only way to differentiate yourself in a saturated market is with gimmicks. 

Happy with my midrange phone that hits every mark for me. Can't be the only one."
We wanna the specs! 😅
"damn this looks dope, just hope this does not flop like Sony's enthusiast phones. Also hopefully they aren't overpriced."
I'm guessing Pei knows what he needs to do when pricing this phone...
Like always with nothing all the money will go to the design team and the product will be not very very interesting
Notification light is back. So awesome !!!!
What a scam the front camera on the left
1minute - 1k likes......daaaammn 🔥🔥🔥

Call me crazy but they obviously copied the aluminum flat edges of the iPhone and the overall body design?
Easter Egg - MKBHD logo is in NOTHING font....!!💥
It looks like a transparent skin to an iPhone
"Third

Found first and second place is already taken"
Looks like they did it again with the restrictions like talking abt the transparent back instead of the specs etc
I love this design
"I wonder if there’s some cool features when you pair the ear 1 buds and the phone, like when You pair AirPods to an iPhone?"
💕💕Love it. Finally something different from the usual stuff.

"it looks sick, the chasis of the phone looks like a case, and the fact that they dont care about the normality, and just went with wtv they designed, bold move for a startup."
Nothing is better than iPhones.
No one will buy this.
"whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat

If you ever get robbed you can literally say you have nothing on your pocket. 🧠

Really tought its an iPhone from the side
Looks like a transparent Iphone at first glance
Ok
yeboie
"Really??.
That's dope"
Nothing like anything
It most definitely looks familiar 👀
"@DC sorry i was replying to your first comment, which mention someone who agree with the another person about the phone is just an iphone clone"
"@Hida I didn't say it was bad or that it was a copy, I said it looked similar because of the bezels. I'm all in for smartphones copying features if it means more competition and a better product for the consumers."
"@DC yeah that's the point, its a goal of all smartphone company should reach, just like speaker for example, back then most smartphone only have mono speaker, now having stereo speakers is the standard, is it bad because its just a copy feature? no its not 
smartphone displays are also in that stage right now, only apple and samsung have symmetrical bezels, in the future it should be standard, so its good to see more companies start doing the same"
@Hida well yes but most phones don't have symmetrical bezels
"@DC dude the symmetrical bezel literally what a flagship modern smartphone should have, if just having that mean copying then having speaker on top and bottom also a copy, having similar size and weight also a copy, what  else having camera in front and back?"
Love these
